Since this is only my second earnings call, I think I'm still enough of a newcomer to share some of my observations of the company before we get to the heart of our discussion this morning.
In our last earnings call, I made several points about what we had done to start to transform PG&E. And we had hired a lot of top-tier talent to supplement the strong core of PG&E veterans that we have. We made organizational changes that established clear lines of accountability for our gas and electric businesses. We put a strong emphasis on operational excellence and we made a commitment of resources to turn the business around, and ultimately, to make our operations the safest in the country. So with the benefits of a few of a few moments on the job, let me add a couple of more observations.
Our team understands that public safety is our highest priority and we're now rolling out technologies to get us there. We understand that the focus is on back-to-basics, that we have to be -- have to focus on benchmarking and to put in place a continuous improvement program. Most of all, the team understands that we have to deliver. We know the areas we need to improve on and we've got a solid foundation from which we can execute. And that's significant because it means that in contrast to where we were just 7 or 8 months ago, we now have a very real opportunity in 2012, first, to truly tackle and resolve our gas issues; second, focus on repositioning PG&E for long-term success; and third, rebuild relationships with key stakeholders. And that is exactly what our executive team is focused on.
So let me start with the first point, the gas issues. The new gas organization we put in place last year has delivered on our key commitments and made impressive progress in 2011. And Chris and Nick will give you the update on the details in just a couple of minutes. What you'll hear is that we've still got an extremely demanding amount of work ahead in 2012. Much of this falls under our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. It's work that this critical to meeting the new pipeline safety standards being adopted by the CPUC and in Congress. It's also essential to resolving the San Bruno issues and rebuilding public trust and confidence in the company. At the same time, it's important to distinguish between the work that was necessary to close the gaps in our past performance and work that's newly required going forward.
Our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan is largely new work for a new world where the CPUC is setting future safety standards at a higher level than ever before. With minor exceptions, it's not all work to meet yesterday's standards as some have claimed. To avoid confusion, we've already asked the CPUC to separate the review of the appropriateness of the plan over the issue of who should pay for the plan.
You've seen our press release this morning that although we're maintaining our guidance from earnings from operations, we've updated our outlook for 2012 pipeline costs. The update reflects our current understanding of our cost based on the experience that we gained in the field last year. We've also made some conservative assumptions about the timing of the CPUC's ruling on our safety plan. Let me underscore that we're going to continue to work hard to accelerate a decision on a safety plan and to resolve all of the gas-related proceedings at the commission.
Reaching as much clarity and closure as we can on the regulatory and legal fronts in doing so as soon as we can is a top priority for our team and we know it's a top priority for our investors us well. Shareholders have stepped up and are bearing substantial cost to address past issues and it's important that regulators recognize this when it comes time to recognize cost work going forward and we will urge them to take that into account.
Let me turn briefly to positioning the company for long-term success. Success, for us, is delivering overall results for customers that are in the first quartile. The key is honestly assessing our business, benchmarking our performance and then acting to close any gaps that we find. We're going to ingrain this into our operations and our culture. Focusing on operational excellence is the single best way to rebuild our relationships with customers, regulators, and we believe, investors. As you've heard me say before we start my past experience in similar situations, the only to convince customers that you're a different company is to prove it by listening to them and then delivering great service. And our entire executive team understands this. None of us expects to get there overnight but we've set a high bar and we will make significant progress in 2012.
So with that, I'll turn to Chris and then Nick to take you through our operational progress in 2011 and our plans for the coming year. Chris?"

Today, I'm going to summarize the significant work that we completed in 2011 to help resolve the gas pipeline issues and I'll touch on the work that we're doing to position the broader company for success. I'll also discuss some of the regulatory developments over the last couple of months.
Let me start with the gas work in 2011. We accomplished a remarkable amount of work this past year to improve the safety of our gas pipeline system. To give you just a couple of examples, by the end of January, we have validated the maximum allowable operating pressures, or what we refer to as MAOP, for all of the more than 2,000 miles of transmission pipelines in high consequence areas. And along the way, we met every one of our commitments with our regulators. In the process, we conducted a record validation effort more detailed and comprehensive than anything done before anywhere. Come work was completed in an unprecedented amount of pressure testing, validating the safety of over 160 miles of gas transmission pipe. This was technically difficult and highly complex work on in-service pipes in densely populated areas. And as Nick will discuss later, we'll be doing a similar amount of work this year to further validate and enhance the safety of our system.
Now gas operations in place where nothing was working hard to improve the safety and reliability of our operations last year. We made a number of safety enhancement stop electric system, focusing on reducing the risk from outages and focusing a number of an impact from equipment failures. At the same time, we had another strong year in electric reliability where we had our second consecutive year with the new low of outage frequency.
In the area of renewables, 19.3% of the electric power we delivered in 2011 came from renewable resources, putting us on track to meet the interim benchmarks as we move towards California's 33% goal by 2020. This in addition to the 40% of clean energy sources from our vast hydroelectric system and our nuclear facility.
Speaking of which, we had another very successful year of nuclear operations at Diablo Canyon, including an industry-leading safety performance during our refueling outage. Finally, we installed 1.5 million SmartMeters in 2011, bringing our total to 8.9 million out of the planned 9.7 million. And we're utilizing those meters and the capabilities to reduce our outage times.
As we look into 2012, we will continue to drive our safety performance improvement in all areas of the company. And Nick is going to discuss the gas plant in just a few minutes. But in the electric operations, we'll be doing more reinforcement and inspection work on poles and increasing our overhead and underground line maintenance work in an effort to identify and resolve potential issues before they disrupt our customers or cause unsafe situations.  Throughout the business, we'll continue to work on improving our processes and using technology to achieve our safety and reliability objectives.
Finally, I'd like to discuss regulatory developments which affect our operational outlook and plans. As you know, the CPUC initiated 2 new investigations since our last earnings call. So we're now working through 3 gas-related investigations as well as the rulemaking proceeding. You may recall that the original investigation was initiated in early 2011, focused mainly on our records management. Then in November, the CPUC initiated the class location investigation to review whether we operated our pipeline system at pressures consistent with current class designations. We've provided our responses in that proceeding, identifying our errors and properly designating class location and adjusted operating pressures accordingly.
The most recent investigation, the gas pipeline investigation, covers all areas of our pipeline operations. It takes into account a report by the safety division on the company's gas pipeline operations and practices which the report attempts to broadly connect with the San Bruno pipeline rupture. This is the most comprehensive review of operations by the CPUC leading to a penalty proceeding.
In addition to these investigations, the CPUC in December gave the staff new citation authority in their oversight of gas companies. Through that new authority, the safety division staff issued a citation for about $17 million for our self report of some maps missing from our distribution leak survey reschedule which our team identified and then promptly connected. We believe this one is excessive under the circumstances and we have appealed the citation. However, there are no precedents to rely on here so we can't predict the final outcome.
Given all of these recent developments and considering the CPUC's wide discretion in these matters, the magnitude of the San Bruno event and developments such as the citation issued by the safety division, we've taken a charge for $200 million. This is an estimate and it does require a lot of judgment but we believe this represents the low end of the range of expected fines and penalties associated with the various gas matters.
Meanwhile, in the rulemaking proceeding, there's been no action or progress on our request for a memo account and the procedural schedule beyond the March hearings remains unclear. We previously assumed that we'd be able to recover the cost for work we do related to the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan in 2012 to comply with the new standards. But that is now much less likely before the rulemaking proceeding is resolved. To be conservative for guidance purposes, we now assume resolution will not occur until the end of this year. This means that costs incurred during 2012 related to the safety plan and prior to a final CPUC order, will fall to the bottom line. This obviously has implications for our guidance which Kent will discuss in at few minutes. But before we go to Kent, Nick is going to provide more detail about our gas safety plans in 2012. Nick?"

As Chris told you, we completed a lot of gas work last year, but we've also been building a strong team of experts from both within the company and from industry-leading firms across the country. As we go forward, we'll be making additional progress in gas operations including improving our integrity management program, our gas distribution practices and the use of technology, all designed to enhance public safety. We know a lot more about our gas pipeline system than we did 1 year ago, and we've also uncovered new challenges even during this past quarter. Based upon all of our experiences last year, we've adjusted our operational plans and our cost expectations for this year.
In terms of the scope of work for this year, we plan on pressure testing or verifying records for 185 miles of transmission pipe, replacing about 40 miles and upgrading 78 miles to enable in-line inspections on those segments. Also, by early 2013, we will complete the MAOP validation for all remaining transmission pipelines in the system, more than 4,000 additional miles. We now expect our costs for the pipeline-related work in 2012 to be about $120 million higher than we previously estimated.
The main driver is the cost for the hydrostatic pressure testing program. As a reminder, we filed our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan last summer including estimated cost which were based upon our limited experience up to that point. We completed the majority of our 2011 pressure testing since that time which impacted our cost expectations for this year. Based upon what we experienced last year in the pressure testing program, we expect to continue to incur cost per mile much higher than what you might see from some of our industry peers, and there are a couple of reasons for this: first, industry average cost for pressure testing are generally based upon generally based upon long line pipe of uniform size with minimal population or customer impacts. We, on the other hand, conduct just on shorter segments of older pipes, often in densely populated areas. And second, we face challenges in local permitting and environmental activities like water disposal, and we expect these to continue as we focus our program on more pipelines in the San Francisco Bay Area this year.
So while additional lead time allows us to bid and contract for these projects more strategically which, will lower these costs compared to 2011, we still expect our pressure testing cost to be substantially more than the industry average. Although the pressure testing unit costs are by far the biggest driver of our higher estimates this year, we'll also need to complete work on some pipelines that we had not originally planned to address in 2012. This carryover work will also increase our pipeline expenses. The combination of all the work I've described in our ongoing performance improvement efforts should bring us greater certainty in higher performance in our gas business going forward.
Now I'll turn things over to Kent."

I have a fair amount to cover, so I'd like to provide the big picture before I go through all the detail. And I think there are 5 key takeaways: first, we took a $200 million of accrual in Q4 for potential penalties associated with all the gas matters; second, our other Q4 results were in line with guidance; third, we're maintaining our 2012 guidance for earnings from operations at $3.10 to $3.30 per share; fourth, we're modifying our 2012 guidance for pipeline-related costs; and fifth, we're increasing our estimate of 2012 equity needs. I'll explain these as I go through my remarks.
So I'm going to start with our Q4 results which are summarized on Slide 6. Here you can see that earnings from operations for Q4 were $366 million or $0.89 per share, and earnings from operations from the year totaled $3.58 per share.
GAAP earnings for the quarter were $83 million or $0.20 per share. The difference between Q4 earnings from operations and GAAP earnings is the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters, and the details of that are shown in the table at the bottom of the slide. First, if a pipeline-related costs, which totaled $180 million pretax during the quarter, and this includes the strength testing and the pipeline validation work that Chris and Nick talked about, as well as our legal and other costs that we incurred during the quarter. For the year, this totaled $483 million pretax and was in line with our guidance.
Below that, you see the $200 million accrual we took in Q4 for potential penalties stemming from the various gas matters. As you know, this was an item we have not provided guidance on. Chris described in the regulatory developments that occurred since our last call and some of the factors we considered in determining the amount of the accrual which clearly involved a lot of judgment. Obviously, we'll continue to assess the accrual in future quarters until the issues are resolved.
Next, you can see that there were no additional accruals during the quarter for third-party liabilities. Prior to Q4, we had accrued a cumulative $375 million through third-party liabilities, including a $155 million in 2011 which you see on the right. And finally, you can see that we booked traditional insurance recoveries of $39 million related to third-party claims during Q4. That brings us to $99 million of insurance recoveries since the accident, and we'll continue to wait until we resolve claims with each carrier before booking additional insurance recoveries.
Slide 7 has the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations. The $0.89 earned in the fourth quarter, which is shown on the far right, represents a $0.19 increase compared to Q4 of 2010. You see the $0.02 of that is due to higher authorized rate base investment, and then we also incurred cost for 2 items in Q4 of 2010 that we did not have in Q4 of 2011. $0.06 for a nuclear refueling outage and $0.05 related to the SmartMeter program.
Litigation and regulatory matters also was $0.04 favorable compared to Q4 2010, in part because the prior period included an initial accrual for the Rancho Cordova accident. These increases were partially offset by higher shares outstanding which had a $0.03 impact and miscellaneous items totaling about $0.04 negative, including some employee related costs such as severance and workers' comp.
That completes my summary of our 2011 results. So I'm now going to move on to our outlook for 2012. On Slide 8, you can see that our guidance for 2012 earnings from operations remains at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. As I'll cover in a moment, we do expect additional equity issuance this year which will result in some dilution. However, notwithstanding that, we're maintaining our 2012 guidance for EPS from operations at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. I'll remind you also that in last quarter's call, we provided some of the key assumptions underlying our 2012 guidance including authorized rate base, CapEx spending levels, incremental expenses we expect to incur and authorized ROE and cap structure. And that info is again included on a slide in the appendix.
Back to Slide 8, there also was no change in our 2012 guidance related to our item impacting comparability for environmental-related costs. This is in connection with chromium cleanup and mitigation at Hinkley. However, we are updating our guidance for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters. And if you turn to Slide 9, I'll walk you through the changes.
Starting on the left-hand side of the slide, you'll remember that our 2012 gas pipeline-related work includes the work we proposed in our pipeline safety enhancement plan which was originally estimated to cost about $230 million, as well as work that fell outside the PSEP, which we estimated would cost between $100 million and $200 million. The non-PSEP costs included work on post-1970 pipe, as well as litigation and other costs.
Previously, the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan work was excluded from our 2012 guidance for the item impacting comparability because we assumed approval of the PSEP is filed. So as you can see at the bottom on the left, our item impacting comparability included only the non-PSEP work, which as you know, we weren't seeking recovery of.
At the upper right side of the slide, you can see the updated cost estimate for our 2012 pipeline work which has increased by about $120 million for the reasons Nick described. Remember, the original PSEP costs estimates were down last summer prior to a lot of our experience in the field. Our estimate now reflects that experience.
In addition, our outlook for the PSEP recovery has also changed. Since our last call, we haven't seen progress in approving a memo account for cost we incur pending a final decision and the procedure totaled schedule for a final decision is still unclear behind hearings scheduled in March. We've decided to conservatively assume that the PSEP is not resolved by the commission until the end of this year. Therefore, we're now including our PSEP and non-PSEP costs in our 2012 guidance for the item impacting comparability. The updated guidance range for these costs is $450 million to $550 million.
On Slide 10, you can see a summary of our current 2012 guidance. As I mentioned before, there's no change in guidance for EPS for operations or for our environmental-related costs. The natural gas matters item is broken out in the table below into its components, including the pipeline-related costs I just described. The range for third-party liability claims remains unchanged at 0 to $225 million. This rate reflects the difference between the amount of we've accrued to date, $375 million, and the upper end of our estimate for third-party liability which is $600 million. As has been our practice, we're not providing guidance for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued or for future insurance recoveries.
I'm going to finish with an update on our equity issuance in 2011 and our plans for 2012, and that's on Slide 11. On our last call, we estimated that based on our guidance assumptions at the time, we expected to issue roughly $600 million of equity starting in the fourth quarter of 2011 through the end of 2012. And you can see that on the left.
Next to that, you can see we actually issued $276 million of equity in Q4. Of course, our guidance now assumes higher unrecovered costs for our gas pipeline-related work in 2012. And in Q4, we took the $200 million accrual for gas-related penalties. Both of these factors have contributed to an expected increase in our 2012 equity issuance of about $300 million. As a result, we expect our 2012 equity needs to be roughly in the $600 million range based on our current assumptions. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year is going to depend on the resolution of the gas matters as well as other factors.
We'd expect to issue between $150 million and $250 million through our internal programs, the 401(k) and DRIP, with the balance coming from external issuance. Our existing dribble program has about $300 million of remaining capacity and we'll consider another dribble program as well as other alternatives to address any remaining needs during the year.
That completes our prepared remarks for this morning's call. And so we'll go ahead now and open up the lines for your questions."

And binding upon the resolution of the gas matters, at some point, it will become a cash item. While it's a non-cash accrual, it's not a 100% you fund with equity because obviously you're raising cash which otherwise you don't need that this point when you issue the equity. So in some ways, you end up initially raising roughly half of what you need and displacing debt issuance that you otherwise would have needed. Ultimately, when you pay a cash amount for the item, then we would raise the remaining equity and some a little bit of debt to offset what you displaced initially and that becomes one-for-one eventually."

That's why some of the work that Nick and his team has done this past year on the Hydro testing in the MAOP we're starting to get some recognition and we really have perceptual committed to having the safest gas system.

So having built pipelines like the millennium pipeline,  pipeline, when your doing hydrostatic pipeline testing on it yet but like you got the pipeline there in the trench you know where you're going to do the hydrostatic testing in advance. It's all laid out. And it's a relatively simple process. We're doing hydrostatic testing on pipes that's been on the ground for 50, 60 years that neighborhoods have grown up around, streets have been paved over. It is a major project. The other issue that we discovered was when you put a brand-new pipe in the ground, you fill it with water, you pressure test it, the water comes out clean. When you put water in a pipe that's been around for 50 or 60 years, you've got residual hydrocarbons, you got corrosion products in there and we've had to then spend a huge amount of money trading out treating the water coming out of the buy. So Nick and his team are have been working very hard to simplify the process. But Nick, there still is a lot of talent out there."

I think it's fair to say this work that we did this past year and that we're going to do in 2012 regarding hydrostatic testing and probably the most complex hydrostatic testing program anywhere in the United States. And as Tony alluded that these are shorter segments of all the pipelines, very difficult working conditions to be able to stage the equipment at the point where you need to begin and then stage additional equipment at the end of the test and the environmental requirements here in California are appropriately the most rigorous in the country. So those standards that we are adhering to here are the highest bar, no doubt, and drive a lot of these costs. And the majority of the cost that we incurred that were unanticipated really relate to handling the water in the hydro test program where we need to, in many cases, before we begin our Hydro test, flush these lines to make sure that the water in the pipe when we do the Hydro test, the actual test itself, is up to drinking water standards. So that has required us to do a lot of water handling, a lot of water treatment, a lot of water disposal, way over and above what would be required, as Tony indicated, in a new pipeline. That said, over the course of 2011, our cost per mile was around $1.6 million a mile. Our estimate for this year is somewhere in the $1.1 million, $1.15 million per mile. So a significant reduction of what we incurred in 2011. I would also add that we're dealing with shorter segments of pipe than I think most people do. And so that adds to the cost per mile."

First of all is that for the most part, most of our gas transmission rate cases were settled. So there were settlement agreement. And when you have a settlement agreement, you don't necessarily do a line item by line item tracking of the different types of cost. And in a lot of times, you also go and address how costs are allocated between years. And so there's a lot of judgment that goes into trying to determine what were the authorized amounts of cost to be spent in any one of those given years. And so when you go back and look at the findings or the assertions, if you will, in that audit, you can see that there's a lot of effort assumptions that they're making that, quite frankly, we disagree bit. And that we will dispute as we move forward in the process. The second thing, though, that you really need to focus here on is that the majority of the costs that they're alleging that we did not spend, the $400 million out of the $500 million, relates to the programs that are, quite frankly, at-risk programs, and is generally around our gas storage and our ability to utilize those funds. Many years ago, the CPUC decided that they did not want the customers to have the risk around that, and so we were  -- the shareholders then with the ones that suffer the consequences of a marketplace that didn't have activity in it or could have the rewards of it. And in fact over the last couple of years, we've seen very little in terms of rewards and income off of those businesses. And so what they're asserting is that we should've taken at-risk revenues that were designed incent or penalize shareholders and apply them elsewhere. And then finally, when you look at the totality of our return in sent over the last 15 to 20 years, you'll see that in general, they're pretty much right around our authorized return in total for the company. And so it's not like all of that went and caused us to have a company-wide excessive earnings. We were utilizing that for other parts of the business.

What struck me most about that report were not so much in details of the audit but the line of argument that the division was presenting, which I think you could paraphrase as something along these lines: That PG&E had a legal obligation to run its gas pipeline system in a safe, reliable fashion if requested and received most recently through a settlement, the revenues that deemed necessary to do so, the events at San Bruno. And the record presented in the report indicate that the company failed in its obligation to provide safe and reliable service. Now the company is coming back and saying our large portion of our PSEP budget which relates to more onerous regulatory standards should be recoverable. And the amounts that are being requested for recovery are comparable to the rate base of the system. And the argument seems to say, ""Didn't we pay you once for the assets and the O&M necessary for safe and reliable service? And if you failed to provide it given that we've paid for it already, why should we pay for it again?"" And it seemed to me an argument that would strike a chord with intervenors. Obviously, it has with commission staff. It might strike a chord with commissioners themselves. So I wanted to ask you how have you seen that argument received at the commission? And secondly, perhaps most importantly, how do you rebut it?"

And I think what we've said measures in response there are some places where we weren't following standard practices and to the extent that that was the case, then we ought to absorb those costs. But to the extent that the standards are being changed and being increased, those new requirements ought to be recoverable from the customers through our rates. And I think you're going to see across the country as we see new national pipeline standards, I think other states will start to look at what happens here in California. You'll see the same thing that while people are following accepted practices in the past, technology has changed. The understanding of the risk have changed, and therefore, these new standards should be recoverable as part of a normal course of business."

Can you comment on expected funds to be paid out to the generator settlements and from about kind of that liability that's sitting there on your balance sheet? And then can you talk about the short-term debt balance? Because the short-term debt balance is at a level that we haven't seen in a long while, they're at about $1.6 billion. And normally, this time this year -- normally the peak in short-term debt balance is third quarter, not fourth quarter.

In terms of generator settlements, we don't see a lot of activity there this year. I think that's a little bit further out. So again, kind of same answer. That's not a big driver of our short-term cash needs. And in terms of where we ended up the year with short-term debt, we do have a fair amount of collateral posted which we do as part of our normal activities related to energy procurement as well as hedging. And when you have low gas prices as we currently have, while that reduces the cash outlay for procuring fuel and gas for customers, it does cause us to have the post collateral to security arrangements we have with counterparties.

Since this is only my second quarterly earnings call, I think I'm still enough of a newcomer to share some of my observations of the company before we get to the heart of our discussion this morning.
At our last earnings call, I made several points about what we had done to start to transform PG&E. And we had hired a lot of top-tier talent to supplement the strong core of PG&E veterans that we have. We made organizational changes that established clear lines of accountability for our gas and electric businesses. We put a strong emphasis on operational excellence, and we made a commitment of resources to turn the business around, and, ultimately, to make our operations the safest in the country. So with the benefit of a few more months on the job, let me add a couple more observations.
Our team understands that public safety is our highest priority, and we're now rolling out technologies to get us there. They understand that the focus is on back-to-basics, that we have to be -- have to focus on benchmarking and to put in place a continuous improvement program. Most of all, the team understands that we have to deliver. We know the areas we need to improve on, and we've got a solid foundation from which we can execute. And that's significant because it means that in contrast to where we were just 7 or 8 months ago, we now have a very real opportunity in 2012: first, to truly tackle and resolve our gas issues; second, focus on repositioning PG&E for long-term success; and third, rebuild relationships with key stakeholders. And that is exactly what our executive team is focused on.
So let me start with the first point, the gas issues. The new gas organization we put in place last year has delivered on our key commitments and made impressive progress in 2011. And Chris and Nick will give you the update on the details in just a couple of minutes. What you'll hear is that we still got an extremely demanding amount of work ahead in 2012. Much of this falls under our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. It's work that is critical to meeting the new pipeline safety standards being adopted by the CPUC and in Congress. It's also essential to resolving the San Bruno issues and rebuilding public trust and confidence in the company. At the same time, it's important to distinguish between the work that was necessary to close the gaps in our past performance and work that's newly required going forward.
Our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan is largely new work for a new world, where the CPUC is setting future safety standards at a higher level than ever before. With minor exceptions, it's not all work to meet yesterday's standards as some have claimed. To avoid confusion, we've already asked the CPUC to separate the review of the appropriateness of the plan over the issue of who should pay for the plan.
You've seen our press release this morning that although we're maintaining our guidance from earnings from operations, we've updated our outlook for 2012 pipeline costs. The update reflects our current understanding of our cost based on the experience that we gained in the field last year. We've also made some conservative assumptions about the timing of the CPUC's ruling on our safety plan. Let me underscore that we're going to continue to work hard to accelerate a decision on a safety plan and to resolve all of the gas-related proceedings at the commission.
Reaching as much clarity and closure as we can on the regulatory and legal fronts in doing so as soon as we can is a top priority for our team, and we know it's a top priority for our investors as well. Shareholders have stepped up and are bearing substantial cost to address past issues, and it's important that regulators recognize this when it comes time to make a decision on cost for work going forward, and we will urge them to take that into account.
Let me turn briefly to positioning the company for long-term success. Success, for us, is delivering overall results for customers that are in the first quartile. The key is honestly assessing our business, benchmarking our performance and then acting to close any gaps that we find. We're going to ingrain this into our operations and our culture. Focusing on operational excellence is the single best way to rebuild our relationships with customers, regulators and, we believe, investors. As you've heard me say before based on my past experience in similar situations, the only to convince customers that you're a different company is to prove it by listening to them and then delivering great service. And our entire executive team understands this. None of us expects to get there overnight, but we've set a high bar, and we will make significant progress in 2012.
So with that, I'll turn to Chris and then Nick to take you through our operational progress in 2011 and our plans for the coming year. Chris?"

And I'll touch on the work that we're doing to position the broader company for success. I'll also discuss some of the regulatory developments over the last couple of months.
Let me start with the gas work in 2011. We accomplished a remarkable amount of work this past year to improve the safety of our gas pipeline system. To give you just a couple of examples, by the end of January, we have validated the maximum allowable operating pressures, or what we refer to as MAOP, for all of the more than 2,000 miles of transmission pipelines in high consequence areas. And along the way, we met every one of our commitments with our regulators. In the process, we conducted a record validation effort more detailed and comprehensive than anything done before anywhere. We've completed an unprecedented amount of pressure testing, validating the safety of over 160 miles of gas transmission pipe. This was technically difficult and highly complex work on in-service pipes in densely populated areas. And as Nick will discuss later, we'll be doing a similar amount of work this year to further validate and enhance the safety of our system.
Now gas operations in place, we're not the only ones working hard to improve the safety and reliability of our operations last year. We made a number of safety enhancement to our electric system, focusing on reducing the risk from outages and reducing the number of and the impact from equipment failures. At the same time, we had another strong year in electric reliability, where we had our second consecutive year with the new low of outage frequency.
In the area of renewables, 19.3% of the electric power we delivered in 2011 came from renewable resources, putting us on track to meet the interim benchmarks as we move towards California's 33% goal by 2020. This in addition to the 40% of clean energy sources from our vast hydroelectric system and our nuclear facility.
Speaking of which, we had another very successful year of nuclear operations at Diablo Canyon, including in the industry-leading safety performance during our refueling outage. Finally, we installed 1.5 million SmartMeters in 2011, bringing our total to 8.9 million out of the planned 9.7 million. And we're utilizing those meters and the capabilities to reduce our outage times.
As we look into 2012, we will continue to drive our safety performance improvement in all areas of the company. And Nick's going to discuss the gas plant in just a few minutes. But in the electric operations, we'll be doing more reinforcement and inspection work on poles and increasing our overhead and underground line maintenance work in an effort to identify and resolve potential issues before they disrupt our customers or cause unsafe situations.  Throughout the business, we'll continue to work on improving our processes and using technology to achieve our safety and reliability objectives.
Finally, I'd like to discuss regulatory developments, which affect our operational outlook and plans. As you know, the CPUC initiated 2 new investigations since our last earnings call. So we're now working through 3 gas-related investigations, as well as the rulemaking proceeding. You may recall that the original investigation was initiated in early 2011, focused mainly on our records management. Then in November, the CPUC initiated the class location investigation to review whether we operated our pipeline system at pressures consistent with current class designations. We've provided our responses in that proceeding, identifying our errors and properly designating class location and adjusted operating pressures accordingly.
The most recent investigation, the gas pipeline investigation, covers all areas of our pipeline operations. It takes into account a report by the safety division on the company's gas pipeline operations and practices, which the report attempts to broadly connect with the San Bruno pipeline rupture. This is the most comprehensive review of operations by the CPUC leading to a penalty proceeding.
In addition to these investigations, the CPUC in December gave the staff new citation authority in their oversight of gas companies. Through that new authority, the safety division staff issued a citation for about $17 million for our self report of some maps missing from our distribution leak survey schedule which our team identified and then promptly corrected. We believe this fine is excessive under the circumstances, and we have appealed the citation. However, there are no precedents to rely on here, so we can't predict the final outcome.
Given all of these recent developments and considering the CPUC's wide discretion in these matters, the magnitude of the San Bruno event and developments such as the citation issued by the safety division, we've taken a charge for $200 million. This is an estimate, and it does require a lot of judgment, but we believe this represents the low end of the range of expected fines and penalties associated with the various gas matters.
Meanwhile, in the rulemaking proceeding, there's been no action or progress on our request for a memo account, and the procedural schedule beyond the March hearings remains unclear. We previously assumed that we'd be able to recover the cost for work we do related to the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan in 2012 to comply with the new standards. But that is now much less likely before the rulemaking proceeding is resolved. To be conservative for guidance purposes, we now assume resolution will not occur until the end of this year. This means that costs incurred during 2012 related to the safety plan and prior to a final CPUC order will fall to the bottom line. This obviously has implications for our guidance, which Kent will discuss in just a few minutes. But before we go to Kent, Nick is going to provide more detail about our gas safety plans in 2012.

As Chris told you, we completed a lot of gas work this last year, but we've also been building a strong team of experts from both within the company and from industry-leading firms across the country. As we go forward, we'll be making additional progress in gas operations, including improving our integrity management program, our gas distribution practices and the use of technology, all designed to enhance public safety. We know a lot more about our gas pipeline system than we did a year ago. And we've also uncovered new challenges even during this past quarter. Based upon all of our experiences last year, we've adjusted our operational plans and our cost expectations for this year.
In terms of the scope of work for this year, we plan on pressure testing or verifying records for 185 miles of transmission pipe, replacing about 40 miles and upgrading 78 miles to enable in-line inspections on those segments. Also, by early 2013, we will complete the MAOP validation for all remaining transmission pipelines in the system, more than 4,000 additional miles. We now expect our costs for the pipeline-related work in 2012 to be about $120 million higher than we previously estimated.
The main driver is the cost for the Hydrostatic Pressure Testing program. As a reminder, we filed our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan last summer, including estimated cost, which were based upon our limited experience up to that point. We completed the majority of our 2011 pressure testing since that time, which impacted our cost expectations for this year. Based upon what we experienced last year in the pressure testing program, we expect to continue to incur cost per mile much higher than what you might see from some of our industry peers. And there are a couple of reasons for this: first, industry average cost for pressure testing are generally based upon long line pipe of uniform size with minimal population or customer impacts. We, on the other hand, conduct test on shorter segments of older pipes, often in densely populated areas. And second, we face challenges in local permitting and environmental activities like water disposal, and we expect these to continue as we focus our program on more pipelines in the San Francisco Bay Area this year.
So while additional lead time allows us to bid and contract for these projects more strategically, which will lower these costs compared to 2011, we still expect our pressure testing cost to be substantially more than the industry average. Although the pressure testing unit costs are by far the biggest driver of our higher estimates this year, we'll also need to complete work on some pipelines that we had not originally planned to address in 2012. This carryover work will also increase our pipeline expenses. The combination of all the work I've described in our ongoing performance improvement efforts should bring us greater certainty in higher performance in our gas business going forward.
Now I'll turn things over to Kent."

And I think there are 5 key takeaways: first, we took a $200 million of accrual in Q4 for potential penalties associated with all the",1413,"Good morning. I have a fair amount to cover, so I'd like to provide the big picture before I go through all the details. And I think there are 5 key takeaways: first, we took a $200 million of accrual in Q4 for potential penalties associated with all the gas matters; second, our other Q4 results were in line with guidance; third, we're maintaining our 2012 guidance for earnings from operations at $3.10 to $3.30 per share; fourth, we're modifying our 2012 guidance for pipeline-related costs; and fifth, we're increasing our estimate of 2012 equity needs. I'll explain to these as I go through with my remarks.
So I'm going to start with our Q4 results, which are summarized on Slide 6. Here you can see that earnings from operations for Q4 were $366 million or $0.89 per share, and earnings from operations from the year totaled $3.58 per share.
GAAP earnings for the quarter were $83 million or $0.20 per share. The difference between Q4 earnings from operations and GAAP earnings is the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters. And the details of that are shown in the table at the bottom of the slide. First is the pipeline-related costs, which totaled $180 million pretax during the quarter. And this includes the strength testing and the pipeline validation work that Chris and Nick talked about, as well as our legal and other costs that we incurred during the quarter. For the year, this totaled $483 million pretax and was in line with our guidance.
Below that, you see the $200 million accrual we took in Q4 for potential penalties stemming from the various gas matters. As you know, this was an item we had not provided guidance on. Chris described the regulatory developments that occurred since our last call and some of the factors we considered in determining the amount of the accrual, which clearly involved a lot of judgment. Obviously, we'll continue to assess the accrual in future quarters until the issues are resolved.
Next, you can see that there were no additional accruals during the quarter for third-party liabilities. Prior to Q4, we had accrued a cumulative $375 million through a third-party liability, including a $155 million in 2011, which you see on the right. And finally, you can see that we booked additional insurance recoveries of $39 million related to third-party claims during Q4. That brings us to $99 million of insurance recoveries since the accident, and we'll continue to wait until we've resolved claims with each carrier before booking additional insurance recoveries.
Slide 7 has the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations. The $0.89 earned in the fourth quarter, which is shown on the far right, represents a $0.19 increase compared to Q4 of 2010. You see, the $0.02 of that is due to higher authorized rate base investment. And then we also incurred cost for 2 items in Q4 of 2010 that we did not have in Q4 of 2011, $0.06 for a nuclear refueling outage and $0.05 related to the SmartMeter program.
Litigation and regulatory matters also was $0.04 favorable compared to Q4 2010, in part because the prior period included an initial accrual for the Rancho Cordova accident. These increases were partially offset by higher shares outstanding, which had a $0.03 impact and miscellaneous items totaling about $0.04 negative, including some employee related costs such as severance and workers' comp.
That completes my summary of our 2011 results. So I'm now going to move on to our outlook for 2012. On Slide 8, you can see that our guidance for 2012 earnings from operations remained at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. As I'll cover in a moment, we do expect additional equity issuance this year, which will result in some dilution. However, notwithstanding that, we're maintaining our 2012 guidance for EPS from operations at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. I'll remind you also that in the last quarter's call, we provided some of the key assumptions underlying our 2012 guidance, including authorized rate base, CapEx spending levels, incremental expenses we expect to incur and authorized ROE and cap structure. And that info is again included on a slide in the appendix.
Back to Slide 8, there also was no change in our 2012 guidance related to our item impacting comparability for environmental-related costs. This is in connection with chromium cleanup and mitigation at Hinkley. However, we are updating our guidance for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters. And if you turn to Slide 9, I'll walk you through the changes.
Starting on the left-hand side of the slide, you'll remember that our 2012 gas pipeline-related work includes the work we proposed in our pipeline safety enhancement plan, which was originally estimated to cost about $230 million, as well as work that fell outside the PSEP, which we estimated would cost between $100 million and $200 million. The non-PSEP costs included work on post-1970 pipe, as well as litigation and other costs.
Previously, the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan work was excluded from our 2012 guidance for the item impacting comparability because we assumed approval of the PSEP as filed. So as you can see at the bottom on the left, our item impacting comparability included only the non-PSEP work, which as you know, we weren't seeking recovery of.
At the upper right side of the slide, you can see the updated cost estimate for our 2012 pipeline work, which is increased by about $120 million for the reasons Nick described. Remember, the original PSEP cost estimates were down last summer prior to a lot of our experience in the field. Our estimate now reflects that experience.
In addition, our outlook for the PSEP recovery has also changed. Since our last call, we haven't seen progress in approving a memo account for cost we incur pending a final decision, and the procedural schedule for a final decision is still unclear beyond hearings scheduled in March. We've decided to conservatively assume that the PSEP is not resolved by the commission until the end of this year. Therefore, we're now including our PSEP and non-PSEP costs in our 2012 guidance for the item impacting comparability. The updated guidance range for these costs is $450 million to $550 million.
On Slide 10, you can see a summary of our current 2012 guidance. As I mentioned before, there's no change in guidance for EPS from operations or for our environmental-related costs. The natural gas matters item is broken out in the table below into its components, including the pipeline-related costs I just described. The range for third-party liability claims remains unchanged at 0 to $225 million. This range reflects the difference between the amount we've accrued to date, $375 million, and the upper end of our estimate for third-party liability, which is $600 million. As has been our practice, we're not providing guidance for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued or for future insurance recoveries.
I'm going to finish with an update on our equity issuance in 2011 and our plans for 2012, and that's on Slide 11. On our last call, we estimated that based on our guidance assumptions at the time, we expected to issue roughly $600 million of equity starting in the fourth quarter of 2011 through the end of 2012. And you can see that on the left.
Next to that, you can see we actually issued $276 million of equity in Q4. Of course, our guidance now assumes higher unrecovered costs for our gas pipeline-related work in 2012. And in Q4, we took the $200 million accrual for gas-related penalties. Both of these factors have contributed to an expected increase in our 2012 equity issuance of about $300 million. As a result, we expect our 2012 equity needs to be roughly in the $600 million range based on our current assumptions. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year is going to depend on the resolution of the gas matters as well as other factors.
We'd expect to issue between $150 million and $250 million through our internal programs, the 401(k) and DRIP, with the balance coming from external issuance. Our existing dribble program has about $300 million of remaining capacity, and we'll consider another dribble program as well as other alternatives to address any remaining needs during the year.
That completes our prepared remarks for this morning's call. And so we'll go ahead now and open up the lines for your questions."

And depending upon the resolution of the gas matters, at some point, it will become a cash item. While it's a non-cash accrual, it's not 100% you fund with equity because, obviously, you're raising cash, which otherwise you don't need at this point when you issue the equity. So in some ways, you end up initially raising roughly half of what you need and displacing debt issuance that you otherwise would have needed. Ultimately, when you pay a cash amount for the item, then we would raise the remaining equity and some a little bit of debt to offset what you displaced initially, and that becomes one-for-one eventually."

That's why some of the work that Nick and his team had done this past year on the hydrotesting in the MAOP, we're starting to get some recognition. And we really have committed to having the safest gas system. And I think eventually, people will start to realize it's a very real commitment that we're delivering on. So I would say while there are some areas we've made some real progress, we continue on some of our operational areas that affect our customer satisfaction numbers and the like.

We're doing hydrostatic testing on pipes that's been in the ground for 50, 60 years that neighborhoods have grown up around, streets have been paved over. It is a major project. The other issue that we discovered was when you put a brand-new pipe in the ground, you fill it with water, you pressure test it, the water comes out clean. When you put water in a pipe that's been around for 50 or 60 years, you've got residual hydrocarbons, you got corrosion products in there, and we've had to then spend a huge amount of money treating the water coming out, out of the pipes.

I think it's fair to say this work that we did this past year and that we're going to do in 2012 regarding hydrostatic testing is probably the most complex hydrostatic testing program anywhere in the United States. And as Tony alluded that these are shorter segments of all the pipelines, very difficult working conditions to be able to stage the equipment at the point where you need to begin and then stage additional equipment at the end of the test. And the environmental requirements here in California are appropriately the most rigorous in the country. So those standards that we are adhering to here are the highest bar, no doubt, and drive a lot of these costs. And the majority of the cost that we incurred that were unanticipated really relate to handling the water in the hydro test program, where we need to, in many cases before we begin our hydro test, flush these lines to make sure that the water in the pipe when we do the hydro test, the actual test itself, is up to drinking water standards. So that has required us to do a lot of water handling, a lot of water treatment, a lot of water disposal, way over and above what would be required, as Tony indicated, in a new pipeline. That said, over the course of 2011, our cost per mile was around $1.6 million a mile. Our estimate for this year is somewhere in the $1.1 million, $1.15 million per mile. So a significant reduction of what we incurred in 2011. I would also add that we're dealing with shorter segments of pipe than I think that most people do, and so that adds to the cost per mile."

So when you add all that up, that brings you to about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion that shareholders have incurred. As you know, we've also committed to spend $200 million this year and $200 million next year on all of our operations, which is not going to be funded by customers, but in fact at shareholders' cost.

First of all is that for the most part, most of our gas transmission rate cases were settled. So there were settlement agreement. And when you have a settlement agreement, you don't necessarily do a line item by line item tracking of the different types of cost. And in a lot of times, you also don't address how costs are allocated between years. And so there's a lot of judgment that goes into trying to determine what were the authorized amounts of cost to be spent in any one of those given years. And so when you go back and look at the findings or the assertions, if you will, in that audit, you can see that there's a lot of effort assumptions that they're making that, quite frankly, we disagree bit. And that -- and we will dispute as we move forward in the process. 
The second thing, though, that you really need to focus here on is that the majority of the costs that they're alleging that we did not spend, the $400 million out of the $500 million, relates to the programs that are, quite frankly, at-risk programs, and it generally is around our gas storage and our ability to utilize those funds. Many years ago, the CPUC decided that they did not want the customers to have the risk around that, and so we were  -- the shareholders then were the ones that would suffer the consequences of a marketplace that didn't have activity in it or could have the rewards of it. And in fact over the last couple of years, we've seen very little in terms of rewards and income off of those businesses. And so what they're asserting is that we should have taken at-risk revenues that were designed incent or penalize shareholders and apply them elsewhere. 
And then finally, when you look at the totality of our returns over the last 15 to 20 years, you'll see that in general, they're pretty much right around our authorized return in total for the company. And so it's not like all of that went and caused it to have a company-wide excessive earnings. We were utilizing that for other parts of the business. And so there's a lot there that we will -- that will come out and be asserted differently by us as we move forward in the regulatory proceedings."

What struck me most about that report were not so much the details of the audit, but the line of argument that the division was presenting, which I think you could paraphrase as something along these lines: that PG&E had a legal obligation to run its gas pipeline system in a safe, reliable fashion. It requested and received most recently, through a settlement, the revenues that deemed necessary to do so, the events at San Bruno. And the record presented in the report indicate that the company failed in its obligation to provide safe and reliable service. Now the company is coming back and saying our large portion of our PSEP budget, which relates to more onerous regulatory standards, should be recoverable. And the amounts that are being requested for recovery are comparable to the rate base of the system. And the argument seems to say, ""Didn't we pay you once for the assets and the O&M necessary for safe and reliable service? And if you failed to provide it given that we've paid for it already, why should we pay for it again?"" And it seemed to me an argument that would strike a chord with intervenors.

In terms of generator settlements, we don't see a lot of activity there this year. I think that's a little bit further out. So again, kind of same answer. That's not a big driver of our short-term cash needs. And in terms of where we ended up the year with short-term debt, we do have a fair amount of collateral posted, which we do as part of our normal activities related to energy procurement as well as hedging. And when you have low gas prices as we currently have, while that reduces the cash outlay for procuring fuel and gas for customers, it does cause us to have the post collateral to security arrangements we have with counterparties.

Since this is only my second quarterly earnings call, I think I'm still enough of a newcomer to share some of my observations of the company before we get to the heart of our discussion this morning.
At our last earnings call, I made several points about what we had done to start to transform PG&E. And we had hired a lot of top-tier talent to supplement the strong core of PG&E veterans that we have. We made organizational changes that established clear lines of accountability for our gas and electric businesses. We put a strong emphasis on operational excellence, and we made a commitment of resources to turn the business around, and, ultimately, to make our operations the safest in the country. So with the benefits of a few more months on the job, let me add a couple more observations.
Our team understands that public safety is our highest priority, and we're now rolling out technologies to get us there. They understand that the focus is on back-to-basics, that we have to be -- have to focus on benchmarking and to put in place a continuous improvement program. Most of all, the team understands that we have to deliver. We know the areas we need to improve on, and we've got a solid foundation from which we can execute. And that's significant because it means that in contrast to where we were just 7 or 8 months ago, we now have a very real opportunity in 2012: first, to truly tackle and resolve our gas issues; second, focus on repositioning PG&E for long-term success; and third, rebuild relationships with key stakeholders. And that is exactly what our executive team is focused on.
So let me start with the first point, the gas issues. The new gas organization we put in place last year has delivered on our key commitments and made impressive progress in 2011. And Chris and Nick will give you the update on the details in just a couple of minutes. What you'll hear is that we still got an extremely demanding amount of work ahead in 2012. Much of this falls under our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. It's work that is critical to meeting the new pipeline safety standards being adopted by the CPUC and in Congress. It's also essential to resolving the San Bruno issues and rebuilding public trust and confidence in the company. At the same time, it's important to distinguish between the work that was necessary to close the gaps in our past performance and work that's newly required going forward.
Our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan is largely new work for a new world, where the CPUC is setting future safety standards at a higher level than ever before. With minor exceptions, it's not all work to meet yesterday's standards as some have claimed. To avoid confusion, we've already asked the CPUC to separate the review of the appropriateness of the plan over the issue of who should pay for the plan.
You've seen our press release this morning that although we're maintaining our guidance from earnings from operations, we've updated our outlook for 2012 pipeline costs. The update reflects our current understanding of our cost based on the experience that we gained in the field last year. We've also made some conservative assumptions about the timing of the CPUC's ruling on our safety plan. Let me underscore that we're going to continue to work hard to accelerate a decision on a safety plan and to resolve all of the gas-related proceedings at the commission.
Reaching as much clarity and closure as we can on the regulatory and legal fronts in doing so as soon as we can is a top priority for our team, and we know it's a top priority for our investors as well. Shareholders have stepped up and are bearing substantial cost to address past issues, and it's important that regulators recognize this when it comes time to make a decision on cost for work going forward, and we will urge them to take that into account.
Let me turn briefly to positioning the company for long-term success. Success, for us, is delivering overall results for customers that are in the first quartile. The key is honestly assessing our business, benchmarking our performance and then acting to close any gaps that we find. We're going to ingrain this into our operations and our culture. Focusing on operational excellence is the single best way to rebuild our relationships with customers, regulators and, we believe, investors. As you've heard me say before based on my past experience in similar situations, the only way to convince customers that you're a different company is to prove it by listening to them and then delivering great service. And our entire executive team understands this. None of us expects to get there overnight, but we've set a high bar, and we will make significant progress in 2012.
So with that, I'll turn to Chris and then Nick to take you through our operational progress in 2011 and our plans for the coming year. Chris?"
139813,145791776,259270,"PG&E Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2012",2012-02-16,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tony.

Today, I'm going to summarize the significant work that we completed in 2011 to help resolve the gas pipeline issues. And I'll touch on the work that we're doing to position the broader company for success. I'll also discuss some of the regulatory developments over the last couple of months.
Let me start with the gas work in 2011. We accomplished a remarkable amount of work this past year to improve the safety of our gas pipeline system. To give you just a couple of examples, by the end of January, we have validated the maximum allowable operating pressures, or what we refer to as MAOP, for all of the more than 2,000 miles of transmission pipelines in high consequence areas. And along the way, we met every one of our commitments with our regulators. In the process, we conducted a records validation effort more detailed and comprehensive than anything done before anywhere. We've completed an unprecedented amount of pressure testing, validating the safety of over 160 miles of gas transmission pipe. This was technically difficult and highly complex work on in-service pipes in densely populated areas. And as Nick will discuss later, we'll be doing a similar amount of work this year to further validate and enhance the safety of our system.
Now gas operations in place, we're not the only ones working hard to improve the safety and reliability of our operations last year. We made a number of safety enhancements to our electric system, focusing on reducing the risk from outages and reducing the number of, and the impact from, equipment failures. At the same time, we had another strong year in electric reliability, where we had our second consecutive year with the new low of outage frequency.
In the area of renewables, 19.3% of the electric power we delivered in 2011 came from renewable resources, putting us on track to meet the interim benchmarks as we move towards California's 33% goal by 2020. This is in addition to the 40% of clean energy sources from our vast hydroelectric system and our nuclear facility.
Speaking of which, we had another very successful year of nuclear operations at Diablo Canyon, including in the industry-leading safety performance during our refueling outage. Finally, we installed 1.5 million SmartMeters in 2011, bringing our total to 8.9 million out of the planned 9.7 million. And we're utilizing those meters and the capabilities to reduce our outage times.
As we look into 2012, we will continue to drive our safety performance improvement in all areas of the company. And Nick's going to discuss the gas plants in just a few minutes. But in the electric operations, we'll be doing more reinforcement and inspection work on poles and increasing our overhead and underground line maintenance work in an effort to identify and resolve potential issues before they disrupt our customers or cause unsafe situations.  Throughout the business, we'll continue to work on improving our processes and using technology to achieve our safety and reliability objectives.
Finally, I'd like to discuss regulatory developments, which affect our operational outlook and plans. As you know, the CPUC initiated 2 new investigations since our last earnings call. So we're now working through 3 gas-related investigations, as well as the rule-making proceeding. You may recall that the original investigation was initiated in early 2011, focused mainly on our records management. Then in November, the CPUC initiated the class location investigation to review whether we operated our pipeline system at pressures consistent with current class designations. We've provided our responses in that proceeding, identifying our errors and properly designating class location and adjusted operating pressures accordingly.
The most recent investigation, the gas pipeline investigation, covers all areas of our pipeline operations. It takes into account a report by the safety division on the company's gas pipeline operations and practices, which the report attempts to broadly connect with the San Bruno pipeline rupture. This is the most comprehensive review of operations by the CPUC leading to a penalty proceeding.
In addition to these investigations, the CPUC in December gave the staff new citation authority in their oversight of gas companies. Through that new authority, the safety division staff issued a citation for about $17 million for our self report of some maps missing from our distribution leak survey schedule, which our team identified and then promptly corrected. We believe this fine is excessive under the circumstances, and we have appealed the citation. However, there are no precedents to rely on here, so we can't predict the final outcome.
Given all of these recent developments and considering the CPUC's wide discretion in these matters, the magnitude of the San Bruno event and developments such as the citation issued by the safety division, we've taken a charge for $200 million. This is an estimate, and it does require a lot of judgment, but we believe this represents the low end of the range of expected fines and penalties associated with the various gas matters.
Meanwhile, in the rule-making proceeding, there's been no action or progress on our request for a memo account, and the procedural schedule beyond the March hearings remains unclear. We previously assumed that we'd be able to recover the cost for work we do related to the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan in 2012 to comply with the new standards. But that is now much less likely before the rule-making proceeding is resolved. To be conservative for guidance purposes, we now assume resolution will not occur until the end of this year. This means that costs incurred during 2012 related to the safety plan, and prior to a final CPUC order, will fall to the bottom line. This obviously has implications for our guidance, which Kent will discuss in just a few minutes. But before we go to Kent, Nick is going to provide more detail about our gas safety plans in 2012. Nick?"

As Chris told you, we've completed a lot of gas work this last year, but we've also been building a strong team of experts from both within the company and from industry-leading firms across the country. As we go forward, we'll be making additional progress in gas operations, including improving our integrity management program, our gas distribution practices and the use of technology, all designed to enhance public safety. We know a lot more about our gas pipeline system than we did a year ago. And we've also uncovered new challenges even during this past quarter. Based upon all of our experiences last year, we've adjusted our operational plans and our cost expectations for this year.
In terms of the scope of work for this year, we plan on pressure testing or verifying records for 185 miles of transmission pipe, replacing about 40 miles and upgrading 78 miles to enable in-line inspections on those segments. Also, by early 2013, we will complete the MAOP validation for all remaining transmission pipelines in the system, more than 4,000 additional miles. We now expect our costs for the pipeline-related work in 2012 to be about $120 million higher than we previously estimated.
The main driver is the cost for the Hydrostatic Pressure Testing program. As a reminder, we filed our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan last summer, including estimated costs, which were based upon our limited experience up to that point. We completed the majority of our 2011 pressure testing since that time, which impacted our cost expectations for this year. Based upon what we experienced last year in the pressure testing program, we expect to continue to incur cost per mile much higher than what you might see from some of our industry peers. And there are a couple of reasons for this: first, industry average cost for pressure testing are generally based upon long line pipe of uniform size with minimal population or customer impacts. We, on the other hand, need to conduct test on shorter segments of older pipes, often in densely populated areas. And second, we face challenges in local permitting and environmental activities like water disposal, and we expect these to continue as we focus our program on more pipelines in the San Francisco Bay Area this year.
So while additional lead time allows us to bid and contract for these projects more strategically, which will lower these costs compared to 2011, we still expect our pressure testing cost to be substantially more than the industry average. Although the pressure testing unit costs are by far the biggest driver of our higher estimates this year, we'll also need to complete work on some pipelines that we had not originally planned to address in 2012. This carryover work will also increase our pipeline expenses. The combination of all the work I've described in our ongoing performance improvement efforts should bring us greater certainty in higher performance in our gas business going forward.
Now I'll turn things over to Kent."

And I think there are 5 key takeaways: first, we took a $200 million of accrual in Q4 for potential penalties associated with all the gas matters; second, our other Q4 results were in line with guidance; third, we're maintaining our 2012 guidance for earnings from operations at $3.10 to $3.30 per share; fourth, we're modifying our 2012 guidance for pipeline-related costs; and fifth, we're increasing our estimate of 2012 equity needs. I'll explain each of these as I go through with my remarks.
So I'm going to start with our Q4 results, which are summarized on Slide 6. Here you can see that earnings from operations for Q4 were $366 million or $0.89 per share, and earnings for operations from the year totaled $3.58 per share.
GAAP earnings for the quarter were $83 million or $0.20 per share. The difference between Q4 earnings from operations and GAAP earnings is the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters. And the details of that are shown in the table at the bottom of the slide. First is the pipeline-related costs, which totaled $180 million pretax during the quarter. And this includes the strength testing and the pipeline validation work that Chris and Nick talked about, as well as our legal and other costs that we incurred during the quarter. For the year, this totaled $483 million pretax and was in line with our guidance.
Below that, you see the $200 million accrual we took in Q4 for potential penalties stemming from the various gas matters. As you know, this was an item we had not provided guidance on. Chris described the regulatory developments that occurred since our last call and some of the factors we considered in determining the amount of the accrual, which clearly involved a lot of judgment. Obviously, we'll continue to assess the accrual in future quarters until the issues are resolved.
Next, you can see that there were no additional accruals during the quarter for third-party liabilities. Prior to Q4, we had accrued a cumulative $375 million through a third-party liability, including $155 million in 2011, which you see on the right. And finally, you can see that we booked additional insurance recoveries of $39 million related to third-party claims during Q4. That brings us to $99 million of insurance recoveries since the accident, and we'll continue to wait until we've resolved claims with each carrier before booking additional insurance recoveries.
Slide 7 has the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations. The $0.89 earned in the fourth quarter, which is shown on the far right, represents a $0.19 increase compared to Q4 of 2010. You see, the $0.02 of that is due to higher authorized rate base investment. And then we also incurred costs for 2 items in Q4 of 2010 that we did not have in Q4 of 2011, $0.06 for a nuclear refueling outage and $0.05 related to the SmartMeter program.
Litigation and regulatory matters also was $0.04 favorable compared to Q4 2010, in part because the prior period included an initial accrual for the Rancho Cordova accident. These increases were partly offset by higher shares outstanding, which had a $0.03 impact and miscellaneous items totaling about $0.04 negative, including some employee related costs such as severance and workers' comp.
That completes my summary of our 2011 results. So I'm now going to move on to our outlook for 2012. On Slide 8, you can see that our guidance for 2012 earnings from operations remains at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. As I'll cover in a moment, we do expect additional equity issuance this year, which will result in some dilution. However, notwithstanding that, we're maintaining our 2012 guidance for EPS from operations at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. I'll remind you also that in the last quarter's call, we provided some of the key assumptions underlying our 2012 guidance, including authorized rate base, CapEx spending levels, incremental expenses we expect to incur and authorized ROE and cap structure. And that info is again included on a slide in the appendix.
Back to Slide 8, there also was no change in our 2012 guidance related to our item impacting comparability for environmental-related costs. This is in connection with chromium cleanup and mitigation at Hinkley. However, we are updating our guidance for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters. And if you turn to Slide 9, I'll walk you through the changes.
Starting on the left-hand side of the slide, you'll remember that our 2012 gas pipeline-related work includes the work we proposed in our pipeline safety enhancement plan, which was originally estimated to cost about $230 million, as well as work that fell outside the PSEP, which we estimated would cost between $100 million and $200 million. The non-PSEP costs included work on post-1970 pipe, as well as litigation and other costs.
Previously, the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan work was excluded from our 2012 guidance for the item impacting comparability because we assumed approval of the PSEP as filed. So as you can see at the bottom on the left, our item impacting comparability included only the non-PSEP work, which as you know, we weren't seeking recovery of.
At the upper right side of the slide, you can see the updated cost estimate for our 2012 pipeline work, which is increased by about $120 million for the reasons Nick described. Remember, the original PSEP cost estimates were down last summer prior to a lot of our experience in the field. Our estimate now reflects that experience.
In addition, our outlook for the PSEP recovery has also changed. Since our last call, we haven't seen progress in approving a memo account for cost we incur pending a final decision, and the procedural schedule for a final decision is still unclear beyond hearings scheduled in March. We've decided to conservatively assume that the PSEP is not resolved by the commission until the end of this year. Therefore, we're now including our PSEP and non-PSEP costs in our 2012 guidance for the item impacting comparability. The updated guidance range for these costs is $450 million to $550 million.
On Slide 10, you can see a summary of our current 2012 guidance. As I mentioned before, there's no change in guidance for EPS from operations or for our environmental-related costs. The natural gas matters item is broken out in the table below into its components, including the pipeline-related costs I just described. The range for third-party liability claims remains unchanged at 0 to $225 million. This range reflects the difference between the amount we've accrued to date, $375 million, and the upper end of our estimate for third-party liability, which is $600 million. As has been our practice, we're not providing guidance for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued, or for future insurance recoveries.
I'm going to finish with an update on our equity issuance in 2011 and our plans for 2012, and that's on Slide 11. On our last call, we estimated that based on our guidance assumptions at the time, we expected to issue roughly $600 million of equity starting in the fourth quarter of 2011 through the end of 2012. And you can see that on the left.
Next to that, you can see we actually issued $276 million of equity in Q4. Of course, our guidance now assumes higher unrecovered costs for our gas pipeline-related work in 2012. And in Q4, we took the $200 million accrual for gas-related penalties. Both of these factors have contributed to an expected increase in our 2012 equity issuance of about $300 million. As a result, we expect our 2012 equity needs to be roughly in the $600 million range based on our current assumptions. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year is going to depend on the resolution of the gas matters as well as other factors.
We'd expect to issue between $150 million and $250 million through our internal programs, the 401(k) and DRIP, with the balance coming from external issuance. Our existing dribble program has about $300 million of remaining capacity, and we'll consider another dribble program as well as other alternatives to address any remaining needs during the year.
That completes our prepared remarks for this morning's call. And so we'll go ahead now and open up the lines for your questions."

And depending upon the resolution of the gas matters, at some point, it will become a cash item. While it's a non-cash accrual, it's not 100% you fund with equity because, obviously, you're raising cash, which otherwise you don't need at this point when you issue the equity. So in some ways, you end up initially raising roughly half of what you need and displacing debt issuance that you otherwise would have needed. Ultimately, when you pay a cash amount for the item, then we would raise the remaining equity and some a little bit of debt to offset what you displaced initially, and that becomes one-for-one eventually."

And we've committed to our board to move those along. Clearly, on some of the perceptual benchmarkings, so our customer satisfaction numbers, which combines not only our operational performance but also the perception of the company in the marketplace, those continue to reside squarely in third and fourth quartile. And to deal with those, you've got to do a combination of improving the service and also in improving the credibility of the company in the marketplace. That's why some of the work that Nick and his team has done this past year on the hydrotesting in the MAOP, we're starting to get some recognition. And we really have committed to having the safest gas system. And I think eventually, people will start to realize it's a very real commitment that we're delivering on. So I would say while there are some areas we've made some real progress, we continue on some of our operational areas that affect our customer satisfaction numbers and the like. We're still average to below average."

So having built pipelines like the Millennium Pipeline, Iroquois Pipeline, when you're going out doing hydrostatic testing on a brand-new pipeline and you've got the pipe lying there in the trench, you know where you're going to do the hydrostatic testing in advance. It's all laid out, and it's a relatively simple process. We're doing hydrostatic testing on pipe that's been in the ground for 50, 60 years that neighborhoods have grown up around, streets have been paved over. It is a major project. The other issue that we discovered was when you put a brand-new pipe in the ground, you fill it with water, you pressure test it, the water comes out clean. When you put water in a pipe that's been around for 50 or 60 years, you've got residual hydrocarbons, you got corrosion products in there, and we've had to then spend a huge amount of money treating the water coming out, out of the pipes. So Nick and his team have been working very hard to simplify the process. But, Nick, there still is a lot of challenge out there."

I think it's fair to say the work that we did this past year and that we're going to do in 2012 regarding hydrostatic testing is probably the most complex hydrostatic testing program anywhere in the United States. And as Tony alluded that these are shorter segments of older pipelines, very difficult working conditions to be able to stage the equipment at the point where you need to begin and then stage additional equipment at the end of the test. And the environmental requirements here in California are appropriately the most rigorous in the country. So those standards that we are adhering to here are the highest bar, no doubt, and drive a lot of these costs. And the majority of the cost that we incurred that were unanticipated really relate to handling the water in the hydro test program, where we need to, in many cases before we begin our hydro test, flush these lines to make sure that the water in the pipe when we do the hydro test, the actual test itself, is up to drinking water standards. So that has required us to do a lot of water handling, a lot of water treatment, a lot of water disposal, way over and above what would be required, as Tony indicated, in a new pipeline. That said, over the course of 2011, our cost per mile was around $1.6 million a mile. Our estimate for this year is somewhere in the $1.1 million, $1.15 million per mile. So a significant reduction of what we incurred in 2011. I would also add that we're dealing with shorter segments of pipe than I think that most people do, and so that adds to the cost per mile."

I can't speak to their motivations, but we take everything like this very seriously, and we have found nothing to suggest that our workmanship was nothing but top quality.

You saw in our press release that cumulative to date, we've spent around $550 million that is not going to be recovered, that is at a shareholder cost. And obviously, our guidance indicates that we could spend nearly that much in 2012 on pipeline-related items. We accrued a $200 million penalty. So when you add all that up, that brings you to about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion that shareholders have incurred. As you know, we've also committed to spend $200 million this year and $200 million next year on all of our operations, which is not going to be funded by customers, but in fact at shareholders' cost. And that's how you can get to $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, which, obviously, is a very significant price tag. In fact, that's actually approaching the total net investment in our pipelines that we built up over decades.

First of all is that for the most part, most of our gas transmission rate cases were settled. So there were settlement agreements. And when you have a settlement agreement, you don't necessarily do a line item by line item tracking of the different types of costs. And in a lot of times, you also don't address how costs are allocated between years. And so there's a lot of judgment that goes into trying to determine what were the authorized amounts of cost to be spent in any one of those given years. And so when you go back and look at the findings or the assertions, if you will, in that audit, you can see that there's a lot of different assumptions that they're making that, quite frankly, we disagree with. And that -- and we will dispute as we move forward in the process. 
The second thing, though, that you really need to focus here on is that the majority of the costs that they're alleging that we did not spend, the $400 million out of the $500 million, relates to the programs that are, quite frankly, at-risk programs, and it generally is around our gas storage and our ability to utilize those funds. Many years ago, the CPUC decided that they did not want the customers to have the risks around that, and so we were  -- the shareholders then were the ones that would suffer the consequences of a marketplace that didn't have activity in it or could have the rewards of it. And in fact over the last couple of years, we've seen very little in terms of rewards and income off of those businesses. And so what they're asserting is that we should have taken at-risk revenues that were designed to incent or penalize shareholders and apply them elsewhere. 
And then finally, when you look at the totality of our returns over the last 15 to 20 years, you'll see that in general, they're pretty much right around our authorized return in total for the company. And so it's not like all of that went and caused it to have a company-wide excessive earnings. We were utilizing that for other parts of the business. And so there's a lot there that we will -- that will come out and be asserted differently by us as we move forward in the regulatory proceedings."

What struck me most about that report were not so much the details of the audit, but the line of argument that the division was presenting, which I think you could paraphrase as something along these lines: that PG&E had a legal obligation to run its gas pipeline system in a safe, reliable fashion. It requested and received most recently, through a settlement, the revenues that it deemed necessary to do so, the events at San Bruno. And the record presented in the report indicate that the company failed in its obligation to provide safe and reliable service. Now the company is coming back and saying our large portion of our PSEP budget, which relates to more onerous regulatory standards, should be recoverable. And the amounts that are being requested for recovery are comparable to the rate base of the system. And the argument seems to say, ""Didn't we pay you once for the assets and the O&M necessary for safe and reliable service? And if you failed to provide it given that we've paid for it already, why should we pay for it again?"" And it seemed to me an argument that would strike a chord with intervenors. Obviously, it has with commission staff. It might strike a chord with commissioners themselves. So I wanted to ask you, how have you seen that argument received at the commission?

But to the extent that the standards are being changed and being increased, those new requirements ought to be recoverable from our customers through our rates. And I think you're going to see across the country, as we see new national pipeline standards, I think other states will start to look at what happens here in California, you'll see the same thing that while people were following accepted practices in the past, technology has changed, the understanding of the risks have changed, and, therefore, these new standards should be recoverable as part of a normal course of business."

In terms of generator settlements, we don't see a lot of activity there this year. I think that's a little bit further out. So again, kind of same answer. That's not a big driver of our short-term cash needs. And in terms of where we ended up the year with short-term debt, we do have a fair amount of collateral posted, which we do as part of our normal activities related to energy procurement as well as hedging. And when you have low gas prices as we currently have, while that reduces the cash outlay for procuring fuel and gas for customers, it does cause us to have the post collateral to security arrangements we have with counterparties.

Thanks for joining us. On our last earnings call, we outlined our top priorities for 2012, but I'd like to start today by reviewing these priorities again because I think they provide a good context for the discussion of our actions and results from the last quarter, as well as set the context for our plans for the rest of the year. So if you look at Slide 2. Our key objectives for the year are: first, we want to resolve as many of the gas related issues as we can in 2012; second, we want to position the company for long-term success; and third, we want to work very hard at rebuilding relationships with stakeholders. 
So let me start with the gas issues. We're continuing to work to the various regulatory and legal proceedings. We'd like to resolve the regulatory proceedings as soon as possible because the sooner we get clarity on these issues, the better it is for everyone from the utility to regulators to our customers. There's no way to predict whether settlement discussions will go forward or be successful, but we do support this approach as a way to accelerate the process. If and when there's any further news to report on this, we'll share it at the appropriate time. 
On the legal front, we also continue our efforts to settle the various individual claims related to the tragedy of San Bruno. Our goal is to provide victims with fair compensation. Just as with the regulatory issues, we'd like to do that as soon as possible and we're making progress towards that goal. Separately, we were pleased in this quarter to reach a critical agreement with the city of San Bruno by making a contribution to benefit the citizens of the community. This was an important milestone for us in that it helps the city move forward in the healing process, and it's important for us because it's another step on the road towards resolution of all of these issues.
Let me shift to the steps we're taking to position the company for long-term success starting with the gas business. We're maintaining the momentum that we established last year with safety improvement efforts in gas operations, and Chris is going to provide you with lots more details on what's planned for 2012. We've also now essentially completed the restructuring of the gas business, which has significantly improved accountability and the expertise in the organization. Our recently several highly experienced gas industry veterans have come on board filling our remaining vacancies for Vice Presidents overseeing key areas of gas operations. By the end of this quarter, we hope to complete the last of our high-level hires and have the team completely in place. We're also continuing to add new talent in other areas of the company. This includes officers with excellent credentials in customer care and information technology, which clearly are areas where we can benefit from their deep expertise. And then most recently, we announced the hiring of Ed Halpern from the South Texas Project as a Senior Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. Ed's full-time presence at Diablo Canyon build even greater depth into an already strong nuclear program that we've got. All of these additions to the team give me greater confidence that we're making the changes necessary to achieve a new level of performance and operations in customer service. Everyone on the team is focused on safety compliance and continuous improvement and working to close the gaps between where we are today and where we need to go to deliver outstanding service to our customers.
So last, let me touch on rebuilding relationships. Chris and I and many of our senior leaders continue to meet as often as possible with customers, policy makers, business partners and others. It's become clear to me from the conversations that we have that our stakeholders do want us to be successful and broadly speaking, we're getting positive feedback on the direction that we're moving. In that vein, a few recent successes are worth noting because I think they demonstrate we're doing a better job of listening to our customers. So for example, for that segment of customers, who do not want to participate in our SmartMeter program, we now have an opt-out alternative. Another example is the economic development rate that we've proposed to the CPUC. In these difficult economic times, this is a way to bring electric rate relief to businesses that need it to preserve or create jobs at our service area. And finally, for our residential customers, we're working to further modify the current multi-tiered rate structure to streamline and simplify it and improve the affordability of our service. Rebuilding relationships will be a long-term effort, but these are steps in the right direction. And we'll continue to look for these kinds of opportunities going forward. Ultimately though, we know that the key is for us to continue to deliver what we say we're going to deliver. Importantly, we did that last year when we completed our aggressive hydrostatic testing commitment and our operating pressure validation on our high consequence gas transmission pipelines. So with that introduction, let me turn the mic over to Chris. Chris?"
139813,183978087,294860,"PG&E Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone.

So this morning, I'm going to provide the regulatory and operational updates that are described briefly on Slide 3. Starting with the regulatory side. Procedural schedules have now been set for all 3 of the gas investigations with hearing dates scheduled for the fall. The CPUC staff has filed its findings and reports in 2 out of the 3 of those investigations and they're going to provide the report on the third round by the end of the month. These are all important milestones in each of the cases on our path forward towards resolution. 
In our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, the administrative law judge held 2 weeks of hearings at the end of March. A key issue covered in the testimony of the various parties was the categorization of work proposed in the company's safety plan. We believe that most of the workers needed to comply with the new standards, while other parties argued that much of it should have been done to comply with existing standards. We expect that final resolution will deal with both the scope of the gas work required through 2014 and the allocation of costs between shareholders and customers. We continue to fuel our proposal for this split as appropriate and that is that PG&E shareholders will continue to pay the costs necessary to comply with existing regulations but work that we undertake to meet new standards set by the CPUC is appropriate to recover from our customers. The final decision in the safety plan is expected in September.
In other regulatory news, on April 20, we filed our cost of capital as did the other California utilities and we proposed a reduction in our return on equity to 11% and that's from our current level of 11.35%. We did not propose any changes to our common equity ratio of 52% nor to the current multiyear adjustment mechanism. That mechanism would continue to link ROE to the performance of the munies bond yield impacts. We expect hearings to occur this fall and proposed and final decisions by the end of the year. The new levels in mechanism will go into affect 2013. 
And finally, this summer, we'll file the notice of intent for our next General Rate Case. We'll provide you details of our expense and capital request at that time, and as a reminder, the GRC addresses electric and gas distribution and electric generation, and it will go into effect in 2014. Our next Gas Transmission & Storage case is a year later.
Now moving over to operations. Obviously, we continue to perform important gas work this year, building out the extraordinary work completed in 2011. This quarter the gas team continued to deliver impressive results. Even with the limitations of working on the system during the winter when gas demand is much higher, we completed several miles of hydrostatic tests in the first quarter, and that's on our way to the planned performance of hydrostatic test on another 160 miles during the remainder of this year. We also made significant progress on our efforts to validate and document the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure of our pipelines. We completed about 900 miles in Q1 out of 3,600 miles planned for the entire year. In addition, as we performed fieldwork and identify emerging issues, we will continue to shift the pipeline work plan to ensure that the work at the highest safety priority is completed. 
In the area of nuclear operations, Diablo Canyon Unit 21 began its regularly scheduled refueling outage about 2 weeks ago, and the outage is progressing as scheduled. Now although we have not experienced similar issues at Diablo Canyon, we do recognize there is currently a lot of focus on the steam generators at so I'll offer some comments pertaining to our Diablo Canyon plan. As you may recall, we replaced the steam generators and all the associated tubing several years ago. They have since then passed the rigorous 1-year inspection demonstrating very strong performance. In addition, our steam generators are of a different design and were sourced from a different manufacturer. Nonetheless, we continue to monitor them and with the next more detailed inspection of the steam generator tubing scheduled for 2014 and 2015 for the 2 units. Obviously, both and in Diablo Canyon are important resources for California, and we'll continue to monitor findings and apply any lessons learned from Sentinel 3 to Diablo Canyon.
Shifting gears, we recently reached a milestone in our long-term commitment to resolve the chromium exposure in the groundwater at Hinkley. We were supplying residents in the area with bottled water, and we've established a program that offers eligible residents a set of alternatives, including a whole house water replacement system or the choice to sell us their property. Primarily as a result of this program, we took a charge for $71 million for environmental-related costs this quarter. We have not change the overall estimate of costs related to the ultimate resolution of all the chromium-related issues previously provided. Resolving the whole house water issue addresses a significant component of our obligations to the community of Hinkley. The most notable remaining issue, which is the final remediation plan, is expected to be resolved late this year or early next year.
Moving onto overall performance. We continue to focus on our highest priorities of safe, reliable, affordable customer-focused electric and gas service. You'll see our high-level operational performance focus areas described in Exhibit 7 in the Appendix. We place greater emphasis than ever before on safety in operational performance, specifically adopting measures that tie the public safety, employee safety, customer service and financial performance. For each of these measures, we've developed quarterly and annual targets based on improving our performance and ultimately over the years providing first quartile utility service. In some areas, such as nuclear operations, we already meet first quartile benchmarks, and the year end goal is to maintain that level of performance. In other areas, the year end goal is to improve performance by a specified percentage as part of a multiyear plan to provide exceptional levels of service. Our first quarter results show we're exceeding year-to-date performance targets in nuclear operations, gas leak performance and emergency response. We're meeting performance targets in gas reliability, and we need to improve our performance to achieve our targets for employee safety, customer satisfaction, electrical liability and outages caused by downed wires. As 2012 progresses, our goal is to show improvement in each one of these areas. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken."

I'm going to walk you through the results for the first quarter, and then I'll cover our outlook for the rest of 2012. Our Q1 results are summarized on Slide 4 and earnings from operations for the quarter were $",1337,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to walk you through the results for the first quarter, and then I'll cover our outlook for the rest of 2012. Our Q1 results are summarized on Slide 4 and earnings from operations for the quarter were $372 million or $0.89 per diluted common share. GAAP results for the quarter were $233 million or $0.56 per share. The difference between earnings from operations and GAAP reflects the items impacting comparability for natural gas matters and for environmental-related costs at Hinkley. The item related to natural gas matters totaled $0.23 per share for the quarter, and the components of that are delineated at the table at the bottom. First is the pipeline related costs, which totaled $104 million pretax during Q1. So this includes the strength testing and the pipeline validation work, as well as our legal costs incurred during the quarter. And most Of this work was generally on plan for the quarter although legal costs exceeded plan due to an upswing in activity. Below that, you see that there were no additional accruals during the quarter related to potential penalties stemming from the various gas matters and you'll remember in Q4 last year, we incurred $200 million for potential penalties, which represented the low end of the range of possible outcomes. Of course, we'll continue to assess the accrual in future quarters until the issues are resolved. 
The next component is the $70 million pretax charge we took during the quarter for the contribution we made to the safety of San Bruno, and Tony mentioned in his remarks the importance of reaching this agreement with the city.
Next, you can see there also were no additional accruals for the quarter for the third-party liability claims, and to date, we've accrued the total of $375 million for third-party liability related to the accident. And then finally, we booked insurance recoveries of $11 million in Q1 and that brings us to $110 million of insurance recovery since the accident. We'll continue to wait until we resolve claims with each carrier before bookings future recoveries. In the table at the top, you can see that in addition to the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters, we also took a charge for environmental related costs at Hinkley totaling $0.10 per share. This accrual represents the expected costs associated providing the whole house water that Chris described and is in line with our original guidance range of $0.00 to $0.14 for the year. 
Now Slide 5 has the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations and the $0.89 that we earned in the first quarter, which is shown on the far right, represents a $0.31 increase compared to Q1 of 2011. Most of that increase is due to unusual items in the first quarter of last year, rather than activity in the most recent quarter. So for example, in Q1 last year, we were still waiting for final approval of the General Rate Case and the Gas Transmission & Storage case. So $0.14 of this quarter's increase is because we weren't able to book the associated revenues in Q1 last year. As a reminder, because we booked the catch-up revenues in Q2 of last year, you should expect to see a similar item, but in reverse, when we discuss our second quarter results a few months from now.
Next, $0.07 of the increase is due to lower outage restoration costs in comparison to last year when we had an unusually severe winter storm season. And $0.05 cents relates to lower litigation and regulatory costs compared to last year in large part because the prior period included an accrual for the Rancho Cordova accident.
We had a $0.05 increase to the higher authorized rate base investments this year compared to last year. We also picked up $0.02 in gas transmission revenues and $0.07 in miscellaneous. Most of which includes a number of small items that we expect will reverse by the end of the year. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $0.06 related to the planned incremental spending we've undertaken to improve our operational performance and $0.03 dilution for higher shares outstanding. And by the way, you should expect a larger impact from dilution in future quarters, and this is in part because we issued $250 million of equity late in Q1 so it's full effect wasn't felt in the quarter.
Now our guidance for the year is summarized on the next slide, and you can see at the top that there's no change in our guidance range for earnings from operations. That remains at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. Some of the key assumptions that underlie our 2012 guidance, such as authorized rate base, capital expenditure levels, the incremental expenses we expect to incur and our authorized ROE and cap structure, those are all provided in Exhibit 3 in the appendix. The guidance range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters has been updated basically to reflect the accrual made in Q1 for the contribution to the city of San Bruno and the proceeds we received from insurance providers during the quarter. So moving to the bottom part of the slide you can see in the table that we're maintaining the range of $4.50 to $5.50 for pipeline related costs for the year although we are trending towards the upper end of that range and while our fieldwork is generally on track fairly early in the year, our legal costs have risen significantly as the pace and scope of discovery and other activities have picked up more rapidly than we expected. So we'll continue to monitor this trend and we'll provide an update on our next call.
The range for third-party liability claims remains unchanged at zero to $225 million and this range again just reflect the difference between what we've already accrued to date, $375 million, and then the upper end of our estimate for third-party liability, which is $600 million. 
As in past quarter, we're not providing guidance for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued or for future insurance recoveries. Back to the table at the top, you can see our guidance for the item impacting comparability for environmental related costs. The upper end of the range is unchanged at $0.14, the lower end of the range reflects the $71 million pretax charge we took in Q1 associated with the whole house water replacement program.
So I'll finish up with our updated plans for equity issuance in 2012 and that's on Slide 7. On our last call, I indicated based on various guidance assumptions we expected to issue roughly $600 million of equity this year and that estimate is shown on the left. Next to that, you can see that we've increased our expectation for equity issuance this year by about $100 million, so our new estimate is roughly $700 million based on our guidance assumptions. The primary driver for the increase is the contribution we made to the city of San Bruno during the quarter, as well as the trends towards the higher end of the range of our pipeline related costs.
Moving to the right in the chart, you'll see that we actually issued a significant portion of that, almost $400 million, in the first quarter. This includes about $60 million to our internal programs, our direct 401(k), about $80 million through our program and about $250 million through the block equity offering we undertook in March. That allowed us to prefinance some of our equity needs for the year and provides us more flexibility pending resolution of the various gas issues. Our remaining need based on our guidance assumption is roughly $300 million, which is shown on the right. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year will depend on the resolution of the gas matters as well as other factors.
So with that, we're going to open up the lines for questions and then Tony will provide some closing remarks following Q&A."

But particularly, with respect Edison that's more like 58%. It's important that people also recognize that Edison has a lot more preferred stock than we have, and as a result, we end up at the same place from a credit perspective overall, which is really the purpose of having the right balance for your capital structure. And we have looked that we have a capital structure that makes sense and especially given the fact that S&P downgraded us.

On our last earnings call, we outlined our top priorities for 2012. But I like to start today by reviewing these priorities again, because I think they provide a good context for the discussion of our actions and results from the last quarter as well as set the context for our plans for the rest of the year. 
So if you look at Slide 2, our key objectives for the year are, first, we want to resolve as many of the gas-related issues as we can in 2012. Second, we want to position the company for a long-term success. And third, we want to work very hard at rebuilding relationships with stakeholders. 
So let me start with the gas issues. We're continuing to work to the various regulatory and legal proceedings. We'd like to resolve the regulatory proceedings as soon as possible, because the sooner we get clarity on these issues, the better it is for everyone from the utility to regulators to our customers. There's no way to predict whether settlement discussions will go forward or be successful, but we do support this approach as a way to accelerate the process. If and when there's any further news to report on this, we'll share it at the appropriate time. 
On the legal front, we also continue our efforts to settle the various individual claims related to the tragedy in San Bruno. Our goal is to provide victims with fair compensation. Just as with the regulatory issues, we'd like to do that as soon as possible, and we're making progress towards that goal. Separately, we were pleased in this quarter to reach a critical agreement with the city of San Bruno by making a contribution to benefit the citizens of the community. This was an important milestone for us in that it helps the city move forward in the healing process. And it's important for us, because it's another step on the road towards resolution of all of these issues.
Let me shift to the steps we're taking to position the company for long-term success starting with the gas business. We're maintaining the momentum that we established last year with safety improvement efforts in gas operations, and Chris is going to provide you with lots more detail on what's planned for 2012. 
We've also now essentially completed the restructuring of the gas business, which has significantly improved accountability and the expertise in the organization. Recently, several highly experienced gas industry veterans have come onboard, filling our remaining vacancies for vice presidents overseeing key areas in gas operations. By the end of this quarter, we hope to complete the last of our high-level hires and have the team completely in place. We're also continuing to add new talent in other areas of the company. This includes officers with excellent credentials in customer care and information technology, which clearly are areas that where we can benefit from their deep expertise. 
And then most recently, we announced the hiring of Ed Halpin from the South Texas Project as the Senior Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. Ed's full-time presence at Diablo Canyon build even greater depth into an already strong nuclear program that we've got. 
All of these additions to the team give me greater confidence that we're making the changes necessary to achieve a new level of performance and operations in customer service. Everyone on the team is focused on safety compliance and continuous improvement and working to close the gaps between where we are today and where we need to go to deliver outstanding service to our customers.
So last, let me touch on rebuilding relationships. Chris and I and many of our other senior leaders continue to meet as often as possible with customers, policymakers, business partners and others. It's become clear to me from the conversations that we have that our stakeholders do want us to be successful, and broadly speaking, we're getting positive feedback on the direction that we're moving. 
In that vein, a few recent successes are worth noting, because I think they demonstrate we're doing a better job of listening to our customers. So for example, for that segment of customers who do not want to participate in our SmartMeter program, we now have an opt-out alternative. Another example is the economic development rate that we've proposed to the CPUC. In these difficult economic times, this is a way to bring electric rate relief to businesses that need it to preserve or create jobs at our service area. And finally, for our residential customers, we're working to further modify the current multi-tiered rate structure to streamline and simplify it and improve the affordability of our service. 
Rebuilding relationships will be a long-term effort, but these are steps in the right direction, and we'll continue to look for these kinds of opportunities going forward. Ultimately though, we know that the key is for us to continue to deliver what we say we're going to deliver. Importantly, we did that last year when we completed our aggressive hydrostatic testing commitment and our operating pressure validation in our high-consequence gas transmission pipelines. 
So with that introduction, let me turn the mic over to Chris. Chris?"
139813,183978087,295044,"PG&E Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone.

So this morning, I'm going to provide the regulatory and operational updates that are described briefly on Slide 3. Starting with the regulatory side, procedural schedules have now been set for all 3 of the gas investigations with hearing dates scheduled for the fall. The CPUC staff has filed its findings and reports in 2 out of the 3 of those investigations, and they are going to provide the report on the third one at the end of this month. These are all important milestones in each of the cases on our path forward towards resolution. 
In our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, the administrative law judge held 2 weeks of hearings at the end of March. A key issue covered in the testimony of the various parties was the categorization of work proposed in the company's safety plan. We believe that most of the workers needed to comply with the new standards, while other parties argued that much of it should have been done to comply with existing standards. We expect that final resolution will deal with both the scope of the gas work required through 2014 and the allocation of cost between shareholders and customers. We continue to feel our proposal for this split is appropriate. And that is that PG&E shareholders will continue to pay the cost necessary to comply with existing regulations, but work that we undertake to meet new standards set by the CPUC is appropriate to recover from our customers. The final decision in the safety plan is expected in September.
In other regulatory news, on April 20, we filed our cost of capital case as did the other California utilities. And we proposed a reduction in our return on equity to 11%, and that's from our current level of 11.35%. We did not propose any changes to our common equity ratio of 52% nor to the current multiyear adjustment mechanism. That mechanism would continue to link ROE to the performance of the Moody's bond yield impacts. We expect hearings to occur this fall and the proposed and final decisions by the end of the year. The new levels in mechanism would go into affect in January of 2013. 
And finally, this summer, we'll file the notice of intent for our next General Rate Case. We'll provide you details of our expense and capital request at that time. And as a reminder, the GRC addresses electric and gas distribution and electric generation, and it will go into effect in 2014. Our next Gas Transmission & Storage case is a year later.
Now moving over to operations. Obviously, we continue to perform important gas work this year. Building up the extraordinary work completed in 2011, this quarter, the gas team continued to deliver impressive results. Even with the limitations of working on the system during the winter, when gas demand is much higher, we completed several miles of hydrostatic tests in the first quarter, and that's on our way to the planned performance of hydrostatic tests on another 160 miles during the remainder of this year. 
We also made significant progress on our efforts to validate and document the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure of our pipelines. We completed about 900 miles in Q1 out of 3,600 miles planned for the entire year. In addition, as we performed fieldwork and identify emerging issues, we will continue to shift the pipeline work plan to ensure that the work of the -- at the highest safety priority is completed. 
In the area of nuclear operations, Diablo Canyon Unit 1 began its regularly scheduled refueling outage about 2 weeks ago, and the outage is progressing as scheduled. Now although we don't -- we have not experienced similar issues at Diablo Canyon, we do recognize there is currently a lot of focus on the steam generators at San Onofre, so I'll offer some comments pertaining to our Diablo Canyon plan. 
As you may recall, we replaced the steam generators and all the associated tubing several years ago. They have since then passed the rigorous one-year inspection, demonstrating very strong performance. In addition, our steam generators are of a different design and were sourced from a different manufacturer. Nonetheless, we continue to monitor them and with the next more detailed inspection of the steam generator tubing scheduled for 2014 and 2015 for the 2 units. Obviously, both San Onofre and Diablo Canyon are important resources for California, and we'll continue to monitor Edison's findings and apply any lessons learned from San Onofre to Diablo Canyon.
Shifting gears, we recently reached a milestone in our long-term commitment to resolve the chromium exposure in the groundwater at Hinkley. We were supplying residents in the area with bottled water, and we've established a program that offers eligible residents a set of alternatives, including a whole house water replacement system or the choice to sell us their property. Primarily as a result of this program, we took a charge for $71 million for environmental-related cost this quarter. We have not changed the overall estimate of cost related to the ultimate resolution of all the chromium-related issues previously provided. Resolving the whole house water issue addresses a significant component of our obligations to the community of Hinkley. The most notable remaining issue, which is the final remediation plan, is expected to be resolved late this year or early next year.
Moving on to overall performance. We continue to focus on our highest priorities of safe, reliable, affordable, customer-focused electric and gas service. You'll see our high-level operational performance focus areas described in Exhibit 7 in the Appendix. We place greater emphasis than ever before on safety in operational performance, specifically adopting measures that tie to public safety, employee safety, customer service and financial performance. 
For each of these measures, we have developed quarterly and annual targets based on improving our performance and ultimately, over the years, providing first quartile utility service. In some areas, such as nuclear operations, we already meet first quartile benchmarks, and the year-end goal is to maintain that level of performance. In the other areas, the year-end goal is to improve performance by a specified percentage as part of a multiyear plan to provide exceptional levels of service. 
Our first quarter results show we're exceeding year-to-date performance targets in nuclear operations, gas leak performance and emergency response. We're meeting performance targets in gas reliability, and we need to improve our performance to achieve our targets for employee safety, customer satisfaction, electrical liability and the outages caused by downed wires. As 2012 progresses, our goal is to show improvement in each one of these areas. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

I'm going to walk you through the results for the first quarter, and then I'll cover our outlook for the rest of 2012. 
Our Q1 results are summarized on Slide 4, and earnings from operations for the quarter were $372 million or $0.89 per diluted common share. GAAP results for the quarter were $233 million or $0.56 per share. The difference between earnings from operations and GAAP reflects the items impacting comparability for natural gas matters and for environmental-related costs at Hinkley. 
The item related to natural gas matters totaled $0.23 per share for the quarter, and the components of that are delineated in the table at the bottom. First is the pipeline-related costs, which totaled $104 million pretax during Q1. So this includes the strength testing and the pipeline validation work as well as our legal cost incurred during the quarter. And most of this work was generally on plan for the quarter, although legal cost exceeded plan due to an upswing in activity. Below that, you see that there were no additional accruals during the quarter related to potential penalties stemming from the various gas matters, and you'll remember in Q4 of last year, we incurred $200 million for potential penalties, which represented the low end of a range of possible outcomes. Of course, we'll continue to assess the accrual in future quarters until the issues are resolved. 
The next component is the $70 million pretax charge we took during the quarter for the contribution we made to the city of San Bruno, and Tony mentioned in his remarks the importance of reaching this agreement with the city. Next, you can see there also were no additional accruals during the quarter for third-party liability claims, and to date, we've accrued the total of $375 million for third-party liability related to the accident. And then finally, we booked insurance recoveries of $11 million in Q1, and that brings us to $110 million of insurance recovery since the accident. We'll continue to wait until we've resolved claims with each carrier before booking future recoveries. 
In the table at the top, you can see that in addition to the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters, we also took a charge for environmental-related costs at Hinkley totaling $0.10 per share. This accrual represents the expected costs associated providing the whole house water that Chris described, and it's in line with our original guidance range of $0.00 to $0.14 for the year. 
Now Slide 5 has the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations, and the $0.89 that we earned in the first quarter, which is shown on the far right, represents a $0.31 increase compared to Q1 of 2011. Most of that increase is due to unusual items in the first quarter of last year rather than activity in the most recent quarter. So for example, in Q1 last year, we were still waiting for final approval of the General Rate Case and the Gas Transmission & Storage case. So $0.14 of this quarter's increase is because we weren't able to book the associated revenues in Q1 last year. As a reminder, because we booked the catch-up revenues in Q2 of last year, you should expect to see a similar item but in reverse when we discuss our second quarter results a few months from now.
Next, $0.07 of the increase is due to lower outage restoration cost in comparison to last year, when we had an unusually severe winter storm season. And $0.05 cents relates to lower litigation and regulatory cost compared to last year, in large part because the prior period included an accrual for the Rancho Cordova accident.
We had a $0.05 increase due to higher authorized rate base investments this year compared to last year. We also picked up $0.02 in gas transmission revenues and $0.07 in miscellaneous, most of which includes a number of small items that we expect will reverse by the end of the year. 
These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $0.06 related to the planned incremental spending we've undertaken to improve our operational performance and $0.03 dilution for higher shares outstanding. And by the way, you should expect a larger impact from dilution in future quarters. And this is in part because we issued $250 million of equity late in Q1, so it's full effect wasn't felt in the quarter.
Now our guidance for the year is summarized on the next slide, and you can see at the top that there's no change in our guidance range for earnings from operations. That remains at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. Some of the key assumptions that underlie our 2012 guidance, such as authorized rate base, capital expenditure levels, the incremental expenses we expect to incur and our authorized ROE and cap structure, those are all provided in Exhibit 3 in the appendix. The guidance range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters has been updated basically to reflect the accrual made in Q1 for the contribution to the city of San Bruno and the proceeds we received from insurance providers during the quarter. 
So moving to the bottom part of the slide, you can see in the table that we're maintaining the range of $450 million to $550 million for pipeline-related cost for the year, although we are trending towards the upper end of that range. And while our fieldwork is generally on track fairly early in the year, our legal costs have risen significantly as the pace and scope of discovery and other activities have picked up more rapidly than we expected. So we'll continue to monitor this trend, and we'll provide an update on our next call.
The range for third-party liability claims remains unchanged at $0 to $225 million. And this range, again, just reflects the difference between what we've already accrued to date, $375 million and then the upper end of our estimate for third-party liability, which is $600 million. As in past quarters, we're not providing guidance for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued or for future insurance recoveries. 
Back to the table at the top, you can see our guidance for the item impacting comparability for environmental-related costs. The upper end of the range is unchanged at $0.14. The lower end of the range reflects the $71 million pretax charge we took in Q1 associated with the whole house water replacement program.
So I'll finish up with our updated plans for equity issuance in 2012, and that's on Slide 7. On our last call, I indicated based on various guidance assumptions, we expected to issue roughly $600 million of equity this year, and that estimate is shown on the left. Next to that, you can see that we've increased our expectation for equity issuance this year by about $100 million. So our new estimate is roughly $700 million based on our guidance assumptions. The primary driver for the increase is the contribution we made to the city of San Bruno during the quarter as well as the trend towards the higher end of the range of our pipeline-related cost.
Moving to the right in the chart, you'll see that we actually issued a significant portion of that, almost $400 million, in the first quarter. This includes about $60 million to our internal programs, our DRIP and 401(k); about $80 million to our Dribble Program; and then about $250 million through the block equity offering we undertook in March. That allowed us to prefinance some of our equity needs for the year and provides us more flexibility pending resolution of the various gas issues. Our remaining need based on our guidance assumption is roughly $300 million, which is shown on the right. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year will depend on the resolution of the gas matters as well as other factors.
So with that, we're going to open up the lines for your questions, and then Tony will provide some closing remarks following Q&A."

And while simplistically, some of our observers have noted that our common equity ratio was higher than the other utilities -- although frankly, I think Sempra is looking to raise their common equity ratio to look more like ours. But particularly with respect Edison, that's more like 58%. It's important that people also recognize that Edison has a lot more preferred stock than we have. And as a result, we end up at the same place from a credit perspective overall, which is really the purpose of having the right balance for your capital structure. And we have looked at the alternatives of issuing a lot more preferred stock and having less common stock outstanding, and it is essentially equivalent from a cost perspective of our customers, given our credit ratings and our expected cost of issuance.

We encourage you to review those and also to review the discussion of risk factors that appears in our 2011 annual report and in the form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony."

On our last earnings call, we outlined our top priorities for 2012. But I'd like to start today by reviewing these priorities again, because I think they provide a good context for the discussion of our actions and results from the last quarter as well as set the context for our plans for the rest of the year. 
So if you look at Slide 2, our key objectives for the year are, first, we want to resolve as many of the gas-related issues as we can in 2012. Second, we want to position the company for a long-term success. And third, we want to work very hard at rebuilding relationships with stakeholders. 
So let me start with the gas issues. We're continuing to work to the various regulatory and legal proceedings. We'd like to resolve the regulatory proceedings as soon as possible, because the sooner we get clarity on these issues, the better it is for everyone from the utility to regulators to our customers. There's no way to predict whether settlement discussions will go forward or be successful, but we do support this approach as a way to accelerate the process. If and when there's any further news to report on this, we'll share it at the appropriate time. 
On the legal front, we also continue our efforts to settle the various individual claims related to the tragedy in San Bruno. Our goal is to provide victims with fair compensation. Just as with the regulatory issues, we'd like to do that as soon as possible, and we're making progress towards that goal. Separately, we were pleased in this quarter to reach a critical agreement with the city of San Bruno by making a contribution to benefit the citizens of the community. This was an important milestone for us in that it helps the city move forward in the healing process. And it's important for us, because it's another step on the road towards resolution of all of these issues.
Let me shift to the steps we're taking to position the company for long-term success starting with the gas business. We're maintaining the momentum that we established last year with safety improvement efforts in gas operations, and Chris is going to provide you with lots more detail on what's planned for 2012. 
We've also now essentially completed the restructuring of the gas business, which has significantly improved accountability and the expertise in the organization. Recently, several highly experienced gas industry veterans have come onboard, filling our remaining vacancies for vice presidents overseeing key areas in gas operations. By the end of this quarter, we hope to complete the last of our high-level hires and have the team completely in place. We're also continuing to add new talent in other areas of the company. This includes officers with excellent credentials in customer care and information technology, which clearly are areas that where we can benefit from their deep expertise. 
And then most recently, we announced the hiring of Ed Halpin from the South Texas Project as the Senior Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. Ed's full-time presence at Diablo Canyon builds even greater depth into an already strong nuclear program that we've got. 
All of these additions to the team give me greater confidence that we're making the changes necessary to achieve a new level of performance and operations in customer service. Everyone on the team is focused on safety compliance and continuous improvement and working to close the gaps between where we are today and where we need to go to deliver outstanding service to our customers.
So last, let me touch on rebuilding relationships. Chris and I and many of our other senior leaders continue to meet as often as possible with customers, policymakers, business partners and others. It's become clear to me from the conversations that we have that our stakeholders do want us to be successful, and broadly speaking, we're getting positive feedback on the direction that we're moving. 
In that vein, a few recent successes are worth noting, because I think they demonstrate we're doing a better job of listening to our customers. So for example, for that segment of customers who do not want to participate in our SmartMeter program, we now have an opt-out alternative. Another example is the economic development rate that we've proposed to the CPUC. In these difficult economic times, this is a way to bring electric rate relief to businesses that need it to preserve or create jobs at our service area. And finally, for our residential customers, we're working to further modify the current multi-tiered rate structure to streamline and simplify it and improve the affordability of our service. 
Rebuilding relationships will be a long-term effort, but these are steps in the right direction, and we'll continue to look for these kinds of opportunities going forward. Ultimately though, we know that the key is for us to continue to deliver what we say we're going to deliver. Importantly, we did that last year when we completed our aggressive hydrostatic testing commitment and our operating pressure validation in our high-consequence gas transmission pipelines. 
So with that introduction, let me turn the mic over to Chris. Chris?"
139813,183978087,295141,"PG&E Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone.

So this morning, I'm going to provide the regulatory and operational updates that are described briefly on Slide 3. Starting with the regulatory side, procedural schedules have now been set for all 3 of the gas investigations with hearing dates scheduled for the fall. The CPUC staff has filed its findings and reports in 2 out of the 3 of those investigations, and they are going to provide the report on the third one at the end of this month. These are all important milestones in each of the cases on our path forward towards resolution. 
In our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, the administrative law judge held 2 weeks of hearings at the end of March. A key issue covered in the testimony of the various parties was the categorization of work proposed in the company's safety plan. We believe that most of the work is needed to comply with the new standards, while other parties argued that much of it should have been done to comply with existing standards. We expect that final resolution will deal with both the scope of the gas work required through 2014 and the allocation of cost between shareholders and customers. We continue to feel our proposal for this split is appropriate. And that is that PG&E shareholders will continue to pay the cost necessary to comply with existing regulations, but work that we undertake to meet new standards set by the CPUC is appropriate to recover from our customers. The final decision in the safety plan is expected in September.
In other regulatory news, on April 20, we filed our cost of capital case as did the other California utilities. And we proposed a reduction in our return on equity to 11%, and that's from our current level of 11.35%. We did not propose any changes to our common equity ratio of 52% nor to the current multiyear adjustment mechanism. That mechanism would continue to link ROE to the performance of the Moody's bond yield index. We expect hearings to occur this fall and proposed and final decisions by the end of the year. The new levels in mechanism would go into affect in January of 2013. 
And finally, this summer, we'll file the notice of intent for our next General Rate Case. We'll provide you details of our expense and capital requests at that time. And as a reminder, the GRC addresses electric and gas distribution and electric generation, and it will go into effect in 2014. Our next Gas Transmission & Storage case is a year later.
Now moving over to operations. Obviously, we continue to perform important gas work this year. Building up the extraordinary work completed in 2011, this quarter, the gas team continued to deliver impressive results. Even with the limitations of working on the system during the winter, when gas demand is much higher, we completed several miles of hydrostatic tests in the first quarter, and that's on our way to the planned performance of hydrostatic tests on another 160 miles during the remainder of this year. 
We also made significant progress on our efforts to validate and document the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure of our pipelines. We completed about 900 miles in Q1 out of 3,600 miles planned for the entire year. In addition, as we performed fieldwork and identify emerging issues, we will continue to shift the pipeline work plan to ensure that the work of the -- at the highest safety priority is completed. 
In the area of nuclear operations, Diablo Canyon Unit 1 began its regularly scheduled refueling outage about 2 weeks ago, and the outage is progressing as scheduled. Now although we don't -- we have not experienced similar issues at Diablo Canyon, we do recognize there is currently a lot of focus on the steam generators at San Onofre, so I'll offer some comments pertaining to our Diablo Canyon plan. 
As you may recall, we replaced the steam generators and all the associated tubing several years ago. They have since then passed the rigorous one-year inspection, demonstrating very strong performance. In addition, our steam generators are of a different design and were sourced from a different manufacturer. Nonetheless, we continue to monitor them and with the next more detailed inspection of the steam generator tubing scheduled for 2014 and 2015 for the 2 units. Obviously, both San Onofre and Diablo Canyon are important resources for California, and we'll continue to monitor Edison's findings and apply any lessons learned from San Onofre to Diablo Canyon.
Shifting gears, we recently reached a milestone in our long-term commitment to resolve the chromium exposure in the groundwater at Hinkley. We were supplying residents in the area with bottled water, and we've established a program that offers eligible residents a set of alternatives, including a whole house water replacement system or the choice to sell us their property. Primarily as a result of this program, we took a charge for $71 million for environmental-related cost this quarter. We have not changed the overall estimate of cost related to the ultimate resolution of all the chromium-related issues previously provided. Resolving the whole house water issue addresses a significant component of our obligations to the community of Hinkley. The most notable remaining issue, which is the final remediation plan, is expected to be resolved late this year or early next year.
Moving on to overall performance. We continue to focus on our highest priorities of safe, reliable, affordable, customer-focused electric and gas service. You'll see our high-level operational performance focus areas described in Exhibit 7 in the Appendix. We place greater emphasis than ever before on safety in operational performance, specifically adopting measures that tie to public safety, employee safety, customer service and financial performance. 
For each of these measures, we have developed quarterly and annual targets based on improving our performance and ultimately, over the years, providing first quartile utility service. In some areas, such as nuclear operations, we already meet first quartile benchmarks, and the year-end goal is to maintain that level of performance. In other areas, the year-end goal is to improve performance by a specified percentage as part of a multiyear plan to provide exceptional levels of service. 
Our first quarter results show we're exceeding year-to-date performance targets in nuclear operations, gas leak performance and emergency response. We're meeting performance targets in gas reliability, and we need to improve our performance to achieve our targets for employee safety, customer satisfaction, electrical liability and the outages caused by downed wires. As 2012 progresses, our goal is to show improvement in each one of these areas. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

I'm going to walk you through the results for the first quarter, and then I'll cover our outlook for the rest of 2012. Our Q1 results are summarized on Slide 4, and earnings from operations for the quarter wer",1339,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to walk you through the results for the first quarter, and then I'll cover our outlook for the rest of 2012. 
Our Q1 results are summarized on Slide 4, and earnings from operations for the quarter were $372 million or $0.89 per diluted common share. GAAP results for the quarter were $233 million or $0.56 per share. The difference between earnings from operations and GAAP reflects the items impacting comparability for natural gas matters and for environmental-related costs at Hinkley. 
The item related to natural gas matters totaled $0.23 per share for the quarter, and the components of that are delineated in the table at the bottom. First is the pipeline-related costs, which totaled $104 million pretax during Q1. So this includes the strength testing and the pipeline validation work as well as our legal costs incurred during the quarter. And most of this work was generally on plan for the quarter, although legal costs exceeded plan due to an upswing in activity. Below that, you see that there were no additional accruals during the quarter related to potential penalties stemming from the various gas matters. And you remember in Q4 of last year, we accrued $200 million for potential penalties, which represented the low end of a range of possible outcomes. Of course, we'll continue to assess the accrual in future quarters until the issues are resolved. 
The next component is the $70 million pretax charge we took during the quarter for the contribution we made to the city of San Bruno, and Tony mentioned in his remarks the importance of reaching this agreement with the city. Next, you can see there also were no additional accruals during the quarter for third-party liability claims, and to date, we've accrued the total of $375 million for third-party liability related to the accident. And then finally, we booked insurance recoveries of $11 million in Q1, and that brings us to $110 million of insurance recovery since the accident. We'll continue to wait until we've resolved claims with each carrier before booking future recoveries. 
In the table at the top, you can see that in addition to the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters, we also took a charge for environmental-related costs at Hinkley totaling $0.10 per share. This accrual represents the expected costs associated providing the whole house water option that Chris described, and is in line with our original guidance range of 0 to $0.14 for the year. 
Now Slide 5 has the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations, and the $0.89 that we earned in the first quarter, which is shown on the far right, represents a $0.31 increase compared to Q1 of 2011. Most of that increase is due to unusual items in the first quarter of last year rather than activity in the most recent quarter. So for example, in Q1 last year, we were still waiting for final approval of the General Rate Case and the Gas Transmission & Storage case. So $0.14 of this quarter's increase is because we weren't able to book the associated revenues in Q1 last year. As a reminder, because we booked the catch-up revenues in Q2 of last year, you should expect to see a similar item but in reverse when we discuss our second quarter results a few months from now.
Next, $0.07 of the increase is due to lower outage restoration cost in comparison to last year, when we had an unusually severe winter storm season. And $0.05 cents relates to lower litigation and regulatory cost compared to last year, in large part because the prior period included an accrual for the Rancho Cordova accident.
We had a $0.05 increase due to higher authorized rate base investments this year compared to last year. We also picked up $0.02 in gas transmission revenues and $0.07 in miscellaneous, most of which includes a number of small items that we expect will reverse by the end of the year. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $0.06 related to the planned incremental spending we've undertaken to improve our operational performance and $0.03 dilution for higher shares outstanding. And by the way, you should expect a larger impact from dilution in future quarters. And this is in part because we issued $250 million of equity late in Q1, so it's full effect wasn't felt in the quarter.
Now our guidance for the year is summarized on the next slide, and you can see at the top that there's no change in our guidance range for earnings from operations. That remains at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. Some of the key assumptions that underlie our 2012 guidance, such as authorized rate base, capital expenditure levels, the incremental expenses we expect to incur and our authorized ROE and cap structure, those are all provided in Exhibit 3 in the appendix. The guidance range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters has been updated basically to reflect the accrual made in Q1 for the contribution to the city of San Bruno and the proceeds we received from insurance providers during the quarter. 
So moving to the bottom part of the slide, you can see in the table that we're maintaining the range of $450 million to $550 million for pipeline-related cost for the year, although we are trending towards the upper end of that range. And while our fieldwork is generally on track fairly early in the year, our legal costs have risen significantly as the pace and scope of discovery and other activities have picked up more rapidly than we expected. So we'll continue to monitor this trend, and we'll provide an update on our next call.
The range for third-party liability claims remains unchanged at 0 to $225 million. And this range, again, just reflects the difference between what we've already accrued to date, $375 million and then the upper end of our estimate for third-party liability, which is $600 million. As in past quarters, we're not providing guidance for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued or for future insurance recoveries. 
Back to the table at the top, you can see our guidance for the item impacting comparability for environmental-related costs. The upper end of the range is unchanged at $0.14. The lower end of the range reflects the $71 million pretax charge we took in Q1 associated with the whole house water replacement program.
So I'll finish up with our updated plans for equity issuance in 2012, and that's on Slide 7. On our last call, I indicated based on various guidance assumptions, we expected to issue roughly $600 million of equity this year, and that estimate is shown on the left. Next to that, you can see that we've increased our expectation for equity issuance this year by about $100 million. So our new estimate is roughly $700 million based on our guidance assumptions. The primary driver for the increase is the contribution we made to the city of San Bruno during the quarter as well as the trend towards the higher end of the range of our pipeline-related cost.
Moving to the right in the chart, you'll see that we actually issued a significant portion of that, almost $400 million, in the first quarter. This includes about $60 million to our internal programs, our DRIP and 401(k); about $80 million to our Dribble Program; and then about $250 million through the block equity offering we undertook in March. That allowed us to prefinance some of our equity needs for the year and provides us more flexibility pending resolution of the various gas issues. Our remaining need based on our guidance assumption is roughly $300 million, which is shown on the right. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year will depend on the resolution of the gas matters as well as other factors.
So with that, we're going to open up the lines for your questions, and then Tony will provide some closing remarks following Q&A."

I’m going to provide some opening remarks, and then I’ll turn it over to Chris and Kent to cover operations and financials in more detail.
On slide 2, you see the three key objectives that we have been talking about this year. I’ll speak to the first, resolving gas issues. We’ve been in settlement discussions regarding the regulatory proceedings. These are multiple proceedings, they are multiple parties, and they are complex issues. And beyond that, given where we are in the discussions, I just don’t think it’s helpful to go into any more detail about where we are. But I will say that if and when we have news to share, we will in fact share that at the appropriate time. We continue to believe that resolving the regulatory issues sooner rather than later would be beneficial for PG&E, our regulators, and our customers. So we will continue to push forward on that.
I do want to comment on third party liability, our civil cases. We’re making lots of progress in resolving these claims. We’ve settled several more of the most serious cases, and our intent continues to be that we provide victims with fair compensation and doing that as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, we continue to make good progress on our work in the field. As we’ve done this and as we’ve added new experienced leaders, we’ve identified some new work that we need to accomplish, and given all that we’re currently doing, it’s probably going to take several years to finish this new work as well. And Chris is going to describe that in more detail shortly. And as I’ve indicated in the past, there’s no quick fix, but we’re going to do whatever it takes to meet the commitments we’ve made related to system safety.
With respect to our second objective for the year, positioning the company for long-term success, last month we filed our 2014 General Rate Case Notice of Intent and it reflects the important work we should be doing over the next several years. So we’ll spend some time discussing that in this call as well.
We’ve also introduced a new planning process. It’s one that I’ve used in the past to more effectively manage the business. This process focuses first on developing a long-term strategy and identifying the critical objectives that we want to accomplish. Once the team has clear alignment on this, we develop tactical plans and budgets that then can be implemented on a company-wide basis. I think this is a process that will keep us focused on our key objectives and ultimately help us deliver results for many years to come.
Finally, shifting to our third objective, rebuilding relationships, we’ve seen a slight uptick in customer satisfaction, but I think it’s a little too soon to predict that that is a consistent trend. In the last month, we launched a major new customer outreach campaign. This effort combines advertising, social media, online information, community outreach, and a variety of other elements. It will feature our own employees and provide concrete examples of the work we’re doing to improve safety and reliability, and we anticipate that this is going to be a multiyear educational effort as we continue to work on our system.
Our research had told us that our customers really like the work that our employees are doing and they respect them, but they do want to know what specifically that the company is doing to make our system safer. This multichannel communications campaign will underscore the message that this is a new PG&E that’s serious about making improvements. And ultimately, we believe that this educational campaign is an investment in our relationship with our customers and our communities and part of the recovery plan that’s essential to our long-term success.
So we’re focused on these key objectives - resolving our gas issues in the near term, positioning the company for success, and rebuilding the relationships, and I believe we’re making good progress. It’s going to take some time, but the long-term prospects for the company are positive.
So with that, let me turn it over to Chris to discuss our operations in more detail.

I’m going to provide the regulatory and then the operational updates that are summarized on slide 3. I’ll start with our General Rate Case Notice of Intent filing, which covers the gas and electric distribution and electric generation parts of the business. You’ll recall that the gas transmission and electric transmission are handled in other proceedings.
The key themes in the general rate case filing are investing in our infrastructure and leveraging technology in order to improve operations and achieve significant gains in safety and reliability performance. The 2014 proposed revenue increase of $1.25 billion represents the funding necessary to cover operating expenses and provide for the annual costs associated with roughly $4 billion of infrastructure improvements. The capital expenditures in the general rate case should represent roughly two-thirds of the company’s total CapEx in 2014. The biggest percentage increase in the GRC filing is in the gas distribution area where we would be replacing a substantially greater number of older gas distribution lines than in the past, improving the technology we use to detect gas leaks, and significantly upgrading asset management capabilities.
For electric distribution, we’ll be replacing more overhead electric lines based on their operating performance and installing more automation to limit the impact and duration of outages. The next step in the process is a full review of the filing by the Division of Ratepayer Advocates, followed ultimately by the filing of our formal application before the end of the year.
Turning to the operations side, as you can see on this slide and the Appendix, we’re on track for many of our high-level operational performance metrics. We’ve also made substantial progress this quarter on several of our key initiatives. We validated and documented the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure, or the MAOP, of over 1,300 miles of our gas transmission pipe in the second quarter, and that brings our year-to-date total to almost 2,000 miles out of the 3,400 miles planned for this year. We’ve completed 41 miles of hydrostatic tests during this quarter and remain on track to test 160 miles during the year. And we’ve installed 24 new automated safety valves on our gas transmission system and plan to have 46 by year end. We’ve also been doing some follow-up field work on class location and related issues, and this is where we’ve identified the additional work that Tony referred to earlier.
Specifically, we’ve found vegetation and structures that are encroaching on our rights of way over our transmission pipelines. As a result, we’ll be conducting a comprehensive survey of the entire gas transmission system to identify all of the encroachments, assess the cost and scope of the work, and begin taking action.
We’ve also identified additional integrity management work that’s necessary, and this includes completing more internal pipeline assessments and other types of inspections to confirm the quality of our pipelines. Now, most of this work will ramp up next year, and we expect that addressing these issues may take several years to complete.
Next, you’ll recall that we identified roughly $200 million in incremental work that we decided to undertake across the utility this year and next. To date, we’ve made solid progress in carrying out that work. In the electric operations, we’ve increased maintenance and repair work on both our overhead lines and underground cables and structures. We’ve also increased our patrolling of poles by tens of thousands of units, and have taken appropriate corrective maintenance actions to reduce fire risk and improve safety.
On the gas side, we’ve completed more repairs to lower grade distribution leaks as we’ve shortened our recheck intervals and have performed more maintenance work on our gas distribution lines. In putting together our 2014 General Rate Case filing, we’ve identified some additional work, mainly in the gas distribution area, that we expect to undertake going forward. It includes a higher volume of gas meter and service work, as well as some mark and locate work. Consistent with our commitment to safety and compliance, we’re not going to be able to wait until 2014 to begin some of this work. This will result in an increase in the annual incremental spend from about $200 million to about $250 million. However, there are some other areas, like the light storm season we experienced earlier this year, that create headroom for us to maintain our 2012 guidance for earnings from operations. Finally, I know a number of you have an interest in our progress on the Diablo Canyon seismic studies. There are a couple of authorizations that are pending to allow us to conduct the offshore seismic mapping. We’re hopeful that we’ll receive these authorizations in the next few months to allow us to complete the work by the end of this year.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Kent.

As usual, I’m going to go through the results for the second quarter and discuss our outlook for the rest of 2012. I also plan to provide some observations about post-2012.
I’m going to start on slide 4, which summarizes our results for the quarter. Earnings from operations were $0.81 per diluted common share, while GAAP results were $0.55 per share. The difference between the two is the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters which totaled $0.26 for the quarter. The components of that are broken out in the table at the bottom in pre-tax dollars. The pipeline-related costs totaled $128 million during the quarter, and include the pipeline validation and strength testing work in the field as well as our legal costs. In general, the field work has been on plan, although we continue to experience higher than planned legal costs.
We also took an $80 million accrual during the quarter for third-party liabilities, and this reflects the results of the recent settlements reached which Tony discussed, as well as the latest information that we have about the remaining claims. It brings our total accrual for third-party liability claims since the accident to $455 million. The upper end of our estimate for third-party liability remains at $600 million. Finally, we booked insurance recoveries of $25 million for the quarter, bringing us to $135 million of insurance recovery booked since the accident.
We continue to believe that a significant portion of the cost incurred for third party claims will be recovered through insurance, but we’ll wait until we’ve resolved claims with each carrier before booking future recoveries.
Moving to slide 5, you can see the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations including the primary factors that take us from $1.02 in Q2 last year to $0.81 in Q2 this year. First off, results for the period last year reflected two quarters of incremental revenues due to approval of the 2011 General Rate Case and Gas Transmission and Storage Case which were both retroactive to January 1. So there’s a $0.13 adjustment to normalize the timing of those decisions last year.
There was also a $0.09 reduction due to our planned incremental spending this year to improve our operational performance across the utility. And then finally, share dilution accounted for a $0.06 reduction, and this reflects the share issuance during the quarter as well as the full effect of our equity offering completed late in Q1.
Those items were partially offset by a $0.05 increase due to higher authorized rate base investments this year compared to last year, and then we had another $0.02 positive due to other smaller items.
Slide 6 summarizes our 2012 guidance. The guidance range for earnings from operations remains at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. The range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters has been updated to reflect the accrual this quarter, the third party liability, and our insurance recovery.
In the table at the bottom, you can see the ranges for each component of the natural gas matters in pre-tax dollars. The range for pipeline-related costs is unchanged at $450 million to $550 million for the year. However, we continue to trend towards the upper end of that range primarily due to legal costs, so we’re continuing to watch this one. The range for third-party liability claims is now $80 million to $225 million. The lower end reflects the accrual taken in the quarter and the upper end is unchanged.
For insurance recoveries, you see the $36 million we booked during the first and second quarter. As in the past, we’re not providing guidance for future insurance recoveries or for additional penalties beyond what we’ve already accrued.
In terms of equity issuance, we continue to expect to need roughly $700 million this year based on our guidance assumptions. Through the end of the second quarter, our total issuance was $572 million, so we’re well along with our plans. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year will depend on a variety of things, most significantly, of course, developments related to the gas matters.
At this point, I thought I’d also provide some observations to help you think about our profile beyond 2012. Clearly, 2013 looks to be a down year for earnings from operations, primarily due to year-over-year dilution and some reduction in our authorized ROE. And of course, 2014 is going to be a key year for us since that’s the start of our next General Rate Case period.
As I go through this, I expect that you’ll have some questions for which you’ll want quantitative answers. However, much of what I’m going to say will be more directional, more qualitative than quantitative. We certainly want to be transparent with you all, but we won’t be in a position to provide guidance for future years until at least we have more visibility around the outcome of our gas issues. In the meantime, this somewhat qualitative approach seemed to be the best option.
I’m going to start on slide 7, and there you can see that we’ve listed some factors for you to consider in thinking about our future year earnings from operations.
In terms of capital expenditures, this year we expect to be approaching $4.8 billion. In 2013, we should be at or above that level since we have important investments planned throughout our business. As an aside, if bonus depreciation is not extended next year, that would cause us to be somewhat above our authorized rate base in 2013 and we’d intend to true that up in the 2014 General Rate Case. For capital expenditures in 2014, we’ve proposed a higher level in the next General Rate Case.
In terms of our authorized rate base which we earn on, we expect it could increase from around $24.5 billion this year to about $26 billion in 2013 based on our last General Rate Case and other proceedings, including the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan request, which obviously hasn’t been decided yet. Our authorized rate base for 2014 will be reset in the upcoming General Rate Case as well as other proceedings. Because we intend to true up historic rate base in the General Rate Case, we’d expect a more significant increase in authorized rate base in 2014, maybe in the 10% range or so, based on our General Rate Case and our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan request. But we’d expect rate base growth after that to return to more normal levels during attrition years.
Our authorized ROE and equity ratio for 2013 will obviously be set in the Cost of Capital proceeding which is now underway. We’ve proposed a reduction in ROE from 11.35% to 11% next year, and we’ve proposed maintaining our common equity ratio at 52%. In addition to deciding those levels, the PUC is also going to consider a mechanism for adjusting ROE in 2014 and beyond, but we don’t expect them to address that until the early part of next year.
Next is the incremental spend. As Chris discussed, we expect it to total about $250 million across the utility this year and to continue next year. As you know, these costs are not currently reflected in our rates. However, we will be seeking cost recovery in our General Rate Case starting in 2014.
Next is earnings on CWIP, or construction work in progress. You’ll remember that we accrue AFUDC on CWIP, and our 2012 guidance assumes that about half of that is offset by below-the-line costs that are not recovered from customers, and those are things like charitable contributions, advertising, public affairs work, and so forth. Of course, that reflects the minimal advertising we’ve done the last few years. And given the recovery plan that Tony talked about, including the customer outreach campaign, we expect that we will have higher below-the-line costs which will largely offset our CWIP earnings in the future. So you’ll want to keep that in mind.
Finally, we’ve seen significant equity issuance this year, much of which has been driven by unrecovered gas pipeline costs. You’ll see our equity need estimate of roughly $700 million for 2012. Our equity issuance beyond this year is expected to continue to be significantly higher than would be satisfied by our internal programs, our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plan. Some of the key drivers for this are capital expenditure levels, year-over-year differences in our cash flows, the potential expiration of bonus depreciation which I mentioned, our planned incremental spend across the utility, and then the level of future gas pipeline costs.
So let’s go to slide 8 now, and here we’ve shown some factors to consider in estimating future unrecovered pipeline-related costs. Let’s start with 2012. At the top, you can see our current guidance for unrecovered pipeline-related costs of $450 million to $550 million. That includes the four components you see listed - the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan expenses, which we’ve been seeking recovery of, for which a final decision isn’t expected until late in the year, the pipeline costs that we’re not seeking recovery of, such as work on post-1960’s pipe, and then other work that’s been identified since the PSEP filing last summer, and then legal and other costs.
In 2013 and 2014, the PSEP expenses we are seeking recovery of are shown as to be determined, pending a decision by the PUC. And of course, you can go back to our PSEP filing from last summer to see our original request over this timeframe. The PSEP costs we are not requesting recovery of will continue in 2013 and 2014, but the level of expenditure is expected to decline after this year. That’s why we show it as lower.
Other work refers to the pipeline rights of way and integrity management work that Chris discussed, which we’re in the process of scoping out. We do expect it to ramp-up next year, and it takes several years to complete. So we show it as higher next year.
Finally, we expect our legal costs to decline significantly after this year, so we show it as lower in both years. Obviously, that profile will depend on how quickly the various proceedings are concluded.
Down below, you see the other components of our item impacting comparability for our natural gas matters - penalties, third-party liabilities, and insurance recoveries, along with some commentary there. In particular, I think we’ve made good progress in resolving a number of significant third-party claims, and we hope to be able to resolve many of the remaining claims in a timely manner. I’d expect the timing of insurance recovery to generally follow from that, but it’s hard to predict exactly when that will occur.
So, that’s an overview of some of the major factors likely to affect our earnings from operations and our unrecovered natural gas costs going forward. I know it’s a lot to digest, but I do hope my comments are helpful to you in keeping track of the various pieces that will likely influence our results over the next few years. Tony?

We’re focused on resolving our outstanding issues and running the business well so we can be successful in the long run.

I’m going to provide some opening remarks, and then I’ll turn it over to Chris and Kent to cover operations and financials in more detail.On Slide 2, you see the 3 key objectives that we have",705,"Well good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. I’m going to provide some opening remarks, and then I’ll turn it over to Chris and Kent to cover operations and financials in more detail.
On Slide 2, you see the 3 key objectives that we have been talking about this year. I’ll speak to the first, resolving gas issues. We’ve been in settlement discussions regarding the regulatory proceedings. These are multiple proceedings, they are multiple parties, and they are complex issues. And beyond that, given where we are in the discussions, I just don’t think it’s helpful to go into any more detail about where we are. But I will say that if and when we have news to share, we will in fact share that at the appropriate time. We continue to believe that resolving the regulatory issues sooner rather than later would be beneficial for PG&E, our regulators and our customers. So we will continue to push forward on that.
I do want to comment on third party liability, our civil cases. We’re making lots of progress in resolving these claims. We’ve settled several more of the most serious cases, and our intent continues to be that we provide victims with fair compensation and doing that as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, we continue to make good progress on our work in the field. As we’ve done this and as we’ve added new experienced leaders, we’ve identified some new work that we need to accomplish, and given all that we’re currently doing, it’s probably going to take several years to finish this new work as well. And Chris is going to describe that in more detail shortly. And as I’ve indicated in the past, there’s no quick fix, but we’re going to do whatever it takes to meet the commitments we’ve made related to system safety.
With respect to our second objective for the year, positioning the company for long-term success, last month we filed our 2014 General Rate Case Notice of Intent and it reflects the important work we should be doing over the next several years. So we’ll spend some time discussing that in this call as well.
We’ve also introduced a new planning process. It’s one that I’ve used in the past to more effectively manage the business. This process focuses first on developing a long-term strategy and identifying the critical objectives that we want to accomplish. Once the team has clear alignment on this, we develop tactical plans and budgets that then can be implemented on a company-wide basis. I think this is a process that will keep us focused on our key objectives and ultimately help us deliver results for many years to come.
Finally, shifting to our third objective, rebuilding relationships, we’ve seen a slight uptick in customer satisfaction, but I think it’s a little too soon to predict that, that is a consistent trend. In the last month, we launched a major new customer outreach campaign. This effort combines advertising, social media, online information, community outreach and a variety of other elements. It will feature our own employees and provide concrete examples of the work we’re doing to improve safety and reliability, and we anticipate that this is going to be a multiyear educational effort as we continue to work on our system.
Our research had told us that our customers really like the work that our employees are doing and they respect them, but they do want to know what, specifically, that the company is doing to make our system safer. This multichannel communications campaign will underscore the message that this is a new PG&E that’s serious about making improvements. And ultimately, we believe that this educational campaign is an investment in our relationship with our customers and our communities and part of the recovery plan that’s essential to our long-term success.
So we’re focused on these key objectives: resolving our gas issues in the near term, positioning the company for success and rebuilding the relationships, and I believe we’re making good progress. It’s going to take some time, but the long-term prospects for the company are positive.
So with that, let me turn it over to Chris to discuss our operations in more detail."

I’m going to provide the regulatory and then the operational updates that are summarized on Slide 3. I’ll start with our General Rate Case Notice of Intent filing, which covers the gas and electric distribution and electric generation parts of the business. You’ll recall that the gas transmission and electric transmission are handled in other proceedings.
The key themes in the general rate case filing are investing in our infrastructure and leveraging technology in order to improve operations and achieve significant gains in safety and reliability performance. The 2014 proposed revenue increase of $1.25 billion represents the funding necessary to cover operating expenses and provide for the annual costs associated with roughly $4 billion of infrastructure improvements. The capital expenditures in the general rate case should represent roughly 2/3 of the company’s total CapEx in 2014. The biggest percentage increase in the GRC filing is in the gas distribution area where we would be replacing a substantially greater number of older gas distribution lines than in the past, improving the technology we use to detect gas leaks and significantly upgrading asset management capabilities.
For electric distribution, we’ll be replacing more overhead electric lines based on their operating performance and installing more automation to limit the impact and duration of outages. The next step in the process is a full review of the filing by the Division of Ratepayer Advocates, followed ultimately by the filing of our formal application before the end of the year.
Turning to the operations side, as you can see on this slide and the Appendix, we’re on track for many of our high-level operational performance metrics. We’ve also made substantial progress this quarter on several of our key initiatives. We validated and documented the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure, or the MAOP, of over 1,300 miles of our gas transmission pipe in the second quarter, and that brings our year-to-date total to almost 2,000 miles out of the 3,400 miles planned for this year. We’ve completed 41 miles of hydrostatic tests during this quarter and remain on track to test 160 miles during the year. And we’ve installed 24 new automated safety valves on our gas transmission system and plan to have 46 by year end. We’ve also been doing some follow-up field work on class location and related issues, and this is where we’ve identified the additional work that Tony referred to earlier.
Specifically, we’ve found vegetation and structures that are encroaching on our rights of way over our transmission pipelines. As a result, we’ll be conducting a comprehensive survey of the entire gas transmission system to identify all of the encroachments, assess the cost and scope of the work and begin taking action.
We’ve also identified additional integrity management work that’s necessary, and this includes completing more internal pipeline assessments and other types of inspections to confirm the quality of our pipelines. Now most of this work will ramp up next year, and we expect that addressing these issues may take several years to complete.
Next, you’ll recall that we identified roughly $200 million in incremental work that we decided to undertake across the utility this year and next. To date, we’ve made solid progress in carrying out that work. In the electric operations, we’ve increased maintenance and repair work on both our overhead lines and underground cables and structures. We’ve also increased our patrolling of poles by tens of thousands of units, and have taken appropriate corrective maintenance actions to reduce fire risk and improve safety.
On the gas side, we’ve completed more repairs to lower grade distribution leaks as we’ve shortened our recheck intervals and have performed more maintenance work on our gas distribution lines. In putting together our 2014 General Rate Case filing, we’ve identified some additional work, mainly in the gas distribution area, that we expect to undertake going forward. It includes a higher volume of gas meter and service work, as well as some mark and locate work. Consistent with our commitment to safety and compliance, we’re not going to be able to wait until 2014 to begin some of this work. This will result in an increase in the annual incremental spend from about $200 million to about $250 million. However, there are some other areas, like the light storm season we experienced earlier this year, that create headroom for us to maintain our 2012 guidance for earnings from operations. Finally, I know a number of you have an interest in our progress on the Diablo Canyon seismic studies. There are a couple of authorizations that are pending to allow us to conduct the offshore seismic mapping. We’re hopeful that we’ll receive these authorizations in the next few months to allow us to complete the work by the end of this year.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Kent."

As usual, I’m going to go through the results for the second quarter and discuss our outlook for the rest of 2012. I also plan to provide some observations about post-2012.
I’m going to start on Slide 4, which summarizes our results for the quarter. Earnings from operations were $0.81 per diluted common share, while GAAP results were $0.55 per share. The difference between the two is the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters, which totaled $0.26 for the quarter. The components of that are broken out in the table at the bottom in pre-tax dollars. The pipeline-related costs totaled $128 million during the quarter and include the pipeline validation and strength testing work in the field, as well as our legal costs. In general, the field work has been on plan, although we continue to experience higher than planned legal costs.
We also took an $80 million accrual during the quarter for third-party liabilities and this reflects the results of the recent settlements reached, which Tony discussed, as well as the latest information that we have about the remaining claims. It brings our total accrual for third-party liability claims since the accident to $455 million. The upper end of our estimate for third-party liability remains at $600 million. Finally, we booked insurance recoveries of $25 million for the quarter, bringing us to $135 million of insurance recovery booked since the accident.
We continue to believe that a significant portion of the cost incurred for third party claims will be recovered through insurance, but we’ll wait until we’ve resolved claims with each carrier before booking future recoveries.
Moving to Slide 5, you can see the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations, including the primary factors that take us from $1.02 in Q2 last year to $0.81 in Q2 this year. First off, results for the period last year reflected two quarters of incremental revenues due to approval of the 2011 General Rate Case and Gas Transmission and Storage Case, which were both retroactive to January 1. So there’s a $0.13 adjustment to normalize the timing of those decisions last year.
There was also a $0.09 reduction due to our planned incremental spending this year to improve our operational performance across the utility. And then finally, share dilution accounted for a $0.06 reduction, and this reflects the share issuance during the quarter as well as the full effect of our equity offering completed late in Q1.
Those items were partially offset by a $0.05 increase due to higher authorized rate base investments this year compared to last year, and then we had another $0.02 positive due to other smaller items.
Slide 6 summarizes our 2012 guidance. The guidance range for earnings from operations remains at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. The range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters has been updated to reflect the accrual this quarter, the third party liability and our insurance recovery.
In the table at the bottom, you can see the ranges for each component of the natural gas matters in pre-tax dollars. The range for pipeline-related costs is unchanged at $450 million to $550 million for the year. However, we continue to trend towards the upper end of that range, primarily due to legal costs, so we’re continuing to watch this one. The range for third-party liability claims is now $80 million to $225 million. The lower end reflects the accrual taken in the quarter and the upper end is unchanged.
For insurance recoveries, you see the $36 million we booked during the first and second quarter. As in the past, we’re not providing guidance for future insurance recoveries or for additional penalties beyond what we’ve already accrued.
In terms of equity issuance, we continue to expect to need roughly $700 million this year based on our guidance assumptions. Through the end of the second quarter, our total issuance was $572 million, so we’re well along with our plans. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year will depend on a variety of things, most significantly, of course, developments related to the gas matters.
At this point, I thought I’d also provide some observations to help you think about our profile beyond 2012. Clearly, 2013 looks to be a down year for earnings from operations, primarily due to year-over-year dilution and some reduction in our authorized ROE. And of course, 2014 is going to be a key year for us since that’s the start of our next General Rate Case period.
As I go through this, I expect that you’ll have some questions for which you’ll want quantitative answers. However, much of what I’m going to say will be more directional, more qualitative than quantitative. We certainly want to be transparent with you all, but we won’t be in a position to provide guidance for future years until at least we have more visibility around the outcome of our gas issues. In the meantime, this somewhat qualitative approach seemed to be the best option.
I’m going to start on Slide 7, and there you can see that we’ve listed some factors for you to consider in thinking about our future year earnings from operations.
In terms of capital expenditures, this year we expect to be approaching $4.8 billion. In 2013, we should be at or above that level since we have important investments planned throughout our business. As an aside, if bonus depreciation is not extended next year, that would cause us to be somewhat above our authorized rate base in 2013 and we’d intend to true that up in the 2014 General Rate Case. For capital expenditures in 2014, we’ve proposed a higher level in the next General Rate Case.
In terms of our authorized rate base, which we earn on, we expect it could increase from around $24.5 billion this year to about $26 billion in 2013, based on our last General Rate Case and other proceedings, including the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan request, which obviously hasn’t been decided yet. Our authorized rate base for 2014 will be reset in the upcoming General Rate Case as well as other proceedings. Because we intend to true up historic rate base in the General Rate Case, we’d expect a more significant increase in authorized rate base in 2014, maybe in the 10% range or so, based on our General Rate Case and our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan request. But we’d expect rate base growth after that to return to more normal levels during attrition years.
Our authorized ROE and equity ratio for 2013 will obviously be set in the Cost of Capital proceeding, which is now underway. We’ve proposed a reduction in ROE from 11.35% to 11% next year, and we’ve proposed maintaining our common equity ratio at 52%. In addition to deciding those levels, the PUC is also going to consider a mechanism for adjusting ROE in 2014 and beyond, but we don’t expect them to address that until the early part of next year.
Next is the incremental spend. As Chris discussed, we expect it to total about $250 million across the utility this year and to continue next year. As you know, these costs are not currently reflected in our rates. However, we will be seeking cost recovery in our General Rate Case starting in 2014.
Next is earnings on CWIP, or construction work in progress. You’ll remember that we accrue AFUDC on CWIP, and our 2012 guidance assumes that about half of that is offset by below-the-line costs that are not recovered from customers, and those are things like charitable contributions, advertising, public affairs work and so forth. Of course, that reflects the minimal advertising we’ve done the last few years. And given the recovery plan that Tony talked about, including the customer outreach campaign, we expect that we will have higher below-the-line costs, which will largely offset our CWIP earnings in the future. So you’ll want to keep that in mind.
Finally, we’ve seen significant equity issuance this year, much of which has been driven by unrecovered gas pipeline costs. You’ll see our equity need estimate of roughly $700 million for 2012. Our equity issuance beyond this year is expected to continue to be significantly higher than would be satisfied by our internal programs, our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plan. Some of the key drivers for this are capital expenditure levels, year-over-year differences in our cash flows, the potential expiration of bonus depreciation, which I mentioned, our planned incremental spend across the utility and then the level of future gas pipeline costs.
So let’s go to Slide 8 now, and here we’ve shown some factors to consider in estimating future unrecovered pipeline-related costs. Let’s start with 2012. At the top, you can see our current guidance for unrecovered pipeline-related costs of $450 million to $550 million. That includes the 4 components you see listed: the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan expenses, which we’ve been seeking recovery of, for which a final decision isn’t expected until late in the year; the pipeline costs that we’re not seeking recovery of, such as work on post-1960’s pipe; and then other work that’s been identified since the PSEP filing last summer; and then legal and other costs.
In 2013 and 2014, the PSEP expenses we are seeking recovery of are shown as to be determined, pending a decision by the PUC. And of course, you can go back to our PSEP filing from last summer to see our original request over this timeframe. The PSEP costs we are not requesting recovery of will continue in 2013 and 2014, but the level of expenditure is expected to decline after this year. That’s why we show it as lower.
Other work refers to the pipeline rights of way and integrity management work that Chris discussed, which we’re in the process of scoping out. We do expect it to ramp-up next year, and it takes several years to complete. So we show it as higher next year.
Finally, we expect our legal costs to decline significantly after this year, so we show it as lower in both years. Obviously, that profile will depend on how quickly the various proceedings are concluded.
Down below, you see the other components of our item impacting comparability for our natural gas matters: penalties, third-party liabilities, and insurance recoveries, along with some commentary there. In particular, I think we’ve made good progress in resolving a number of significant third-party claims, and we hope to be able to resolve many of the remaining claims in a timely manner. I’d expect the timing of insurance recovery to generally follow from that, but it’s hard to predict exactly when that will occur.
So that’s an overview of some of the major factors likely to affect our earnings from operations and our unrecovered natural gas costs going forward. I know it’s a lot to digest, but I do hope my comments are helpful to you in keeping track of the various pieces that will likely influence our results over the next few years. Tony?"

I’m going to provide some opening remarks, and then I’ll turn it over to Chris and Kent to cover operations and financials in more detail.
On Slide 2, you see the 3 key objectives that we have been talking about this year. I’ll speak to the first, resolving gas issues. We’ve been in settlement discussions regarding the regulatory proceedings. These are multiple proceedings, they are multiple parties, and they are complex issues. And beyond that, given where we are in the discussions, I just don’t think it’s helpful to go into any more detail about where we are. But I will say that if and when we have news to share, we will in fact share that at the appropriate time. We continue to believe that resolving the regulatory issues sooner rather than later would be beneficial for PG&E, our regulators and our customers. So we will continue to push forward on that.
I do want to comment on third party liability, our civil cases. We’re making lots of progress in resolving these claims. We’ve settled several more of the most serious cases, and our intent continues to be that we provide victims with fair compensation and doing that as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, we continue to make good progress on our work in the field. As we’ve done this and as we’ve added new experienced leaders, we’ve identified some new work that we need to accomplish, and given all that we’re currently doing, it’s probably going to take several years to finish this new work as well. And Chris is going to describe that in more detail shortly. And as I’ve indicated in the past, there’s no quick fix, but we’re going to do whatever it takes to meet the commitments we’ve made related to system safety.
With respect to our second objective for the year, positioning the company for long-term success, last month we filed our 2014 General Rate Case Notice of Intent and it reflects the important work we should be doing over the next several years. So we’ll spend some time discussing that in this call as well.
We’ve also introduced a new planning process. It’s one that I’ve used in the past to more effectively manage the business. This process focuses first on developing a long-term strategy and identifying the critical objectives that we want to accomplish. Once the team has clear alignment on this, we develop tactical plans and budgets that then can be implemented on a company-wide basis. I think this is a process that will keep us focused on our key objectives and ultimately help us deliver results for many years to come.
Finally, shifting to our third objective, rebuilding relationships, we’ve seen a slight uptick in customer satisfaction, but I think it’s a little too soon to predict that, that is a consistent trend. In the last month, we launched a major new customer outreach campaign. This effort combines advertising, social media, online information, community outreach and a variety of other elements. It will feature our own employees and provide concrete examples of the work we’re doing to improve safety and reliability, and we anticipate that this is going to be a multiyear educational effort as we continue to work on our system.
Our research had told us that our customers really like the work that our employees are doing and they respect them, but they do want to know what, specifically, that the company is doing to make our system safer. This multichannel communications campaign will underscore the message that this is a new PG&E that’s serious about making improvements. And ultimately, we believe that this educational campaign is an investment in our relationship with our customers and our communities and part of the recovery plan that’s essential to our long-term success.
So we’re focused on these key objectives: resolving our gas issues in the near term, positioning the company for success and rebuilding the relationships, and I believe we’re making good progress. It’s going to take some time, but the long-term prospects for the company are positive.
So with that, let me turn it over to Chris to discuss our operations in more detail."

I’m going to provide the regulatory and then the operational updates that are summarized on Slide 3.

I’m going to provide the regulatory and then the operational updates that are summarized on Slide 3. I’ll start with our General Rate Case Notice of Intent filing, which covers the gas and electric distribution and electric generation parts of the business. You’ll recall that the gas transmission and electric transmission are handled in other proceedings.
The key themes in the general rate case filing are investing in our infrastructure and leveraging technology in order to improve operations and achieve significant gains in safety and reliability performance. The 2014 proposed revenue increase of $1.25 billion represents the funding necessary to cover operating expenses and provide for the annual costs associated with roughly $4 billion of infrastructure improvements. The capital expenditures in the general rate case should represent roughly 2/3 of the company’s total CapEx in 2014. The biggest percentage increase in the GRC filing is in the gas distribution area where we would be replacing a substantially greater number of older gas distribution lines than in the past, improving the technology we use to detect gas leaks and significantly upgrading asset management capabilities.
For electric distribution, we’ll be replacing more overhead electric lines based on their operating performance and installing more automation to limit the impact and duration of outages. The next step in the process is a full review of the filing by the Division of Ratepayer Advocates, followed ultimately by the filing of our formal application before the end of the year.
Turning to the operations side, as you can see on this slide and the Appendix, we’re on track for many of our high-level operational performance metrics. We’ve also made substantial progress this quarter on several of our key initiatives. We validated and documented the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure, or the MAOP, of over 1,300 miles of our gas transmission pipe in the second quarter, and that brings our year-to-date total to almost 2,000 miles out of the 3,400 miles planned for this year. We’ve completed 41 miles of hydrostatic tests during this quarter and remain on track to test 160 miles during the year. And we’ve installed 24 new automated safety valves on our gas transmission system and plan to have 46 by year end. We’ve also been doing some follow-up field work on class location and related issues, and this is where we’ve identified the additional work that Tony referred to earlier.
Specifically, we’ve found vegetation and structures that are encroaching on our rights of way over our transmission pipelines. As a result, we’ll be conducting a comprehensive survey of the entire gas transmission system to identify all of the encroachments, assess the cost and scope of the work and begin taking action.
We’ve also identified additional integrity management work that’s necessary, and this includes completing more internal pipeline assessments and other types of inspections to confirm the quality of our pipelines. Now most of this work will ramp up next year, and we expect that addressing these issues may take several years to complete.
Next, you’ll recall that we identified roughly $200 million in incremental work that we decided to undertake across the utility this year and next. To date, we’ve made solid progress in carrying out that work. In the electric operations, we’ve increased maintenance and repair work on both our overhead lines and underground cables and structures. We’ve also increased our patrolling of poles by tens of thousands of units, and have taken appropriate corrective maintenance actions to reduce fire risk and improve safety.
On the gas side, we’ve completed more repairs to lower grade distribution leaks as we’ve shortened our recheck intervals and have performed more maintenance work on our gas distribution lines. In putting together our 2014 General Rate Case filing, we’ve identified some additional work, mainly in the gas distribution area, that we expect to undertake going forward. It includes a higher volume of gas meter and service work, as well as some mark and locate work. Consistent with our commitment to safety and compliance, we’re not going to be able to wait until 2014 to begin some of this work. This will result in an increase in the annual incremental spend from about $200 million to about $250 million. However, there are some other areas, like the light storm season we experienced earlier this year, that create headroom for us to maintain our 2012 guidance for earnings from operations. Finally, I know a number of you have an interest in our progress on the Diablo Canyon seismic studies. There are a couple of authorizations that are pending to allow us to conduct the offshore seismic mapping. We’re hopeful that we’ll receive these authorizations in the next few months to allow us to complete the work by the end of this year.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Kent."

As usual, I’m going to go through the results for the second quarter and discuss our outlook for the rest of 2012. I also plan to provide some observations about post-2012.
I’m going to start on Slide 4, which summarizes our results for the quarter. Earnings from operations were $0.81 per diluted common share, while GAAP results were $0.55 per share. The difference between the 2 is the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters, which totaled $0.26 for the quarter. The components of that are broken out in the table at the bottom in pre-tax dollars. The pipeline-related costs totaled $128 million during the quarter and include the pipeline validation and strength testing work in the field, as well as our legal costs. In general, the field work has been on plan, although we continue to experience higher than planned legal costs.
We also took an $80 million accrual during the quarter for third-party liabilities and this reflects the results of the recent settlements reached, which Tony discussed, as well as the latest information that we have about the remaining claims. It brings our total accrual for third-party liability claims since the accident to $455 million. The upper end of our estimate for third-party liability remains at $600 million. Finally, we booked insurance recoveries of $25 million for the quarter, bringing us to $135 million of insurance recovery booked since the accident.
We continue to believe that a significant portion of the cost incurred for third party claims will be recovered through insurance, but we’ll wait until we’ve resolved claims with each carrier before booking future recoveries.
Moving to Slide 5, you can see the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations, including the primary factors that take us from $1.02 in Q2 last year to $0.81 in Q2 this year. First off, results for the period last year reflected 2 quarters of incremental revenues due to approval of the 2011 General Rate Case and Gas Transmission and Storage Case, which were both retroactive to January 1. So there’s a $0.13 adjustment to normalize the timing of those decisions last year.
There was also a $0.09 reduction due to our planned incremental spending this year to improve our operational performance across the utility. And then finally, share dilution accounted for a $0.06 reduction, and this reflects the share issuance during the quarter as well as the full effect of our equity offering completed late in Q1.
Those items were partially offset by a $0.05 increase due to higher authorized rate base investments this year compared to last year, and then we had another $0.02 positive due to other smaller items.
Slide 6 summarizes our 2012 guidance. The guidance range for earnings from operations remains at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. The range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters has been updated to reflect the accrual this quarter, the third party liability and our insurance recovery.
In the table at the bottom, you can see the ranges for each component of the natural gas matters in pre-tax dollars. The range for pipeline-related costs is unchanged at $450 million to $550 million for the year. However, we continue to trend towards the upper end of that range, primarily due to legal costs, so we’re continuing to watch this one. The range for third-party liability claims is now $80 million to $225 million. The lower end reflects the accrual taken in the quarter and the upper end is unchanged.
For insurance recoveries, you see the $36 million we booked during the first and second quarter. As in the past, we’re not providing guidance for future insurance recoveries or for additional penalties beyond what we’ve already accrued.
In terms of equity issuance, we continue to expect to need roughly $700 million this year based on our guidance assumptions. Through the end of the second quarter, our total issuance was $572 million, so we’re well along with our plans. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year will depend on a variety of things, most significantly, of course, developments related to the gas matters.
At this point, I thought I’d also provide some observations to help you think about our profile beyond 2012. Clearly, 2013 looks to be a down year for earnings from operations, primarily due to year-over-year dilution and some reduction in our authorized ROE. And of course, 2014 is going to be a key year for us since that’s the start of our next General Rate Case period.
As I go through this, I expect that you’ll have some questions for which you’ll want quantitative answers. However, much of what I’m going to say will be more directional, more qualitative than quantitative. We certainly want to be transparent with you all, but we won’t be in a position to provide guidance for future years until at least we have more visibility around the outcome of our gas issues. In the meantime, this somewhat qualitative approach seemed to be the best option.
I’m going to start on Slide 7, and there you can see that we’ve listed some factors for you to consider in thinking about our future year earnings from operations.
In terms of capital expenditures, this year we expect to be approaching $4.8 billion. In 2013, we should be at or above that level since we have important investments planned throughout our business. As an aside, if bonus depreciation is not extended next year, that would cause us to be somewhat above our authorized rate base in 2013 and we’d intend to true that up in the 2014 General Rate Case. For capital expenditures in 2014, we’ve proposed a higher level in the next General Rate Case.
In terms of our authorized rate base, which we earn on, we expect it could increase from around $24.5 billion this year to about $26 billion in 2013, based on our last General Rate Case and other proceedings, including the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan request, which obviously hasn’t been decided yet. Our authorized rate base for 2014 will be reset in the upcoming General Rate Case as well as other proceedings. Because we intend to true up historic rate base in the General Rate Case, we’d expect a more significant increase in authorized rate base in 2014, maybe in the 10% range or so, based on our General Rate Case and our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan request. But we’d expect rate base growth after that to return to more normal levels during attrition years.
Our authorized ROE and equity ratio for 2013 will obviously be set in the Cost of Capital proceeding, which is now underway. We’ve proposed a reduction in ROE from 11.35% to 11% next year, and we’ve proposed maintaining our common equity ratio at 52%. In addition to deciding those levels, the PUC is also going to consider a mechanism for adjusting ROE in 2014 and beyond, but we don’t expect them to address that until the early part of next year.
Next is the incremental spend. As Chris discussed, we expect it to total about $250 million across the utility this year and to continue next year. As you know, these costs are not currently reflected in our rates. However, we will be seeking cost recovery in our General Rate Case starting in 2014.
Next is earnings on CWIP, or construction work in progress. You’ll remember that we accrue AFUDC on CWIP, and our 2012 guidance assumes that about half of that is offset by below-the-line costs that are not recovered from customers, and those are things like charitable contributions, advertising, public affairs work and so forth. Of course, that reflects the minimal advertising we’ve done the last few years. And given the recovery plan that Tony talked about, including the customer outreach campaign, we expect that we will have higher below-the-line costs, which will largely offset our CWIP earnings in the future. So you’ll want to keep that in mind.
Finally, we’ve seen significant equity issuance this year, much of which has been driven by unrecovered gas pipeline costs. You’ll see our equity need estimate of roughly $700 million for 2012. Our equity issuance beyond this year is expected to continue to be significantly higher than would be satisfied by our internal programs, our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plan. Some of the key drivers for this are capital expenditure levels, year-over-year differences in our cash flows, the potential expiration of bonus depreciation, which I mentioned, our planned incremental spend across the utility and then the level of future gas pipeline costs.
So let’s go to Slide 8 now, and here we’ve shown some factors to consider in estimating future unrecovered pipeline-related costs. Let’s start with 2012. At the top, you can see our current guidance for unrecovered pipeline-related costs of $450 million to $550 million. That includes the 4 components you see listed: the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan expenses, which we’ve been seeking recovery of, for which a final decision isn’t expected until late in the year; the pipeline costs that we’re not seeking recovery of, such as work on post-1960’s pipe; and then other work that’s been identified since the PSEP filing last summer; and then legal and other costs.
In 2013 and 2014, the PSEP expenses we are seeking recovery of are shown as to be determined, pending a decision by the PUC. And of course, you can go back to our PSEP filing from last summer to see our original request over this timeframe. The PSEP costs we are not requesting recovery of will continue in 2013 and 2014, but the level of expenditure is expected to decline after this year. That’s why we show it as lower.
Other work refers to the pipeline rights of way and integrity management work that Chris discussed, which we’re in the process of scoping out. We do expect it to ramp-up next year, and it takes several years to complete. So we show it as higher next year.
Finally, we expect our legal costs to decline significantly after this year, so we show it as lower in both years. Obviously, that profile will depend on how quickly the various proceedings are concluded.
Down below, you see the other components of our item impacting comparability for our natural gas matters: penalties, third-party liabilities, and insurance recoveries, along with some commentary there. In particular, I think we’ve made good progress in resolving a number of significant third-party claims, and we hope to be able to resolve many of the remaining claims in a timely manner. I’d expect the timing of insurance recovery to generally follow from that, but it’s hard to predict exactly when that will occur.
So that’s an overview of some of the major factors likely to affect our earnings from operations and our unrecovered natural gas costs going forward. I know it’s a lot to digest, but I do hope my comments are helpful to you in keeping track of the various pieces that will likely influence our results over the next few years. Tony?"

So the procedural timeline for the 3 investigations have probably proposed decisions by the end of this year or early January, and final decisions in the first quarter of 2013."

My comments this morning will be brief, and then I'll turn it over to Chris and Ken. On Slide 2 as you've seen before, our focus is on 3 priorities: resolving the gas issues, positioning the company for long-term success and rebuilding relationships. 
I'm pleased to report we continue to make progress in these areas, including improvements throughout all of our operations, and we continue to be focused on the key stakeholders, especially customers. Given recent events however, our call today will primarily cover gas issues, starting with our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. We're disappointed with the proposed decision we received on the PSEP filing because, among other things, it failed to reflect the fact that much of this work is driven by new standards and requirements and that good engineering and planning practices include contingency plans and such complex operations, and Chris is going to elaborate more on this point. 
As it stands, the proposed decision is punitive and with costs already incurred, represents more than $1 billion in unrecovered costs without even factoring how the investigations will be resolved. We believe that the resolution of the investigation and the resolution of the PSEP rulemaking should be viewed in conjunction with each other to resolve an appropriate conclusion. This is going to be the primary focus as we participate in continuing settlement discussions. I want to emphasize we are still committed to the settlement discussions, and we still believe that the involvement of a mediator is the best way to bring the parties together in what have been complex and protracted discussions. As always, our work to resolve the gas proceedings will not distract us from our obligation to deliver safe, reliable and affordable gas electric service our customers. So with that, let me turn it over to Chris to go into some of these details."

As you can see on Slide 3, my comments will primarily be focused on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Program or the PSEP program and the proposed decision on the work that we outlined in our PSEP filing. I'll also",937,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 3, my comments will primarily be focused on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Program or the PSEP program and the proposed decision on the work that we outlined in our PSEP filing. I'll also provide an update on Hinkley, the environmental activities there. 
You'll recall that the PSEP filing was made in August of 2011 and represents the work that we believe is necessary to address the new higher standards adopted by the CPUC related to pipeline safety and modernization. We made our filing in about 2 months time in response to the directive to develop a comprehensive multiyear plan. 
In developing the PSEP cost estimates, we've worked with an industry expert, who followed industry best practices and helping us estimate these costs. In particular, our contingency estimates followed project-management standards for work in the preliminary design stage, as much of our work was at that time. We also requested an advice letter process for recovery our costs of both those estimates. Since making our filing, our experience in the field shows that we need to the contingency, and in some cases more than that with, which I'll describe in a moment. In contrast, the proposed decision in the ordered us to complete the work we outlined but disallows a significant portion of the funding, including all of the requested contingency and the advice letter mechanism. We believe the rejection of these requests is both arbitrary and unreasonable, particularly since is an established practice used another commission proceedings. The proposed decision also drastically reduces our Return on Equity on PSEP capital investment, compounding the punitive effect of the decision. 
Shifting to the work underway, we are on track to accomplish the work we targeted for this year. On the strength test front, we completed 85 miles of testing in the third quarter, putting us on to achieve the achieve the 160 miles we targeted by year end. Our PSEP filing targets more than 350 additional miles through 2014. As Nick Stavropoulos discussed on our call in February, we've seen strength test costs that are higher than both industry benchmarks and the cost assumptions in our PSEP filing. The strength testing effort is the largest and most expensive component of the planned PSEP expenses. We did achieve a 25% cost reduction in 2012 compared to our per mile cost in 2011, but we expect the strength testing in 2013 and '14 to be at similar unit costs as it is in '12. There are a couple of drivers for these higher costs. 
First, we're testing short segments of older pipeline as opposed to newly constructed longer segments. These are often located in dense urban areas, as opposed to the rural, less populated areas. 
Second, we prepared our costs forecast, we assume that the pipeline could be cleaned by a single cleaning run. However, in practice, fully eliminating the contaminants in the older lines has required up to 5 cleaning runs, significantly increasing the cost of storing, testing, treating, transporting and disposing of the water used in the cleaning process. 
On the pipeline replacement, we completed the replacement of 12 miles in the third quarter. We have additional replacement projects currently underway and we expect to have replaced almost 40 miles by year end. We plan to replace an additional 150 miles through 2014 as outlined in our filings. Conditions we've encountered while completing this work include more complicated and lengthy of permitting processes, as well as land acquisition delays in project reengineering. The pipeline replacement cost is expected to be at a level consistent with our request when you exclude the contingencies in 2013 and 2014. 
In our work validating the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure or the MAOP, our pipeline -- of our pipelines, we've completed the validation of more than 3,000 miles year-to-date with 4,000 miles expected to be validated by the end of the year. We're on track to complete all of the MAOP validation work of our entire Gas Transmission network of more than 5,700 miles by early 2013. We've also installed 35 automated valves so far this year and expect to reach our target of 46 by year end. The costs associated with these programs are in line with what we assumed in the PSEP filing when including the contingency. 
So summing this up, we continue to focus on ways to complete all of our work more efficiently, including competitive bidding and more pre-engineering and design work. It's a reasonable assumption though at this point that we will need more than the contingency amounts requested in the PSEP filing for the expense-related work and to meet our commitments and that we will remain on track, including the contingency, for the capital-related work. 
Now before I conclude, I'll briefly mention our chromium cleanup of the groundwater in Hinkley. To remind you, earlier this year, we established a program that offered eligible residents a set of alternatives, including a whole house water replacement system or the choice to sell it to the property. We have adjusted our cost estimates for Hinkley to reflect the responses we've received. We've also made adjustments based on the draft environmental impact report issued by the Water Board in August. As a result of these items, we took an additional charge of $24 million this quarter. We believe that we've developed a strong, final remediation plan and our accruals have been based on that plan. However, the Water Board is not anticipated to adopt the final plan until sometime in 2013. So with that, I'll turn it over to Ken."

As usual, I'll run through our third quarter results and our outlook 2 were the remainder of the year. As you'll see, the quarter was in line with our expectations. I'll also address some of the financial implications of the proposed decision on our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, should it be adopted in its current form. 
Slide 4 summarizes our results for the quarter. Earnings from operations were $0.93 per diluted common share, while GAAP results were $0.84. The difference is in the items impacting comparability for national gas matters and for environmental related costs. The components of the item impacting comparability for gas matters are shown in the table at the bottom pretax dollars. Pipeline related costs totaled $139 million during the quarter, including working the field and legal costs. There were no additional accruals for third-party liability claims during the quarter, but we did book insurance recovery of $99 million in Q3. Severance total insurance recovery since the accident to $234 million. In terms of the item impacting comparability for environmental related costs, we accrued an additional charge of about $0.03 per share in Q3, reflecting the development at Hinkley that Chris described. 
Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operation, including the primary factory that take from $1.08 in Q3 last year to $0.93 in Q3 this year. Though we had a $0.05 increase in rate base earnings compared to a year ago, this was more than offset by our planned incremental work across the utility, which totaled $0.10 negative during the quarter and share dilution, which totaled $0.06. In addition, we had other smaller items that net to a negative $0.04.
Slide 6 summarizes our 2012 guidance. The changes from last quarter are shown in blue. Our range for earnings from operations is unchanged to $3.10 to $3.30 per share. Our range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters had been updated solely to reflect the insurance recovery booked in Q3. The table at the bottom provides the ranges for each component of the natural gas matters in pretax dollars, and I'll just briefly go through them. So for pipeline related costs, the range remains $4.50 to $5.50 for the year, and we continue to trend towards the upper end. And we deploy that the proposed decision for the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, if adopted by the P&C, will result in the write-off of some capital expenditures we've made since the program began. That effect is not included in our guidance at this point, and I'll say more about that a little later on. 
The third party liability claims range for 2012 was unchanged at $80 million to $225 million. The larger number corresponds to the upper estimate for cumulative third party liabilities, which remains at $600 million. For insurance recovery, you should see the $135 million we booked during the first 3 quarters of the year and has been our practice, we're not providing guidance for future insurance recovery or for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued. 
Back to the table at the top, we've updated the range for environmental-related costs to reflect the accrual taken into Q3. To date, we've accrued $0.13, consistent with our guidance of up to $0.14. 
In terms of equity issuance, our year-to-date total through September was $720 million. We expect some modest additional issuance for the remainder of the year through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans. 
On our last call, I talked about our financial profile over the next few years and Slide 7, which we used on the last call, raised up some of the drivers of this profile, including our request that CapEx and rate base, our allowed ROE, our incremental spend across the utility and in our equity needs. 
I'll remind you a few of the takeaways. We expect 2013 to be a down year for earnings from operations, primarily due to year-over-year dilution, some reduction in our authorized ROE and our incremental spend across the utility. 
2014 on the other hand, is the start of our next general Rate Case period. It's an opportunity to true up our cost of revenues for significant portions of our operation and to continue to invest in our infrastructure. First, this picture is clouded by the uncertainty associated with the GAAP pipeline issues, what the total cost will be and how the ratemaking is going to work. 
We hope to resolve these issues as soon as we can towards the settlement process. In the meantime, the proposed decision on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan provides the data points regarding some of the issues. Obviously, there is much about the PD we don't agree with, but I know many of you have been trying to assess the financial implication in the event it is approved by the Commission. 
Now Slide 8 is also from our last call, and I just want to spend a minute on it for context before we get into the proposed decision. Let me reorient you to the Slide. At the top, you can see our 2012 guidance for pipeline related costs totaling $450 million to $550 million and these is comprised of the 4 components shown below that. These same components will affect 2013 and 2014 costs to varying degrees. 
First, the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan expenses, which we may not recover. 
Second, the PSEP costs we're not requesting recovery of, such as certain work on pipe and we show those costs as declining after this year. 
Third, the other work that's been identified this year, including the work we described in our last call. We show these costs as increasing after this year, and I'll just say we're still in the process of scoping this work, how long it's going to take and what are the costs but we do expect the work to be significant. 
And then fourth are the legal and other costs, which we show as declining after this year. 
Now it's that first component, the PSEP cost, that's really addressed in the proposed decision. As Chris said, the PD orders us to do the work but we disallow recovery of significant portion of those costs, including all the requested contingency around and the letter mechanisms to address costs above those levels. 
So let's go to Slide 9 was shows you the numbers from that proposed decision. The top half of the slide compares our requested expense recovery each year with the amounts recommended for recovery in the proposed decision and in the bottom half that's the same thing for capital. So I'll start with expense. 
Assuming we don't receive a final decision until the beginning of 2013, the PD would disallow all 2012 expenses. That's in line with our guidance that we've been providing for this year . For 2013 and 2014, the PD will leave a shorter expense work by about $130 million over the 2-year period, compared to our original request which included the contingency. So that's the $81 million and the $51 million from the Slide. However, as Chris indicated, our experience to date with pressure testing is that our costs will be higher than our original request. That means our unrecovered expenses 2013 and 2014 could be roughly double the amount shown here. 
Now let's go to capital. The proposed decision would disallow recovery of about $400 million of capital expenditures over the 4-year period, including the entirety of our records project and all of the contingency requested. If the proposed decision were approved by the TSC, we have to write-off the disallowed capital. For capital that's already been incurred, we take a charge, and if our future capital that exceeds the authorized level, we write that off assets incurred. Today we have less experience with capital work than with our expense, but our experience so far suggests that our costs are generally on track with amounts we requested, if you include the contingency. So long as that trend continues, the amount shown here will approximate our unrecovered capital cost over this period. 
Now going forward, I expect this to continue to show any unrecovered PSEP costs, both expense and capital, along with other gas pipeline related costs from the prior slide as an item impacting comparability in 2013 and 2014. So those PSEP investments we are allowed to recover, the proposed decision would also reduce the return on equity to the level of our embedded cost of that. We continue to earn this reduced return for our 5-year period after each project is done into operation. After that, they'd be allowed to earn costs of equity. We estimate that the total nominal value of this reduced return could be roughly $130 million after-tax over the relevant period and that figure is shown at the bottom of the table. If the PD is approved as proposed, I'd expect us to reflect the lower return in our earnings from operations going forward rather than include it in an item impacting comparability, since earnings and raise basis is typically ongoing. So that basically covers the potential impact of the PSEP proposal decision, including the unrecovered expenses, the CapEx and the reduced return on equity. I'm going to turn it back to Tony now for a few final comments."

My comments this morning will be brief, and then I'll turn it over to Chris and Kent. On Slide 2, as you've seen before, our focus is on 3 priorities: resolving the gas issues, positioning the company for long-term success and rebuilding relationships. I'm pleased to report we continue to make progress in these areas, including improvements throughout all of our operations, and we continue to be focused on the key stakeholders, especially customers. 
Given recent events, however, our call today will primarily cover gas issues, starting with our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. We're disappointed with the proposed decision we received on the PSEP filing because, among other things, it failed to reflect the fact that much of this work is driven by new standards and requirements and that good engineering and planning practices include contingency plans in such complex operations, and Chris is going to elaborate more on this point. 
As it stands, the proposed decision is punitive and, with cost already incurred, represents more than $1 billion in unrecovered costs, without even factoring how the investigations will be resolved. We believe that the resolution of the investigations and the resolution of the PSEP rulemaking should be viewed in conjunction with each other to resolve an appropriate conclusion. This is going to be the primary focus as we participate in continuing settlement discussions. 
While I emphatize, we are still committed to the settlement discussions, and we still believe in the involvement -- that the involvement of a mediator is the best way to bring the parties together in what have been complex and protracted discussions. As always, our work to resolve the gas proceedings will not distract us from our obligation to deliver safe, reliable and affordable gas and electric service to our customers. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Chris to go into some of these things in details."
139813,222416835,372640,"PG&E Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2012",2012-10-29,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 3, my comments will primarily be focused on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Program, or the PSEP program, and the proposed decision and the work that we outlined in our PSEP filing. I'll",942,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 3, my comments will primarily be focused on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Program, or the PSEP program, and the proposed decision and the work that we outlined in our PSEP filing. I'll also provide an update on Hinkley, the environmental activities there. 
You'll recall that the PSEP filing was made in August of 2011 and represents the work that we believe is necessary to address the new higher standards adopted by the CPUC related to the pipeline safety and modernization. We made our filing in about 2-month time in response to the CPUC directive to develop a comprehensive multiyear plan. 
In developing the PSEP cost estimates, we've worked with an industry expert who followed industry best practices in helping us estimate these costs. In particular, our contingency estimates followed project-management standards for work in the preliminary design stage, as much of our work was at that time. We also requested an advice letter process for recovery of costs of both those estimates. Since making our filing, our experience in the field shows that we need a contingency and, in some cases, more than that, which I'll describe in a moment. 
In contrast, the proposed decision in the PSEP ordered us to complete the work we outlined but disallows a significant portion of the funding, including all of the requested contingency and the advice letter mechanism. We believe the rejection of these requests is both arbitrary and unreasonable, particularly since this is an established practice used in other commission proceedings. The proposed decision also drastically reduces our return on equity on PSEP capital investment, compounding the punitive effect of the decision. 
Shifting to the work underway, we are on track to accomplish the work we've targeted for this year. On the strength test front, we completed 85 miles of testing in the third quarter, putting us on track to achieve the achieve the 160 miles we targeted by year end. Our PSEP filing targets more than 350 additional miles through 2014. 
As Nick Stavropoulos discussed on our call in February, we've seen strength test costs that are higher than both industry benchmarks and the cost assumptions in our PSEP filing. The strength testing effort is the largest and most expansive -- expensive component of the planned PSEP expenses. We did achieve a 25% cost reduction in 2012 compared to our per-mile cost in 2011, but we expect the strength testing in 2013 and '14 to be at a similar unit cost as it is in '12. 
There are a couple of drivers for these higher costs. First, we're testing short segments of older pipeline as opposed to newly constructed longer segments. These are often located in dense, urban areas as opposed to the rural, less populated areas. Second, when we prepared our cost forecast, we assumed that the pipelines could be cleaned with a single cleaning run. However, in practice, fully eliminating the contaminants in the older lines has required up to 5 cleaning runs, significantly increasing the cost of storing, testing, treating, transporting and disposing of the water used in the cleaning process. 
On the pipeline replacement, we completed the replacement of 12 miles in the third quarter. We have additional replacement projects currently underway, and we expect to have replaced almost 40 miles by year end. We plan to replace an additional 150 miles through 2014 as outlined in our filings. Conditions we've encountered while completing this work include more complicated and lengthy permitting processes, as well as land acquisition delays and project reengineering. The pipeline replacement cost is expected to be at a level consistent with our request when you include the contingencies in 2013 and 2014. 
In our work validating the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure, or the MAOP, our pipeline -- of our pipelines, we've completed the validation of more than 3,000 miles year-to-date with 4,000 miles expected to be validated by the end of the year. We're on track to complete all of the MAOP validation work of our entire gas transmission network of more than 6,700 miles by early 2013. We've also installed 35 automated valves so far this year and expect to reach our target of 46 by year end. The costs associated with these programs are in line with what we assumed in the PSEP filing when including the contingency. 
So summing this up, we continue to focus on ways to complete all of our work more efficiently, including competitive bidding and more pre-engineering and design work. It's a reasonable assumption, though, at this point that we will need more than the contingency amounts requested in the PSEP filing for the expense-related work and to meet our commitments and that we will remain on track, including the contingency, for the capital-related work. 
Now before I conclude, I'll briefly mention our chromium cleanup of the groundwater in Hinkley. To remind you, earlier this year, we established a program that offered eligible residents a set of alternatives, including a whole house water replacement system or the choice to sell us their property. We have adjusted our cost estimates for Hinkley to reflect the responses we've received. We've also made adjustments based on the draft environmental impact report issued by the water board in August. As a result of these items, we took an additional charge of $24 million this quarter. We believe that we've developed a strong, final remediation plan, and our accruals have been based on that plan. However, the water board is not anticipated to adopt the final plan until sometime in 2013. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

As you'll see, the quarter was in line with our expectations. I'll also address some of the financial implications at the proposed decision on our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan should it be adopted in its current form. 
Slide 4 summarizes our results for the quarter. Earnings from operations were $0.93 per diluted common share while GAAP results were $0.84. The difference is the items impacting comparability for national gas matters and for environmental-related costs. 
The components of the item impacting comparability for gas matters are shown in the table at the bottom in  pretax dollars. Pipeline-related costs totaled $139 million during the quarter, including working the field and legal costs. There were no additional accruals for third-party liability claims during the quarter, but we did book insurance recovery of $99 million in Q3. That brings total insurance recovery since the accident to $234 million. 
In terms of the item impacting comparability for environmental-related costs, we accrued an additional charge of about $0.03 per share in Q3, reflecting the development at Hinkley that Chris described. 
Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations, including the primary factors that take us from $1.08 in Q3 last year to $0.93 in Q3 this year. Though we had a $0.05 increase in rate base earnings compared to a year ago, this was more than offset by our planned incremental work across the utility, which totaled $0.10 negative during the quarter, and share dilution, which totaled $0.06. In addition, we had other smaller items that net to a negative $0.04.
Slide 6 summarizes our 2012 guidance. The changes from last quarter are shown in blue. Our range for earnings from operations is unchanged to $3.10 to $3.30 per share. Our range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters had been updated solely to reflect the insurance recovery booked in Q3. 
The table at the bottom provides the ranges for each component of the natural gas matters in pretax dollars, and I'll just briefly go through them. For pipeline-related costs, the range remains $450 million to $550 million for the year, and we continue to trend towards the upper end. 
I need to point out that the proposed decision for the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, if adopted by the PUC, will result in the write-off of some capital expenditures we've made since the program began. That effect is not included in our guidance at this point, and I'll say more about that a little later on. 
The third party liability claims, our range for 2012, was unchanged at $80 million to $225 million. The larger number corresponds to the upper estimate for cumulative third-party liabilities, which remains at $600 million. For insurance recoveries, you should see the $135 million we booked during the first 3 quarters of the year. And has been our practice, we're not providing guidance for future insurance recoveries or for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued. 
Back to the table at the top, we've updated the range for environmental-related costs to reflect the accrual taken in Q3. To date, we've accrued $0.13, consistent with our guidance of up to $0.14. 
In terms of equity issuance, our year-to-date total through September was $720 million. We expect some modest additional issuance for the remainder of the year through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans. 
On our last call, I talked about our financial profile over the next few years. And Slide 7, which we used on the last call, raised up some of the drivers of this profile, including our requested CapEx and rate base, our allowed ROE, our incremental spend across the utility and then our equity needs. 
And I'll remind you a few of the takeaways. We expect 2013 to be a down year for earnings from operations, primarily due to year-over-year dilution, some reduction in our authorized ROE and our incremental spend across the utility.  2014, on the other hand, is the start of our next General Rate Case period, and there's an opportunity to true-up our cost and revenues for significant portions of our operations and to continue to invest in our infrastructure. 
of course, this picture is clouded by the uncertainty associated with the gas pipeline issues, what the total cost will be and how the ratemaking is going to work. We hope to resolve these issues as soon as we can through the settlement process. In the meantime, the proposed decision on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan provides the data points regarding some of the issues. Obviously, there is much about the PD we don't agree with, but I know many of you have been trying to assess the financial implication in the event it is approved by the commission. 
Now Slide 8 is also from our last call, and I just want to spend a minute on it for context before we get into the proposed decision. Let me reorient you to the slide. At the top, you can see our 2012 guidance for pipeline-related costs totaling $450 million to $550 million, and these is comprised of the 4 components shown below that. These same components will affect 2013 and 2014 costs to varying degrees. 
First, the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan expenses, which we may not recover. Second, the PSEP costs we're not requesting recovery of, such as certain work on post-1960 pipe, and we show those costs as declining after this year. Third, the other work that's been identified this year, including the rights of way work we described on our last call. We show these costs as increasing after this year. And I'll just say we're still in the process of scoping out this work, how long it's going to take and what it will cost, but we do expect the work to be significant. And then fourth are the legal and other costs, which we show as declining after this year. 
Now it's that first component, the PSEP cost, that's really addressed in the proposed decision. As Chris said, the PD orders us to do the work but would disallow recovery of a significant portion of those costs, including all the requested contingency around and the advice letter mechanism to address costs above those levels. 
So let's go to Slide 9 which shows you the numbers from the proposed decision. The top half of the slide compares our requested expense recovery each year with the amounts recommended for recovery in the proposed decision, and in the bottom half does the same thing for capital. 
So I'll start with the expense. Assuming we don't receive a final decision until the beginning of 2013, the PD would disallow all 2012 expenses. That's in line with our guidance that we've been providing for this year. For 2013 and 2014, the PD will leave us short for expense work by about $130 million over the 2-year period compared to our original request, which include the contingency. So that's the $81 million and the $51 million from the slide. However, as Chris indicated, our experience to date with pressure testing is that our costs will be higher than our original request. That means our unrecovered expenses in 2013 and 2014 could be roughly double the amount shown here. 
Now let's go to capital. The proposed decision would disallow recovery of about $400 million of capital expenditures over the 4-year period, including the entirety of our records project and all the contingency we requested. If the proposed decision were approved by the PUC, we have to write-off the disallowed capital. For capital that's already been incurred, we take an immediate charge. And then for future capital that exceeds the authorized level, we write that off as it's been incurred. Today, we have less experience with capital work than with our expense. But our experience so far suggests that our costs are generally on track with the amounts we requested, if you include the contingency. So long as that trend continues, the amount shown here will approximate our unrecovered capital cost over this period. 
Now going forward, I expect this to continue to show any unrecovered PSEP costs, both expense and capital, along with other gas pipeline-related costs from the prior slide, as an item impacting comparability in 2013 and 2014. So those PSEP investments we are allowed to recover, the proposed decision would also reduce the return on equity to the level of our embedded cost of debt. They continue to earn this reduced return for a 5-year period after each project has gone into operation. After that, they'd be allowed to earn our authorized costs of equity. 
We estimate that the total nominal value of this reduced return could be roughly $130 million after tax over the relevant period, and that figure is shown at the bottom of the table. If the PD is approved as proposed, I'd expect us to reflect the lower return in our earnings from operations going forward rather than include it in an item impacting comparability, since earnings on rate base is typically viewed as ongoing. 
So that basically covers the potential impact of the PSEP proposed decision, including the unrecovered expenses, the CapEx and the reduced return on equity. I'm going to turn it back to Tony now for a few final comments."

My comments this morning will be brief, and then I'll turn it over to Chris and Kent. On Slide 2, as you've seen before, our focus is on 3 priorities: resolving the gas issues, positioning the company for long-term success and rebuilding relationships. I'm pleased to report we continue to make progress in these areas, including improvements throughout all of our operations, and we continue to be focused on the key stakeholders, especially customers. 
Given recent events, however, our call today will primarily cover gas issues, starting with our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. We're disappointed with the proposed decision we received on the PSEP filing because, among other things, it failed to reflect the fact that much of this work is driven by new standards and requirements and that good engineering and planning practices include contingency plans in such complex operations, and Chris is going to elaborate more on this point. 
As it stands, the proposed decision is punitive and, with cost already incurred, represents more than $1 billion in unrecovered costs, without even factoring how the investigations will be resolved. We believe that the resolution of the investigations and the resolution of the PSEP rulemaking should be viewed in conjunction with each other to resolve in an appropriate conclusion. This is going to be the primary focus as we participate in continuing settlement discussions. 
I want to emphasize, we are still committed to the settlement discussions, and we still believe in the involvement -- that the involvement of a mediator is the best way to bring the parties together in what have been complex and protracted discussions. As always, our work to resolve the gas proceedings will not distract us from our obligation to deliver safe, reliable and affordable gas and electric service to our customers. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Chris to go into some of these things in detail."
139813,222416835,372685,"PG&E Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2012",2012-10-29,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 3, my comments will primarily be focused on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Program, or the PSEP program, and the proposed decision and the work that we outlined in our PSEP filing. I'll al",941,"Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 3, my comments will primarily be focused on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Program, or the PSEP program, and the proposed decision and the work that we outlined in our PSEP filing. I'll also provide an update on Hinkley, the environmental activities there. 
You'll recall that the PSEP filing was made in August of 2011 and represents the work that we believe is necessary to address the new higher standards adopted by the CPUC related to pipeline safety and modernization. We made our filing in about 2 months' time in response to the CPUC directive to develop a comprehensive multiyear plan. 
In developing the PSEP cost estimates, we worked with an industry expert who followed industry best practices in helping us estimate these costs. In particular, our contingency estimates followed project management standards for work in the preliminary design stage, as much of our work was at that time. We also requested an advice letter process for recovery of costs of both those estimates. Since making our filing, our experience in the field shows that we need the contingency and, in some cases, more than that, as I'll describe in a moment. 
In contrast, the proposed decision in the PSEP orders us to complete the work we outlined but disallows a significant portion of the funding, including all of the requested contingency and the advice letter mechanism. We believe the rejection of these requests is both arbitrary and unreasonable, particularly since this is an established practice used in other commission proceedings. The proposed decision also drastically reduces our return on equity on PSEP capital investment, compounding the punitive effect of the decision. 
Shifting to the work underway, we are on track to accomplish the work we targeted for this year. On the strength test front, we completed 85 miles of testing in the third quarter, putting us on track to achieve the 160 miles we targeted by year end. Our PSEP filing targets more than 350 additional miles through 2014. 
As Nick Stavropoulos discussed on our call in February, we've seen strength test costs that are higher than both industry benchmarks and the cost assumptions in our PSEP filing. The strength testing effort is the largest and most expansive -- expensive component of the planned PSEP expenses. We did achieve a 25% cost reduction in 2012 compared to our per-mile cost in 2011, but we expect the strength testing in 2013 and '14 to be at a similar unit cost as it is in '12. 
There are a couple of drivers for these higher costs. First, we're testing short segments of older pipeline as opposed to newly constructed longer segments. These are often located in dense, urban areas as opposed to the rural, less populated areas. Second, when we prepared our cost forecast, we assumed that the pipelines could be cleaned with a single cleaning run. However, in practice, fully eliminating the contaminants in the older lines has required up to 5 cleaning runs, significantly increasing the cost of storing, testing, treating, transporting and disposing of the water used in the cleaning runs. 
On the pipeline replacement, we completed the replacement of 12 miles in the third quarter. We have additional replacement projects currently underway, and we expect to have replaced almost 40 miles by year end. We plan to replace an additional 150 miles through 2014 as outlined in our filing. Conditions we've encountered while completing this work include more complicated and lengthy permitting processes, as well as land acquisition delays and project reengineering. The pipeline replacement cost is expected to be at a level consistent with our request when you include the contingencies in 2013 and 2014. 
In our work validating the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure, or the MAOP, our pipeline -- of our pipelines, we've completed the validation of more than 3,000 miles year-to-date with 4,000 miles expected to be validated by the end of the year. We're on track to complete all of the MAOP validation work of our entire gas transmission network of more than 6,700 miles by early 2013. We've also installed 35 automated valves so far this year and expect to reach our target of 46 by year end. The costs associated with these programs are in line with what we assumed in the PSEP filing when including the contingency. 
So summing this up, we continue to focus on ways to complete all of our work more efficiently, including competitive bidding and more pre-engineering and design work. It's a reasonable assumption, though, at this point that we will need more than the contingency amounts requested in the PSEP filing for the expense-related work and to meet our commitments and that we will remain on track, including the contingency, for the capital-related work. 
Now before I conclude, I'll briefly mention our chromium cleanup of the groundwater in Hinkley. To remind you, earlier this year, we established a program that offered eligible residents a set of alternatives, including a whole house water replacement system or the choice to sell us their property. We have adjusted our cost estimates for Hinkley to reflect the responses we've received. We have also made adjustments based on the draft environmental impact report issued by the water board in August. As a result of these items, we took an additional charge of $24 million this quarter. We believe that we've developed a strong, final remediation plan, and our accruals have been based on that plan. However, the water board is not anticipated to adopt the final plan until sometime in 2013. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent."

As you'll see, the quarter was in line with our expectations. I'll also address some of the financial implications of the proposed decision on our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan should it be adopted in its current form. 
Slide 4 summarizes our results for the quarter. Earnings from operations were $0.93 per diluted common share while GAAP results were $0.84. The difference is the items impacting comparability for natural gas matters and for environmental-related costs. 
The components of the item impacting comparability for gas matters are shown in the table at the bottom in pretax dollars. Pipeline-related costs totaled $139 million during the quarter, including work in the field and legal costs. There were no additional accruals for third-party liability claims during the quarter, but we did book insurance recovery of $99 million in Q3. That brings total insurance recovery since the accident to $234 million. 
In terms of the item impacting comparability for environmental-related costs, we accrued an additional charge of about $0.03 per share in Q3, reflecting the development at Hinkley that Chris described. 
Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations, including the primary factors that take us from $1.08 in Q3 last year to $0.93 in Q3 this year. While we had a $0.05 increase in rate base earnings compared to a year ago, this was more than offset by our planned incremental work across the utility, which totaled $0.10 negative during the quarter, and share dilution, which totaled $0.06. In addition, we had other smaller items that net to a negative $0.04.
Slide 6 summarizes our 2012 guidance. The changes from last quarter are shown in blue. Our range for earnings from operations is unchanged at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. Our range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters has been updated solely to reflect the insurance recovery booked in Q3. 
The table at the bottom provides the ranges for each component of the natural gas matters in pretax dollars, and I'll just briefly go through them. For pipeline-related costs, the range remains $450 million to $550 million for the year, and we continue to trend towards the upper end. 
I need to point out that the proposed decision for the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, if adopted by the PUC, would result in the write-off of some capital expenditures we've made since the program began. That effect is not included in our guidance at this point, and I'll say more about that a little later on. 
The third party liability claims, our range for 2012 was unchanged at $80 million to $225 million. The larger number corresponds to the upper estimate for cumulative third-party liabilities, which remains at $600 million. For insurance recoveries, you see the $135 million we booked during the first 3 quarters of the year. And has been our practice, we're not providing guidance for future insurance recoveries or for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued. 
Back to the table at the top, we've updated the range for environmental-related costs to reflect the accrual taken in Q3. To date, we've accrued $0.13, consistent with our guidance of up to $0.14. 
In terms of equity issuance, our year-to-date total to September was $720 million. We expect some modest additional issuance for the remainder of the year through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans. 
On our last call, I talked about our financial profile over the next few years. And Slide 7, which we used on the last call, lays out some of the drivers of this profile, including our requested CapEx and rate base, our allowed ROE, our incremental spend across the utility and then our equity needs. 
And I'll remind you a few of the takeaways. We expect 2013 to be a down year for earnings from operations, primarily due to year-over-year dilution, some reduction in our authorized ROE and our incremental spend across the utility. 2014, on the other hand, is the start of our next General Rate Case period, and there's an opportunity to true-up our cost and revenues for significant portions of our operations and to continue to invest in our infrastructure. 
Of course, this picture is clouded by the uncertainty associated with the gas pipeline issues, what the total cost will be and how the ratemaking is going to work. We hope to resolve these issues as soon as we can through the settlement process. In the meantime, the proposed decision on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan provides the data points regarding some of the issues. Obviously, there is much about the PD we don't agree with, but I know many of you have been trying to assess the financial implication in the event it is approved by the commission. 
Now Slide 8 is also from our last call, and I just want to spend a minute on it for context before we get into the proposed decision. So let me reorient you to the slide. At the top, you can see our 2012 guidance for pipeline-related costs totaling $450 million to $550 million, and this is comprised of the 4 components shown below that. These same components will affect 2013 and 2014 costs to varying degrees. 
First, the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan expenses, which we may not recover. Second, the PSEP costs we're not requesting recovery of, such as certain work on post-1960 pipe, and we show those costs as declining after this year. Third, the other work that's been identified this year, including the rights of way work we described on our last call. We show these costs as increasing after this year. And I'll just say we're still in the process of scoping out this work, how long it's going to take and what it will cost, but we do expect the work to be significant. And then fourth are the legal and other costs, which we show as declining after this year. 
Now it's that first component, the PSEP cost, that's really addressed in the proposed decision. As Chris said, the PD orders us to do the work but would disallow recovery of a significant portion of those costs, including all the requested contingency amount and the advice letter mechanism to address costs above those levels. 
So let's go to Slide 9 which shows you the numbers from the proposed decision. The top half of the slide compares our requested expense recovery each year with the amounts recommended for recovery in the proposed decision, and then the bottom half does the same thing for capital. 
So I'll start with expense. Assuming we don't receive a final decision until the beginning of 2013, the PD would disallow all 2012 expenses. That's in line with our guidance that we've been providing for this year. For 2013 and 2014, the PD will leave us short for expense work by about $130 million over the 2-year period compared to our original request, which included the contingency. So that's the $81 million and the $51 million from the slide. However, as Chris indicated, our experience to date with pressure testing is that our costs will be higher than our original request. That means our unrecovered expenses in 2013 and 2014 could be roughly double the amount shown here. 
Now let's go to capital. The proposed decision would disallow recovery of about $400 million of capital expenditures over the 4-year period, including the entirety of our records project and all the contingency we requested. If the proposed decision were approved by the PUC, we'd have to write off the disallowed capital. For capital that's already been incurred, we'd take an immediate charge. And then for future capital that exceeds the authorized level, we'd write that off as it's incurred. To date, we've had less experience with capital work than with our expense. But our experience so far suggests that our costs are generally on track with the amounts we requested, if you include the contingency. So long as that trend continues, the amount shown here will approximate our unrecovered capital cost over this period. 
Now going forward, I expect this to continue to show any unrecovered PSEP costs, both expense and capital, along with other gas pipeline-related costs from the prior slide, as an item impacting comparability in 2013 and 2014. For those PSEP investments we are allowed to recover, the proposed decision would also reduce the return on equity to the level of our embedded cost of debt. They continue to earn this reduced return for a 5-year period after each project's gone into operation. After that, they'd be allowed to earn our authorized cost of equity. 
We estimate that the total nominal value of this reduced return could be roughly $130 million after tax over the relevant period, and that figure is shown at the bottom of the table. If the PD is approved as proposed, I'd expect us to reflect the lower return in our earnings from operations going forward rather than include it in an item impacting comparability, since earnings on rate base is typically viewed as ongoing. 
So that basically covers the potential impact of the PSEP proposed decision, including the unrecovered expenses, the CapEx and the reduced return on equity. I'm going to turn it back to Tony now for a few final comments."

That's the remediation of the chromium itself, and that goes on for years.
