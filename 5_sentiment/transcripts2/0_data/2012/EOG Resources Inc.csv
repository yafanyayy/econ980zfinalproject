We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those at the Eagle Ford may contain potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily cultivated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest resort reported guidelines. We incorporate a preference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in the Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, COO; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations, and Ill Miller; Manager of Engineering and Operations.
An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included fourth quarter and updated full year guidance in yesterday's press release.
This is our 50th quarterly earnings call since we became a fully public company, exiting the, we have a lot of positives to discuss this morning including exciting news from several Texas-based liquids resource plays. I'll discuss topics in the following order. I'll first review our 2011 fourth quarter and full year net income and discretionary cash flow. Then I'll provide operational results followed by reserve replacement and our 2012 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss the financials and capital structure and I'll follow with our macro hedge position and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the fourth quarter, EOG reported net income of $120.7 million or $0.45 per diluted share and $1.091 billion or $4.10 per diluted share for the full year 2011. For investors, we focused on non-GAAP net income to eliminate marked to market impacts into nonrecurring items as outlined in our press release. EOG's fourth quarter adjusted net income was $309 million or $1.15 per diluted share and $1.0 billion or $3.79 per diluted share for the full year.
For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the fourth quarter was $1.3 billion and $4.57 billion for the full year.
I'll now address our 2011 operational results in key plays.
For both the fourth quarter and full year, our liquids and total company production exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. For the full year 2011, we achieved 52% total company crude oil growth with a 61% increase in U.S. crude oil production. Total company liquids increased 48%, all organic. This is clearly best in class for company our size and is right on top of the 49% total liquids growth projection we provided you exactly a year ago on this same earnings call. Since 2007, EOG's crude and condensate growth and total liquids growth have each increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 38%.
Our 2011 North American gas production declined 7% versus 2010 from a combination of asset sales and lack of drilling. Total company overall production growth was 9.4%, again very close to the 9.5% estimate we provided last February. Also for the full year, our aggregate unit lease and well, transportation and the DDNA were lower than the aggregate midpoint guidance.
As I've said on multiple earnings calls, EOG's focus is on year-to-year, year-over-year increases in EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow and our path to achieve this goal is strong liquids growth. For 2011 compared to 2010, our GAAP EPS growth was 551%. Non-GAAP EPS growth was 227%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 55% and discretionary cash flow growth was 52%. And based on current NYMEX prices, we expect continued growth in these metrics in 2012.
In 2011, 67% of our total company well head revenues came from liquids. In North America, 72% of wellhead revenues came from liquids. This strong liquids growth is generated by the first move of positions we captured in horizontal, domestic oil plays. We presently have 4 of these, each of which we believe is world-class. I'll now discuss each of these 4 plays starting with the Eagle Ford.
The Eagle Ford was our biggest oil growth engine in 2011 and will again be the biggest component of our 2012 growth. A long time oil field axiom is that big fields tend to get bigger over time and that is certainly the case here. This continues to be the hottest and highest reinvestment rate of return play in North America, and EOG has the largest and best situated acreage position in the crude oil window. We continue to be the largest crude oil producer in the Eagle Ford with net after royalty production of 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at year-end, 18% of which was liquids.
Our press release contains multiple well results including the 6 outstanding Wells on the Henkhaus lease, which IP at approximately 3,100 barrels of oil per day with 560 barrels per day in NGLs and 2.8 million cubic feet a day of natural gas per well. This is the best package of wells we've drilled to date. Rather than provide you a well-by-well recitation, I'll provide some content regarding the overall play. There are 4 key points. First, we now have up to 200 days of well performance for multiple down spacing test, and we've concluded that our original 130-acre spacing was too wide to maximize NPV and recovery factors. Based on reservoir modeling and [indiscernible] results, we now calculate the spacing of 65 to 90 acres is more appropriate and will vary across the field depending on a number of factors including lease configuration, geology and reservoir conditions. Using this new spacing, we have a total of 3,200 additional wells yet to drill plus the 375 we've already drilled for a total potential recoverable reserve estimate of 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty.
This is a 700 million barrel oil equivalent net after royalty or 78% increase from our previous estimate. Just this net increase of 700 million barrels of oil equivalent is larger, we believe, than any net domestic discovery by any company in recent history. And the total size of 1.6 billion recoverable barrels is the biggest U.S. discovery net to any one company since [indiscernible] Bay in the late 1960s, in our opinion, including the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We tend to kind of rollover some of these numbers and sometimes 1 gets lost in the numbers, but this is an extremely significant number and I want to quote it you again, the total size of 1.6 billion the barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty that we've captured in Eagle Ford, we believe, is the biggest U.S. discovery including the entire Deepwater Gulf of Mexico net to any one company since the [indiscernible] Bay in the late 1960s.
This is not a pie-in-the-sky number. Our 61% 2011 domestic oil growth was driven by this asset and proves this is a real deal. The number is substantiated by results from the 375 EOG horizontal oil wells drilled in the Eagle Ford plus hundreds of horizontal wells drilled by offset operators. The 3200 additional wells were determined using our 572,000 net acres and de-rating that number to allow for subsurface faults or other drilling limitations related to varying lease ownerships. Now I know there are a lot of analytical people listening on this call and the tendency will be to take our 572,000 net acres, divide by a mix of 65 to 98 per spacing and you'll come up with a much higher well count and an even larger reserve number. We'd ask that you refrain from this calculation because as with any play, a portion of our acreage is eliminated either because of subsurface faults or drilling limitations related to differing lease ownerships.
In addition, we smartly raised our net after royalty per well reserve estimate and 450 MBoe based on recent well improvements that we highlighted in the last several earnings releases. The outcome of our down spacing test is that we've taken the original 4% recovery factor and are now using 6%, based on geologic analysis, logs and studies, we now estimate the net after royalty oil in place under our acreage to be 27.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
The second point relating to the Eagle Ford is that our Wisconsin sand mine is now up and running, and we currently expect that our average 2012 Eagle Ford well cost will be $5.5 million, generating an 80% direct after tax reinvestment rate of return. We believe these are the best economics in the entire industry for a large-scale hydrocarbon play. Our well cost are consistently $1 million to $2 million less than that other operators drilling similar wells.
Third, we currently have 572,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford oil window, now that we drilled 375 net wells, we anticipate we'll be able to readily hold all these acreage. For example, for lease retention, we only need to drill 40 wells this year. Last year, we drilled and completed 244 net wells and this year, we expect to drill approximately 280 net wells to optimize development.
And fourth, during 2011, we encountered no major liquids or gas takeaway issues related to the Eagle Ford. We're still on the bubble regarding take away capacity for the next 5 months until midyear when the new Enterprise gas plant and crude oil pipeline are in service. This will improve both our logistics and net backs.
 To simply summarize the Eagle Ford, I can't think of a more substantial, profitable oil discovery in the entire industry in recent times. It's huge, located in Texas, has excellent economics, and is not speculative.
I'll now shift to the Barnett Combo play where our consistently good results have probably been overshadowed by the high EOG Resources-profile Eagle Ford and Bakken. EOG is the largest crude oil producer in the Barnett. The bottom line for the Barnett Combo is that we grew our liquids volumes by 107% in 2011 from 13.2000 barrels per day to 27.3000 barrels a day, and we expect this to be our second largest liquids growth contributor in 2012 also. This play has become a consistent and profitable workhorse for us. Roughly 85% of the revenue stream from these wells emanates from liquids; 41% of which is crude oil and typical direct after tax reinvestment rates of return, even with current low gas prices are approximately 40%. We have a cost advantage in the combo because we use sand from one of our own sand mines. Last year, we drilled 249 net combo wells, and we expect to complete an additional 200 net wells in 2012. We added 25,000 core area acres during 2011 and now have a total of 200,000 net acres.
Now I'll discuss results from our 240,000 net acres of Permian Basin, Wolfcamp and Leonard assets, which we expect will be our third largest liquids contributor in 2012. We drilled 47 net wells in these plays last year and plan to drill 112 net wells this year. Our overall results continue to be some of the best in the industry as noted in our press release with several wells with IP rates over 1,000 barrels of oil per day plus NGLs and gas. We made good progress last quarter in reducing our well cost. And after we begin using our self-sourced sand this year, we expect our typical Wolfcamp well will be about 280 MBoe net after royalty for a $5.5 million completed well cost. A typical Leonard well will be 300 MBoe net after royalty for a $6 million well cost. Both of these plays have a combo product mix, roughly 40% of oil, 30% NGLs and 30% dry gas.
Direct after tax reinvestment rates of return or 55% for the Wolfcamp and 45% for the Leonard. Until recently, all our well results have been for the middle Wolfcamp interval. However, we just achieved our first success in the upper Wolfcamp. The University 9 #2803H tested at 883 barrels of oil per day with 68 barrels per day of NGLs and 400 Mcf a day of natural gas. We're currently evaluating whether this upper zone is viable target across our acreage.
In the North Dakota Bakken, we continue to achieve consistent results and the play contributed 13% total liquids growth realized in our overall Rocky Mountain operating area in 2011 over 2010. We're reducing our Bakken rig count in 2012 because the majority of our acreage is now vested, and we therefore expect therefore expect 2012 volumes to decline a bit. Some analysts have recently noted that Bakken economics may be less than stellar for many companies. Fortunately for EOG, we have the crude by rail system that gives us a net back advantage, and we also started to sell source some of our sand needs giving us a cost advantage. In EOG case, I'll also point you to a Bakken reserve charge in our presentation posted in our website. An independent analysis of all 2400 Bakken laterals completed in the basin by the industry to date shows that EOG has the highest per well reserves of any company.
During 2012, we'll be attempting to improve our Bakken recovery factor by testing down spacing in our core area, similar to what we've done in the Eagle Ford. You may recall that we drilled our core area with 640-acre spacing, which is the widest spacing used in Bakken by any operator. We have drilled multiple down space wells recently in a recent present well, the fertile 48-0905H confirms our optimism with an IP rate of 1324 barrels of oil a day. We believe that down spacing to 320 acres and the increased reserves but the magnitude of the potential reserve increase is much less than the Eagle Ford. It's about 50 million barrels net. We're also going to commence a Bakken water [indiscernible] palette this year is to see if we can further improve the oil recovery in the field. We drilled 69 net Bakken and 10 3/4 [ph] wells in 2011 and plan to drill 60 total net wells in 2012.
Regarding other North American oil plays, in the Niobrara, will be completing a number of was that we drilled past year. We'll continue to evaluate and optimize completion techniques. Our midcontinent [indiscernible] and Wyoming Powder River basin plays exhibited good recent results.
In Ellis County Oklahoma, the Oakland 31 #2H was drilled as a horizontal oil producer and returned to sales 870 barrels of oil per day with 1.3 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas. The Glen 25 #2H was competed at 5002 barrels of oil per day with 1.2 million cubic feet a day or rich natural gas. EOG has 90% and 42% working interest respectively in these Wells.
In the Wyoming Powder River basin, we have 2 rigs drilling in the Turner Formation. The [indiscernible] 9-23H well was completed to sales at 390 barrels of oil per day with 2.8 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. We have 52% working interest in this well.
The [indiscernible] 42-14H was completed the sales at 391 barrels of oil per day with 2.8 million cubic feet a day of rich gas and we have 83% working interest in this well.
The Crossbow 206H and 5218H wells were completed at 270 and 411 barrels of oil per day respectively, both with 300 -- 3.5 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas, and we have 69% and 100% working interest in these wells.
The Niobrara, Maramaton and Powder River basin will continue to be contributory, but not gain breaking liquids plays for EOG.
In Canada, we're continuing to developing our area Waskada area and we drilled 126 net wells in 2012 compared to 94 wells last year. We don't expect large growth in this area in 2012 due to a slow ramp up in operations and minor dispositions. 2 recent wells have production rates of 418 and 480 barrels of oil per day and are among the best wells in the play to date.
In the British Columbia Horn River basin, we committed the minimum drilling capital required to hold leases in 2011 and we'll do so again in 2012. After our 2012 drilling program, all of our 160,000 acres will be converted to 10-year leases. The Kitimat LNG project continues to progress. Key items we need to establish before making a final investment decision are a detailed project cost estimate and obtaining an oil Index off take contract. We expect final investment decision will be a second half 2012 event.
Outside North America, we have 2 areas of oil activities. In the East Irish Sea, we expect the commission our Conwy field and production facilities in early 2013. Production will likely peak at 20,000 barrels of oil a day net sometime this year. In Argentina, we're currently drilling our first horizontal Vaca Muerte oil shale well and we expect results in the third quarter. Additionally, we expect our 2012 Trinidad natural gas production to be essentially flat with 2011 levels.
We are devoting 10% of our 2012 capital to dry gas activities to perpetuate our acreage. The good news is that by year end, our go forward drilling requirements to hold acreage in the Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River will be quite small. We'll expand the use of our sell source frac sands for our Marcellus sales activities during 2012.
I'll now address our 2011 reserve replacement and filing cost.
For the total company, we replaced 167% of our production at a $19.68 per BOE all-in cost including reserve revisions. Total company proved reserves increased 5.3% to 2.054 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Excluding the impact of producing asset sales, total company net proved developed reserves increased 9% overall and 8% in North America. In the U.S., we replaced 216% of our production. From drilling alone in the U.S., our finding cost was $15.97. And in both North America and the U.S., 72% of our reserve adds were liquids. Our overall reserves went from 28% liquids in 2010 to 36% in 2011 reflecting our liquids focus.
Our total liquids replacement was 465% and our total liquids reserve increased 39% year-over-year.
Overall natural gas reserves decreased due to reduced drilling for dry gas, producing property sales and adjustments due to both low gas prices and well performance. These are from overall numbers and with our low finding costs are supportive of the high the gross margins we're currently generating.
The 24th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has done an engineering analysis of our reserves and our overall number was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered 85% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying the earnings release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost.
Now I'll address our 2012 business plan. We expect our 2012 total CapEx to be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion will be devoted to facilities, midstream and other infrastructure. We expect 90% of our CapEx will be focused on liquids-rich plays. We're increasing our previous 27% total company 2012 liquids growth target to 30%. We are now targeting 30% total liquids growth consisting of 30% oil and 30% NGL growth year-over-year. I'll mention that this growth is back end loaded with the real liquids growth showing up in the third and fourth quarters.
During the first quarter, we are adding frac spreads in a number of plays and we'll have pattern wells offline due to offset fracs. We also will have some gas prices and capacity downtime in some of our Texas liquids rich plays. And in addition, we expect some liquids dispositions in the first quarter end was taking this into account in the first quarter guidance.
We have a very deep liquids drilling inventory and I previously mentioned an additional 3200 drilling location in the Eagle Ford. We remain committed to managing a conservative financial structure, and in addition to gas properties, we are selling some working interest positions in non-operated liquids rich production this year to maintain our 30% limit on net debt to cap ratio. We intend to divest $1.2 billion of acreage and producing properties, of which we've closed on $340 million of primarily gas properties year to date, and we have an additional $50 million in progress.
We expect most of the remaining 2012 sales will consist of either outside operated oil properties or non-core liquids rich gas assets. We expect to sell over 3,000 barrels per day of liquids this year on an annualized basis and have taken this into consideration in the guidance for full year 2012 that we issued last night. As previously stated, we have 0 interest in growing North American gas volumes, and we expect our North American natural gas volumes to decline 11% year-over-year in 2012 due to dispositions and severely limited natural gas capital investment.
However, our game plan is to preserve our large dry gas core resource play positions so we can exploit them several years down the road when gas prices improve. Our total aggregate production growth will be 5.5% this year, but because 200% of growth emanates from liquids and at the current 35:1 oil gas price ratio, we expect to generate strong 2012 growth in EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow. Based on the current NYMEX trip, we expect that our 2012 North American revenue ratio will be 84% liquids and 16% gas compared to only 29% from liquids just 4 years ago.
When you consider that approximately half of our 2012 North American gas is hedged, that means that only about 8% of our North American total revenues are exposed to spot gas prices. Simply put, we think we're better situated than any other large cap E&P to deal with the current natural gas price environment.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 50% and the deferred tax ratio was less than 1%. Similarly, the effective tax rate for the year was 43% and the deferred tax ratio was 61%.
We also announced another increase in the dividend on the common stock. This is the 13th increase in 13 years. Effective with the next dividend, the annual indicated rate is $0.68 per share, a 6 .25% increase. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2012. For the first quarter, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 50%. For the full year 2012, the expected effective tax rate is 35% to 45%.

Now I'll provide our views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think that the global supply demand balance is tight and the fundamentals dictate the current $100 WTI price. The upside risks are mainly geopo",933,"Thanks, Tim. Now I'll provide our views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think that the global supply demand balance is tight and the fundamentals dictate the current $100 WTI price. The upside risks are mainly geopolitical. The downside risk is the second global recession, and for that contingency, we recently these our crude oil hedge position. For 2012, as a percent of North American oil production, we're approximately 23% hedged at $104..95. We're 33% hedged at $105.36 for February 1 to June 30 and 14% hedged at $104.26 for the second half of the year.
I'll also note that we expect the commission our St. James Crude Unloading Facility in April. Based on the current WTI differential, we plan to move up to 100,000 barrels of oil per day from different areas to take advantage of the crude price uplift at St. James. We continue to have a very cautious outlook regarding 2012 natural gas prices and fortunately, as a percentage of North American gas, we're 45% hedged at $5.44 for the year. We've recently layered on 150 million cubic feet a day of hedges for 2013 and 2014 at $4.79.
Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are a lot of important points, 8 in total, we'd like you to take away from this call. First, the game plan we articulated several years ago are working. We've captured world-class, low-risk liquids position that are driving the strongest organical liquids growth primarily oil of any large cap independent. In parallel, our EPS adjusted EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow are growing at high rates. We expect this to be a multiyear trend.
Second, we're accomplishing this game plan with relatively low net debt, which was 26% at year end.
Third, our 4 liquids plays, the Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo, Bakken and Wolfcamp/Leonard constitute the most powerful horizontal liquids arsenal of any independent E&P. Each is world-class in size, is located in the onshore, lower 48 in producer friendly states and generate strong reinvestment rates of return. Additionally, we believe that both public and sell side data indicate EOG is achieving the highest liquids reserves per well at the lowest cost in each play. I'll also note that our front end leasehold costs were likely the lowest in the industry in each play.
Fourth, with our expanded Eagle Ford reserve estimate, we feel even more confident that our estimated reserve, potential reserve recoverable of 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty Eagle Ford asset is the largest net oil reserve accumulation found in the U.S. in the past 40 years.
Further, we believe that this play generates -- likely generate the highest reinvestment rate of return opportunity in the entire E&P industry or large scale play.
Fifth, our Barnett Combo, North Dakota Bakken and Permian basin plays are all performing as we expected. All of these at long-term growth upside.
6, we have a plan to deal with our 2012 funding GAAP and already, we're nearly 1/3 of the way towards our 2012 property disposition target. Because of our liquids growth, our 2013 funding GAAP narrows considerably or since a lot of our acreage which will be vested by then, we can decelerate CapEx and achieved only robust instead of outstanding 2013 liquids growth.
7th, with 2 sand mines now in operation in our crude by rail facilities in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Cushing, we are confident that we can reduce Augusta content to obtain the highest oil net backs. We have recently seen differentials at Clearbrook, Minnesota increased to $15 to $25 off of WTI and as much as $42 below LOS for Bakken-related production. Using our own crude by rail facilities in North Dakota, we are currently transfer half of our Bakken from Stanley to Cushing to capture the higher margins. During the second quarter, we'll have our St. James rail unloading facility in service giving us the flexibility to quickly react to these types of market conditions. We can then avoid local market local disconnects and have our crew of of the WTR or LOS benchmarks. There are a number of crude oil planned for this year. What's important for EOG is that we secured both the loading and offloading facilities. We have origination facilities in Stanley, North Dakota and in the ego further. We have of loading or destination facilities at both Cushing and St. James. Unit trains require tremendous amount of real estate and a secure supply of crude oil and as part of our marketing strategy, we put both pieces in place early on.
And finally, there are at least 3 significant discriminators that separate EOG from the pack. First, we have the 4 best domestic liquids resource plays in the industry bar none. Second, our ownership in these 4 plays is 100%. We don't have any JVs. Our Eagle Ford Inc. which is an example of why we shun JVs on our major own plays. It we had done a JV a year or 2 ago, we would effectively given away a portion of the 700 million barrels Eagle Ford upside that we just announced.

On the personnel side, for example, if we said wow, we just increased our reserves considerably, we're going to double activity in 2012 over expectations. We would flatly out control in terms of being able to intelligently manage that increased investment. We just don't have qualified technical people to do that. So that's 1 issue. The other issue is that it's obvious that we're learning quite a bit as we go on in this Eagle Ford play. You can tell that from improved quality of our well results that we've reported each quarter. Obviously, the spacing is something we're learning more. So we're going to take this at a moderate pace because we're going to be a lot smarter a year or 2 from now from them are today and relating to these assets. So it is possible that with the relative size increase that we've just announced that in 2013 and later, we may elect to accelerate development of this. But it's really not so much on the capital side. It's going to be more a function of having got the people qualified to handle further step of and have we got our learning optimization such that we could say dramatically increased activity even more from there.

And the other possibility here is secondary recovery. And we mentioned on the call that we'll will be initiating a pilot project in the Bakken to get more oil out of the ground using the water  injection. In the Eagle Ford, we probably would not try water injection, but we have some other things in mind there. So it's quite likely that within the next 12 to 18 months, we'll have a pilot project going in Eagle Ford of secondary nature that we hope would be successful. But we just have to play it out.

We've always said on these resource plays, you just can't take a straight-line quarter-to-quarter to quarter-to-quarter to quarter and assume that our production growth is going to be that way. The biggest single component of the lumpiness in our production growth is what we call pattern drilling and fracing. If you notice in those Henkhaus wells for example in Eagle Ford that we mentioned to you on a press release there, typically what we do there is we drill 4 or 5 of those wells individually. And then we wait until we get all the wells drilled then we line them up and frac-ing them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without producing any of them. And then when they're all fraced, we turn them all on at 1 time. So you get a big burst of production, but it's just a function of how many wells hav you drilled in the pattern, what's your frac schedule and everything. And in the first quarter, we've got really I'd say, an abnormal amount of wells that we're going to be patterned, drilling and fracing. So that's affecting it. We've also got some downtime and some gas processing plants that we're anticipating that's going to hurt some of our NGL production and oil production from some of our combo areas. And then, the last thing is a little bit of property dispositions that as we mentioned, because the gas market is so weak, the majority of our $1.2 billion worth of property dispositions this year are going to have some liquid component with them. And so, we're trying to get those scheduled and timing. So you can't expect that the first quarter and potentially, the second quarter are not going to have strong year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter growth numbers -- excuse me, the year-over-year is going to be very strong than the first quarter. I believe it's a number like 40%, 40-plus percent. But we caution you, don't just just take straight-line on our quarter-to-quarter growth in 2011 and just extrapolate that in 2012. Next question."

We think we've seen enough to feel pretty comfortable on the down spacing, in terms of the evaluation of -- to be honest with you, on many of the down spacing patterns, we find that the down space wells are better and stronger than the original widely spaced wells. And of course, if we were to have an interference, to would just the opposite of that. And what we're seeing is the effects of 2 things: 1, the original spacing that we have were just too wide to drain the areas. And the second thing is, those old wells may have been say, a year or 2 years old. Now we're coming in between them and drill in. Our completion techniques have improved considerably during that timeframe. So the data from the down spacing, once we interpret it, I would classify it as a slamdunk that 130 acres basic was too wide. So the data, when you analyze it is pretty unambiguous, rally and that's why I think a lot of people were expecting that sometime, perhaps later in 2012, we'll be announcing down spacing conclusions.

But the remaining sales of roughly $800 million, we have yet to do, we just anticipate that we to offer just dry gas properties that in the market that would attach much of a price. And so, that's 1 change you've had to make over the last 6 months for this year is originally, we intended that most of our sales in 2012 would be just dry gas. But due to collapse of gas prices, we had to change that. And I'd say out of the 800 million remaining, those are going to have essentially all of those are going to have a liquid component. Some of them are just going to be flat oil areas, and we are looking at selling outside operated stuff in the Bakken and some of them are going to be gas with rich liquids component in there. In terms of our gas production, base decline and things like that add up, I probably not don't want to offer of a specific number for you on that. The only thing I would offer up is that one of the things that I've noted in previous earnings calls is that it's been disturbing for to to see most of the independent group has strongly grown their North American gas volumes over the last 3 years, and have been, in my mind, active contributors to this gas bubble whereas EOG has done just the anti-thesis of that. As a mentioned earlier, this will be the fourth straight year were North American gas volumes have declined, which we believe is a rational economic response to these chronic low gas prices."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those at the Eagle Ford, may contain potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in the Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, COO; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations; and Jill Miller, Manager of Engineering and Acquisitions.
An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included first quarter and updated full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This is our 50th quarterly earnings call since we became a fully public company, and fittingly, we have a lot of positives to discuss this morning, including exciting news from several Texas-based liquids resource plays. I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll first review our 2011 fourth quarter and full year net income and discretionary cash flow. Then I'll provide operational results, followed by reserve replacement and our 2012 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure and I'll follow with our macro hedge position and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the fourth quarter, EOG reported net income of $120.7 million or $0.45 per diluted share and $1.091 billion or $4.10 per diluted share for the full year 2011. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts in certain nonrecurring items as outlined in our press release, EOG's fourth quarter adjusted net income was $309 million or $1.15 per diluted share and $1.0 billion or $3.79 per diluted share for the full year.
For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the fourth quarter was $1.3 billion and $4.57 billion for the full year.
I'll now address our 2011 operational results and key plays.
For both the fourth quarter and full year, our liquids and total company production exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. For the full year 2011, we achieved 52% total company crude oil growth with a 61% increase in U.S. crude oil production. Total company liquids increased 48%, all organic. This is clearly best in class for a company our size and is right on top of the 49% total liquids growth projection we provided you exactly 1 year ago on this same earnings call. Since 2007, EOG's crude and condensate growth and total liquids growth have each increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 38%.
Our 2011 North American gas production declined 7% versus 2010 from a combination of asset sales and lack of drilling. Total company overall production growth was 9.4%, again very close to the 9.5% estimate we provided last February. Also for the full year, our aggregate unit lease and well, transportation and DD&A costs were lower than the aggregate midpoint guidance.
As I've said on multiple earnings calls, EOG's focus is on year-to-year, year-over-year increases in EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow and our path to achieve this goal is strong liquids growth. For 2011 compared to 2010, our GAAP EPS growth was 551%. Non-GAAP EPS growth was 227%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 55% and discretionary cash flow growth was 52%. And based on current NYMEX prices, we expect continued growth in these metrics in 2012.
In 2011, 67% of our total company well head revenues came from liquids. In North America, 72% of wellhead revenues came from liquids. This strong liquids growth is generated by the first move of positions we captured in horizontal, domestic oil plays. We presently have 4 of these, each of which we believe is world-class. I'll now discuss each of these 4 plays starting with the Eagle Ford.
The Eagle Ford was our biggest oil growth engine in 2011 and will again be the biggest component of our 2012 growth. A long time oil field axiom is that big fields tend to get bigger over time and that's certainly the case here. This continues to be the hottest and highest reinvestment rate of return play in North America, and EOG has the largest and best situated acreage position in the crude oil window. We continue to be the largest crude oil producer in the Eagle Ford with net after royalty production of 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at year end, 88% of which was liquids.
Our press release contains multiple well results including the 6 outstanding wells on the Henkhaus lease, which IPd of approximately 3,100 barrels of oil per day with 560 barrels per day in NGLs and 2.8 million cubic feet a day of natural gas per well. This is the best package of wells we've drilled to date. Rather than provide you a well-by-well recitation, I'll provide some content regarding the overall play. There are 4 key points. First, we now have up to 200 days of well performance for multiple down spacing test, and we've concluded that our original 130-acre spacing was too wide to maximize NPV and recovery factors. Based on reservoir modeling and pilot results, we now calculate the spacing of 65 to 90 acres is more appropriate and will vary across the field depending on a number of factors including lease configuration, geology and reservoir conditions. Using this new spacing, we have a total of 3,200 additional wells yet to drill plus the 375 we've already drilled for a total potential recoverable reserve estimate of 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty.
This is a 700 million barrel oil equivalent net after royalty or 78% increase from our previous estimate. Just this net increase of 700 million barrels of oil equivalent is larger, we believe, than any net domestic discovery by any company in recent history. And the total size of 1.6 billion recoverable barrels is the biggest U.S. discovery net to any one company since Prudhoe Bay in the late 1960s, in our opinion, including the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We tend to kind of rollover some of these numbers and sometimes one gets lost in the numbers, but this is an extremely significant number and I want to quote it you again, the total size of 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty that we've captured in Eagle Ford, we believe, is the biggest U.S. discovery including the entire deepwater Gulf of Mexico net to any one company since Prudhoe Bay in the late 1960s.
This is not a pie-in-the-sky number. Our 61% 2011 domestic oil growth was driven by this asset and proves this is the real deal. The number is substantiated by results from the 375 EOG horizontal oil wells drilled in the Eagle Ford plus hundreds of horizontal wells drilled by offset operators. The 3,200 additional wells were determined using our 572,000 net acres and de-rating that number to allow for subsurface faults or other drilling limitations related to varying lease ownerships. Now I know there are a lot of analytical people listening on this call and your tendency will be to take our 572,000 net acres, divide by a mix of 65 to 90 acre spacing and you'll come up with a much higher well count and an even larger reserve number. We'd ask that you refrain from this calculation because as with any play, a portion of our acreage is eliminated either because of subsurface faults or drilling limitations related to differing lease ownerships.
In addition, we slightly raised our net after royalty per well reserve estimate to 450 MBoe based on recent well improvements that we highlighted in the last several earnings releases. The outcome of our down spacing test is that we've taken the original 4% recovery factor and are now using 6%, based on geologic analysis, logs and studies, we now estimate the net after royalty oil in place under our acreage to be 27.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
The second point relating to the Eagle Ford is that our Wisconsin sand mine is now up and running, and we currently expect our average 2012 Eagle Ford well cost will be $5.5 million, generating an 80% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return. We believe these are the best economics in the entire industry for a large-scale hydrocarbon play. Our well costs are consistently $1 million to $2 million less than other operators drilling similar wells.
Third, we currently have 572,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford oil window. Now that we drilled 375 net wells, we anticipate we'll be able to readily hold all this acreage. For example, for lease retention, we only need to drill 40 wells this year. Last year, we drilled and completed 244 net wells and this year, we expect to drill approximately 280 net wells to optimize development.
And fourth, during 2011, we encountered no major liquids or gas takeaway issues relating to the Eagle Ford. We're still in on a bubble regarding take away capacity for the next 5 months until midyear when the new Enterprise gas plant and crude oil pipeline are in service. This will improve both our logistics and net backs.
To simply summarize the Eagle Ford, I can't think of a more substantial, profitable oil discovery in the entire industry in recent times. It's huge, located in Texas, has excellent economics, and it's not speculative.
I'll now shift to the Barnett Combo play where our consistently good results have probably been overshadowed by the higher profile Eagle Ford and Bakken. EOG is the largest crude oil producer in the Barnett. The bottom line for the Barnett Combo is that we grew our liquids volumes by 107% in 2011 from 13.2000 barrels a day to 27.3000 barrels a day, and we expect this to be our second largest liquids growth contributor in 2012 also. This play has become a consistent and profitable workhorse for us. Roughly 85% of the revenue stream from these wells emanates from liquids; 41% of which is crude oil and typical direct after-tax reinvestment rates of return, even with current low gas prices, are approximately 40%. We have a cost advantage in the combo because we use sand from one of our own sand mines. Last year, we drilled 249 net combo wells, and we expect to complete an additional 200 net wells in 2012. We added 25,000 core area acres during 2011 and now have a total of 200,000 net acres.
Now I'll discuss results from our 240,000 net acres of Permian Basin, Wolfcamp and Leonard assets, which we expect will be our third largest liquids contributor in 2012. We drilled 47 net wells in these plays last year and plan to drill 112 net wells this year. Our overall results continue to be some of the best in the industry, as noted in our press release, with several wells with IP rates over 1,000 barrels of oil per day plus NGLs and gas. We made good progress last quarter in reducing our well cost. And after we begin using our self-sourced sand this year, we expect our typical Wolfcamp well will be about 280 MBoe net after royalty for a $5.5 million completed well cost. A typical Leonard well will be 300 MBoe net after royalty for a $6 million well cost. Both of these plays have a combo product mix, roughly 40% of oil, 30% NGLs and 30% dry gas.
Direct after-tax reinvestment rates of return are 55% for the Wolfcamp and 45% for the Leonard. Until recently, all our well results have been for the middle Wolfcamp interval. However, we just achieved our first success in the upper Wolfcamp. The University 9 #2803H tested at 883 barrels of oil per day with 68 barrels per day of NGLs and 400 Mcf a day of natural gas. We're currently evaluating whether this upper zone is a viable target across our acreage.
In the North Dakota Bakken, we continue to achieve consistent results and the play contributed to the 13% total liquids growth realized in our overall Rocky Mountain operating area in 2011 over 2010. We're reducing our Bakken rig count in 2012 because a majority of our acreage is now vested, and we, therefore, expect therefore expect 2012 volumes to decline a bit. Some analysts have recently noted that Bakken economics may be less than stellar for many companies. Fortunately for EOG, we have the crude-by-rail system that gives us a net back advantage, and we also started to self source some of our sand needs, giving us a cost advantage. In EOG's case, I'll also point you to a Bakken reserve charge in our presentation posted on our website. An independent analyst -- excuse me, an independent analysis of all 2,428 Bakken laterals completed in the basin by the industry to date, shows that EOG has the highest per well reserves of any company.
During 2012, we'll be attempting to improve our Bakken recovery factor by testing down spacing in our core area, similar to what we've done in the Eagle Ford. You may recall that we drilled our core area with 640-acre spacing, which is the widest spacing used in Bakken by any operator. We have drilled multiple down space wells recently. In a recent well, the Fertile 48-0905H confirms our optimism with an IP rate of 1,324 barrels of oil a day. We believe that down spacing to 320 acres may increase reserves but the magnitude of the potential reserve increase is much less than the Eagle Ford. It's about 50 million barrels net. We're also going to commence a Bakken waterflood pilot this year to see if we can further improve the oil recovery in the field. We drilled 69 net Bakken and 10 net 3/4 wells in 2011 and plan to drill 60 total net wells in 2012.
Regarding other North American oil plays, in the Niobrara, we'll be completing a number of well that we drilled last year. We'll continue to evaluate and optimize completion techniques. Our mid-continent Marmaton and Wyoming Powder River basin plays exhibited good recent results.
In Ellis County, Oklahoma, the Opal 31 #2H was drilled as a horizontal oil producer in the Marmaton and turned to sales at 870 barrels of oil per day with 1.3 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas. The Glen 25 #2H was competed at 5,002 barrels of oil per day with 1.2 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas. EOG has 90% and 42% working interest, respectively, in these wells.
In the Wyoming Powder River basin, we have 2 rigs drilling in the Turner Formation. The Arbalest 9-23H well was completed to sales at 390 barrels of oil per day with 2.8 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. We have 52% working interest in this well.
The Arbalest 42-14H was completed to sales at 391 barrels of oil per day with 2.8 million cubic feet a day of rich gas, and we have 83% working interest in this well.
The Crossbow 20-06H and 52-18H wells were completed at 270 and 411 barrels of oil per day, respectively, both with 300 -- 3.5 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas, and we have 69% and 100% working interest in these wells.
The Niobrara, Maramaton and Powder River basin will continue to be contributory, but not game breaking liquids plays for EOG.
In Canada, we'll continue developing our Waskada area and we drilled 126 net wells in 2012 compared to 94 wells last year. We don't expect large growth in this area in 2012 due to a slow ramp up in operations and minor dispositions. Two recent wells had production rates of 418 and 480 barrels of oil per day and are among the best wells in the play to date.
In the British Columbia Horn River basin, we committed the minimum drilling capital required to hold leases in 2011 and we'll do so again in 2012. After our 2012 drilling program, all of our 160,000 acres will be converted to 10-year leases. The Kitimat LNG project continues to progress. Key items we need to establish before making a final investment decision are a detailed project cost estimate and obtaining an oil index offtake contract. We expect final investment decision will be a second half 2012 event.
Outside North America, we have 2 areas of oil activities. In the East Irish Sea, we expect to commission our Conwy field and production facilities in early 2013. Production will likely peak at 20,000 barrels of oil a day net, sometime this year. 
In Argentina, we're currently drilling our first horizontal Vaca Muerta oil shale well and we expect results in the third quarter. Additionally, we expect our 2012 Trinidad natural gas production to be essentially flat with 2011 levels.
We are devoting 10% of our 2012 capital to dry gas activities to perpetuate our acreage. The good news is that by year end, our go-forward drilling requirements to hold acreage in the Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River will be quite small. We'll expand the use of our self-sourced frac sand to our Marcellus activities during 2012.
I'll now address our 2011 reserve replacement and finding cost.
For the total company, we replaced 167% of our production at a $19.68 per BOE all-in cost, including reserve revisions. Total company proved reserves increased 5.3% to 2.054 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Excluding the impact of producing asset sales, total company net proved developed reserves increased 9% overall and 8% in North America. In the U.S., we replaced 216% of our production. From drilling alone in the U.S., our finding cost was $15.97. And in both North America and the U.S., 72% of our reserve adds were liquids. Our overall reserves went from 28% liquids in 2010 to 36% in 2011, reflecting our liquids focus.
Our total liquids replacement was 465% and our total liquids reserve increased 39% year-over-year.
Overall natural gas reserves decreased due to reduced drilling for dry gas, producing property sales and adjustments due to both low gas prices and well performance. These are from the overall numbers and with our low finding costs are supportive of the high liquids margins we're currently generating.
For the 24th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has done an engineering analysis of our reserves and our overall number was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered 85% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying the earnings release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding cost.
Now I'll address our 2012 business plan. We expect our 2012 total CapEx to be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion will be devoted to facilities, midstream and other infrastructure. We expect 90% of our CapEx will be focused on liquids-rich plays. We're increasing our previous 27% total company 2012 liquids growth target to 30%. We are now targeting 30% total liquids growth consisting of 30% oil and 30% NGL growth year-over-year. I'll mention that this growth is back-end loaded with the real liquids growth showing up in the third and fourth quarters.
During the first quarter, we are adding frac spreads in a number of plays and we'll have pattern wells offline due to offset fracs. We'll also will have some gas processing capacity downtime in some of our Texas liquids rich plays. And in addition, we expect some liquids dispositions in the first quarter and we've taken all this into account in the first quarter guidance.
We have a very deep liquids drilling inventory and I previously mentioned an additional 3,200 drilling locations in the Eagle Ford. We remain committed to managing a conservative financial structure, and in addition to gas properties, we are selling some working interest positions in non-operated oil and liquids rich production this year to maintain our 30% limit on the net debt-to-cap ratio. We intend to divest $1.2 billion of acreage and producing properties, of which we've closed on $340 million of primarily gas properties year to date, and we have an additional $50 million in progress.
We expect most of the remaining 2012 sales will consist of either outside-operated oil properties or non-core liquids rich gas assets. We expect to sell over 3,000 barrels per day of liquids this year on an annualized basis and have taken this into consideration in the guidance for full year 2012 that we issued last night. As previously stated, we have 0 interest in growing North American gas volumes, and we expect our North American natural gas volumes to decline 11% year-over-year in 2012 due to dispositions and severely limited natural gas capital investment.
However, our game plan is to preserve our large dry gas core resource play positions so we can exploit them several years down the road when gas prices improve. Our total aggregate production growth will be 5.5% this year, but because 200% of the growth emanates from liquids and at the current 35:1 oil to gas price ratio, we expect to generate strong 2012 growth in EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow. Based on the current NYMEX strip, we expect that our 2012 North American revenue ratio will be 84% liquids and 16% gas compared to only 29% from liquids just 4 years ago.
When you consider that approximately half of our 2012 North American gas is hedged, that means that only about 8% of our North American total revenues are exposed to spot gas prices. Simply put, we think we're better situated than any other large cap E&P to deal with the current natural gas price environment.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

Capitalized interest for the quarter was $13.5 million and $57.7 million for the full year. For the fourth quarter 2011, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.66 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $154 million.
Total acquisitions for the quarter were $200,000 and for $4.2 million for the year. For the full year 2011, total exploration and development expenditures were $6.47 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $656 million.
For 2011, approximately 10% of the drilling program CapEx was exploration and 90% was development. Approximately 20% of the CapEx was allocated to dry gas drilling.
For the full year 2011, proceeds from asset sales were $1.43 billion. At year end 2011, total debt outstanding was $5.0 billion and the debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 28%. At December 31, we had $616 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.4 billion for a net debt-to-total capital ratio of 26%.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 50% and the deferred tax ratio was less than 1%. Similarly, the effective tax rate for the year was 43% and the deferred tax ratio was 61%.
We also announced another increase in the dividend on the common stock. This is the 13th increase in 13 years. Effective with the next dividend, the annual indicated rate is $0.68 per share, a 6.25% increase. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2012. For the first quarter, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 50%. For the full year 2012, the expected effective tax rate is 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the first quarter and for the full year.
Regarding price sensitivities, with our current hedge position in 2012, for each $1 move in crude oil prices, net income is impacted $32 million, cash flow is impacted $47 million. For each $0.10 move in natural gas prices, net income is impacted $11 million and cash flow was impacted by $16 million.

Now I'll provide our views regarding macro hedging and then some concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think that the global supply demand balance is tight and the fundamentals dictate the current $100 WTI price. The upside rises are mainly geopolitical. The downside risk is a second global recession, and for that contingency, we've recently increased our crude oil hedge position. For 2012, as a percent of North American oil production, we're approximately 23% hedged at $104.95. We're 33% hedged at $105.36 for February 1 to June 30 and 14% hedged at $104.26 for the second half of the year.
I'll also note that we expect to commission our St. James crude unloading facility in April. Based on the current WTI LOS differential, we will plan to move up to 100,000 barrels a day from different areas to take advantage of the crude price uplift at St. James. We continue to have a very cautious outlook regarding 2012 natural gas prices and fortunately, as a percentage of North American gas, we're 45% hedged at $5.44 for the year. We've recently layered on 150 million cubic feet a day of hedges for 2013 and 2014 at $4.79.
Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are a lot of important points, 8 in total, we'd like you to take away from this call. First, the game plan we articulated several years ago is working. We've captured world-class, low-risk liquids position that are driving the strongest organic liquids growth, primarily oil, of any large cap independent. In parallel, our EPS adjusted EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow are growing at high rates. We expect this to be a multiyear trend.
Second, we're accomplishing this game plan with relatively low net debt, which was 26% at year end.
Third, our 4 liquids plays, the Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo, Bakken and Wolfcamp/Leonard, constitute the most powerful horizontal liquids arsenal of any independent E&P. Each is world-class in size, is located in the onshore, lower 48 in producer-friendly states and generate strong reinvestment rates of return. Additionally, we believe that both public and sell side data indicate EOG is achieving the highest liquids reserves per well at the lowest cost in each play. I'll also note that our front end leasehold costs were likely the lowest in the industry for each play.
Fourth, with our expanded Eagle Ford reserve estimate, we feel even more confident that our estimated reserve, potential reserve recoverable of 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty Eagle Ford asset is the largest net oil reserve accumulation found in the U.S. in the past 40 years.
Further, we believe that this play generates -- likely generates the highest reinvestment rate of return opportunity in the entire E&P industry or large-scale play.
Fifth, our Barnett Combo, North Dakota Bakken and Permian Basin plays are all performing as we expected. All of these have long-term growth upside.
Sixth, we have a plan to deal with our 2012 funding GAAP and already, we're nearly 1/3 of the way towards our 2012 property disposition target. Because of our liquids growth, our 2013 funding GAAP narrows considerably or since a lot of our acreage will be vested by then, we could decelerate CapEx and achieve only robust instead of outstanding 2013 liquids growth.
Seventh, with 2 EOG sand mines now in operation in our crude-by-rail facilities in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Cushing, St. James we're comfortable that we can both reduce well costs and continue to obtain the highest oil net backs. We have recently seen differentials at Clear Brook, Minnesota increase to $15 to $25 off of WTI and as much as $42 below LOS for Bakken-related production. Using our own crude-by-rail facilities in North Dakota, we are currently transporting approximately half of our Bakken oil from Stanley to Cushing to capture the higher margins. During the second quarter, we'll have our St. James rail unloading facility in service giving us the flexibility to quickly react to these types of market conditions. We can then avoid local market disconnects and sell our crude off of either WTI or LOS benchmarks. There are a number of new crude-by-rail projects planned for this year. What's important for EOG is that we secure both the loading and offloading facilities. We have origination facilities in Stanley, North Dakota and in the Eagle Ford. We have off loading or destination facilities at both Cushing and St. James. Unit trains require tremendous amounts of real estate and a secure supply of crude oil and as part of our marketing strategy, we put both pieces in place early on.
And finally, there are at least 3 significant discriminators that separate EOG from the pack. First, we have the 4 best domestic liquids resource plays in the industry bar none. Second, our ownership in these 4 plays is 100%. We don't have any JVs. Our Eagle Ford acreage is an example of why we've shunned JVs on our major oil plays. It we had done a JV 1 year or 2 ago, we would effectively have given away a portion of the 700 million barrel Eagle Ford upside that we've just announced.
Lastly, we're unique in that we're the only company that's reduced its North American gas production in 2009, 2010, 2011, and plan to do so again in 2012. We think that's a rational business response to chronically low gas prices, and that's what our shareholders expect of us. 
Thanks for listening. And now we'll go to Q&A."

On the personnel side, for example, if we said, wow, we just increased our reserves considerably, we're going to double activity in 2012 over expectations. We would be flatly out control in terms of being able to intelligently manage that increased investment. We just don't have enough qualified technical people to do that. So that's one issue. The other issue is that it's obvious that we're learning quite a bit as we go on in this Eagle Ford play. You can tell that from the improved quality of our well results that we've reported each quarter. Obviously, the spacing is something we're learning more. So we're going to take this at a moderate pace because we're going to be a lot smarter 1 year or 2 from now than we are today relating to these assets. So it is possible that with the relative size increase that we've just announced that in 2013 and later, we may elect to accelerate development of this. But it's really not so much on the capital side. It's going to be more a function of have we got the people qualified to handle a further step up and have we got our learning optimization such that we could, say, dramatically increase activity even more on there. So it's a complicated picture. You can't really look at it on just advancing net present value without considering these other items, Doug. What's your follow-up question?"

The next 2 more steps here, we need to determine is the 65 to 98 acre spacing, is that the most dense we can drill, or is it should we be even looking it more dense? And the other possibility here is secondary recovery. And we mentioned on the call that we'll will be initiating a pilot project in the Bakken to get more oil out of the ground using the water injection. In the Eagle Ford, we probably would not try water injection, but we have some other things in mind there. So it's quite likely that within the next 12 to 18 months, we'll have a pilot project going in the Eagle Ford of secondary recovery nature that we hope would be successful. But we just have to play it out. With 28 billion barrels of oil net in place under our acreage, this is clearly an improvement. Recovery factors is clearly the single most important thing we can be doing here in EOG, and we're giving it appropriate focus."

So at this point that the 280 MBoe kind of wells on the model that we're using, I mean, it could increase over time but we're not ready to do that yet. But the play is going really well. I mean, we're focused primarily on developing the middle zone, and the numbers that we're using for the reserve for well are conservative."

The biggest singl",358,"Yes, Brian. Three different drivers on the Q1 volumes. We've always said on these resource plays, you can't just take a straight line quarter to quarter to quarter to quarter and assume that our production growth is going to be that way. The biggest single component of the lumpiness in our production growth is what we call pattern drilling and fracing. If you notice in those Henkhaus wells for example in Eagle Ford that we mentioned to you on a press release there, typically, what we do there is we drill 4, 5 of those wells. We don't frac any of them individually and then we wait til we get all the wells drilled then we line them up and frac them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without producing any of them. And then when they're all frac-ed, we turn them all on at one time. So you get a big burst of production, but it's just a function of how many wells have you drilled in the pattern, what's your frac schedule and everything. And in the first quarter, we've got really, I'd say, an abnormal amount of wells that we're going to be patterned, drilling and fracing. So that's affecting it. We've also got some downtime in some gas processing plants that we're anticipating that's going to hurt some of our NGL production and oil production from some of our combo areas. And then, the last thing is a little bit of property dispositions that, as we mentioned, because the gas market is so weak, the majority of our $1.2 billion worth of property dispositions this year are going to have some liquid component with them. And so we're trying to get those scheduled timing. So you can't expect that the first quarter and potentially, the second quarter are not going to have strong year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter growth numbers -- excuse me, the year-over-year is going to be very strong in the first quarter. I believe it's a number like 40%, 40-plus percent. But we just caution you, don't just take a straight line on our quarter-to-quarter growth in 2011 and just extrapolate that in 2012."

And of course, if we were to have an interference, it would just the opposite of that.

And the second thing is, is that those old wells may have been, say, 1 year, 2 years old. Now we're coming in between them and drilling. And our completion techniques have improved considerably during that timeframe. So the data from the down spacing, once we interpret it, I would classify it as a slam dunk that 130 acres spacing was too wide. So the data, when you analyze it, is pretty unambiguous really.

So the 30% NGL number currently is, frankly, just simply updating a number that was stale even 12 months ago. So it's not that we're seeing a huge influx of increased NGL mix, or anything like that. It's really we're just updating a stale number."

And today, you saw the results from the Eagle Ford on that, and we mentioned that in the Bakken, we're looking at 2 things there. One is down spacing and then second is secondary recovery. And then the third over-arching goal for this year is to find a large horizontal oil accumulation outside North America. And you heard us mention this Vaca Muerta shale that we'll give you more details on as the year progresses. So on all 3 of those goals, those are still targets our for this year.

And then on the -- we are working primarily, most of our drilling, nearly all of our drilling so far has been in the middle zone. And we're having really good results in the middle zone, and really in every acreage spot that we test, we tested the middle zone as being really good. We do have the one well that we have in the press release. It's The University 9 #2803 in Reagan County and we IP that well at 883 barrels of oil a day, and that was a full lateral upper zone test and that well looks very good to us and is very encouraging. Other than that, we have very limited test than the lower zone and the upper zone. So we have plans to do additional testing this year in those zones, and we'll see how that goes. But we're really optimistic. The middle looks very consistent. And so, we're working on our on development patterns out there, trying to establish what's the proper spacing. And we're also -- we've implemented our self-sourced sand and the new completion techniques. And so the play is going really well. One of the great things about the play is that we've significantly reduced the well cost over the last few quarters with the implementation of our stand, and our drilling efficiencies have gone up. We've recently drilled a well from spud to TD in 4.9 days. And so, our operational people in West Texas are doing an excellent job on reducing cost as well as developing a play properly. So we're pretty encouraged about the play."

And if we wanted to, we could target and drill that tranche over the next several years and really shoot up [indiscernible]. But to be fair and objective, it's not so much that they're super long laterals, it's that they're located in a portion of the reservoir that we believe is definitely more prolific than in some other parts of the reservoir. So we'll say, you can expect we'll continue to be able to report wells of that similar type as we go throughout 2012, but we'd kind of point you more to the average well and say, the average well is quite strong and gives you 80% return.

And we're testing the down spacing in both the core and the Lite. In the core, we're testing 320 down spacing; in the Lite, we're testing 160 down spacing.

Just a tiny bit of liquids and oil with those. But the remaining sales of roughly $800 million, we have yet to do, we just anticipate that were we to offer just dry gas properties out there in the market that they wouldn't fetch much of a price. And so that's one change we've had to make over the last 6 months. For this year is, originally, we intended that most of our sales in 2012 would be just dry gas. But due to the collapse of gas prices, we've had to change that. And I'd say out of the 800 million remaining, those are going to have -- essentially, all of those are going to have a liquid component. Some of them are just going to be flat oil areas, and we are looking at selling some outside operated stuff in the Bakken and some of them are going to be gas with rich liquids component in there. 
In terms of our gas production, base decline and things like that add up, I probably not -- don't want to offer up a specific number for you on that. The only thing I would offer up is that one of the things that I've noted on previous earnings calls is that it's been disturbing to me to see most of the independent group has strongly grown their North American gas volumes over the last 3 years, and have been, in my mind, active contributors to this gas bubble, whereas EOG has done just the anti-thesis of that. As I mentioned earlier, this will be the fourth straight year where North American gas volumes have declined, which we believe is a rational economic response to these chronic low gas prices."

With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, COO; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations; and Jill Miller, Manager of Engineering and Acquisitions.
An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included first quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This is our 50th quarterly earnings call since we became a fully public company, and fittingly, we have a lot of positives to discuss this morning, including exciting news from several Texas-based liquids resource plays. I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll first review our 2011 fourth quarter and full year net income and discretionary cash flow. Then I'll provide operational results, followed by reserve replacement and our 2012 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure, and I'll follow with our macro hedge position and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the fourth quarter, EOG reported net income of $120.7 million or $0.45 per diluted share and $1.091 billion or $4.10 per diluted share for the full year 2011. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts in certain nonrecurring items as outlined in our press release, EOG's fourth quarter adjusted net income was $309 million or $1.15 per diluted share and $1.0 billion or $3.79 per diluted share for the full year.
For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the fourth quarter was $1.3 billion and $4.57 billion for the full year.
I'll now address our 2011 operational results and key plays.
For both the fourth quarter and full year, our liquids and total company production exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. For the full year 2011, we achieved 52% total company crude oil growth with a 61% increase in U.S. crude oil production. Total company liquids increased 48%, all organic. This is clearly best in class for a company our size and is right on top of the 49% total liquids growth projection we provided you exactly a year ago on this same earnings call. Since 2007, EOG's crude and condensate growth and total liquids growth have each increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 38%.
Our 2011 North American gas production declined 7% versus 2010 from a combination of asset sales and lack of drilling. Total company overall production growth was 9.4%, again very close to the 9.5% estimate we provided last February. Also for the full year, our aggregate unit lease and well, transportation and DD&A costs were lower than the aggregate midpoint guidance.
As I've said on multiple earnings calls, EOG's focus is on year-to-year, year-over-year increases in EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow, and our path to achieve this goal is strong liquids growth. For 2011 compared to 2010, our GAAP EPS growth was 551%. Non-GAAP EPS growth was 227%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 55% and discretionary cash flow growth was 52%. And based on current NYMEX prices, we expect continued growth in these metrics in 2012.
In 2011, 67% of our total company wellhead revenues came from liquids. In North America, 72% of wellhead revenues came from liquids. This strong liquids growth is generated by the first move of positions we captured in horizontal, domestic oil plays. We presently have 4 of these, each of which we believe is world-class. I'll now discuss each of these 4 plays starting with the Eagle Ford.
The Eagle Ford was our biggest oil growth engine in 2011 and will again be the biggest component of our 2012 growth. A long time oil field axiom is that big fields tend to get bigger over time, and that's certainly the case here. This continues to be the hottest and highest reinvestment rate of return play in North America, and EOG has the largest and best situated acreage position in the crude oil window. We continue to be the largest crude oil producer in the Eagle Ford with net after royalty production of 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at year end, 88% of which was liquids.
Our press release contains multiple well results including the 6 outstanding wells on the Henkhaus lease, which IP-ed at an average of approximately 3,100 barrels of oil per day with 560 barrels per day in NGLs and 2.8 million cubic feet a day of natural gas per well. This is the best package of wells we've drilled to date. Rather than provide you a well-by-well recitation, I'll provide some content regarding the overall play. There are 4 key points. First, we now have up to 200 days of well performance from multiple down spacing tests, and we've concluded that our original 130-acre spacing was too wide to maximize NPV and recovery factors. Based on reservoir modeling and pilot results, we now calculate that spacing of 65 to 90 acres is more appropriate and will vary across the field depending on a number of factors including lease configuration, geology and reservoir conditions. Using this new spacing, we have a total of 3,200 additional wells yet to drill plus the 375 we've already drilled for a total potential recoverable reserve estimate of 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty.
This is a 700 million barrel oil equivalent net after royalty or 78% increase from our previous estimate. Just this net increase of 700 million barrels of oil equivalent is larger, we believe, than any net domestic discovery by any company in recent history. And the total size of 1.6 billion recoverable barrels is the biggest U.S. discovery net to any one company since Prudhoe Bay in the late 1960s, in our opinion, including the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We tend to kind of rollover some of these numbers and sometimes one gets lost in numbers, but this is an extremely significant number and I want to quote it you again, the total size of 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty that we've captured in Eagle Ford, we believe, is the biggest U.S. discovery including the entire deepwater Gulf of Mexico net to any one company since Prudhoe Bay in the late 1960s.
This is not a pie-in-the-sky number. Our 61% 2011 domestic oil growth was driven by this asset and proves this is the real deal. The number is substantiated by results from the 375 EOG horizontal oil wells drilled in the Eagle Ford plus hundreds of horizontal wells drilled by offset operators. The 3,200 additional wells were determined using our 572,000 net acres and de-rating that number to allow for subsurface faults or other drilling limitations related to varying lease ownerships. Now I know there are a lot of analytical people listening on this call and your tendency will be to take our 572,000 net acres, divide by a mix of 65 to 90 acre spacing, and you'll come up with a much higher well count and an even larger reserve number. We'd ask that you refrain from this calculation because as with any play, a portion of our acreage is eliminated either because of subsurface faults or drilling limitations related to differing lease ownerships.
In addition, we slightly raised our net after royalty per well reserve estimate to 450 Mboe based on recent well improvements that we highlighted in the last several earnings releases. The outcome of our down spacing test is that we've taken the original 4% recovery factor and are now using 6%. Based on geologic analysis, logs and studies, we now estimate the net after royalty oil in place under our acreage to be 27.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
The second point relating to the Eagle Ford is that our Wisconsin sand mine is now up and running, and we currently expect our average 2012 Eagle Ford well cost will be $5.5 million, generating an 80% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return. We believe these are the best economics in the entire industry for a large-scale hydrocarbon play. Our well costs are consistently $1 million to $2 million less than other operators drilling similar wells.
Third, we currently have 572,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford oil window. Now that we drilled 375 net wells, we anticipate we'll be able to readily hold all this acreage. For example, for lease retention, we only need to drill 40 wells this year. Last year, we drilled and completed 244 net wells and this year, we expect to drill approximately 280 net wells to optimize development.
And fourth, during 2011, we encountered no major liquids or gas takeaway issues relating to the Eagle Ford. We still are on the bubble regarding take away capacity for the next 5 months until midyear when the new Enterprise gas plant and crude oil pipeline are in service. This will improve both our logistics and net backs.
To simply summarize the Eagle Ford, I can't think of a more substantial, profitable oil discovery in the entire industry in recent times. It's huge, located in Texas, has excellent economics, and it's not speculative.
I'll now shift to the Barnett Combo play where our consistently good results have probably been overshadowed by the higher profile Eagle Ford and Bakken. EOG is the largest crude oil producer in the Barnett. The bottom line for the Barnett Combo is that we grew our liquids volumes by 107% in 2011 from 13.2000 barrels a day to 27.3000 barrels a day, and we expect this to be our second largest liquids growth contributor in 2012 also. This play has become a consistent and profitable workhorse for us. Roughly 85% of the revenue stream from these wells emanates from liquids; 41% of which is crude oil, and typical direct after-tax reinvestment rates of return, even with current low gas prices, are approximately 40%. We have a cost advantage in the combo because we use sand from one of our own sand mines. Last year, we drilled 249 net combo wells, and we expect to complete an additional 200 net wells in 2012. We added 25,000 core area acres during 2011 and now have a total of 200,000 net acres.
Now I'll discuss results from our 240,000 net acres of Permian Basin, Wolfcamp and Leonard assets, which we expect will be our third largest liquids contributor in 2012. We drilled 47 net wells in these plays last year and plan to drill 112 net wells this year. Our overall results continue to be some of the best in the industry, as noted in our press release, with several wells with IP rates over 1,000 barrels of oil per day plus NGLs and gas. We made good progress last quarter in reducing our well cost. And after we begin using our self-sourced sand this year, we expect our typical Wolfcamp well will be about 280 Mboe net after royalty for a $5.5 million completed well cost. A typical Leonard well will be 300 Mboe net after royalty for a $6 million well cost. Both of these plays have a combo product mix, roughly 40% oil, 30% NGLs and 30% dry gas.
Direct after-tax reinvestment rates of return are 55% for the Wolfcamp and 45% for the Leonard. Until recently, all our well results have been for the middle Wolfcamp interval. However, we just achieved our first success in the upper Wolfcamp. The University 9 #2803H tested at 883 barrels of oil per day with 68 barrels per day of NGLs and 400 Mcf a day of natural gas. We're currently evaluating whether this upper zone is a viable target across our acreage.
In the North Dakota Bakken, we continue to achieve consistent results, and the play contributed to the 13% total liquids growth realized in our overall Rocky Mountain operating area in 2011 over 2010. We're reducing our Bakken rig count in 2012 because a majority of our acreage is now vested, and we, therefore, expect 2012 volumes to decline a bit. Some analysts have recently noted that Bakken economics may be less than stellar for many companies. Fortunately for EOG, we have the crude-by-rail system that gives us a net back advantage, and we also started to self source some of our sand needs, giving us a cost advantage. In EOG's case, I'll also point you to a Bakken reserve chart in our presentation posted on our website. An independent analyst -- excuse me, an independent analysis of all 2,428 Bakken laterals completed in the basin by the industry to date, shows that EOG has the highest per well reserves of any company.
During 2012, we'll be attempting to improve our Bakken recovery factor by testing down spacing in our core area, similar to what we've done in the Eagle Ford. You may recall that we drilled our core area with 640-acre spacing, which is the widest spacing used in the Bakken by any operator. We have drilled multiple down space wells recently. In a recent well, the Fertile 48-0905H confirms our optimism with an IP rate of 1,324 barrels of oil a day. We believe that down spacing to 320 acres may increase reserves, but the magnitude of the potential reserve increase is much less than the Eagle Ford. It's about 50 million barrels net. We're also going to commence a Bakken waterflood pilot this year to see if we can further improve the oil recovery in the field. We drilled 69 net Bakken and 10 net Three Forks wells in 2011 and plan to drill 60 total net wells in 2012.
Regarding other North American oil plays, in the Niobrara, we'll be completing a number of well that we drilled last year. We'll continue to evaluate and optimize completion techniques. Our mid-continent Marmaton and Wyoming Powder River basin plays exhibited good recent results.
In Ellis County, Oklahoma, the Opal 31 #2H was drilled as a horizontal oil producer in the Marmaton and turned to sales at 870 barrels of oil per day with 1.3 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas. The Guinan 25 #2H was competed at 502 barrels of oil per day with 1.2 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas. EOG has 90% and 42% working interest, respectively, in these wells.
In the Wyoming Powder River basin, we have 2 rigs drilling in the Turner formation. The Arbalest 9-23H well was completed to sales at 390 barrels of oil per day with 2.8 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. We have 52% working interest in this well.
The Arbalest 42-14H was completed to sales at 391 barrels of oil per day with 2.8 million cubic feet a day of rich gas, and we have 83% working interest in this well.
The Crossbow 20-06H and 52-18H wells were completed at 270 and 411 barrels of oil per day, respectively, both with 300 -- 3.5 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas, and we have 69% and 100% working interest in these wells.
The Niobrara, Maramaton and Powder River Basin will continue to be contributory, but not game breaking liquids plays for EOG.
In Canada, we'll continue developing our Waskada area and will drill 126 net wells in 2012 compared to 94 wells last year. We don't expect large growth in this area in 2012 due to a slow ramp up in operations and minor dispositions. Two recent wells had production rates of 418 and 480 barrels of oil per day and are among the best wells in the play to date.
In the British Columbia Horn River Basin, we committed the minimum drilling capital required to hold leases in 2011, and we'll do so again in 2012. After our 2012 drilling program, all of our 160,000 acres will be converted to 10-year leases. The Kitimat LNG project continues to progress. Key items we need to establish before making a final investment decision are a detailed project cost estimate and obtaining an oil index offtake contract. We expect final investment decision will be a second half 2012 event.
Outside North America, we have 2 areas of oil activity. In the East Irish Sea, we expect to commission our Conwy field and production facilities in early 2013. Production will likely peak at 20,000 barrels of oil a day net, sometime this year. 
In Argentina, we're currently drilling our first horizontal Vaca Muerta oil shale well and we expect results in the third quarter. Additionally, we expect our 2012 Trinidad natural gas production to be essentially flat with 2011 levels.
We are devoting 10% of our 2012 capital to dry gas activities to perpetuate our acreage. The good news is that by year end, our go-forward drilling requirements to hold acreage in the Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River will be quite small. We'll expand the use of our self-sourced frac sand to our Marcellus activities during 2012.
I'll now address our 2011 reserve replacement and finding cost.
For the total company, we replaced 167% of our production at a $19.68 per BOE all-in cost, including reserve revisions. Total company proved reserves increased 5.3% to 2.054 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Excluding the impact of producing asset sales, total company net proved developed reserves increased 9% overall and 8% in North America. In the U.S., we replaced 216% of our production. From drilling alone in the U.S., our finding cost was $15.97. And in both North America and the U.S., 72% of our reserve adds were liquids. Our overall reserves went from 28% liquids in 2010 to 36% in 2011, reflecting our liquids focus.
Our total liquids replacement was 465% and our total liquids reserve increased 39% year-over-year.
Overall, natural gas reserves decreased due to reduced drilling for dry gas, producing property sales and adjustments due to both low gas prices and well performance. These are strong overall numbers, and with our low finding costs, are supportive of the high liquids margins we're currently generating.
For the 24th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has done an engineering analysis of our reserves, and our overall number was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered 85% of our proved reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying the earnings release for the calculation of reserve replacement and finding costs.
Now I'll address our 2012 business plan. We expect our 2012 total CapEx to be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion will be devoted to facilities, midstream and other infrastructure. We expect 90% of our CapEx will be focused on liquids-rich plays. We're increasing our previous 27% total company 2012 liquids growth target to 30%. We are now targeting 30% total liquids growth consisting of 30% oil and 30% NGL growth year-over-year. I'll mention that this growth is back-end loaded with the real liquids growth showing up in the third and fourth quarters.
During the first quarter, we are adding frac spreads in a number of plays and we'll have pattern wells off-line due to offset fracs. We'll also have some gas processing capacity downtime in some of our Texas liquids rich plays. And in addition, we expect some liquids dispositions in the first quarter, and we've taken all this into account in the first quarter guidance.
We have a very deep liquids drilling inventory, and I previously mentioned an additional 3,200 drilling locations in the Eagle Ford. We remain committed to managing a conservative financial structure, and in addition to gas properties, we are selling some working interest positions in non-operated oil and liquids rich production this year to maintain our 30% limit on the net debt-to-cap ratio. We intend to divest $1.2 billion of acreage and producing properties, of which we've closed on $340 million of primarily gas properties year to date, and we have an additional $50 million in progress.
We expect most of the remaining 2012 sales will consist of either outside-operated oil properties or noncore liquids rich gas assets. We expect to sell over 3,000 barrels per day of liquids this year on an annualized basis and have taken this into consideration in the guidance for full year 2012 that we issued last night. As previously stated, we have 0 interest in growing North American gas volumes, and we expect our North American natural gas volumes to decline 11% year-over-year in 2012 due to dispositions and severely limited natural gas capital investment.
However, our game plan is to preserve our large dry gas core resource play positions so we can exploit them several years down the road when gas prices improve. Our total aggregate production growth will be 5.5% this year, but because 200% of the growth emanates from liquids and at the current 35:1 oil to gas price ratio, we expect to generate strong 2012 growth in EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow. Based on the current NYMEX strip, we expect that our 2012 North American revenue ratio will be 84% liquids and 16% gas compared to only 29% from liquids just 4 years ago.
When you consider that approximately half of our 2012 North American gas is hedged, that means that only about 8% of our North American total revenues are exposed to spot gas prices. Simply put, we think we're better situated than any other large cap E&P to deal with the current natural gas price environment.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

For the full year 2011, total exploration and development expenditures were $6.47 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $656 million.
For 2011, approximately 10% of the drilling program CapEx was exploration and 90% was development. Approximately 20% of the CapEx was allocated to dry gas drilling.
For the full year 2011, proceeds from asset sales were $1.43 billion. At year end 2011, total debt outstanding was $5.0 billion and the debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 28%. At December 31, we had $616 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.4 billion for a net debt-to-total capital ratio of 26%.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 50% and the deferred tax ratio was less than 1%. Similarly, the effective tax rate for the year was 43% and the deferred tax ratio was 61%.
We also announced another increase in the dividend on the common stock. This is the 13th increase in 13 years. Effective with the next dividend, the annual indicated rate is $0.68 per share, a 6.25% increase. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2012. For the first quarter, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 50%. For the full year 2012, the expected effective tax rate is 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the first quarter and for the full year.
Regarding price sensitivities, with our current hedge position in 2012, for each $1 move in crude oil prices, net income is impacted $32 million, cash flow is impacted $47 million. For each $0.10 move in natural gas prices, net income is impacted $11 million and cash flow is impacted by $16 million.

269660,146207873,260108,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2012",2012-02-17,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Now I'll provide our views regarding macro hedging and then some concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think that the global supply demand balance is tight and the fundamentals dictate the current $100 WTI price. The upside risks are ma",936,"Thanks, Tim. Now I'll provide our views regarding macro hedging and then some concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think that the global supply demand balance is tight and the fundamentals dictate the current $100 WTI price. The upside risks are mainly geopolitical. The downside risk is a second global recession, and for that contingency, we've recently increased our crude oil hedge position. For 2012, as a percent of North American oil production, we're approximately 23% hedged at $104.95. We're 33% hedged at $105.36 for February 1 to June 30 and 14% hedged at $104.26 for the second half of the year.
I'll also note that we expect to commission our St. James crude unloading facility in April. Based on the current WTI LOS differential, we would plan to move up to 100,000 barrels a day from different areas to take advantage of the crude price uplift at St. James. We continue to have a very cautious outlook regarding 2012 natural gas prices and fortunately, as a percentage of North American gas, we're 45% hedged at $5.44 for the year. We've recently layered on 150 million cubic feet a day of hedges for 2013 and 2014 at $4.79.
Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are a lot of important points, 8 in total, we'd like you to take away from this call. First, the game plan we articulated several years ago is working. We've captured world-class, low-risk liquids positions that are driving the strongest organic liquids growth, primarily oil, of any large cap independent. In parallel, our EPS adjusted EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow are growing at high rates. We expect this to be a multiyear trend.
Second, we're accomplishing this game plan with relatively low net debt, which was 26% at year end.
Third, our 4 liquids plays, the Eagle Ford, Barnett Combo, Bakken and Wolfcamp/Leonard, constitute the most powerful horizontal liquids arsenal of any independent E&P. Each is world-class in size, is located in the onshore, lower 48 in producer-friendly states and generate strong reinvestment rates of return. Additionally, we believe that both public and sell side data indicate EOG is achieving the highest liquids reserves per well at the lowest cost in each play. I'll also note that our front end leasehold costs were likely the lowest in industry for each play.
Fourth, with our expanded Eagle Ford reserve estimate, we feel even more confident that our estimated reserve, potential reserve recoverable of 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent net after royalty Eagle Ford asset is the largest net oil reserve accumulation found in the U.S. in the past 40 years.
Further, we believe that this play generates -- likely generates the highest reinvestment rate of return opportunity in the entire E&P industry for large-scale play.
Fifth, our Barnett Combo, North Dakota Bakken and Permian Basin plays are all performing as we expected. All of these have long-term growth upside.
Sixth, we have a plan to deal with our 2012 funding GAAP and already, we're nearly 1/3 of the way towards our 2012 property disposition target. Because of our liquids growth, our 2013 funding GAAP narrows considerably or since a lot of our acreage will be vested by then, we could decelerate CapEx and achieve only robust instead of outstanding 2013 liquids growth.
Seventh, with 2 EOG sand mines now in operation in our crude-by-rail facilities in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Cushing and St. James, we're comfortable that we can both reduce well costs and continue to obtain the highest oil net backs. We have recently seen differentials at Clear Brook, Minnesota increase to $15 to $25 off of WTI and as much as $42 below LOS for Bakken-related production. Using our own crude-by-rail facilities in North Dakota, we are currently transporting approximately half of our Bakken oil from Stanley to Cushing to capture the higher margins. During the second quarter, we'll have our St. James rail unloading facility in service giving us the flexibility to quickly react to these types of market conditions. We can then avoid local market disconnects and sell our crude off of either WTI or LOS benchmarks. There are a number of new crude-by-rail projects planned for this year. What's important for EOG is that we secure both the loading and offloading facilities. We have origination facilities in Stanley, North Dakota and in the Eagle Ford. We have offloading or destination facilities at both Cushing and St. James. Unit trains require tremendous amounts of real estate and a secure supply of crude oil and as part of our marketing strategy, we put both pieces in place early on.
And finally, there are at least 3 significant discriminators that separate EOG from the pack. First, we have the 4 best domestic liquids resource plays in the industry bar none. Second, our ownership in these 4 plays is 100%. We don't have any JVs. Our Eagle Ford acreage is an example of why we've shunned JVs on our major oil plays. It we had done a JV a year or 2 ago, we would effectively have given away a portion of the 700 million barrel Eagle Ford upside that we just announced.
Lastly, we're unique in that we're the only company that's reduced its North American gas production in 2009, 2010, 2011, and plan to do so again in 2012. We think that's a rational business response to chronically low gas prices, and that's what our shareholders expect of us. 
Thanks for listening. And now we'll go to Q&A."

On the personnel side, for example, if we said, ""Wow, we just increased our reserves considerably, we're going to double activity in 2012 over expectations,"" we would be flatly out control in terms of being able to intelligently manage that increased investment. We just don't have enough qualified technical people to do that. So that's one issue. The other issue is that it's obvious that we're learning quite a bit as we go on in this Eagle Ford play. You can tell that from the improved quality of our well results that we've reported each quarter. Obviously, the spacing is something we're learning more. So we're going to take this at a moderate pace because we're going to be a lot smarter a year or 2 from now than we are today relating to this asset. So it is possible that with the relative size increase that we've just announced that in 2013 and later, we may elect to accelerate development of this. But it's really not so much on the capital side. It's going to be more a function of have we got the people qualified to handle a further step up and have we got our learning optimization such that we could, say, dramatically increase activity even more on there. So it's a complicated picture. You can't really look at it on just advancing net present value without considering these other items, Doug. What's your follow-up question?"

And the other possibility here is secondary recovery. And we mentioned on the call that we'll be initiating a pilot project in the Bakken to get more oil out of the ground using water injection. In the Eagle Ford, we probably would not try water injection, but we have some other things in mind there. So it's quite likely that within the next 12 to 18 months, we'll have a pilot project going in the Eagle Ford of a secondary recovery nature that we hope would be successful. But we just have to play it out. With 28 billion barrels of oil net in place under our acreage, this is clearly an improvement. Recovery factors is clearly the single most important thing we can be doing here in EOG, and we're giving it appropriate focus."

The biggest singl",359,"Yes, Brian. Three different drivers on the Q1 volumes. We've always said on these resource plays, you can't just take a straight line quarter to quarter to quarter to quarter and assume that our production growth is going to be that way. The biggest single component of the lumpiness in our production growth is what we call pattern drilling and frac-ing. If you notice in those Henkhaus wells, for example, in Eagle Ford that we mentioned to you on the press release there, typically, what we do there is we drill 4 or 5 of those wells. We don't frac any of them individually, and then we wait till we get all the wells drilled, then we line them up and frac them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, without producing any of them. And then when they're all frac-ed, we turn them all on at one time. So you get a big burst of production, but it's just a function of how many wells have you drilled in the pattern, what's your frac schedule and everything. And in the first quarter, we've got really, I'd say, an abnormal amount of wells that we're going to be patterned, drilling and frac-ing. So that's affecting it. We've also got some downtime in some gas processing plants that we're anticipating that's going to hurt some of our NGL production and oil production from some of our combo areas. And then, the last thing is a little bit of property dispositions that, as we mentioned, because the gas market is so weak, the majority of our $1.2 billion worth of property dispositions this year are going to have some liquid component with them. And so we're trying to get those scheduled timing. So you can't expect that the first quarter and potentially, the second quarter are not going to have strong year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter growth numbers -- excuse me, the year-over-year is going to be very strong in the first quarter. I believe it's a number like 40%, 40-plus percent. But we just caution you, don't just take a straight line on our quarter-to-quarter growth in 2011 and just extrapolate that in 2012."

We think we've seen enough to feel pretty comfortable on the down spacing in terms of evaluation. To be honest with you, on many of the down spacing patterns, we found out that the down space wells are better and stronger than the original widely-spaced wells. And of course, if we were to have an interference, it would just the opposite of that. And what we're seeing is the effects of 2 things: One, the original spacing that we had was just too wide to drain the areas. And the second thing is, is that those old wells may have been, say, a year, 2 years old. Now we're coming in between them and drilling. And our completion techniques have improved considerably during that time frame. So the data from the down spacing, once we interpret it, I would classify it as a slam dunk that 130 acres spacing was too wide. So the data, when you analyze it, is pretty unambiguous, really. And that's why, I think, a lot of people were expecting that sometime, perhaps later in 2012, we'd be announcing down spacing conclusions. But the data is just -- it's pretty crystal clear."

Other than that, we have very limited test in the lower zone and the upper zone. So we have plans to do additional testing this year in those zones, and we'll see how that goes. But we're really optimistic. The middle looks very consistent. And so, we're working on our development patterns out there, trying to establish what's the proper spacing. And we're also -- we've implemented our self-sourced sand and new completion techniques. And so the play is going really well. One of the great things about the play is that we've significantly reduced the well cost over the last few quarters with the implementation of our sand, and our drilling efficiencies have gone up.

But the remain",323,"Well, yes, in terms of your first part of your question there, Joe, the sales that we've done to date and that we have in progress, which are roughly $400 million, those were predominantly gas. Just a tiny bit of liquids and oil with those. But the remaining sales of roughly $800 million, we have yet to do, we just anticipate that were we to offer just dry gas properties out there in the market that they wouldn't fetch much of a price. And so that's one change we've had to make over the last 6 months. For this year is, originally, we intended that most of our sales in 2012 would be just dry gas. But due to the collapse of gas prices, we've had to change that. And I'd say out of the 800 million remaining, those are going to have -- essentially, all of those are going to have a liquid component. Some of them are just going to be flat oil areas, and we are looking at selling some outside operated stuff in the Bakken, and some of them are going to be gas with rich liquids component in there. In terms of our gas production, base decline and things like that, I'd probably not -- don't want to offer up a specific number for you on that. The only thing I would offer up is that one of the things that I've noted on previous earnings calls is that it's been disturbing to me to see most of the independent group has strongly grown their North American gas volumes over the last 3 years, and have been, in my mind, active contributors to this gas bubble, whereas EOG has done just the anti-thesis of that. As I mentioned earlier, this will be the fourth straight year where our North American gas volumes have declined, which we believe is a rational economic response to these chronic low gas prices."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those for the Eagle Ford and Bakken, may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, COO; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. In updated our presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included second quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our first quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow, then I'll provide operational results and our 2012 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure and I'll follow with a macro view and hedge position and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in the press release, for the first quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $324 million or $1.20 per diluted share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's first quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $317.5 million or $1.17 per diluted share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $1.3 billion.
I'll now address our operational results and keep place. During the first quarter, all 3 of our production categories exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Our total crude and condensate production was up 49% year-over-year and total liquids were up 48% year-over-year. Additionally, the midpoint of our second quarter total crude and condensate guidance projects 42% year-over-year growth and 5% sequential growth. Our first quarter North American natural gas volumes declined 9% year-over-year, which is consistent with our projections.
Total company first quarter production from all sources was up 10% year-over-year. Our aggregate Unit costs were in line with projections. For the full year 2012, we have increased our total company's liquids growth target from 30% to 33% consisting of 33% crude and condensate growth and 32% NGL growth. The higher liquids growth is a result of stronger Eagle Ford and Bakken production. These increases are total company production growth target from the previous 5.5% to 7%. We have not changed our full year CapEx estimate.
As you know by now, we believe that total company production for net adjusted share is a useless metric, given the current 42:1 oil to gas price ratio. EOG's focus is on year-over-year increases in EPS, EBITDAX and DCF, and a path to achieve this goal is strong crude oil growth. In the first quarter 2012, our year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was 131%. Non-GAAP EPS increased 72%. Adjusted EBITDAX growth was 39% and DCF increased 39%. This is on top of the peer leading growth that we posted in these same metrics for the full year 2011 versus 2010 that I articulated on our year-end earnings call.
For the first quarter, 80% of our total company wellhead revenues emanated from liquids. In North America, 85% of wellhead revenues came from liquids. Of these liquids revenues, 87% are from crude and condensate and only 13% from NGLs.
This strong liquids revenue and volume growth is primarily generated by our 4 large horizontal domestic oil and liquids plays, which I'll now discuss starting with the Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford continues to be our 800-pound gorilla in terms of crude oil growth. And we still believe our position is the largest domestic net oil discovery in 40 years, and generates the highest ROR of any current large hydrocarbon play. We continue to be largest crude oil producer in the play with 77,000 Boe per day average net production for March, 90% of which was liquids. 
Our press release again contains multiple new well results with eyepiece for individual wells in the 2,000 to 3,000 barrel oil per day range. Note that these are oil IPs, and if we included NGLs and natural gas, the barrel of oil equivalent per day rate will be even higher. Because our oil IPs are much higher than those reported by offset operators, I received several investor questions asking whether we're testing our wells on wide open chokes to generate artificially high oil rates. The simple answer is no. These are flow test in normal production equipment with the normal choke in don the wellhead. We think the high initial rates are simply indicative of better wells as attested by our 49% year-over-year organic crude oil and condensate growth rate.
I'll now discuss 6 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, last quarter, we advised you that 65 to 90 acre down spacing was successful, and we've increased the potential net recoverable reserve estimate from 900 million to 1.6 billion Boes.
Not only we have an additional 90 days of production history, we're even more comfortable with these down spacing conclusions. We are now testing space with tighting -- tighter than the current 65 to 90 acre, i.e. 40 acres to determine if further identify will be viable to increase recovery factor and we'll likely have some results by year end.
Second, we continue to see an improvement in well performance from recent wells compared to wells completed just a year ago. This is likely due to better fracs and better placement of our laterals. This is occurring across essentially all our acreage. We've certainly seen this in our more prolific acreage where a year ago, we were highlighting wells with 1,500 barrel oil per day IP rates. And today, in those areas, the IPs are 2,500 to 3,000 barrels of oil per day. These 2,500 to 3,000 barrel oil per day rates are holding up and have averaged 30-day rates of 1,500 barrels of oil per day. We're also making these kinds of improvements in areas with lesser quality rock.
With success in down spacing, we have identified at least 3,200 additional locations to drill. Based on the 300 net wells we plan to drill this year, this gives us an 11-year inventory. The reason wer not accelerating the drilling of these unusually large well inventory is the technological improvements we are making. If we're making better wells than we were a year ago, suffice to say that we may not even make better wells a year from now. So why rush to drill wells that may not will technically optimal. We're closely focused on balancing the present value of these assets versus this technical well improvement. And you'll hear more about this in subsequent quarters.
We've reduced the number of drilling days per well due to learning curve efficiencies and now need fewer rigs to drill the targeted 300 wells. Relative to the first quarter, our Eagle Ford drilling activity will be less per net acre for the remainder of the year as we reduced our rig count from the current 26 to 23 rigs.
Third, I continue to be impressed with the consistency of this play across the trends. We don't get a lot of geologic reservoir surprises. And the few surprises we do get are generally more upside than downside.
Fourth. Now that Wisconsin fan plant is operational, we're currently using 100% self source sand in this play and saving about 5,000 barrels of oil. Because our sand is cheaper, our engineers are experimenting with bigger fracs to see the effects on initial slow rate and long-term reserves.
Fifth. During the past year, I've highlighted the possibility of product takeaway restrictions, but so far, we've been able to dodge these bottleneck bullets. We expect Enterprise to commission their new oil pipeline and gas prices in plant next month. So we think the go-forward risk of takeaway curtailments has been considerably reduced.
And sixth. In early 2013, we expect to commence a dry gas injection product to determine whether this enhanced oil recovery technique will improve our current estimated 6% recovery factor. We expect to have preliminary results in late 2013.
To summarize the Eagle Ford, it's given us a lot of upside surprises so far, and we'll continue to develop it at a technically optimal pace.
I'll now shift to the Bakken Three Forks. Each of our 2011 quarterly calls had a business as usual tone to our Bakken Three Forks asset, even though we continue to be the largest Bakken oil producer in North Dakota. However, we've recently generated exciting and very significant results in 3 different parts of the play, indicating we have more potential upside and growth opportunities than we've previously indicated. The 3 focus areas are: First, in the last quarter, we mentioned early success in our partial core area with 320 acre down spacing compared to our original 640 acres spacing. We recently drilled 3 additional 320-acre down space wells, and all are successful with IP rates ranging from 992 to 1,393 barrels of oil per day. Working interest in these wells vary from 51% to 61%.
Additionally, production from the offsetting original 640-acre wells has doubled after the downs based one after completions. The typical 640-acre well that had been online 4 to 5 years was producing 100 to 200 barrels of oil per day before the down space well was drilled. And it's currently making 200 to 400 barrels of oil per day put this give us production gains from both the new infill wells and the older producing wells. Based on these results, we'll implement 320-acre down spacing throughout our core area and we'll also test 160-acre down spacing.
In our Bakken Lite area, our original development plan was on 320 acres. And by next quarter, we'll have some 160-acre down spacing results.
In summary, the down spacing is working and the reserve impact will likely be larger than the 50 million net barrels of oil we indicated in the February call.
Second, we continue to achieve excellent results in our Antelope Extension area, which is 25 miles southwest of our core area. Both the Bakken and Three Forks are productive in these acreage. We recently drilled a group of wells. Four wells were drilled in the Three Forks formation and had IP rates of 926, 1,393, 1,455 and 3,415 barrels of oil per day, plus 1 million to 3 million per day of rich gas. Our Bakken well we recently drilled in the same area had an IP rate of 2,300 barrels of oil per day with similarly associated with rich gas. We had 100% working interest in all these wells. These results are better than we expected.
Third, in Far Eastern Montana and Western North Dakota in our Diamond Point and Stateline areas, we've recently completed 7 wells that IP that rates between 540 and 1,100 barrels of oil per day. We have an average 63% working interest in this area. All 7 wells have high rock quality and we expected. And this opens a brand-new large development area for us where we have identified over 200 drilling locations.
Additionally, in late April, we commenced 2 waterflood pilots in our Core Parshall Field to try to improve our current approximately 8% recovery factor. And we expect to have preliminary results by year-end 2012.
In summary, we're much more excited than we were a year ago about our remaining Bakken and Three Forks potential.
Moving to our Wolfcamp and Leonard plays. Our press release highlighted some individual well results, which are consistent with previous quarters. Because of the timing of our pattern drilling, we expect our 2012 production from these plays to be back-end loaded. We're still experimenting with the optimal well spacing, and expect we'll have more specific details regarding these plays later in the year. The 2 most asked investor questions we received regarding Wolfcamp are, one, is more than 1 interval productive? And two, why is EOG indicated 280 Mboe per well NAR reserve estimates smaller than the quarter offset operation? To date, most of our success has been in the middle Wolfcamp interval, but we do have 2 positive results from the upper interval. Regarding per well reserves, in our February presentation, we use an example of the well with a low net revenue interest EOG that was not comparable to appears as we report gross reserves. On the gross 8 8 spaces, our typical Wolfcamp per well EUR is approximately 430 Mboe.
I'll also note that our lower university wells noted in the IR Slide we posted last night have low initial production rates than the past quarters. That's because these wells tested against -- flowing against Highline pressures. We consider that these wells are typical and are typical reserves to wells that we reported in previous quarters, even though the IP rates are lower because of the higher back pressure.
Shifting to our Barnett Combo play. We continue to expect this to be our second largest liquids growth contributor in 2012, and we've highlighted typical wells in the press release. In the first quarter, we expanded the combo play with successful step out wells in 2 different directions. This play continues to slowly expand year after year. We plan to complete 200 net combo wells this year. And year to date, well results are on track with expectations. I will note that we might have a possible gas processing pinch point in the June time frame. It will be touch and go for a month or so and see if we can add process and capacity quickly enough to hand of our increasing rich gas volumes in this particular area.
In the Wyoming Powder River basin, we continue to have success with our horizontal drilling program in the Turner Sand Stone. Two recent wells are the Arbalest 593601H, which tested at 412 barrels of oil per day with 2.2 million cubic feet a day of rich gas and the Arbalest 29-23H was tested at 208 barrels of oil per day with 1.6 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. We have approximately 93% working interest in these wells.
We continue to be bullish regarding our 240,000 net acres in the Powder River basin. The basin has multiple stack pace similar to the Permian Basin, all of which contained oil rich gas. We've had great results in the Turner sands, and we'll be testing other zones in addition to the Turner before year end.
Regarding other North American oil plays, we recently completed a nice Niobrara well in Wyoming. The Jubilee 6904 well produced 460 barrels of oil per day. After few weeks online, we have 100% working interest.
In the midcontinent, we continue to generate consistent results from our Marmaton and Cleveland place. Four recent Marmaton wells IP-ed at 470 to 770 barrels of oil per day each. We have 61% to 94% working interest in these wells. Two nice 51% working interest Cleveland wells recently IP-ed at 490 and 560 barrels of oil per day.
We're also continuing to look for new greenfield North American liquids plays. We have captured a number of these. But as you know, we only disclose these place when they are proven successful and we have all the acreage tied up. The same disclosure strategy worked for us in Eagle Ford Bakken, Barnett Combo and Permian. It made frustrated investors on front end because we don't hype on the growth potential, but we think investors are happy with our actual results at the end of the day. 
Recently, the trade press has highlighted an EOG transaction in the Tuscaloosa. We continue to have 0 interest in the JV and any of the Big 4 oil resource plays. However, over the last several months, each of our Big 4 for oil place has gotten bigger, and Maire up period creating acreage in other areas. This will likely at our CapEx opportunities over time. Therefore, we decided to work with an upside partner in our exploration efforts to the Louisiana Tuscaloose Marina shale oil thing which will team with Mitsubishi. We don't intend to provide specific funding details, but we hope it's win-win for both parties. To reiterate, any possible oil resource play JVs will be the exception rather than rule and will definitely not be implemented in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Combo or Permian.
We've previously disclosed that approximately 10% of our 2012 CapEx will be devoted to dry gas drilling in Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River to hold acreage, and nothing has changed. We expect the percent of CapEx allocated to dry gas in 2013 will be approximately 5%. 
I'll make one interesting observation regarding our Barnett Shale gas production, which I believe are priced all horizontal resource plays both gas and oil. For 2 years, we've not only monitored drilling in our Johnson County Barnett gas field, and we've been able to observed production declines without interference from new wells. Over the past 2 years, the aggregate decline of wells has been slightly less than our forecast. This data should eliminate concerns among investors regarding longer term declines from horizontal gas and oil resource plays.
Outside North America, we're continuing to work on our East Irish Sea Conway oil development with an expected second half 2013 production start up. Productions commencement has slipped 6 months because of a delay in drilling rig arrival. Production will likely peak at 20,000 oil per day -- barrels of oil per day late in 2013. We own 100% of this project.
In Argentina, our first Vaca Muerta vertical well has been completed. The well was currently in the early flow back stages after frac and looks strong. We've also drilled and cased a horizontal well, and we'll frac it in June. In Trinida, we continue to project our 2012 gas sales will be flat at 2011. We don't have much news to report regarding our Kitimat project. We still expect FID no sooner than year end.
I'll now adjust 2 other EOG key differentiators, crude-by-rail and sand plants. Our St. James crude-by-rail facility received its first Bakken crude oil shipment on April 15, allowing us to begin capturing the current $15 Bakken to LLS price uplift. We now have the capability to move our Bakken, Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp crude to lead a cushion at St. James. Based on current differentials, the best NPV for our rail tanker fleet is to move our EOG Bakken oil to St. James and center Eagle Ford in Houston and Corpus Christi markets. We expect our St. James facility to handle 50,000 barrels a day by June, increasing to 70,000 barrels a day by year end. We've provided guidance on our U.S. oil differentials relative to WTI for the second quarter in yesterday's press release. 
For those modeling this net back benefit, remember that May will be a debugging month where we earn out the startup kinks will likely to facility we run at capacity. We will not have the St. James facility fully operational for the entire second quarter. And not all of EOG's oil production will be total to St. James. As market conditions and differentials change, we have great flexibility and can rapidly revise where we set our production and how we get our production to market.
Regarding frac sand, our new Wisconsin sand plant started up in January. And this plant, in addition to our other fan facilities, gives us the capacity to now sell stores the majority of our 2012 domestic fracs. Our less approximation of the annual savings is $500,000 per well times 600 wells or $300 million per year.
No other E&P company has boasted these differentiators, and only a very small minority has even one of the two, which, combined with our first mover resource play advantage, gives us a big competitive advantage.
Now I'll discuss our 2012 business plan. Because we value consistency, I'm happy to report that there are no changes to the strategy that we articulated in February. This strategy is obviously working, because we increased our full year liquids growth target from 30% to 33%. We continue to adhere to a low debt ratio and intend to limit our macs net debt to cap to 30% and sell $1.2 billion of assets the year. Through May 1, we've closed on $565 million of sales and have approximately $600 million of sales in progress. So once we close on pending sales, we've essentially net our $1.2 billion target. Over the past 3 years, we've concentrated our assets by selling over 8,000 wells.
Part of our plan is to preserve a large dry gas resource play position, and we're achieving that by devoting a small portion of our CapEx to Marcellus, Haynesville and Horn River lease retention drilling. In the Horn River Basin, we drilled 4 wells during the first quarter and the 3 wells remained to drill in the second quarter. Once these are drills, our leases will be held for 10 years. Our liquids plays are generating very strong results as evidenced by our outstanding organic liquids growth. This business plan will generate strong year-over-year EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow growth even with lower gas prices. Remember, only 8% of this year's North American revenue is subject to spot gas prices. Even though some of our gas hedges roll off in 2013, because of our strong liquids growth, we expect only a small amount of 2013 North American revenues will emanate from unhedged gas. Simply put, we think we're better situated than any of our large cap E&P to deal with the current natural gas price environment. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $171 million.
Total acquisitions for the quarter were $327,000. As mentioned, through May 1, proceeds from asset sales were $565 million. At the end of March 2012, total debt outstanding was $5.0  billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 28%.
At March 31, we had $294 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.7 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 27%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 38% and the deferred tax ratio was 56%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with earnings press release for the second quarter and full year 2012. For the second quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%.
We've also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year. Regarding price sensitivities, with our current hedge position in 2012, reached $1 move in crude oil prices, net income was impacted by $29 million and cash flow was impacted by $43 million. For each $0.10 move in natural gas prices, net income is impacted by $10 million and cash flow was impacted by $14 million. 
Now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Now I'll provide some views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply-demand balance is tight, and the fundamentals dictate an average $105 WTI price in 2012. The upside pressures are mainly due political. The downside risk is a second global recession. And for that contingency, we've recently increased our crude oil hedge position. We don't subscribe to the theory that North American oil growth will create adorable surplus. We think a lot of the advertised of the untested new North American liquids place or even more subsequence or an NGL place.
For the second half of 2012, we're approximately 24% hedged at $106.74 price. We continue to have a very cautious outlook regarding 2012 natural gas prices. And fortunately, as a percent of North American gas, we're 45% hedged at $5.44 for the second half of the year. We think the current rise in gas prices is a head fake but the storage overhang is just too massive.
As you know, we've been a big North American gas player in the last several years, and we adjusted our gas investments accordingly 2010, '11 and '12. Last year, our North American natural gas production declined 7%. And this year, we project a 10% decline. This is likely the largest 2-year gas production decline of the peer group, so we're doing our part to balance market. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are 6 points to take away from this call. First, the game plan we articulated several years ago is working. In the first quarter, our year-over-year GAAP EPS increased 131%. Non-GAAP EPS increased 72%. Adjusted EBITDAX was up 39% and discretionary cash flow increased 39%. This is on top of our peer leading full year 2011 versus 2010 growth in these metrics.
Second, we continue to exhibit extremely strong oil and NGL growth for a company our size. First quarter crude and condensate growth was 49% year-over-year and total liquids were up 48%. This is on top of 52% crude and condensate growth and 48% total liquids organic growth for the full year of 2011 versus 2010. Accordingly, we've raised our full year 2012 liquids growth target to 33% while keeping CapEx flat. Third, we're on track to sell $1.2 billion of properties and keep our net debt to total cap below 30%.
Fourth, what can I say about the Eagle Ford except that it's an 800-pound gorilla developing into a 1,000-pound gorilla.
Fifth, the Bakken Three Forks is our upside supplies to the quarter, and we're considerably more optimistic about the next 10 years of this play than we were a year ago.
And finally, EOG has 2 very significant logistical advantages that put us in a class by itself, crude-by-rail and self-service frac sand. Together, these provide opportunity for higher net backs, market flexibility and cost advantages, all above what the estimated when we committed to these projects.
Thanks for listening. And now, we'll go to Q&A."

Those are the lines that are going to be the big difference. It's not so much were going to find a prove of incremental acreage somewhere. It's really, really now, how best -- how dense the spacing can we drill on the acreage that we have. And then we can make a secondary project work from that. So that's the look at it.

So that will just take a little bit of time. We just kind of see how it goes as we progress. On the frac side, as you know, industry-wide, we are very aggressive on trying new techniques and new styles of frac technology using macro seismic and trying to increase the lock that we are connecting each one of these horizontal wells. And so we're making very, very substantial and steady progress in the Eagle Ford. As Mark mentioned earlier, we are being more aggressive in some of the areas on our frac tiles. In terms of stand, we're using different kinds of frac fluids and even different kinds of sand sizes in alternating the pump rates as well as alternating the way we distribute the Bakken laterals. And we're making really good progress. I would say much of the increases in the IP that you see on the wells are due to just better frac technology than we had a year ago. So we're just very pleased. Also, as Mark mentioned, the rock quality in the Eagle Ford, it looks like we've definitely captured the sweet spot.

So they've all gotten bigger considerably bigger, some of them just a bit bigger. And then we continue to have an increasing list of greenfield new play ideas. And so we just decided that it's 30% net debt to cap is a hard line for us. And we will just avail ourselves of some external financiing on at least 1 selected oil play. And so I think on a go-forward basis, 2 things come out of -- you ought to conclude. One is the 30% net debt to cap is not a number we take lightly.

There's are always resource plays were going to fall in our face once we quit drilling. And the intent of my comment was to say this is the first time where we've had 2 years without a level of interruptions from a lot of new drilling wells. And the data basically shows that we have 2 years, that there are no precipitous declines other than what we had projected. And actually, a little stronger well performance than what we've projected. So there were some profits of doom out there that said always resoucre plays within overstated reserves et cetera. And I just thought it be useful to you folks to hear some real data."

Our theory is that when we frac those wells originally, which would have been 640-acre wells 4, 5 years ago that looking back, we probably didn't get as efficient of a stimulation as we might have liked. And that we now are going to bigger fracs today than what we did back then, and that in the downspaced wells, we gave a bigger frac and we probably stimulated some of that area even around the 640-acre original well. So that's kind of -- that's one theory that seems to make the most sense to me. That we would frac new well, even the older well. So it's kind of an extra bonus, really on there, which kind of accentuates the case for the down spacing  there really. And then the other thing it tells us is that clearly the 640-acre original spacing was too wide. So it makes it kind of a slamdunk case for the 320-acre spacing. And then it's open for question about is 320s still too wide? Should we investigate? So that's next step we're looking into. On the spacing on both the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, clearly, what we did investors spec is we started out with to wide a spacing, and in both of them now, we're identifying the spacing and we identified until we've concluded okay, this is too dense of a spacing. And maybe in the Eagle Ford example maybe 65 acres is densed as we want to go, maybe 40 acres, we don't know. But I guess we'll really learn. The other way we could have done is we could have gone to ultradense spacing to start, and then say this is too deed and we're going to wider spacing, but we're doing it the other way. So we'll just see how it plays out, but we've concluded that the initial spacing was too wide, and we're just working with it until we concluded in our case this is too close in terms of spacing."

But the second -- and the reason first and second quarter or weak is that there were a lot of plant turnarounds, ethylene plant turnarounds. But beginning in the second half of the year, we expect those pricing to strengthen in relative sense. And that really we're more bullish than a lot of people that ethane price will remain decent, probably in the 40% to 50% range of crude oil long term. So right now, we're not writing off those prices and saying they're going to just degrade to nothingness.

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those for the Eagle Ford and Bakken, may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, COO; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included second quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our first quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow, then I'll provide operational results and our 2012 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure and I'll follow with our macro view and hedge position, and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in the press release, for the first quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $324 million or $1.20 per diluted share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's first quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $317.5 million or $1.17 per diluted share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $1.3 billion.
I'll now address our operational results and key plays. During the first quarter, all 3 of our production categories exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Our total crude and condensate production was up 49% year-over-year and total liquids were up 48% year-over-year. Additionally, the midpoint of our second quarter total crude and condensate guidance projects 42% year-over-year growth and 5% sequential growth. Our first quarter North American natural gas volumes declined 9% year-over-year, which is consistent with our projections.
Total company first quarter production from all sources was up 10% year-over-year. Our aggregate unit costs were in line with projections. For the full year 2012, we have increased our total company liquids growth target from 30% to 33%, consisting of 33% crude and condensate growth and 32% NGL growth. The higher liquids growth is a result of stronger Eagle Ford and Bakken production. These increases are our total company production growth target from the previous 5.5% to 7%. We have not changed our full year CapEx estimate.
As you know by now, we believe that total company production for debt adjusted share is a useless metric, given the current 42:1 oil to gas price ratio. EOG's focus is on year-over-year increases in EPS, EBITDAX and DCF, and our path to achieve this goal is strong crude oil growth. In the first quarter 2012, our year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was 131%, non-GAAP EPS increased 72%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 39% and DCF increased 39%. This is on top of the peer leading growth that we posted in these same metrics for the full year 2011 versus 2010 that I articulated on our year-end earnings call.
For the first quarter, 80% of our total company wellhead revenues emanated from liquids. In North America, 85% of wellhead revenues came from liquids. Of these liquids revenues, 87% are from crude and condensate and only 13% from NGLs.
This strong liquids revenue and volume growth is primarily generated by our 4 large horizontal domestic oil and liquids plays, which I'll now discuss starting with the Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford continues to be our 800-pound gorilla in terms of crude oil growth, and we still believe our position is the largest domestic net oil discovery in 40 years and generates the highest direct AT ROR of any current large hydrocarbon play. We continue to be largest crude oil producer in the play, with 77,000 Boe per day average net production for March, 90% of which was liquids. 
Our press release again contains multiple new well results with IPs for individual wells in the 2,000 to 3,000 barrel oil per day range. Note that these are oil IPs, and if we included NGLs and natural gas, the barrel oil equivalent per day rates would be even higher because our oil IPs are much higher than those reported by offset operators. I've received several investor questions asking whether we're testing our wells on wide open chokes to generate artificially high oil rates. The simple answer is no. These are flow tests into our normal production equipment with a normal choke in the wellhead. We think the high initial rates are simply indicative of better wells as attested by our 49% year-over-year organic crude oil and condensate growth rate.
I'll now discuss 6 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, last quarter, we advised you that 65 to 90 acre downspacing was successful, and we'd increased the potential net recoverable reserve estimate from 900 million to 1.6 billion Boes.
Now that we have an additional 90 days of production history, we're even more comfortable with these downspacing conclusions. We're now testing space are tighting -- tighter than the current 65 to 90 acres, i.e. 40 acres, to determine if further densify will be viable to increase recovery factor and we'll likely have some results by year end.
Second, we continue to see an improvement in well performance from recent wells compared to wells completed just a year ago. This is likely due to better fracs and better placement of our laterals. This is occurring across essentially all our acreage. We've certainly seen this in our more prolific acreage where a year ago, we were highlighting wells with 1,500 barrel oil per day IP rates. And today, in those same areas, the IPs are 2,500 to 3,000 barrels of oil per day. These 2,500 to 3,000 barrel oil per day rates are holding up and have averaged 30-day rates of 1,500 barrel oil per day. We're also making these type of improvements in areas with lesser quality rock.
With the success in downspacing, we have identified at least 3,200 additional locations to drill. Based on the 300 net wells we plan to drill this year, this gives us an 11-year inventory. The reason we're not accelerating the drilling of this unusually large well inventory is the technological improvements we're making. If we're making better wells than we were a year ago, who's to say we may not make even better wells a year from now? So why rush to drill wells that may not be technically optimum? We're closely focused on balancing the present value of this asset versus this technical well improvement. And you'll hear more about this in subsequent quarters.
We've reduced the number of drilling days per well due to learning curve efficiencies and now need fewer rigs to drill the targeted 300 wells. Relative to the first quarter, our Eagle Ford drilling activity will be less frenetic for the remainder of the year as we reduce our rig count from the current 26 to 23 rigs.
Third, I continue to be impressed with the consistency of this play across the trend. We don't get a lot of geologic or reservoir surprises, and the few surprises we do get are generally more upside than downside.
Fourth. Now that our Wisconsin sand plant is operational, we're currently using 100% self-sourced sand in this play and saving about $500,000 a well. Because our sand is cheaper, our engineers are experimenting with bigger fracs to see the effect on initial slow rate and long-term reserves.
Fifth. During the past year, I've highlighted the possibility of product takeaway restrictions, but so far, we've been able to dodge these bottleneck bullets. We expect Enterprise to commission their new oil pipeline and gas processing plant next month. So we think the go-forward risk of takeaway curtailments has been considerably reduced.
And sixth. In early 2013, we expect to commence a dry gas injection pilot to determine whether this enhanced oil recovery technique will improve our current estimated 6% recovery factor. We expect to have preliminary results in late 2013.
To summarize the Eagle Ford, it's given us a lot of upside surprises so far, and we'll continue to develop it at a technically optimal pace.
I'll now shift to the Bakken Three Forks. Each of our 2011 quarterly calls had a business-as-usual tone to our Bakken Three Forks asset, even though we continue to be the largest Bakken oil producer in North Dakota. However, we've recently generated exciting and very significant results in 3 different parts of the play, indicating we have more potential upside and growth opportunities than we've previously indicated. The 3 focus areas are: First, in the last quarter, we mentioned early success in our partial core area with 320-acre downspacing compared to our original 640-acre spacing. We recently drilled 3 additional 320-acre downspaced wells, and all are successful with IP rates ranging from 992 to 1,393 barrels of oil per day. Working interest in these wells vary from 51% to 61%.
Additionally, production from the offsetting original 640-acre wells has doubled after the downspaced won after completions. The typical 640 acre well that had been online 4 to 5 years was producing 100 to 200 barrels of oil per day before the downspace-ed well was drilled, and it's currently making 200 to 400 barrels of oil per day. This gives us production gain from both the new infill wells and the older producing wells. Based on these results, we'll implement 320 acre downspacing throughout our core area, and we'll also test 160 acre downspacing.
In our Bakken Lite area, our original development plan was on 320 acres. And by next quarter, we'll have some 160 acre downspacing results.
In summary, the downspacing is working and the reserve impact will likely be larger than the 50 million net barrels of oil we indicated on the February call.
Second, we continue to achieve excellent results in our Antelope Extension area, which is 25 miles southwest of our core area. Both the Bakken and Three Forks are productive in this acreage. We've recently drilled a group of Clarks Creek wells. Four wells were drilled in the Three Forks formation and had IP rates of 926, 1,393, 1,455 and 3,415 barrels of oil per day, plus 1 million to 3 million per day of rich gas. Our Bakken well we recently drilled in this same area had an IP rate of 2,300 barrels of oil per day with similarly associated rich gas. We have 100% working interest in all these wells. These results are better than we expected.
Third, in Far Eastern Montana and Western North Dakota in our Diamond Point and Stateline areas, we've recently completed 7 wells that IP that rates between 540 and 1,100 barrels of oil per day. We have an average 63% working interest in this area. All 7 wells have high rock quality that we expected, and this opens up a brand new large development area for us where we have identified over 200 drilling locations.
Additionally, in late April, we commenced 2 waterflood pilots in our Core Parshall Field to try to improve our current approximately 8% recovery factor, and we expect to have preliminary results by year-end 2012.
In summary, we're much more excited than we were a year ago about our remaining Bakken and Three Forks potential.
Moving to our Wolfcamp and Leonard plays. Our press release highlighted some individual well results, which are consistent with previous quarters. Because of the timing of our pattern drilling, we expect our 2012 production from these plays to be back-end loaded. We're still experimenting with the optimum well spacing, and expect we'll have more specific detail regarding these plays later in the year. The 2 most asked investor questions we've received regarding the Wolfcamp are, one, is more than one interval productive? And 2, why are EOG's indicated 280 Mboe per well NAR reserve estimate smaller than those quoted by offset operators? To-date, most of our success has been in the middle Wolfcamp interval, but we do have 2 positive results from the upper interval. Regarding per well reserves, in our February IR presentation, we used an example of a well with a low net revenue interest EOG that was not comparable to peers who report gross reserves. On a gross 8 8 [ph] spaces, our typical Wolfcamp per well EUR is approximately 430 Mboe.
I'll also note that although university wells noted in the IR slide we posted last night, have lower initial production rates than in past quarters. That's because these wells tested against -- flowing against high line pressures. We consider that these wells are typical and of typical reserves to wells that we've reported in previous quarters, even though the IP rates are lower because of the higher back pressure.
Shifting to our Barnett Combo play. We continue to expect this to be our second largest liquids growth contributor in 2012, and we've highlighted typical wells in the press release. In the first quarter, we expanded the combo play with successful step out wells in 2 different directions. This play continues to slowly expand year after year. We plan to complete 200 net combo wells this year. And year-to-date well results are on track with expectations. I will note that we might have a possible gas processing pinch point in the June time frame. It will be touch and go for a month or so to see if we can add processing capacity quickly enough to handle our increasing rich gas volumes from this particular area.
In the Wyoming Powder River basin, we continue to have success with our horizontal drilling program in the Turner sandstone. Two recent wells are the Arbalest 59-3601H, which tested at 412 barrels of oil per day with 2.2 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. And the Arbalest 29-23H was tested at 208 barrels of oil per day with 1.6 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. We have approximately 93% working interest in these wells.
We continue to be bullish regarding our 240,000 net acres in the Powder River basin. The basin has multiple stack pays similar to the Permian Basin, all of which contained oil rich gas. We've had great results in the Turner sands, and we'll be testing other zones in addition to the Turner before year end.
Regarding other North American oil plays, we recently completed a nice Niobrara well in Laramie County, Wyoming. The Jubilee 6904 [ph] well produced 460 barrels of oil per day. After a few weeks online, we have 100% working interest.
In the mid-continent, we continue to generate consistent results from our Marmaton and Cleveland plays. Four recent Marmaton wells IP-ed at 470 to 770 barrels of oil a day each. We have 61% to 94% working interest in these wells. Two nice 51% working interest Cleveland wells recently IP-ed at 490 and 560 barrels of oil per day.
We're also continuing to look for a new greenfield North American liquids plays. We have captured a number of these, but as you know, we only disclose these plays when they are proven successful and we have all the acreage tied up. This same disclosure strategy worked for us in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Barnett Combo and Permian. It may frustrate investors on the front end because we don't hype unproved potential, but we think investors are happy with our actual order results at the end of the day. 
Recently, the trade press has highlighted an EOG transaction in the Tuscaloosa. We continue to have 0 interest in a JV in any of our Big 4 oil resource plays. However, over the last several months, each of our Big 4 oil place has gotten bigger, and we're accreting acreage in other areas. This will likely add to our CapEx opportunities over time. Therefore, we decided to work with an upside partner in our exploration efforts to the Louisiana Tuscaloosa marine shale oil play where we've teamed with Mitsubishi. We don't intend to provide specific funding details, but we hope it's win-win for both parties. To reiterate, any possible oil resource play JVs will be the exception rather than rule, and will definitely not be implemented in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Combo or Permian.
We've previously disclosed that approximately 10% of our 2012 CapEx will be devoted to dry gas drilling in Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River to hold acreage, and nothing has changed. We expect the percent of CapEx allocated to dry gas in 2013 will be approximately 5%. 
I'll make one interesting observation regarding our Barnett Shale gas production, which I believe are priced all horizontal resource plays both gas and oil. For 2 years, we've not only monitored drilling in our Johnson County Barnett gas field, and we've been able to observed production declines without interference from new wells. Over the past 2 years, the aggregate decline of wells has been slightly less than our forecast. This data should ameliorate concerns among investors regarding longer term declines from horizontal gas and oil resource plays.
Outside North America, we're continuing to work on our East Irish Sea Conwy oil development with an expected second half 2013 production start up. Production's commencement has slipped 6 months because of a delay in drilling rig arrival. Production will likely peak at 20,000 barrels of oil per day late in 2013. We own 100% of this project.
In Argentina, our first Vaca Muerta vertical well has been completed. The well was currently in the early flowback stages after frac and looks strong. We've also drilled and cased a horizontal well, and we'll frac it in June. In Trinida, we continue to project our 2012 gas sales will be flat with 2011. We don't have much news to report regarding our Kitimat project. We still expect FID no sooner than year end.
I'll now address 2 other EOG key differentiators: Crude-by-rail and sand plants. Our St. James crude-by-rail facility received its first Bakken crude oil shipment on April 15, allowing us to begin capturing the current $15 Bakken to LLS price uplift. We now have the capability to move our Bakken, Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp crude to either Cushing or St. James. Based on current differentials, the best NPV for our rail tanker fleet is to move our EOG Bakken oil to St. James and sell our Eagle Ford in Houston and Corpus Christi markets. We expect our St. James facility to handle 50,000 barrels a day by June, increasing to 70,000 barrels a day by year end. We've provided guidance on our U.S. oil differentials relative to WTI for the second quarter in yesterday's press release. 
For those modeling this net back benefit, remember that May will be a debugging month while we iron out the startup kinks, though likely to facility will run at intermittent capacity. We will not have the St. James facility fully operational for the entire second quarter, and not all of EOG's oil production will be total to St. James. As market conditions and differentials change, we have great flexibility and can rapidly revise where we sell our production and how we get our production to market.
Regarding frac sand, our new Wisconsin sand plant started up in January. And this plant, in addition to our other sand facilities gives us the capacity to now sell stores to majority of our 2012 domestic fracs. Our rough approximation of the annual savings is $500,000 per well times 600 wells or $300 million per year.
No other E&P company has boasted these differentiators, and only a very small minority has even one of the 2, which, combined with our first mover resource play advantage, gives us a big competitive advantage.
Now I'll discuss our 2012 business plan. Because we value consistency, I'm happy to report that there are no changes to the strategy that we articulated in February. This strategy is obviously working because we increased our full year liquids growth target from 30% to 33%. We continue to adhere to a low debt ratio and intend to limit our max net debt to cap to 30% and sell $1.2 billion of assets this year. Through May 1, we've closed on $565 million of sales and have approximately $600 million of sales in progress. So once we close on pending sales, we've essentially met our $1.2 billion target. Over the past 3 years, we've concentrated our assets by selling over 8,000 wells.
Part of our plan is to preserve a large dry gas resource play positions, and we're achieving that by devoting a small portion of our CapEx to Marcellus, Haynesville and Horn River lease retention drilling. In the Horn River Basin, we drilled 4 wells during the first quarter and the 3 wells remaining to drill in the second quarter. Once these are drilled, our leases will be held for 10 years. Our liquids plays are generating very strong results as evidenced by our outstanding organic liquids growth. This business plan will generate strong year-over-year EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow growth even with low gas prices. Remember, only 8% of this year's North American revenue is subject to spot gas prices. Even though some of our gas hedges roll off in 2013, because of our strong liquids growth, we expect only a small amount of 2013 North American revenues will emanate from unhedged gas. Simply put, we think we're better situated than any other large cap E&P to deal with the current natural gas price environment. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

For the first quarter 2012, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.9 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $171 million.
Total acquisitions for the quarter were $327,000. As mentioned, through May 1, proceeds from asset sales were $565 million. At the end of March 2012, total debt outstanding was $5.0  billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 28%.
At March 31, we had $294 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.7 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 27%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 38% and the deferred tax ratio was 56%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with earnings press release for the second quarter and full year 2012. For the second quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%.
We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year. Regarding price sensitivities, with our current hedged position in 2012, for each $1 moved in crude oil prices, net income is impacted by $29 million and cash flow is impacted by $43 million. For each $0.10 move in natural gas prices, net income is impacted by $10 million and cash flow is impacted by $14 million. 
Now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Now I'll provide some views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks.

Now I'll provide some views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply-demand balance is tight and the fundamentals dictate an average $105 WTI price in 2012. The upside pressures are mainly due to political. The downside risk is a second global recession. And for that contingency, we've recently increased our crude oil hedge position. We don't subscribe to the theory that North American oil growth will create a global surplus. We think a lot of the advertised but untested new North American liquids plays or even more show than subsequence or our NGL plays.
For the second half of 2012, we're approximately 24% hedged at $106.74 price. We continue to have a very cautious outlook regarding 2012 natural gas prices. And fortunately, as a percent of North American gas, we're 45% hedged at $5.44 for the second half of the year. We think the current rise in gas prices is a head fake but the storage overhang is just too massive.
As you know, we've been a big North American gas bear [ph] in the last several years, and we adjusted our gas investments accordingly in 2010, '11 and '12. Last year, our North American natural gas production declined 7%, and this year we project a 10% decline. This is likely the largest 2-year gas production decline of the peer group, so we're doing our part to balance the market. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are 6 points to take away from this call. First, the game plan we articulated several years ago is working. In the first quarter, our year-over-year GAAP EPS increased 131%, non-GAAP EPS increased 72%, adjusted EBITDAX was up 39% and discretionary cash flow increased 39%. This is on top of our peer leading full year 2011 versus 2010 growth in these new metrics.
Second, we continue to exhibit extremely strong oil and NGL growth for a company our size. First quarter crude and condensate growth was 49% year-over-year and total liquids were up 48%. This is on top of 52% crude and condensate growth and 48% total liquids organic growth for the full year of 2011 versus 2010. Accordingly, we've raised our full year 2012 liquids growth target to 33% while keeping CapEx flat. Third, we're on track to sell $1.2 billion of properties and keep our net debt to total cap below 30%.
Fourth, what can I say about the Eagle Ford except that it's an 800-pound gorilla developing into a 1,000-pound gorilla.
Fifth, the Bakken Three Forks is our upside surprise to the quarter, and we're considerably more optimistic about the next 10 years of this play than we were a year ago.
And finally, EOG has 2 very significant logistical advantages that put us in a class by itself, crude-by-rail and self-sourced frac sand. Together, these provide the opportunity for higher net backs, market flexibility and cost advantages far above what the estimated when we committed to these projects.
Thanks for listening. And now, we'll go to Q&A."

The Bakken Lite area downspacing, we don't know for sure whether that's going to work, and then the waterflood. But probably the biggest things that could make a difference there are the core area downspacing, which we already checked the box on that, and then the waterflood. Those are the ones that are going to be the big difference. It's not so much are we going to be trying to prove up the incremental acreage somewhere. It's really, really now, how best -- how dense a spacing can we drill on the acreage that we have, and then can we make a secondary recovery project work on that. So that's the way I'd look at it, but there's -- if we can get the -- particularly the waterflood to work, then we've got, I think, a significant upgrade in the likely reserves if we've got captured and the likely production we'll be generating out of the Bakken for the next decade, really."

We have several patterns that we're currently drilling and frac-ing and just starting to test that are on the lower spacing, below 65 acres per well. So we're going to take that kind of flow because that's pushing it pretty hard, and we really would like to get a couple of those patterns fully tested and developed before we expand that to overlarge, large areas. So that'll just take a little bit of time and we'll just kind of see how that goes as we progress. On the frac side, as you know, industry-wide, we are very aggressive on trying new techniques and new styles of frac technology and using microseismic and trying to increase the amount of lot that we are connecting each one of these horizontal wells. And so we're making very, very substantial and steady progress in the Eagle Ford. As Mark mentioned earlier, we are being more aggressive in some of the areas on our frac styles. In terms of sand, we're using different kinds of frac fluids and even different kinds of sand sizes in alternating the pump rates, as well as alternating the way we distribute the frac along the laterals and we're making really good progress. I would say much of the increases in the IP that you see on the wells are due to just better frac technology than we had a year ago. So we're just very pleased. We're also, as Mark mentioned, the rock quality in the Eagle Ford, it looks like we definitely captured the sweet spot. And so the quality of rock that we had to deal with and work with in the Eagle Ford is very, very, very good."

So they've all gotten bigger, some of them -- considerably bigger, some of them just a bit bigger. And then we continue to have an increasing list of greenfield new play ideas. And so we just decided that this 30% net debt to cap is a hard line for us. And we will just avail ourselves of some external financing on at least one selected oil play. And so I think on a go-forward basis, 2 things come out of -- you ought to conclude one is the 30% net debt to cap is not a number we take lightly. And the second thing is that the comment about not using external funding in the Big 4 plays is just totally inflexible. We're not going to change that at all.

We didn't expect that. Our theory is that when we frac those wells originally, which would've been the 640-acre wells 4, 5 years ago that looking back, we probably didn't get as efficient of a stimulation as we might have liked and that we now are going to bigger fracs today than what we did back then, and that in the downspaced well, we gave a bigger frac and we probably stimulated some of that area even around the 640-acre original well. So that's kind of -- that's one theory that seems to make the most sense to me, that we would frac new rock around even the older well. So it's kind of an extra bonus, really, on there, which kind of sinches the case for the downspacing  there, really. And then the other thing it tells us is that clearly the 640-acre original spacing was too wide. So it makes it kind of a slamdunk case for the 320-acre spacing, and then it just opens the question about is 320 still too wide? Should we investigate? So that'll be the next step we're looking into. On the spacing on both the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, clearly, what we did in retrospect is we started out with too wide a spacing. And in both of them now, we're densifying the spacing, and we identified until we've concluded okay, this is too dense of a spacing. And maybe in the Eagle Ford example maybe 65 acres is densed as we want to go, maybe 40 acres, we don't know. But I guess we'll really learn. The other way we could've done is we could have gone to ultradense spacing to start, and then, obviously, this is too dense and then work my way to wider spacing, but we're doing it the other way. So we'll just see how it plays it out, but we've concluded that the initial spacing was too wide, and we'll just work inwards until we concluded that in our case, this is too close in terms of spacing."

So right now, we're not writing off those prices and saying they're going to just degrade to nothingness.

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those for the Eagle Ford and Bakken, may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, COO; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included second quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our first quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow, then I'll provide operational results and our 2012 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure and I'll follow with our macro view and hedge position, and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in the press release, for the first quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $324 million or $1.20 per diluted share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's first quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $317.5 million or $1.17 per diluted share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $1.3 billion.
I'll now address our operational results and key plays. During the first quarter, all 3 of our production categories exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Our total crude and condensate production was up 49% year-over-year and total liquids were up 48% year-over-year. Additionally, the midpoint of our second quarter total crude and condensate guidance projects 42% year-over-year growth and 5% sequential growth. Our first quarter North American natural gas volumes declined 9% year-over-year, which is consistent with our projections.
Total company first quarter production from all sources was up 10% year-over-year. Our aggregate unit costs were in line with projections. For the full year 2012, we have increased our total company liquids growth target from 30% to 33%, consisting of 33% crude and condensate growth and 32% NGL growth. The higher liquids growth is a result of stronger Eagle Ford and Bakken production. This increases are our total company production growth target from the previous 5.5% to 7%. We have not changed our full year CapEx estimate.
As you know by now, we believe that total company production per debt adjusted share is a useless metric, given the current 42:1 oil to gas price ratio. EOG's focus is on year-over-year increases in EPS, EBITDAX and DCF, and our path to achieve this goal is strong crude oil growth. In the first quarter 2012, our year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was 131%, non-GAAP EPS increased 72%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 39% and DCF increased 39%. This is on top of the peer leading growth that we posted in these same metrics for the full year 2011 versus 2010 that I articulated on our year-end earnings call.
For the first quarter, 80% of our total company wellhead revenues emanated from liquids. In North America, 85% of wellhead revenues came from liquids. Of these liquids revenues, 87% are from crude and condensate and only 13% from NGLs.
This strong liquids revenue and volume growth is primarily generated by our 4 large horizontal domestic oil and liquids plays, which I'll now discuss starting with the Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford continues to be our 800-pound gorilla in terms of crude oil growth, and we still believe our position is the largest domestic net oil discovery in 40 years and generates the highest direct ATROR of any current large hydrocarbon play. We continue to be largest crude oil producer in the play, with 77,000 Boe per day average net production for March, 90% of which was liquids. 
Our press release again contains multiple new well results with IPs for individual wells in the 2,000 to 3,000 barrel oil per day range. Note that these are oil IPs, and if we included NGLs and natural gas, the barrel oil equivalent per day rates would be even higher because our oil IPs are much higher than those reported by offset operators. I've received several investor questions asking whether we're testing our wells on wide open chokes to generate artificially high oil rates. The simple answer is no. These are flow tests into our normal production equipment with a normal choke in the wellhead. We think the high initial rates are simply indicative of better wells as attested by our 49% year-over-year organic crude oil and condensate growth rate.
I'll now discuss 6 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, last quarter, we advised you that 65 to 90 acre downspacing was successful, and we'd increased the potential net recoverable reserve estimate from 900 million to 1.6 billion Boes.
Now that we have an additional 90 days of production history, we're even more comfortable with these downspacing conclusions. We're now testing space or tighting -- tighter than the current 65 to 90 acres, i.e. 40 acres, to determine if further densifying will be viable to increase the recovery factor and we'll likely have some results by year end.
Second, we continue to see an improvement in well performance from recent wells compared to wells completed just a year ago. This is likely due to better fracs and better placement of our laterals. This is occurring across essentially all our acreage. We've certainly seen this in our more prolific acreage where a year ago, we were highlighting wells with 1,500 barrel oil per day IP rates. And today, in those same areas, the IPs are 2,500 to 3,000 barrels of oil per day. These 2,500 to 3,000 barrel oil per day rates are holding up and have averaged 30-day rates of 1,500 barrel oil per day. We're also making these type of improvements in areas with lesser quality rock.
With the success in downspacing, we have identified at least 3,200 additional locations to drill. Based on the 300 net wells we plan to drill this year, this gives us an 11-year inventory. The reason we're not accelerating the drilling of this unusually large well inventory is the technological improvements we're making. If we're making better wells than we were a year ago, who's to say we may not make even better wells a year from now? So why rush to drill wells that may not be technically optimum? We're closely focused on balancing the present value of this asset versus this technical well improvement. And you'll hear more about this in subsequent quarters.
We've reduced the number of drilling days per well due to learning curve efficiencies and now need fewer rigs to drill the targeted 300 wells. Relative to the first quarter, our Eagle Ford drilling activity will be less frenetic for the remainder of the year as we reduce our rig count from the current 26 to 23 rigs.
Third, I continue to be impressed with the consistency of this play across the trend. We don't get a lot of geologic or reservoir surprises, and the few surprises we do get are generally more upside than downside.
Fourth. Now that our Wisconsin sand plant is operational, we're currently using 100% self-sourced sand in this play and saving about $500,000 a well. Because our sand is cheaper, our engineers are experimenting with bigger fracs to see the effect on initial flow rate and long-term reserves.
Fifth. During the past year, I've highlighted the possibility of product takeaway restrictions, but so far, we've been able to dodge these bottleneck bullets. We expect Enterprise to commission their new oil pipeline and gas processing plant next month. So we think the go-forward risk of takeaway curtailments has been considerably reduced.
And sixth. In early 2013, we expect to commence a dry gas injection pilot to determine whether this enhanced oil recovery technique will improve our current estimated 6% recovery factor. We expect to have preliminary results in late 2013.
To summarize the Eagle Ford, it's given us a lot of upside surprises so far, and we'll continue to develop it at a technically optimal pace.
I'll now shift to the Bakken Three Forks. Each of our 2011 quarterly calls had a business-as-usual tone for our Bakken Three Forks asset, even though we continue to be the largest Bakken oil producer in North Dakota. However, we've recently generated exciting and very significant results in 3 different parts of the play, indicating we have more potential upside and growth opportunities than we've previously indicated. The 3 focus areas are: First, in the last quarter, we mentioned early success in our partial core area with 320-acre downspacing compared to our original 640-acre spacing. We recently drilled 3 additional 320-acre downspaced wells, and all are successful with IP rates ranging from 992 to 1,393 barrels of oil per day. Working interest in these wells vary from 51% to 61%.
Additionally, production from the offsetting original 640-acre wells has doubled after the downspaced won [ph] after completions. The typical 640 acre well that had been online 4 to 5 years was producing 100 to 200 barrels of oil per day before the downspaced well was drilled, and is currently making 200 to 400 barrels of oil per day. This gives us production gain from both the new infill wells and the older producing wells. Based on these results, we'll implement 320 acre downspacing throughout our core area, and we'll also test 160 acre downspacing.
In our Bakken Lite area, our original development plan was on 320 acres. And by next quarter, we'll have some 160 acre downspacing results.
In summary, the downspacing is working and the reserve impact will likely be larger than the 50 million net barrels of oil we indicated on the February call. 
Second, we continue to achieve excellent results in our Antelope Extension area, which is 25 miles southwest of our core area. Both the Bakken and Three Forks are productive in this acreage. We've recently drilled a group of Clarks Creek wells. 4 wells were drilled in the Three Forks formation and had IP rates of 926, 1,393, 1,455 and 3,415 barrels of oil per day, plus 1 million to 3 million per day of rich gas. A Bakken well we recently drilled in this same area had an IP rate of 2,300 barrels of oil per day with similarly associated rich gas. We have 100% working interest in all these wells. These results are better than we expected.
Third, in Far Eastern Montana and Western North Dakota in our Diamond Point and Stateline areas, we've recently completed 7 wells that IPed at rates between 540 and 1,100 barrels of oil per day. We have an average 63% working interest in this area. All 7 wells have high rock quality that we expected, and this opens up a brand new large development area for us where we have identified over 200 drilling locations.
Additionally, in late April, we commenced 2 waterflood pilots in our Core Parshall Field to try to improve our current approximately 8% recovery factor and we expect to have preliminary results by year-end 2012.
In summary, we're much more excited than we were a year ago about our remaining Bakken and Three Forks potential.
Moving to our Wolfcamp and Leonard plays. Our press release highlighted some individual well results, which are consistent with previous quarters. Because of the timing of our pattern drilling, we expect our 2012 production from these plays to be back-end loaded. We're still experimenting with the optimum well spacing, and expect we'll have more specific detail regarding these plays later in the year. The 2 most asked investor questions we've received regarding the Wolfcamp are, one, is more than one interval productive? And 2, why are EOG's indicated 280 Mboe per well NAR reserve estimate smaller than those quoted by offset operators? To-date, most of our success has been in the middle Wolfcamp interval, but we do have 2 positive results from the upper interval. Regarding per well reserves, in our February IR presentation, we used an example of a well with a low net revenue interest to EOG that was not comparable to peers who report gross reserves. On a gross 8 8 [ph] spaces, our typical Wolfcamp per well EUR is approximately 430 Mboe.
I'll also note that although university wells noted in the IR slide we posted last night, have lower initial production rates than in past quarters. That's because these wells tested against -- flowing against high line pressures. We consider that these wells are typical and have typical reserves to wells that we've reported in previous quarters, even though the IP rates are lower because of the higher back pressure.
Shifting to our Barnett Combo play. We continue to expect this to be our second largest liquids growth contributor in 2012, and we've highlighted typical wells in the press release. In the first quarter, we expanded the combo play with successful step out wells in 2 different directions. This play continues to slowly expand year after year. We plan to complete 200 net combo wells this year. And year-to-date well results are on track with expectations. I will note that we might have a possible gas processing pinch point in the June time frame. It will be touch and go for a month or so to see if we can add processing capacity quickly enough to handle our increasing rich gas volumes from this particular area.
In the Wyoming Powder River basin, we continue to have success with our horizontal drilling program in the Turner sandstone. Two recent wells are the Arbalest 59-3601H, which tested at 412 barrels of oil per day with 2.2 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. And the Arbalest 29-23H, which tested at 208 barrels of oil per day with 1.6 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. We have approximately 93% working interest in these wells.
We continue to be bullish regarding our 240,000 net acres in the Powder River basin. The basin has multiple stack pays similar to the Permian Basin, all of which contained oil rich gas. We've had great results in the Turner sands, and we'll be testing other zones in addition to the Turner before year end.
Regarding other North American oil plays, we recently completed a nice Niobrara well in Laramie County, Wyoming. The Jubilee 6904 [ph] well produced 460 barrels of oil per day. After a few weeks online, we have 100% working interest.
In the mid-continent, we continue to generate consistent results from our Marmaton and Cleveland plays. Four recent Marmaton wells IPed at 470 to 770 barrels of oil a day each. We have 61% to 94% working interest in these wells. Two nice 51% working interest Cleveland wells recently IPed at 490 and 560 barrels of oil per day.
We're also continuing to look for a new greenfield North American liquids plays. We have captured a number of these, but as you know, we only disclose these plays when they’re proven successful and we have all the acreage tied up. This same disclosure strategy worked for us in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Barnett Combo and Permian. It may frustrate investors on the front end because we don't hype unproved potential, but we think investors are happy with our actual order results at the end of the day. 
Recently, the trade press has highlighted an EOG transaction in the Tuscaloosa. We continue to have 0 interest in a JV in any of our Big 4 oil resource plays. However, over the last several months, each of our Big 4 oil place has gotten bigger, and we're accreting acreage in other areas. This will likely add to our CapEx opportunities over time. Therefore, we decided to work with an outside partner in our exploration efforts for the Louisiana Tuscaloosa marine shale oil play where we've teamed with Mitsubishi. We don't intend to provide specific funding details, but we hope it's win-win for both parties. To reiterate, any possible oil resource play JVs will be the exception rather than rule, and will definitely not be implemented in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Combo or Permian.
We've previously disclosed that approximately 10% of our 2012 CapEx will be devoted to dry gas drilling in Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River to hold acreage, and nothing has changed. We expect the percent of CapEx allocated to dry gas in 2013 will be approximately 5%. 
I'll make one interesting observation regarding our Barnett Shale gas production, which I believe apprized all horizontal resource plays both gas and oil. For 2 years, we've not only monitored drilling in our Johnson County Barnett gas field, and we've been able to observe production declines without interference from new wells. Over the past 2 years, the aggregate decline of wells has been slightly less than our forecast. This data should ameliorate concerns among investors regarding longer term declines from horizontal gas and oil resource plays.
Outside North America, we're continuing to work on our East Irish Sea Conwy oil development with an expected second half 2013 production start up. Production's commencement has slipped 6 months because of a delay in drilling rig arrival. Production will likely peak at 20,000 barrels of oil per day late in 2013. We own 100% of this project.
In Argentina, our first Vaca Muerta vertical well has been completed. The well was currently in the early flowback stages after frac and looks strong. We've also drilled and cased a horizontal well, and we'll frac it in June. In Trinida, we continue to project that 2012 gas sales will be flat with 2011. We don't have much news to report regarding our Kitimat project. We still expect FID no sooner than year end.
I'll now address 2 other EOG key differentiators: Crude-by-rail and sand plants. Our St. James crude-by-rail facility received its first Bakken crude oil shipment on April 15, allowing us to begin capturing the current $15 Bakken in LLS price uplift. We now have the capability to move our Bakken, Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp crude to either Cushing or St. James. Based on current differentials, the best NPV for our rail tanker fleet is to move our EOG Bakken oil to St. James and sell our Eagle Ford in the Houston and Corpus Christi markets. We expect our St. James facility to handle 50,000 barrels a day by June, increasing to 70,000 barrels a day by year end. We've provided guidance on our U.S. oil differentials relative to WTI for the second quarter in yesterday's press release. 
For those modeling this net back benefit, remember that May will be a debugging month while we iron out the startup kinks, though likely to facility will run at intermittent capacity. We will not have the St. James facility fully operational for the entire second quarter, and not all of EOG's oil production will be sold to St. James. As market conditions and differentials change, we have great flexibility and can rapidly revise where we sell our production and how we get our production to market.
Regarding frac sand, our new Wisconsin sand plant started up in January. And this plant, in addition to our other sand facilities gives us the capacity to now sell source the majority of our 2012 domestic fracs. A rough approximation of the annual savings is $500,000 per well times 600 wells or $300 million per year.
No other E&P company has boasted these differentiators, and only a very small minority has even one of the 2, which, combined with our first mover resource play advantage, gives us a big competitive advantage.
Now I'll discuss our 2012 business plan. Because we value consistency, I'm happy to report that there are no changes to the strategy that we articulated in February. This strategy is obviously working because we increased our full year liquids growth target from 30% to 33%. We continue to adhere to a low debt ratio and intend to limit our max net debt to cap to 30% and sell $1.2 billion of assets this year. Through May 1, we've closed on $565 million of sales and have approximately $600 million of sales in progress. So once we close on pending sales, we've essentially met our $1.2 billion target. Over the past 3 years, we've concentrated our assets by selling over 8,000 wells.
Part of our plan is to preserve a large dry gas resource play positions, and we're achieving that by devoting a small portion of our CapEx to Marcellus, Haynesville and Horn River lease retention drilling. In the Horn River Basin, we drilled 4 wells during the first quarter and have 3 wells remaining to drill in the second quarter. Once these are drilled, our leases will be held for 10 years. Our liquids plays are generating very strong results as evidenced by our outstanding organic liquids growth. This business plan will generate strong year-over-year EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow growth even with low gas prices. Remember, only 8% of this year's North American revenue is subject to spot gas prices. Even though some of our gas hedges roll off in 2013, because of our strong liquids growth, we expect only a small amount of 2013 North American revenues will emanate from unhedged gas. Simply put, we think we're better situated than any other large cap E&P to deal with the current natural gas price environment. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

For the first quarter 2012, total cash, exploration and development expenditures were $1.9 billion excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $171 million.
Total acquisitions for the quarter were $327,000. As mentioned, through May 1, proceeds from asset sales were $565 million. At the end of March 2012, total debt outstanding was $5.0 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 28%.
At March 31, we had $294 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.7 billion or net debt to total cap ratio of 27%. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 38% and the deferred tax ratio was 56%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with earnings press release for the second quarter and full year 2012. For the second quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%.
We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the second quarter and for the full year. Regarding price sensitivities, with our current hedged position in 2012, for each $1 moved in crude oil prices, net income is impacted by $29 million and cash flow is impacted by $43 million. For each $0.10 move in natural gas prices, net income is impacted by $10 million and cash flow is impacted by $14 million. 
Now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Now I'll provide some views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply-demand balance is tight and the fundamentals dictate an average $105 WTI price in 2012. The upside pressures are mainly geopolitical. The downside risk is a second global recession. And for that contingency, we've recently increased our crude oil hedge position. We don't subscribe to the theory that North American oil growth will create a global surplus. We think a lot of the advertised but untested new North American liquids plays are even more show than subsequence or our NGL plays.
For the second half of 2012, we're approximately 24% hedged at $106.74 price. We continue to have a very cautious outlook regarding 2012 natural gas prices. And fortunately, as a percent of North American gas, we're 45% hedged at $5.44 for the second half of the year. We think the current rise in gas prices is a head fake but the storage overhang is just too massive.
As you know, we've been a big North American gas bear the last several years, and we adjusted our gas investments accordingly in 2010, '11 and '12. Last year, our North American natural gas production declined 7%, and this year we project a 10% decline. This is likely the largest 2-year gas production decline of the peer group, so we're doing our part to balance the market. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are 6 points to take away from this call. First, the game plan we articulated several years ago is working. In the first quarter, our year-over-year GAAP EPS increased 131%, non-GAAP EPS increased 72%, adjusted EBITDAX was up 39% and discretionary cash flows increased 39%. This is on top of our peer leading full year 2011 versus 2010 growth in these same metrics.
Second, we continue to exhibit extremely strong oil and NGL growth for a company our size. First quarter crude and condensate growth was 49% year-over-year and total liquids were up 48%. This is on top of 52% crude and condensate growth and 48% total liquids organic growth for the full year of 2011 versus 2010. Accordingly, we've raised our full year 2012 liquids growth target to 33% while keeping CapEx flat. Third, we're on track to sell $1.2 billion of properties and keep our net debt to total cap below 30%.
Fourth, what can I say about the Eagle Ford except that it's an 800-pound gorilla developing into a 1,000-pound gorilla.
Fifth, the Bakken Three Forks is our upside surprise to the quarter, and we're considerably more optimistic about the next 10 years of this play than we were a year ago.
And finally, EOG has 2 very significant logistical advantages that put us in a class by itself, crude-by-rail and self-sourced frac sand. Together, these provide the opportunity for higher net backs, market flexibility and cost advantages far above what we estimated when we committed to these projects.
Thanks for listening. And now, we'll go to Q&A."

The Bakken Lite area downspacing, we don't know for sure whether that's going to work, and then the Waterflood. But probably the biggest things that could make a difference there are the core area downspacing, which we already checked the box on that, and then the Waterflood. Those are the ones that are going to be the big difference. It's not so much are we going to be trying to prove up incremental acreage somewhere. It's really, really now, how best -- how dense a spacing can we drill on the acreage that we have, and then can we make a secondary recovery project work on that. So that's the way I'd look at it, but there's -- if we can get the -- particularly the Waterflood to work, then we've got, I think, a significant upgrade in the likely reserves that we’ve got captured and the likely production we'll be generating out of the Bakken for the next decade, really."

So that'll just take a little bit of time and we'll just kind of see how that goes as we progress. On the frac side, as you know, industry-wide, we are very aggressive on trying new techniques and new styles of frac technology and using microseismic and trying to increase the amount of rock that we are connecting each one of these horizontal wells. And so we're making very, very substantial and steady progress in the Eagle Ford. As Mark mentioned earlier, we are being more aggressive in some of the areas on our frac styles. In terms of sand, we're using different kinds of frac fluids and even different kinds of sand sizes in alternating the pump rates, as well as alternating the way we distribute the frac along the laterals and we're making really good progress. I would say much of the increases in the IPs that you see on the wells are due to just better frac technology than we had a year ago. So we're just very pleased. We're also, as Mark mentioned, the rock quality in the Eagle Ford, it looks like we definitely captured the sweet spot.

We didn't expect that. Our theory is that when we frac those wells originally, which would've been the 640-acre wells 4, 5 years ago that looking back, we probably didn't get as efficient of a stimulation as we might have liked and that we now are going to bigger fracs today than what we did back then, and that in the downspaced well, we gave a bigger frac and we probably stimulated some of that area even around the 640-acre original well. So that's kind of -- that's one theory that seems to make the most sense to me, that we would frac new rock around even the older well. So it's kind of an extra bonus, really, on there, which kind of sinches the case for the downspacing there, really. And the other thing it tells us is that clearly the 640-acre original spacing was too wide. So it makes it kind of a slam dunk case for the 320-acre spacing, and then it just opens the question about well is 320 still too wide? And should we investigate 160? So that'll be the next step we're look at too. On the spacing on both the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, clearly, what we did in retrospect is we started out with too wide of spacing and in both of them now, we're densifying the spacing, and we’ll densify it until we conclude okay, this is too dense of a spacing. And maybe in the Eagle Ford example maybe 65 acres is as dense as we want to go, maybe 40 acres is, we don't know. But I guess you live and you learn. The other way we could've done it is we could have gone to ultra-dense spacing to start, and then said this is too dense and then work the way to wider spacing, but we're doing it the other way. So we'll just see how it plays out, but we're concluded that the initial spacing was too wide, and we'll just work inwards until we conclude that now okay this is too close in terms of spacing."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast, including those for the Eagle Ford and Bakken, may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, COO; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included second quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our first quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow, then I'll provide operational results and our 2012 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure and I'll follow with our macro view and hedge position, and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in the press release, for the first quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $324 million or $1.20 per diluted share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income, to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's first quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $317.5 million or $1.17 per diluted share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the first quarter was $1.3 billion.
I'll now address our operational results and key plays. During the first quarter, all 3 of our production categories exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Our total crude and condensate production was up 49% year-over-year and total liquids were up 48% year-over-year. Additionally, the midpoint of our second quarter total crude and condensate guidance projects 42% year-over-year growth and 5% sequential growth. Our first quarter North American natural gas volumes declined 9% year-over-year, which is consistent with our projections.
Total company first quarter production from all sources was up 10% year-over-year. Our aggregate unit costs were in line with projections. For the full year 2012, we have increased our total company liquids growth target from 30% to 33%, consisting of 33% crude and condensate growth and 32% NGL growth. The higher liquids growth is a result of stronger Eagle Ford and Bakken production. This increases are our total company production growth target from the previous 5.5% to 7%. We have not changed our full year CapEx estimate.
As you know by now, we believe that total company production per debt adjusted share is a useless metric, given the current 42:1 oil to gas price ratio. EOG's focus is on year-over-year increases in EPS, EBITDAX and DCF, and our path to achieve this goal is strong crude oil growth. In the first quarter 2012, our year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was 131%, non-GAAP EPS increased 72%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 39% and DCF increased 39%. This is on top of the peer leading growth that we posted in these same metrics for the full year 2011 versus 2010 that I articulated on our year-end earnings call.
For the first quarter, 80% of our total company wellhead revenues emanated from liquids. In North America, 85% of wellhead revenues came from liquids. Of these liquids revenues, 87% are from crude and condensate and only 13% from NGLs.
This strong liquids revenue and volume growth is primarily generated by our 4 large horizontal domestic oil and liquids plays, which I'll now discuss starting with the Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford continues to be our 800-pound gorilla in terms of crude oil growth, and we still believe our position is the largest domestic net oil discovery in 40 years and generates the highest direct ATROR of any current large hydrocarbon play. We continue to be largest crude oil producer in the play, with 77,000 Boe per day average net production for March, 90% of which was liquids. 
Our press release again contains multiple new well results with IPs for individual wells in the 2,000 to 3,000 barrel oil per day range. Note that these are oil IPs, and if we included NGLs and natural gas, the barrel oil equivalent per day rates would be even higher because our oil IPs are much higher than those reported by offset operators. I've received several investor questions asking whether we're testing our wells on wide open chokes to generate artificially high oil rates. The simple answer is no. These are flow tests into our normal production equipment with a normal choke in the wellhead. We think the high initial rates are simply indicative of better wells as attested by our 49% year-over-year organic crude oil and condensate growth rate.
I'll now discuss 6 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, last quarter, we advised you that 65 to 90 acre downspacing was successful, and we'd increased the potential net recoverable reserve estimate from 900 million to 1.6 billion Boes.
Now that we have an additional 90 days of production history, we're even more comfortable with these downspacing conclusions. We're now testing space or tighting -- tighter than the current 65 to 90 acres, i.e. 40 acres, to determine if further densifying will be viable to increase the recovery factor and we'll likely have some results by year end.
Second, we continue to see an improvement in well performance from recent wells compared to wells completed just a year ago. This is likely due to better fracs and better placement of our laterals. This is occurring across essentially all our acreage. We've certainly seen this in our more prolific acreage where a year ago, we were highlighting wells with 1,500 barrel oil per day IP rates. And today, in those same areas, the IPs are 2,500 to 3,000 barrels of oil per day. These 2,500 to 3,000 barrel oil per day rates are holding up and have averaged 30-day rates of 1,500 barrel oil per day. We're also making these type of improvements in areas with lesser quality rock.
With the success in downspacing, we have identified at least 3,200 additional locations to drill. Based on the 300 net wells we plan to drill this year, this gives us an 11-year inventory. The reason we're not accelerating the drilling of this unusually large well inventory is the technological improvements we're making. If we're making better wells than we were a year ago, who's to say we may not make even better wells a year from now? So why rush to drill wells that may not be technically optimum? We're closely focused on balancing the present value of this asset versus this technical well improvement. And you'll hear more about this in subsequent quarters.
We've reduced the number of drilling days per well due to learning curve efficiencies and now need fewer rigs to drill the targeted 300 wells. Relative to the first quarter, our Eagle Ford drilling activity will be less frenetic for the remainder of the year as we reduce our rig count from the current 26 to 23 rigs.
Third, I continue to be impressed with the consistency of this play across the trend. We don't get a lot of geologic or reservoir surprises, and the few surprises we do get are generally more upside than downside.
Fourth. Now that our Wisconsin sand plant is operational, we're currently using 100% self-sourced sand in this play and saving about $500,000 a well. Because our sand is cheaper, our engineers are experimenting with bigger fracs to see the effect on initial flow rate and long-term reserves.
Fifth. During the past year, I've highlighted the possibility of product takeaway restrictions, but so far, we've been able to dodge these bottleneck bullets. We expect Enterprise to commission their new oil pipeline and gas processing plant next month. So we think the go-forward risk of takeaway curtailments has been considerably reduced.
And sixth. In early 2013, we expect to commence a dry gas injection pilot to determine whether this enhanced oil recovery technique will improve our current estimated 6% recovery factor. We expect to have preliminary results in late 2013.
To summarize the Eagle Ford, it's given us a lot of upside surprises so far, and we'll continue to develop it at a technically optimal pace.
I'll now shift to the Bakken Three Forks. Each of our 2011 quarterly calls had a business-as-usual tone for our Bakken Three Forks asset, even though we continue to be the largest Bakken oil producer in North Dakota. However, we've recently generated exciting and very significant results in 3 different parts of the play, indicating we have more potential upside and growth opportunities than we've previously indicated. The 3 focus areas are: First, in the last quarter, we mentioned early success in our partial core area with 320-acre downspacing compared to our original 640-acre spacing. We recently drilled 3 additional 320-acre downspaced wells, and all are successful with IP rates ranging from 992 to 1,393 barrels of oil per day. Working interest in these wells vary from 51% to 61%.
Additionally, production from the offsetting original 640-acre wells has doubled after the downspaced won [ph] after completions. The typical 640 acre well that had been online 4 to 5 years was producing 100 to 200 barrels of oil per day before the downspaced well was drilled, and is currently making 200 to 400 barrels of oil per day. This gives us production gain from both the new infill wells and the older producing wells. Based on these results, we'll implement 320 acre downspacing throughout our core area, and we'll also test 160 acre downspacing.
In our Bakken Lite area, our original development plan was on 320 acres. And by next quarter, we'll have some 160 acre downspacing results.
In summary, the downspacing is working and the reserve impact will likely be larger than the 50 million net barrels of oil we indicated on the February call. 
Second, we continue to achieve excellent results in our Antelope Extension area, which is 25 miles southwest of our core area. Both the Bakken and Three Forks are productive in this acreage. We've recently drilled a group of Clarks Creek wells. 4 wells were drilled in the Three Forks formation and had IP rates of 926, 1,393, 1,455 and 3,415 barrels of oil per day, plus 1 million to 3 million per day of rich gas. A Bakken well we recently drilled in this same area had an IP rate of 2,300 barrels of oil per day with similarly associated rich gas. We have 100% working interest in all these wells. These results are better than we expected.
Third, in Far Eastern Montana and Western North Dakota in our Diamond Point and Stateline areas, we've recently completed 7 wells that IPed at rates between 540 and 1,100 barrels of oil per day. We have an average 63% working interest in this area. All 7 wells have high rock quality that we expected, and this opens up a brand new large development area for us where we have identified over 200 drilling locations.
Additionally, in late April, we commenced 2 waterflood pilots in our Core Parshall Field to try to improve our current approximately 8% recovery factor and we expect to have preliminary results by year-end 2012.
In summary, we're much more excited than we were a year ago about our remaining Bakken and Three Forks potential.
Moving to our Wolfcamp and Leonard plays. Our press release highlighted some individual well results, which are consistent with previous quarters. Because of the timing of our pattern drilling, we expect our 2012 production from these plays to be back-end loaded. We're still experimenting with the optimum well spacing, and expect we'll have more specific detail regarding these plays later in the year. The 2 most asked investor questions we've received regarding the Wolfcamp are, one, is more than one interval productive? And 2, why are EOG's indicated 280 Mboe per well NAR reserve estimate smaller than those quoted by offset operators? To-date, most of our success has been in the middle Wolfcamp interval, but we do have 2 positive results from the upper interval. Regarding per well reserves, in our February IR presentation, we used an example of a well with a low net revenue interest to EOG that was not comparable to peers who report gross reserves. On a gross 8 8 [ph] spaces, our typical Wolfcamp per well EUR is approximately 430 Mboe.
I'll also note that although university wells noted in the IR slide we posted last night, have lower initial production rates than in past quarters. That's because these wells tested against -- flowing against high line pressures. We consider that these wells are typical and have typical reserves to wells that we've reported in previous quarters, even though the IP rates are lower because of the higher back pressure.
Shifting to our Barnett Combo play. We continue to expect this to be our second largest liquids growth contributor in 2012, and we've highlighted typical wells in the press release. In the first quarter, we expanded the combo play with successful step out wells in 2 different directions. This play continues to slowly expand year after year. We plan to complete 200 net combo wells this year. And year-to-date well results are on track with expectations. I will note that we might have a possible gas processing pinch point in the June time frame. It will be touch and go for a month or so to see if we can add processing capacity quickly enough to handle our increasing rich gas volumes from this particular area.
In the Wyoming Powder River basin, we continue to have success with our horizontal drilling program in the Turner sandstone. Two recent wells are the Arbalest 59-3601H, which tested at 412 barrels of oil per day with 2.2 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. And the Arbalest 29-23H, which tested at 208 barrels of oil per day with 1.6 million cubic feet a day of rich gas. We have approximately 93% working interest in these wells.
We continue to be bullish regarding our 240,000 net acres in the Powder River basin. The basin has multiple stack pays similar to the Permian Basin, all of which contained oil rich gas. We've had great results in the Turner sands, and we'll be testing other zones in addition to the Turner before year end.
Regarding other North American oil plays, we recently completed a nice Niobrara well in Laramie County, Wyoming. The Jubilee 6904 [ph] well produced 460 barrels of oil per day. After a few weeks online, we have 100% working interest.
In the mid-continent, we continue to generate consistent results from our Marmaton and Cleveland plays. Four recent Marmaton wells IPed at 470 to 770 barrels of oil a day each. We have 61% to 94% working interest in these wells. Two nice 51% working interest Cleveland wells recently IPed at 490 and 560 barrels of oil per day.
We're also continuing to look for a new greenfield North American liquids plays. We have captured a number of these, but as you know, we only disclose these plays when they’re proven successful and we have all the acreage tied up. This same disclosure strategy worked for us in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Barnett Combo and Permian. It may frustrate investors on the front end because we don't hype unproved potential, but we think investors are happy with our actual order results at the end of the day. 
Recently, the trade press has highlighted an EOG transaction in the Tuscaloosa. We continue to have 0 interest in a JV in any of our Big 4 oil resource plays. However, over the last several months, each of our Big 4 oil place has gotten bigger, and we're accreting acreage in other areas. This will likely add to our CapEx opportunities over time. Therefore, we decided to work with an outside partner in our exploration efforts for the Louisiana Tuscaloosa marine shale oil play where we've teamed with Mitsubishi. We don't intend to provide specific funding details, but we hope it's win-win for both parties. To reiterate, any possible oil resource play JVs will be the exception rather than rule, and will definitely not be implemented in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Combo or Permian.
We've previously disclosed that approximately 10% of our 2012 CapEx will be devoted to dry gas drilling in Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River to hold acreage, and nothing has changed. We expect the percent of CapEx allocated to dry gas in 2013 will be approximately 5%. 
I'll make one interesting observation regarding our Barnett Shale gas production, which I believe apprized all horizontal resource plays both gas and oil. For 2 years, we've not only monitored drilling in our Johnson County Barnett gas field, and we've been able to observe production declines without interference from new wells. Over the past 2 years, the aggregate decline of wells has been slightly less than our forecast. This data should ameliorate concerns among investors regarding longer term declines from horizontal gas and oil resource plays.
Outside North America, we're continuing to work on our East Irish Sea Conwy oil development with an expected second half 2013 production start up. Production's commencement has slipped 6 months because of a delay in drilling rig arrival. Production will likely peak at 20,000 barrels of oil per day late in 2013. We own 100% of this project.
In Argentina, our first Vaca Muerta vertical well has been completed. The well was currently in the early flowback stages after frac and looks strong. We've also drilled and cased a horizontal well, and we'll frac it in June. In Trinidad, we continue to project that 2012 gas sales will be flat with 2011. We don't have much news to report regarding our Kitimat project. We still expect FID no sooner than year end.
I'll now address 2 other EOG key differentiators: Crude-by-rail and sand plants. Our St. James crude-by-rail facility received its first Bakken crude oil shipment on April 15, allowing us to begin capturing the current $15 Bakken in LLS price uplift. We now have the capability to move our Bakken, Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp crude to either Cushing or St. James. Based on current differentials, the best NPV for our rail tanker fleet is to move our EOG Bakken oil to St. James and sell our Eagle Ford in the Houston and Corpus Christi markets. We expect our St. James facility to handle 50,000 barrels a day by June, increasing to 70,000 barrels a day by year end. We've provided guidance on our U.S. oil differentials relative to WTI for the second quarter in yesterday's press release. 
For those modeling this net back benefit, remember that May will be a debugging month while we iron out the startup kinks, though likely to facility will run at intermittent capacity. We will not have the St. James facility fully operational for the entire second quarter, and not all of EOG's oil production will be sold to St. James. As market conditions and differentials change, we have great flexibility and can rapidly revise where we sell our production and how we get our production to market.
Regarding frac sand, our new Wisconsin sand plant started up in January. And this plant, in addition to our other sand facilities gives us the capacity to now self source the majority of our 2012 domestic fracs. A rough approximation of the annual savings is $500,000 per well times 600 wells or $300 million per year.
No other E&P company has boasted these differentiators, and only a very small minority has even one of the 2, which, combined with our first mover resource play advantage, gives us a big competitive advantage.
Now I'll discuss our 2012 business plan. Because we value consistency, I'm happy to report that there are no changes to the strategy that we articulated in February. This strategy is obviously working because we increased our full year liquids growth target from 30% to 33%. We continue to adhere to a low debt ratio and intend to limit our max net debt to cap to 30% and sell $1.2 billion of assets this year. Through May 1, we've closed on $565 million of sales and have approximately $600 million of sales in progress. So once we close on pending sales, we've essentially met our $1.2 billion target. Over the past 3 years, we've concentrated our assets by selling over 8,000 wells.
Part of our plan is to preserve a large dry gas resource play positions, and we're achieving that by devoting a small portion of our CapEx to Marcellus, Haynesville and Horn River lease retention drilling. In the Horn River Basin, we drilled 4 wells during the first quarter and have 3 wells remaining to drill in the second quarter. Once these are drilled, our leases will be held for 10 years. Our liquids plays are generating very strong results as evidenced by our outstanding organic liquids growth. This business plan will generate strong year-over-year EPS, EBITDAX and discretionary cash flow growth even with low gas prices. Remember, only 8% of this year's North American revenue is subject to spot gas prices. Even though some of our gas hedges roll off in 2013, because of our strong liquids growth, we expect only a small amount of 2013 North American revenues will emanate from unhedged gas. Simply put, we think we're better situated than any other large cap E&P to deal with the current natural gas price environment. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

Now I'll turn it back to Mark."
269660,184282234,302737,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 09, 2012",2012-05-09,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Now I'll provide some views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply-demand balance is tight and the fundamentals dictate an average $105 WTI price in 2012. The upside pressures are mainl",523,"Thanks, Tim. Now I'll provide some views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply-demand balance is tight and the fundamentals dictate an average $105 WTI price in 2012. The upside pressures are mainly geopolitical. The downside risk is a second global recession. And for that contingency, we've recently increased our crude oil hedge position. We don't subscribe to the theory that North American oil growth will create a global surplus. We think a lot of the advertised but untested new North American liquids plays are even more show than subsequence or our NGL plays.
For the second half of 2012, we're approximately 24% hedged at $106.74 price. We continue to have a very cautious outlook regarding 2012 natural gas prices. And fortunately, as a percent of North American gas, we're 45% hedged at $5.44 for the second half of the year. We think the current rise in gas prices is a head fake but the storage overhang is just too massive.
As you know, we've been a big North American gas bear the last several years, and we adjusted our gas investments accordingly in 2010, '11 and '12. Last year, our North American natural gas production declined 7%, and this year we project a 10% decline. This is likely the largest 2-year gas production decline of the peer group, so we're doing our part to balance the market. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
Now let me summarize. In my opinion, there are 6 points to take away from this call. First, the game plan we articulated several years ago is working. In the first quarter, our year-over-year GAAP EPS increased 131%, non-GAAP EPS increased 72%, adjusted EBITDAX was up 39% and discretionary cash flows increased 39%. This is on top of our peer leading full year 2011 versus 2010 growth in these same metrics.
Second, we continue to exhibit extremely strong oil and NGL growth for a company our size. First quarter crude and condensate growth was 49% year-over-year and total liquids were up 48%. This is on top of 52% crude and condensate growth and 48% total liquids organic growth for the full year of 2011 versus 2010. Accordingly, we've raised our full year 2012 liquids growth target to 33% while keeping CapEx flat. Third, we're on track to sell $1.2 billion of properties and keep our net debt to total cap below 30%.
Fourth, what can I say about the Eagle Ford except that it's an 800-pound gorilla developing into a 1,000-pound gorilla.
Fifth, the Bakken Three Forks is our upside surprise to the quarter, and we're considerably more optimistic about the next 10 years of this play than we were a year ago.
And finally, EOG has 2 very significant logistical advantages that put us in a class by itself, crude-by-rail and self-sourced frac sand. Together, these provide the opportunity for higher net backs, market flexibility and cost advantages far above what we estimated when we committed to these projects.

I'd say that there's a -- 3 of those things are definitely working, core area downspacing, state line area, Antelope. The Bakken Lite area downspacing, we don't know for sure whether that's going to work, and then the Waterflood. But probably the biggest things that could make a difference there are the core area downspacing, which we already checked the box on that, and then the Waterflood. Those are the ones that are going to be the big difference. It's not so much are we going to be trying to prove up incremental acreage somewhere. It's really, really now, how best -- how dense a spacing can we drill on the acreage that we have, and then can we make a secondary recovery project work on that. So that's the way I'd look at it, but there's -- if we can get the -- particularly the Waterflood to work, then we've got, I think, a significant upgrade in the likely reserves that we’ve got captured and the likely production we'll be generating out of the Bakken for the next decade, really."

So we're going to take that kind of flow because that's pushing it pretty hard, and we really would like to get a couple of those patterns fully tested and developed before we expand that to -- over large, large areas. So that'll just take a little bit of time and we'll just kind of see how that goes as we progress. On the frac side, as you know, industry-wide, we are very aggressive on trying new techniques and new styles of frac technology and using microseismic and trying to increase the amount of rock that we are connecting each one of these horizontal wells. And so we're making very, very substantial and steady progress in the Eagle Ford. As Mark mentioned earlier, we are being more aggressive in some of the areas on our frac styles. In terms of sand, we're using different kinds of frac fluids and even different kinds of sand sizes in alternating the pump rates, as well as alternating the way we distribute the frac along the laterals and we're making really good progress. I would say much of the increases in the IPs that you see on the wells are due to just better frac technology than we had a year ago. So we're just very pleased. We're also, as Mark mentioned, the rock quality in the Eagle Ford, it looks like we definitely captured the sweet spot.

So they've all gotten bigger, some of them -- considerably bigger, some of them just a bit bigger. And then we continue to have an increasing list of greenfield new play ideas.

And so I think on a go-forward basis, 2 things come out of -- that you ought to conclude. One is the 30% net debt to cap is not a number we take lightly.

We didn't expect that. Our theory is that when we frac those wells originally, which would've been the 640-acre wells 4, 5 years ago that looking back, we probably didn't get as efficient of a stimulation as we might have liked and that we now are going to bigger fracs today than what we did back then, and that in the downspaced well, we gave a bigger frac and we probably stimulated some of that area even around the 640-acre original well. So that's kind of -- that's one theory that seems to make the most sense to me, that we would frac new rock around even the older well. So it's kind of an extra bonus, really, on there, which kind of cinches the case for the downspacing there, really. And the other thing it tells us is that clearly the 640-acre original spacing was too wide. So it makes it kind of a slam dunk case for the 320-acre spacing, and then it just opens the question about well is 320 still too wide? And should we investigate 160? So that'll be the next step we're look at too. On the spacing on both the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, clearly, what we did in retrospect is we started out with too wide of spacing and in both of them now, we're densifying the spacing, and we’ll densify it until we conclude okay, this is too dense of a spacing. And maybe in the Eagle Ford example maybe 65 acres is as dense as we want to go, maybe 40 acres is, we don't know. But I guess you live and you learn. The other way we could've done it is we could have gone to ultra-dense spacing to start, and then said this is too dense and then work the way to wider spacing, but we're doing it the other way. So we'll just see how it plays out, but we're concluded that the initial spacing was too wide, and we'll just work inwards until we conclude that now okay this is too close in terms of spacing."

But beginning in the second half of the year, we expect those prices to strengthen in a relative sense, and that we're a little more bullish than a lot of people that ethane prices will remain decent, probably in the 40% to 50% range of crude oil long term. So right now, we're not writing off those prices and saying they're going to just degrade to nothingness.

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included third quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I will initially review our second quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow, then Bill, Thomas and I will provide operational results and our second half 2012 and preliminary 2013 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure, and I'll follow with our macro view and hedge position and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the second quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $395.8 million or $1.47 per diluted share. For investors focused on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark to market impacts and certain nonrecurring items, as outlined in the press release, EOG's second quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $312.4 million or $1.16 per diluted share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the second quarter was $1.4 billion.
I'll now address as our operational results in key place. During the second quarter, all 3 of our production components approached or exceeded the high end of our 8-K guidance. Our total crude and condensate production was up 52% year-over-year and total liquids were up 49% year-over-year. Total EOG second quarter year-over-year production growth was 16.5%. North American gas was down 7% as predicted, but Trinidad gas was up 21% due to higher contract takes. Our aggregate unit costs were below projections.
As we did on the first quarter call, we are again increasing our full year 2012 total company liquids production growth target, this time from 33% to 35% consisting of 37% crude and condensate growth and 31% NGL growth. Our total company growth targets has also increased again from 7% to 9%.
As we've previously stated, because of the value and balance between crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, EOG's focus has been primarily on oil growth, which will continue to drive year-over-year increases in EPS, adjusted EBITDAX and DCF. The current imbalance between oil and gas is a 33:1 ratio.
In the second quarter, our year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was 34%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 19% and DCF increased 20%.
During the last 3 years, EOG has proven to be the large-cap independent E&P with the highest annual absolute organic crude oil growth rate with increases of 35%, 52% and projected 37% for this year. This growth is more amazing when you consider we've sold $3.2 billion of assets during this period. A chart in our most recent IR presentation shows EOG is industry leader in horizontal oil production by a 2:1 ratio over the number 2 producer.
Additionally, we have quite a substantial amount of North American natural gas reserves in large resource plays which we've inventoried until market conditions improve.
I'll now discuss the plays driving our extraordinarily high organic oil growth rate, starting with the Eagle Ford.
On our May earnings call, I described EOG's Eagle Ford position as our 800-pound gorilla. Based on results in the past 90 days, we still continue to believe our acreage is the largest domestic net oil discovery in the past 40 years and generates the highest after-tax reinvestment rate of return of any current large hydrocarbon play. We're the largest crude oil producer into play, with 103,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net production for June, 76% of which was oil and 14% was NGLs.
I'll now discuss 5 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, this has been our strongest quarter ever for completion of what I'll call monster oil wells, which I'll define as wells as having IP rates of 2,500 barrels of oil a day plus gas and NGLs. Our press release lists several of these, but by my count, we had 16 wells with initial production rates between 2,500 and 4,800 barrels of oil per day plus gas and NGLs this quarter, all in which EOG has 100% working interest.
The 16 monster wells in 1 quarter is particularly startling when we haven't seen any announcement by other Eagle Ford operators of even one such monster well to date. This is a testament to both the quality of our acreage and our completion expertise. 
During the quarter, we set a new record for the best single well, the Boothe 10H, which IP-ed at 4,820 barrels of oil per day with 7.5 million cubic feet per day of rich gas, which is the upper limit of our testing facilities.
Second, our rate of learning on optimizing oil recovery from this asset continues to dramatically improve. During the quarter, we made excellent technical progress in understanding how to get more oil out of the Eagle Ford and the results were showing up in improved well quality. For proprietary reasons, not going to go into specifics here other than to let you know I'm directionally very pleased with the results and they're showing up in our well results like in Boothe #10H.
Third, we plan to drill 330 net dwells this year, up from the 300 we've previously indicated. Because our drilling time for well has declined from 21 days in 2009 to the current 14 days, the drop from 23 to 20 rigs during the second half of the year. We've also front end loaded our 2012 Eagle Ford completion activity. So consequently, our rate of production growth will moderate in the second half.
In the first half of the year, we brought 179 wells to sales and plan to bring 145 wells to sales during the second half. These nuances have been taken into account in our second half guidance.
Fourth, we're now connected to the Eagle Ford -- to the Enterprise oil pipeline and the new Enterprise natural gas processing plant and pipelines. So the go-forward concern regarding take away bottlenecks is considerably reduced, essentially all of our Eagle Ford oil is currently priced off an LSS index. And fifth and finally, our logistics regarding our self sourced Wisconsin frac sand and have performed smoothly all quarter and our frac cost savings are still $0.5 million a well. However, I will note that we are now pumping bigger fracs and this has offset our cost savings. Combined with higher cost of, our average while cost is about $6 million per well higher than our $5.5 million target.
We previously given you typical economics noting we expected an 80% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return or $5.5 million well cost. For the first half of this year, our actual direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return exceeded 80% using the actual well cost, so our impressive economics are still intact.
To summarize the Eagle Ford, it continues to improve better than expected and I expect to see further improvements in well quality and reserve recovery. We continue to test high just spacing in the play. 
I'll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss the Bakken, Wolfcamp and Combo plays."
269660,212759048,339149,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2012",2012-08-03,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Last quarter, we have advised you were more optimistic about the Bakken and Three Forks as growth vehicles than in the past several years for 3 different reasons. I'll give you some updates regarding these reasons. First, 320-acre infill dri",628,"Thanks, Mark. Last quarter, we have advised you were more optimistic about the Bakken and Three Forks as growth vehicles than in the past several years for 3 different reasons. I'll give you some updates regarding these reasons. First, 320-acre infill drilling in the Bakken core continues to generate positive results. The press release shows from several new infill wells. The reason we're so excited about EOG's core area downsizing is that our 90,000 net acre core is the sweetest spot in the entire Bakken, and that's where 22 of the 30 best bucket and also the entire play have been drilled. So this is a rich honey ground for down spacing. With our back and acreage now held by production we are shifting our focus to increasing the recovery factor with down spacing and improved frac technology.
Second, we continue to have great results in our Antelope extension area, which is 25 miles southwest of the core area. Typical recent wells here are the Riverview 13031H and 43031H, which tested data rates of 1,834 barrels of oil per day and 1,863 barrels of oil per day, plus rich gas from the Three Forks and Bakken, respectively.
Third, the third growth area is our Stateline area where we recently completed the Stateline 85328H in Eastern Montana at 1,260 barrels of oil per day. With confirmed success, we estimate 200 potential locations in this area. As you can see, we have plenty of room to run in the Bakken and Three Forks. Additionally, we continue -- Bakken core project and we expect to have preliminary results by year end. 
Shifting to our Permian Basin, Wolfcamp and Leonard horizontal place, our results continue to be consistent with previous quarters. Recent Wolfcamp completions are the 1001H, 10002H, 10003H, and the University 43A on 20087H wells which IP-ed at 1,110, 856, 1,015 and 760 barrels of oil per day respectively, plus rich gas from the middle interval. We are currently completing a couple of Wolfcamp wells in the upper zone and expect results later in the year.
And then in the Mexico Leonard, the #2H and number 8 #1H tested at 722 and 540 barrels of oil per day, with 270 and 145 barrels per day of NGLs, and 1.9 million and 1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, respectively. We have 88% and 91% working interest and in these wells, respectively.
Also a significant Leonard step out the 100% working interest -- working interest Pitchblende 29 #1 was successful and tested at 1,026 barrels of oil per day, with 120 barrels per day of NGLs and 650 Mcf per day of gas. This well sets up a lot of additional locations.
To summarize, our Permian basin program is generating excellent results. We continue to test spacing and multiple targets in both plays, and we believe our 240,000 acres has significant upside for EOG.
In the Barnett Combo, our results are consistently good. In the second quarter, we completed a 4-well pattern on our Tatem and Tatem with full well rates of 400 and 600 barrels of oil per day with 100 to 140 barrels per day of NGLs and 700 to 900 Mcf per day of residual gas.
Our drilling times continued to improve, allowing us to drill more wells with fewer rigs, and we expect to complete 200 net wells this year. We've also been able to avoid any gas processing pinpoints that we were concerned about earlier in the year.
In addition to our big 4 oil plays, we continue to have smaller levels of horizontal oil activity in the Midcontinent, Powder River Basin, Southern Manitoba, et cetera, and we continue to test new orders onto oil play concepts.
Now I'll turn it back over to Mark."

Outside North America, we still expect out 100% working interest East of Conway crude oil development project start up in the second half of 2013. We recently installed the platform and expect to commence drilling in the first quarter of 2013. 
In Argentina, our first horizontal oil well has been completed and is under evaluation. We hope to have some definitive results on next quarter's call. In Trinidad, recent gas takes have been higher than expected due to higher indigenous gas demand. We expect some net in pneumonia plant maintenance downtime in the second half, and our full year guidance rejects only slightly higher full year 2012 Trinidad gas production compared to 2011.
There's nothing new to report on the LNG project. I'll now address 2 other key EOG differentiators, crude by rail and sand plants. Our St. James, Louisiana crude by rail facility has been operational since mid-April, and the impact shows up in our overall second quarter U.S. crude oil realizations versus WTI. The terminal construction cost has already paid out. Now that the Eagle Ford oil pipeline is operational, we've moved a number of rail cars to the Bakken, and we're primarily using the crewed by rail system to move our Bakken crude to Louisiana, capturing the current $20 differential between Clearbrook, Minnesota and St. James, Louisiana.
During July, we're selling about 20 -- excuse me, about 50,000 barrels growth at St. James, and we expect this volume to increase to approximately 80,000 barrels of oil a day by year end as more tank cars become available. 
Our Wisconsin frac senses that is also working as planned. The first sand shipments began late last year and in combination with our Fort Worth plant is currently providing our frac sand needs for more than 700 wells this year. Most importantly, the sand cost savings our Eagle Ford program is still $0.5 million a well.
We've recently had several investor questions regarding NGLs and ethane rejection. In the second quarter and also in July, we experienced only minor NGL curtailments. Most of our NGLs are processed at Mont Belvieu and not Conway. During the past few weeks, we've seen ethane prices rise at ethylene plants that come online after the planned maintenance shut-ins of the first half of the year. As a reminder, in the second quarter only 9% of EOG's in North American revenue emanated from NGLs, with  78% emanating from crude oil.
Now I'll discuss our second half 2012 and preliminary 2013 business plan. Because we're happy with our first half results, we're making only a few minor changes to our original 2012 plan. In the Eagle Ford that, we plan to shift part of our drilling activity to the West, and we'll be drilling a number of lower working interest wells. We've also reduced the number of rigs with the increased drilling efficiencies.
On the natural gas side, the changes to our plan and involve dry gas drilling. As previously disclosed, we've planned to spend about 10% of our CapEx this year, or about $750 million, on dry gas drilling in the Haynesville, River and Marcellus, and HBP our acreage positions.
Essentially, all of these gas resource plays will be in good shape by year end 2012 as far as acreage holding.
We also noted we would like to spend 5% on dry gas drilling next year. We now feel that our natural gas expenditures this year will lockup essentially all of the dry gas acreage we plan to keep. And that unless 2013 gas prices rise dramatically, we will spend very minimal CapEx in 2013 on dry gas drilling. We will likely run only 1 dry gas rig next year. This will allow us to concentrate 2013 on oil and rich gas reinvestment opportunities, while holding all of our quality multi-Tcf North American gas acreage.
We expect to sell between $1.2 billion and $1.25 billion of properties this year, and through the end of July, we've closed on $1.2 billion of sales. Our single biggest sale involved our outside operated Bakken properties, which closed in the second quarter. Even with these sales, many of which involve Euler NGL production, we've increased our 2012 crude oil and liquids production growth target. 
We are considering doing a joint venture on at least 1 additional horizontal oil development play, but it won't be one of our big 4, in other words not the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian Basin, or Barnett Combo plays.
Our current net debt level is 26%, and for 2013, we anticipate living within our self-imposed 30% max net debt to capital guideline and not issuing any equity.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

Now I'll provide our views regarding macro hedging and concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply demand balance is tight and we expect prices to strengthen throughout the remainder of the year. Two recent concerns I've heard from oil bearer involve horizontal shale wells. One concern is will the U.S. create enough shale oil to affect global supply. EOG's forecast is an increase in EOS of 2 million barrels of oil per day by 2015, which we believe will not impact a $90 million-barrel of oil per day global market. We think there are only 3 consequential horizontal oil plays in North America: The Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian, and all other alleged oil plays or either inconsequential on a national scale or really NGL plays. A picture is worth a thousand words. And Slide 7 -- if you take a look at Slide 7 on our website, it makes this blindingly obvious that there's only 3 plays that are meaningful in terms of U.S. oil impact.
The second concern relates to possible international horizontal oil shale plays and the potential impact on supply. My answer there is maybe it will happen, but that's not likely for another 10 years at least. Remember, it's been 10 years since horizontal drilling on shale gas in the Barnett, and no one yet has found commercial shale gas outside North America. Also the key to commercial shale oil or gas is the ability to drill thousands of wells at low well cost, and whether this can be done internationally, is likely problematic.
For August to December 2012, we're approximately 22% hedged at $106.69 price. We've recently begun to layer in 2013 hedges and currently have 16,000 barrels a day hedged at $98.12 for the first half 2013.
We continue to have a cautious long-term view regarding North American gas, but we do believe the 2012 marks from natural gas prices.
We're comfortably hedged in the second half of this year, 45% at $5.44 per MMBtu. For 2013, we have 150,000 MMBtu hedged at $4.79. We recently closed out our 2014 150,000 MMBtu natural gas hedge position. Please see the table included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
In summary, I want to leave you with 2 thoughts. First, how does the investor decide which company to own when it seems like every independent E&P is trying to become a liquids-rich coy. How to decide when every company is having new, often unproven or marginal liquids rich plays upon which they alleged to drill thousands of wells. It's really simple. Go with a company that's generating the results, quarter after quarter, year after year. In this business, there's a lot of hype. The results matter, and they're easy to measure.
And second, there's been a slight change to my retirement coming. The original plan was that I would keep the Chairman and CEO jobs until midyear 2013 when I would retire and handle both these jobs to Bill Thomas. The new plan is that in midyear 2013 I'll handle the CEO job, and I'll remain Chairman from 6 additional months until midyear 20 -- until year end 2013 when I retire. The only readthrough on this change is that psychologically after 31 years, it's a little harder for me to walk away from EOG cold turkey than I originally thought. Well, this plan provides a more gradual approach and an orderly transition.
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

And we'll furnish a much more detailed plan as we do every year on our year end earnings call in February that we'll have specific growth targets for both liquids and gas. But the predicates of the plan are clearly that the amount of dry gas drilling we're going to do next year is going to be pretty close to nothing on one rig really which is just going to be holding acreage in primarily in Bradford County and the Marcellus. And basically we're going to attempt to hold to the 30% net debt. We'll consider selling some additional properties and we're going to heavily find the oil plays and the NGL plays will be more -- and we'll just see what happens to NGL prices. But the oil plays are going to get the vast majority of the funding. And the big plays, they are there. They're going to get the funding, will be 1, Eagle Ford and 2, the Bakken because they're primarily oil. The Permian Basin, even though people think of as an oil play, is really a combo play, as of course is our Barnett Combo so. Both the Wolfcamp and the Leonard have about 40% of that production is oil and the rest of it is NGL. So what you can look for are those 2 plays, the Eagle Ford first, Bakken second are going to get the lion's share of the money. And then we look at some plays other than our big 4 plays. And if it makes sense, we may bring in a JV partner depending on what our cash flow, what our property sales balance is. So all we want to do really, Brian, is just signal to you that at this stage, the plan is clearly there will be a further ramp down of dry gas drilling. And the definite shift of capital even more heavily likely toward Eagle Ford and toward the Bakken and at some additional plays, which may look at oil or combo plays other than the big 4, we may look at bringing in some outside capital."

So that's why our overall production growth is going to be tempered. Total company oil production growth will be tempered a bit, as well is just the slowdown in our overall CapEx. In terms of the West, the wells in the West will not be quite as good as the wells in the East. There will still be wildly economic. But it's an average, you're not going to be getting 4,000 barrels of IP wells typically in the West, as you're going to get in the East. So we're just -- we're not expecting those kind of well profiles out there. But we expect quite good wells for sure. So we're just going to have to see with our recent frac improvements, we expect to see better wells in the West, and we've got 1 or 2 years in the West, so we'll see.

And also because of the number of completions. I quoted the number of completions in the second half versus the number of rigs we're running. So as you noticed, our burn rate in the first half on CapEx was $4.1 billion and we're trying to limit ourselves just from capital discipline to spending 75 or 76 for the full year. So we are consciously slowing down our CapEx. And never biggest CapEx consumer is the Eagle Ford. And the analogy I would give you is right now, EOG is like a coin-operated machine. You put in a lot of coins, and we are an oil-producing behemoth with 100% efficiency. You put in less coins, we don't produce as much oil. We have 0 inefficiencies no, expiration inefficiencies or anything like that and we're going to be putting in less coins in the second half than we put in the first half.

So as we drill wells closer and closer together, we're trying to measure what the EUR per well is going to be. And so we're very cautious on increasing the EUR until we really get the proper spacing. And that goes for really any of these plays. And the other thing I would say about the Wolfcamp is it's not, it's really in third place as far as rock quality. And it's clear to us we've completed I think 72 wells so far to date. And it's going to be more difficult than the Wolfcamp play to get the recovery factor up. It's not certainly as easy as the Eagle Ford play or the Bakken play to get really high recovery factors. So we're being very prudent, we're doing everything we can, technically, to make the play better and it's a really good play and we're very, very satisfied with our results there. But I would just be somewhat cautious on trying to extrapolate that we're going to get 6% or some really high number recovery factor out of Wolfcamp as we've done in the Eagle Ford and some of these other plays just because the rock quality and the difficulty there is kind a hard degree of difficulty."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included third quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our second quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow, then Bill, Thomas and I will provide operational results and our second half 2012 and preliminary 2013 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure, and I'll follow with our macro view and hedge position and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the second quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $395.8 million or $1.47 per diluted share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's second quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $312.4 million or $1.16 per diluted share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the second quarter was $1.4 billion.
I'll now address our operational results in key plays. During the second quarter, all 3 of our production components approached or exceeded the high end of our 8-K guidance. Our total crude and condensate production was up 52% year-over-year, and total liquids were up 49% year-over-year. Total EOG second quarter year-over-year production growth was 16.5%. North American gas was down 7%, as predicted, but Trinidad gas was up 21% due to higher contract takes. Our aggregate unit costs were below projections.
As we did on the first quarter call, we are again increasing our full year 2012 total company liquids production growth target, this time from 33% to 35%, consisting of 37% crude and condensate growth and 31% NGL growth. Our total company growth target has also increased again from 7% to 9%.
As we've previously stated, because of the value imbalance between crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, EOG's focus has been primarily on oil growth, which will continue to drive year-over-year increases in EPS, adjusted EBITDAX and DCF. The current imbalance between oil and gas is a 33:1 ratio. In the second quarter, our year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was 34%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 19% and DCF increased 20%.
During the last 3 years, EOG has proven to be the large-cap independent E&P with the highest annual absolute organic crude oil growth rate, with increases of 35%, 52% and projected 37% for this year. This growth is more amazing when you consider we've sold $3.2 billion of assets during this period. A chart in our most recent IR presentation shows EOG is the industry leader in horizontal oil production by a 2:1 ratio over the #2 producer.  Additionally, we have quite a substantial amount of North American natural gas reserves in large resource plays, which we've inventoried until market conditions improve.
I'll now discuss the plays driving our extraordinarily high organic oil growth rate, starting with the Eagle Ford. On our May earnings call, I described EOG's Eagle Ford position as our 800-pound gorilla. Based on the results in the past 90 days, we still continue to believe our acreage is the largest domestic net oil discovery in the past 40 years and generates the highest after-tax reinvestment rate of return of any current large hydrocarbon play. We're the largest crude oil producer in the play, with 103,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net production for June, 76% of which was oil and 14% was NGLs.
I'll now discuss 5 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, this has been our strongest quarter ever for completion of what I'll call monster oil wells, which I'll define as wells having IP rates of 2,500 barrels of oil a day plus gas and NGLs. Our press release lists several of these, but by my count, we had 16 wells with initial production rates between 2,500 and 4,800 barrels of oil per day plus gas and NGLs this quarter, all in which EOG has 100% working interest.
The 16 monster wells in one quarter is particularly startling when we haven't seen any announcement by other Eagle Ford operators of even one such monster well to date. This is a testament to both the quality of our acreage and our completion expertise. 
During the quarter, we set a new record for the best single well, the Boothe 10H, which IP-ed at 4,820 barrels of oil per day with 7.5 million cubic feet a day of rich gas, which is the upper limit of our testing facilities.
Second, our rate of learning on optimizing oil recovery from this asset continues to dramatically improve. During the quarter, we made excellent technical progress in understanding how to get more oil out of the Eagle Ford, and the results are showing up in improved well quality. For proprietary reasons, I'm not going to go into specifics here other than to let you know I'm directionally very pleased with the results, and they're showing up in our well results like in Boothe #10H.
Third, we plan to drill 330 net wells this year, up from the 300 we've previously indicated. Because our drilling time for well has declined from 21 days in 2009 to the current 14 days, the drop from 23 to 20 rigs during the second half of the year. We also front-end loaded our 2012 Eagle Ford completion activity. So consequently, our rate of production growth will moderate in the second half. In the first half of the year, we brought 179 wells to sales and plan to bring 145 wells to sales during the second half. These nuances have been taken into account in our second half guidance.
Fourth, we're now connected to the Eagle Ford -- or excuse me, to the Enterprise oil pipeline and the new Enterprise natural gas processing plant and pipelines. So the go-forward concern regarding takeaway bottlenecks is considerably reduced. Essentially all of our Eagle Ford oil is currently priced off an OIX index. 
And fifth and finally, our logistics regarding our self-sourced Wisconsin frac sand have performed smoothly all quarter, and our frac cost savings are still $0.5 million a well. However, I will note that we are now pumping bigger fracs, and this has offset our cost savings. Combined with the higher cost of  gel, our average well cost is about $6 million per well, higher than our $5.5 million target.
We've previously given you typical economics, noting we expected an 80% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return or $5.5 million well cost. For the first half of this year, our actual direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return exceeded 80% using the actual well cost, so our impressive economics are still intact.
To summarize the Eagle Ford, it continues to improve better than expected, and I expect to see further improvements in well quality and reserve recovery. We continue to test hydro-spacing in the play. 
I'll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss the Bakken, Wolfcamp and Combo plays."

I'll give you some updates regarding these reasons. First, 320-acre infill",634,"Thanks, Mark. Last quarter, we advised you that we were more optimistic about the Bakken and Three Forks as growth vehicles than in the past several years for 3 different reasons. I'll give you some updates regarding these reasons. First, 320-acre infill drilling in the Bakken Core continues to generate positive results. The press release shows several new infill wells. The reason we're so excited about EOG's core area downsizing is that our 90,000 net acre core is the sweetest spot in the entire Bakken, and it's where 22 of the 30 best Bakken wells in the entire play have been drilled. So this is a rich honey ground for down-spacing. With our Bakken acreage now held by production, we are shifting our focus to increasing the recovery factor with down-spacing and improved frac technology.
Second, we continue to have great results in our Antelope Extension area, which is 25 miles southwest of the core area. Typical recent wells here are the Riverview 100-3031H and  04-3031H, which tested at rates of 1,834 barrels of oil per day and 1,863 barrels of oil per day plus rich gas from the Three Forks and Bakken, respectively.
Third, the third growth area is our Stateline area, where we recently completed the Stateline 08-3328H in Eastern Montana at 1,260 barrels of oil per day. With confirmed success, we estimate 200 potential locations in this area. As you can see, we have plenty of room to run in the Bakken and Three Forks. Additionally, we continue our Bakken Core waterflood pilot project, and we expect to have preliminary results by year end. 
Shifting to our Permian Basin, Wolfcamp and Leonard horizontal plays, our results continue to be consistent with previous quarters. The recent Wolfcamp completions are the Munson #1001H, #1002H and #1003H and the University 43A-#0807H wells, which IP-ed at 1,110, 856, 1,015 and 760 barrels of oil per day, respectively, plus rich gas from the middle interval. We are currently completing a couple of Wolfcamp wells in the upper zone and expect the results later in the year.
In the New Mexico Leonard, the Ross Draw 8 Fed #2H and  Ross Gulch 8 Fed Com #1H tested at 722 and 540 barrels of oil per day, with 270 and 145 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.9 million and 1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, respectively. We have 88% and 91% working interest in these wells, respectively.
Also a significant Leonard step-out, the 100% working interest Pitchblende 29 Fed Com #1 was successful and tested at 1,026 barrels of oil per day, with 120 barrels per day of NGLs and 650 Mcf per day of gas. This well sets up a lot of additional locations.
To summarize, our Permian Basin program is generating excellent results. We continue to test spacing and multiple targets in both plays, and we believe our 240,000 acres has significant upside for EOG.
In the Barnett Combo, our results are consistently good. In the second quarter, we completed a 4-well pattern on our Tatum and Tatum A units with initial full well rates of 400 and 600 barrels of oil per day, with 100 to 140 barrels per day of NGLs and 700 to 900 Mcf per day of residual gas.
Our drilling times continue to improve, allowing us to drill more wells with fewer rigs, and we expect to complete 200 net wells this year. We've also been able to avoid any gas processing pinch points that we were concerned about earlier in the year.
In addition to our big 4 oil plays, we continue to have smaller levels of horizontal oil activity in the Mid-Continent, Powder River Basin, southern Manitoba, et cetera, and we continue to test new horizontal oil play concepts.
Now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Outside North America, we still expect our 100% working interest in East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil development project to start up in the second half of 2013. We recently installed the platform and expect to commence drilling in the first quarter 2013. 
In Argentina, our first horizontal Vaca Muerta oil well has been completed and is under evaluation. We hope to have some definitive results on next quarter's call. In Trinidad, recent gas takes have been higher than expected due to higher indigenous gas demand. We expect some methanol and ammonia plant maintenance downtime in the second half, and our full year guidance projects only slightly higher full year 2012 Trinidad gas production compared to 2011. There's nothing new to report on the Kitimat LNG project. 
I'll now address 2 other key EOG differentiators, crude-by-rail and sand plants. Our St. James, Louisiana crude-by-rail facility has been operational since mid-April, and the impact showed up in our overall second quarter U.S. crude oil realizations versus WTI. The terminal construction cost is already paid up. Now that the Eagle Ford oil pipeline is operational, we've moved a number of rail cars to the Bakken, and we're primarily using the crude-by-rail system to move our Bakken crude to Louisiana, capturing the current $20 differential between Clear Brook, Minnesota and St. James, Louisiana.
During July, we're selling about 20 -- excuse me, about 50,000 barrels gross at St. James, and we expect this volume to increase to approximately 80,000 barrels of oil a day by year end as more tank cars become available. 
Our Wisconsin frac sand system is also working as planned. The first sand shipments began late last year and, in combination with our Fort Worth plant, is currently providing our frac sand needs for more than 700 wells this year. Most importantly, the sand cost savings to our Eagle Ford program is still $0.5 million a well.
We've recently had several investor questions regarding NGLs and ethane rejection. In the second quarter and also in July, we experienced only minor NGL curtailments. Most of our NGLs are processed at Mont Belvieu and not Conwy. During the past few weeks, we've seen ethane prices rise as ethylene plants have come online after the planned maintenance shut-ins of the first half of the year. As a reminder, in the second quarter, only 9% of EOG's North American revenue emanated from NGLs, with 78% emanating from crude oil.
Now I'll discuss our second half 2012 and preliminary 2013 business plan. Because we're happy with our first half results, we're making only a few minor changes to our original 2012 plan. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to shift part of our drilling activity to the west, and we'll be drilling a number of lower working-interest wells. We've also reduced the number of rigs with the increased drilling efficiencies.
On the natural gas side, the changes to our plan involve dry gas drilling. As previously disclosed, we plan to spend about 10% of our CapEx this year or about $750 million on dry gas drilling in the Haynesville, Horn River and Marcellus to and HBP our acreage positions. Essentially, all of these gas resource plays will be in good shape by year-end 2012 as far as acreage holding.
We also noted we would likely spend 5% on dry gas drilling next year. We now feel that our natural gas expenditures this year will lock up essentially all of the dry gas acreage we plan to keep and that unless 2013 gas prices rise dramatically, we will spend very minimal CapEx in 2013 on dry gas drilling. We will likely run only one dry gas rig next year. This will allow us to concentrate 2013 on oil and rich gas reinvestment opportunities while holding all of our quality multi-Tcf North American gas acreage.
We expect to sell between $1.2 billion and $1.25 billion of properties this year, and through the end of July, we've closed on $1.2 billion of sales. Our single biggest sale involved our outside-operated Bakken properties, which closed in the second quarter. Even with these sales, many of which involve oil or NGL production, we've increased our 2012 crude oil and liquids production growth target. 
We are considering doing a joint venture on at least one additional horizontal oil development play, but it won't be 1 of our big 4, in other words, not the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian Basin, or Barnett Combo plays.
Our current net debt level is 26%, and for 2013, we anticipate living within our self-imposed 30% max net debt-to-cap guideline and not issuing any equity.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

Year-to-date, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $3.8 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. Expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $316 million. Total acquisitions for the quarter were $108,000 and $435,000 for the first half. Through June 30, proceeds from asset sales were $1.1 billion and, as Mark mentioned, through the end of July proceeds were $1.2 billion. 
At the end of June 2012, total debt outstanding was $5.0 billion and the debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 27%. At June 30, we had $280 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.7 billion or net debt-to-total cap ratio of 26%. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 39%, and the deferred tax ratio was 67%. 
Yesterday, we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the third quarter and the full year 2012. For the third quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the third quarter and for the full year. Regarding price sensitivities, with our current hedge position for the second half of 2012, for each $1 move in crude oil prices, net income will be impacted by $14 million and cash flow will be impacted by $20.5 million. For each $0.10 move in natural gas prices, net income will be impacted by $4.3 million and cash will be impacted by $6.4 million.

Now I'll provide our views regarding macro hedging and the concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply-demand balance is tight, and we expect prices to strengthen throughout the remainder of the year. Two recent concerns I've heard from oil bears involve horizontal shale oil. One concern is will the U.S. create enough shale oil to affect global supply. EOG's forecast is an increase in the U.S. of 2 million barrels of oil per day by 2015, which, we believe, will not impact a 90 million barrel of oil a day global market. We think there are only 3 consequential horizontal oil plays in North America, the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian, and all other alleged oil plays are either inconsequential on a national scale or really NGL plays. A picture is worth a thousand words, and Slide 7 -- if you take a look at Slide 7 on our website, it makes this blindingly obvious that there's only 3 plays that are meaningful in terms of U.S. oil impact.
The second concern relates to possible international horizontal oil shale plays and their potential impact on supply. My answer there is maybe it will happen, but it's not likely for another 10 years at least. Remember, it's been 10 years since horizontal drilling on locked shale gas in the Barnett, and no one yet has found commercial shale gas outside North America. Also, the key to commercial shale oil or gas is the ability to drill thousands of wells at low per-well cost, and whether this can be done internationally is likely problematic.
For August to December 2012, we're approximately 22% hedged at $106.69 price. We've recently begun to layer in 2013 hedges and currently have 16,000 barrels a day hedged at $98.12 for the first half 2013.
We continue to have a cautious long-term view regarding North American gas, but we do believe that 2012 marks an aider for natural gas prices.
We're comfortably hedged for the second half of this year, 45% at $5.44 per MMBtu. For 2013, we have 150,000 MMBtu hedged at $4.79. We recently closed out our 2014 150,000 MMBtu natural gas hedge position. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
In summary, I want to leave you with 2 thoughts. First, how does the investor decide which company to own when it seems like every independent E&P is trying to become a liquids-rich company, how to decide when every company is having new, often unproven, or marginal liquids-rich plays upon which they allege they'll drill thousands of wells. It's really simple? Go with the company that's generating results quarter after quarter, year after year. In this business, there's a lot of hype. Results matter, and they're easy to measure.
And second, there's been a slight change to my retirement timing. The original plan was that I would keep the Chairman and CEO jobs until midyear 2013, when I will retire and hand over both these jobs to Bill Thomas. The new plan is that in midyear 2013, I'll hand over the CEO job to Bill and I'll remain Chairman for 6 additional months until midyear 20 -- excuse me, until year-end 2013, when I'll retire. The only readthrough on this change is that psychologically, after 31 years, it's a little harder for me to walk away from EOG cold turkey than I originally thought. Well, this plan provides a more gradual approach and orderly transition.
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

That'll have specific growth targets for both the liquids and gas. But the predicates of the plan are clearly that the amount of dry gas drilling we're going to do next year is going to be pretty close to nothing, only one rig, really, which is just going to be holding acreage primarily in Bradford County, in the Marcellus. And basically, we're going to attempt to hold to the 30% net debt. We'll consider selling some additional properties, and we're going to heavily fund the oil plays, and the NGL plays will be more -- we'll just see what happens to NGL prices. But the oil plays are going to get the vast majority of the funding. And the big plays there that are going to get the funding will be one, Eagle Ford and two, the Bakken because they're primarily oil. The Permian Basin, even though people think of it as an oil play, is really a combo play, as, of course, is our Barnett Combo. So both the Wolfcamp and the Leonard have -- about 40% of that production is oil, and the rest of it is NGL. So what you can look for are those 2 plays, the Eagle Ford, first, Bakken, second, are going to get the lion's share of the money. And then we'll look at some plays other than our big 4 plays. And if it makes sense, we may bring in a JV partner depending on what our cash flow, what our property sales balance is. So all we want to do, really, Brian, is just signal to you that at this stage, the plan is clearly, there will be a further ramp down of dry gas drilling and there'll be a definite shift of capital even more heavily likely toward the Eagle Ford and toward the Bakken and at some additional plays which -- we may look at oil or combo plays other than the big 4. We may look at bringing in some outside capital."

I mean, Leo, we haven't changed at this juncture from the average reserves per well, which we provided to people earlier, which is the 450 Mboe per well, net after royalty. Now obviously, some of these or most of these wells that are at north of 2,500 barrels of oil per day are considerably better reserves than 450. But over the entire acreage position, we're still sticking to that number now. Obviously, we've made some improvements, and it's possible that that number could go up with time. But as you know, we're pretty conservative. And as we've done with volume growth projections this year, we'd rather be on the conservative side. So all I can tell you is the numbers we provided you earlier that come out to the 1.6 billion barrels and the average reserves, 450 are still the numbers we prefer that you use. But hopefully, some of the comments we provided on the call will convey our enthusiasm that the Eagle Ford is a very unique rock in that the more time we spend with it, the more enthused we are about the recovery factors and the ultimate potential of that rock. But it's just going to take some time, some time for us, technically, to get our arms about that.

We've got all this acreage to hold, and so we just have to -- we're driven a bit where we locate the rigs by our acreage earning calendar, and that's why we're -- and some of the well -- a higher percentage of the wells we drilled in the second half will be at a lower working interest than -- generally, most the wells we drilled in the first  half year are 100% working interest, and we won't have that benefit in the second half of the year. So that's why our overall production growth is going to be tempered. Total company oil production growth will be tempered a bit, as well as just a slowdown in our overall CapEx. In terms of the West, the wells in the West, as a rule, will not be quite as good as the wells in the East. They'll still be wildly economic. But it's -- on average, you're not going to be getting 4,000 barrels a day IP wells typically in the West as you're going to get in the East. So we're just -- we're not expecting those kind of well profiles out there, but we expect quite good wells, for sure. So we're just going to have to see. With our recent frac improvements, we expect to see better wells this pass in the West, and we've got a year or 2 going to West, so we'll see. And we've done some drilling in the West all this year, and we found some quite good wells out there. So all this is ground into the plan, Brian. So what we're trying to do is not let you guys on the sell side take our first half results and extrapolate them to the second half and say, ""Gee, you're sandbagging, and your oil growth in the second half is going to be off the charts again.""

I'd just say the number of monster wells that we got in the second quarter that I bragged about, that was an extraordinarily high number of monster wells. We don't expect that we're going to see that in the third quarter. So to that degree, second quarter was maybe a little bit anomalous on there. So we're -- I'd say that there definitely is going to be a slowdown in the Eagle Ford growth, third quarter versus second quarter, because of the working interest issues and also because of the number of completions. I quoted the number of completions in the second half versus the -- and number of rigs we're running. So as you noticed, our burn rate in the first half on CapEx was at $4.1 billion, and we're trying to limit ourselves, just from capital discipline, to spending $7.5 billion or $7.6 billion for the full year. So we are consciously slowing down our CapEx. And our biggest CapEx consumer is the Eagle Ford. And the analogy I would give you is right now, EOG is like a coin-operated machine. You put in a lot of coins, and we are an oil-producing behemoth with 100% efficiency. You put in less coins, we don't produce as much oil. But we have 0 inefficiencies, no exploration inefficiencies or anything like that. And we're going to be putting in less coins in the second half than we put in in the first half, and so the rate of oil growth is going to slow down a bit. So it's just that simple."

And currently, in the Houston market, we're getting the same price essentially as if we were selling that oil in St. James, Louisiana. So we're getting pretty much St. James price. And then the Bakken, we continue to move a little bit of the Bakken oil on pipeline and selling it at Clear Brook just to keep some pipeline access, and that a little bit oil is getting -- suffering a severe discount, like the Bakken oil does out there. But the majority of our Bakken oil is getting moved by rail and sold as St. James. So essentially, the majority of both those areas, Bakken and Eagle Ford, is being sold at St. James prices.

And then it's the same, really, on the Wolfcamp or the Eagle Ford. When we're in the early stages on these wells, we're doing 2 things. We're trying to make better wells and we're also downspacing. So as we drill wells closer and closer together, we're trying to measure what the EUR per well is going to be. And so we're very cautious on increasing the EUR until we really get the proper spacing. And that goes for, really, any of these plays. And the other thing I will say about the Wolfcamp is it's not -- it's clearly in third place as far as rock quality. And it's cleared us -- we've completed, I think, 72 wells so far to date. And it's going to be more difficult in the Wolfcamp play to get the recovery factor up. It's not certainly as easy as the Eagle Ford play or the Bakken play to get really high recovery factors. So we're being very prudent. We're doing everything we can, technically, to make the play better. And it's a really good play, and we're very, very satisfied with our results there. But I would just be somewhat cautious on trying to extrapolate that we're going to get 6% or some really high number recovery factor out of Wolfcamp as we've done in the Eagle Ford and some of these other plays just because the rock quality and the difficulty there got a higher degree of difficulty."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risk associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we include third quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our second quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow, then Bill, Thomas and I will provide operational results and our second half 2012 and preliminary 2013 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure, and I'll follow with our macro view and hedge position and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the second quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $395.8 million or $1.47 per diluted share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's second quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $312.4 million or $1.16 per diluted share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the second quarter was $1.4 billion.
I'll now address our operational results in key plays. During the second quarter, all 3 of our production components approached or exceeded the high end of our 8-K guidance. Our total crude and condensate production was up 52% year-over-year, and total liquids were up 49% year-over-year. Total EOG second quarter year-over-year production growth was 16.5%. North American gas was down 7%, as predicted, but Trinidad gas was up 21% due to higher contract takes. Our aggregate unit costs were below projections.
As we did on the first quarter call, we are again increasing our full year 2012 total company liquids production growth target, this time from 33% to 35%, consisting of 37% crude and condensate growth and 31% NGL growth. Our total company growth target has also increased again from 7% to 9%.
As we've previously stated, because of the value imbalance between crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, EOG's focus has been primarily on oil growth, which will continue to drive year-over-year increases in EPS, adjusted EBITDAX and DCF. The current imbalance between oil and gas is a 33:1 ratio. In the second quarter, our year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was 34%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 19% and DCF increased 20%.
During the last 3 years, EOG has proven to be the large-cap independent E&P with the highest annual absolute organic crude oil growth rate, with increases of 35%, 52% and projected 37% for this year. This growth is more amazing when you consider we've sold $3.2 billion of assets during this period. A chart in our most recent IR presentation shows EOG is the industry leader in horizontal oil production by a 2:1 ratio over the #2 producer.  Additionally, we have quite a substantial amount of North American natural gas reserves in large resource plays, which we've inventoried until market conditions improve.
I'll now discuss the plays driving our extraordinarily high organic oil growth rate, starting with the Eagle Ford. On our May earnings call, I described EOG's Eagle Ford position as our 800-pound gorilla. Based on the results in the past 90 days, we still continue to believe our acreage is the largest domestic net oil discovery in the past 40 years and generates the highest after-tax reinvestment rate of return of any current large hydrocarbon play. We're the largest crude oil producer in the play, with 103,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net production for June, 76% of which was oil and 14% was NGLs.
I'll now discuss 5 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, this has been our strongest quarter ever for completion of what I'll call monster oil wells, which I'll define as wells having IP rates of 2,500 barrels of oil a day plus gas and NGLs. Our press release lists several of these, but by my count, we had 16 wells with initial production rates between 2,500 and 4,800 barrels of oil per day plus gas and NGLs this quarter, all in which EOG has 100% working interest.
The 16 monster wells in one quarter is particularly startling when we haven't seen any announcement by other Eagle Ford operators of even one such monster well to date. This is a testament to both the quality of our acreage and our completion expertise. 
During the quarter, we set a new record for the best single well, the Boothe 10H, which IP-ed at 4,820 barrels of oil per day with 7.5 million cubic feet a day of rich gas, which is the upper limit of our testing facilities.
Second, our rate of learning on optimizing oil recovery from this asset continues to dramatically improve. During the quarter, we made excellent technical progress in understanding how to get more oil out of the Eagle Ford, and the results are showing up in improved well quality. For proprietary reasons, I'm not going to go into specifics here other than to let you know I'm directionally very pleased with the results, and they're showing up in our well results like the Boothe #10H.
Third, we plan to drill 330 net wells this year, up from the 300 we previously indicated. Because our drilling time per well has declined from 21 days in 2009 to the current 14 days, but dropped from 23 to 20 rigs during the second half of the year. We also front-end loaded our 2012 Eagle Ford completion activity. So consequently, our rate of production growth will moderate in the second half. In the first half of the year, we brought 179 wells to sales and plan to bring 145 wells to sales during the second half. These nuances have been taken into account in our second half guidance.
Fourth, we're now connected to the Eagle Ford -- or excuse me, to the Enterprise oil pipeline and the new Enterprise natural gas processing plant and pipelines. So the go-forward concern regarding takeaway bottlenecks is considerably reduced. Essentially all of our Eagle Ford oil is currently priced off an OIX index. 
And fifth and finally, our logistics regarding our self-sourced Wisconsin frac sand have performed smoothly all quarter, and our frac cost savings are still $0.5 million a well. However, I will note that we are now pumping bigger fracs, and this has offset our cost savings. Combined with the higher cost of gel, our average well cost is about $6 million per well, higher than our $5.5 million target.
We've previously given you typical economics, noting we expected an 80% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return or a $5.5 million well cost. For the first half of this year, our actual direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return exceeded 80% using the actual well cost, so our impressive economics are still intact.
To summarize the Eagle Ford, it continues to improve better than expected, and I expect to see further improvements in well quality and reserve recovery. We continue to test hydro-spacing in the play. 
I'll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss the Bakken, Wolfcamp and Combo plays."
269660,212759048,339849,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2012",2012-08-03,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. Last quarter, we advised you that we were more optimistic about the Bakken and Three Forks as growth vehicles than in the past several years for 3 different reasons. I'll give you some updates regarding these reasons. First, 320-acre infill",633,"Thanks, Mark. Last quarter, we advised you that we were more optimistic about the Bakken and Three Forks as growth vehicles than in the past several years for 3 different reasons. I'll give you some updates regarding these reasons. First, 320-acre infill drilling in the Bakken Core continues to generate positive results. The press release shows several new infill wells. The reason we're so excited about EOG's core area down-spacing is that our 90,000 net acre core is the sweetest spot in the entire Bakken, and it's where 22 of the 30 best Bakken wells in the entire play have been drilled. So this is a rich hunting ground for down-spacing. With our Bakken acreage now held by production, we are shifting our focus to increasing the recovery factor with down-spacing and improved frac technology.
Second, we continue to have great results in our Antelope Extension area, which is 25 miles southwest of the core area. Typical recent wells here are the Riverview 100-3031H and 04-3031H, which tested at rates of 1,834 barrels of oil per day and 1,863 barrels of oil per day plus rich gas from the Three Forks and Bakken, respectively.
Third, the third growth area is our Stateline area, where we recently completed the Stateline 08-3328H in Eastern Montana at 1,260 barrels of oil per day. With confirmed success, we estimate 200 potential locations in this area. As you can see, we have plenty of room to run in the Bakken and Three Forks. Additionally, we continue our Bakken Core waterflood pilot project, and we expect to have preliminary results by year end. 
Shifting to our Permian Basin, Wolfcamp and Leonard horizontal plays, our results continue to be consistent with previous quarters. The recent Wolfcamp completions are the Munson #1001H, #1002H and #1003H and the University 43A-#0807H wells, which IP-ed at 1,110, 856, 1,015 and 760 barrels of oil per day, respectively, plus rich gas from the middle interval. We are currently completing a couple of Wolfcamp wells in the upper zone and expect results later in the year.
In the New Mexico Leonard, the Ross Draw 8 Fed #2H and  Ross Gulch 8 Fed Com #1H tested at 722 and 540 barrels of oil per day, with 270 and 145 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.9 million and 1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, respectively. We have 88% and 91% working interest in these wells, respectively.
Also a significant Leonard step-out, the 100% working interest Pitchblende 29 Fed Com #1 was successful and tested at 1,026 barrels of oil per day, with 120 barrels per day of NGLs and 650 Mcf per day of gas. This well sets up a lot of additional locations.
To summarize, our Permian Basin program is generating excellent results. We continue to test spacing in multiple targets in both plays, and we believe our 240,000 acres has significant upside for EOG.
In the Barnett Combo, our results are consistently good. In the second quarter, we completed a 4-well pattern on our Tatum and Tatum A units with initial full well rates of 400 and 600 barrels of oil per day, with 100 to 140 barrels per day of NGLs and 700 to 900 Mcf per day of residual gas.
Our drilling times continue to improve, allowing us to drill more wells with fewer rigs, and we expect to complete 200 net wells this year. We've also been able to avoid any gas processing pinch points that we were concerned about earlier in the year.
In addition to our big 4 oil plays, we continue to have smaller levels of horizontal oil activity in the Mid-Continent, Powder River Basin, southern Manitoba, et cetera, and we continue to test new horizontal oil play concepts.
Now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Outside North America, we still expect our 100% working interest in East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil development project to start up in the second half of 2013. We recently installed the platform and expect to commence drilling in the first quarter 2013. 
In Argentina, our first horizontal Vaca Muerta oil well has been completed and is under evaluation. We hope to have some definitive results on next quarter's call. In Trinidad, recent gas takes have been higher than expected due to higher indigenous gas demand. We expect some methanol and ammonia plant maintenance downtime in the second half, and our full year guidance projects only slightly higher full year 2012 Trinidad gas production compared to 2011. There's nothing new to report on the Kitimat LNG project. 
I'll now address 2 other key EOG differentiators, crude-by-rail and sand plants. Our St. James, Louisiana crude-by-rail facility has been operational since mid-April, and the impact showed up in our overall second quarter U.S. crude oil realizations versus WTI. The terminal construction cost is already paid out. Now that the Eagle Ford oil pipeline is operational, we've moved a number of rail cars to the Bakken, and we're primarily using the crude-by-rail system to move our Bakken crude to Louisiana, capturing the current $20 differential between Clear Brook, Minnesota and St. James, Louisiana.
During July, we're selling about 20 -- excuse me, about 50,000 barrels gross at St. James, and we expect this volume to increase to approximately 80,000 barrels of oil a day by year end as more tank cars become available. 
Our Wisconsin frac sand system is also working as planned. The first sand shipments began late last year and, in combination with our Fort Worth plant, is currently providing our frac sand needs for more than 700 wells this year. Most importantly, the sand cost savings to our Eagle Ford program is still $0.5 million a well.
We've recently had several investor questions regarding NGLs and ethane rejection. In the second quarter and also in July, we experienced only minor NGL curtailments. Most of our NGLs are processed at Mont Belvieu and not Conwy. During the past few weeks, we've seen ethane prices rise as ethylene plants have come online after the planned maintenance shut-ins of the first half of the year. As a reminder, in the second quarter, only 9% of EOG's North American revenue emanated from NGLs, with 78% emanating from crude oil.
Now I'll discuss our second half 2012 and preliminary 2013 business plan. Because we're happy with our first half results, we're making only a few minor changes to our original 2012 plan. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to shift part of our drilling activity to the west, and we'll be drilling a number of lower working-interest wells. We've also reduced the number of rigs due to the increased drilling efficiencies.
On the natural gas side, the changes to our plan involve dry gas drilling. As previously disclosed, we plan to spend about 10% of our CapEx this year or about $750 million on dry gas drilling in the Haynesville, Horn River and Marcellus to HBP on our acreage positions. Essentially, all of these gas resource plays will be in good shape by year-end 2012 as far as acreage holding.
We also noted we would likely spend 5% on dry gas drilling next year. We now feel that our natural gas expenditures this year will lock up essentially all of the dry gas acreage we plan to keep and that unless 2013 gas prices rise dramatically, we will spend very minimal CapEx in 2013 on dry gas drilling. We will likely run only one dry gas rig next year. This will allow us to concentrate 2013 on oil and rich gas reinvestment opportunities while holding all of our quality multi-Tcf North American gas acreage.
We expect to sell between $1.2 billion and $1.25 billion of properties this year, and through the end of July, we've closed on $1.2 billion of sales. Our single biggest sale involved our outside-operated Bakken properties, which closed in the second quarter. Even with these sales, many of which involve oil or NGL production, we've increased our 2012 crude oil and liquids production growth target. 
We are considering doing a joint venture on at least one additional horizontal oil development play, but it won't be 1 of our big 4; in other words, not the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian Basin, or Barnett Combo plays.
Our current net debt level is 26%, and for 2013, we anticipate living within our self-imposed 30% max net debt-to-cap guideline and not issuing any equity.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

For the second quarter 2012, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $1.9 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $145 million.
Year-to-date, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $3.8 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. Expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $316 million. Total acquisitions for the quarter were $108,000 and $435,000 for the first half. Through June 30, proceeds from asset sales were $1.1 billion and, as Mark mentioned, through the end of July proceeds were $1.2 billion. 
At the end of June 2012, total debt outstanding was $5.0 billion and the debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 27%. At June 30, we had $280 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.7 billion or net debt-to-total cap ratio of 26%. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 39%, and the deferred tax ratio was 67%. 
Yesterday, we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the third quarter and the full year 2012. For the third quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the third quarter and for the full year. Regarding price sensitivities, with our current hedge position for the second half of 2012, for each $1 move in crude oil prices, net income will be impacted by $14 million and cash flow will be impacted by $20.5 million. For each $0.10 move in natural gas prices, net income will be impacted by $4.3 million and cash flow will be impacted by $6.4 million.

Now I'll provide our views regarding macro hedging and the concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply-demand balance is tight, and we expect prices to strengthen throughout the remainder of the year. Two recent concerns I've heard from oil bears involve horizontal shale oil. One concern is will the U.S. create enough shale oil to affect global supply. EOG's forecast is an increase in the U.S. of 2 million barrels of oil per day by 2015, which, we believe, will not impact a 90 million barrel of oil a day global market. We think there are only 3 consequential horizontal oil plays in North America: the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian, and that all other alleged oil plays are either inconsequential on a national scale or really NGL plays. A picture is worth 1,000 words, and Slide 7 -- if you take a look at Slide 7 on our website, it makes this blindingly obvious that there's only 3 plays that are meaningful in terms of U.S. oil impact.
The second concern relates to possible international horizontal oil shale plays and their potential impact on supply. My answer there is maybe it will happen, but it's not likely for another 10 years at least. Remember, it's been 10 years since horizontal drilling unlocked shale gas in the Barnett, and no one yet has found commercial shale gas outside North America. Also, the key to commercial shale oil or gas is the ability to drill thousands of wells at low per-well cost, and whether this can be done internationally is likely problematic.
For August to December 2012, we're approximately 22% hedged at $106.69 price. We've recently begun to layer in 2013 hedges and currently have 16,000 barrels a day hedged at $98.12 for the first half 2013.
We continue to have a cautious long-term view regarding North American gas, but we do believe that 2012 marks an aider [ph] for natural gas prices.
We're comfortably hedged for the second half of this year, 45% at $5.44 per MMBtu. For 2013, we have 150,000 MMBtu hedged at $4.79. We recently closed out our 2014 150,000 MMBtu natural gas hedge position. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
In summary, I want to leave you with 2 thoughts. First, how does an investor decide which company to own when it seems like every independent E&P is trying to become a liquids-rich company? How to decide when every company is touting new, often unproven, or marginal liquids-rich plays upon which they allege they'll drill thousands of wells. It's really simple. Go with the company that's generating results quarter after quarter, year after year. In this business, there's a lot of hype. Results matter, and they're easy to measure.
And second, there's been a slight change to my retirement timing. The original plan was that I would keep the Chairman and CEO jobs until midyear 2013, when I would retire and hand over both these jobs to Bill Thomas. The new plan is that in midyear 2013, I'll hand over the CEO job to Bill and I'll remain Chairman for 6 additional months until midyear 20 -- excuse me, until year-end 2013, when I'll retire. The only read-through on this change is that psychologically, after 31 years, it's a little harder for me to walk away from EOG cold turkey than I originally thought, so this plan provides a more gradual approach and orderly transition.
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

But the predicates of the plan are clearly that the amount of dry gas drilling we're going to do next year is going to be pretty close to nothing, only one rig, really, which is just going to be holding acreage primarily in Bradford County, in the Marcellus. And basically, we're going to attempt to hold to the 30% net debt. We'll consider selling some additional properties, and we're going to heavily fund the oil plays, and the NGL plays will be more -- we'll just see what happens to NGL prices. But the oil plays are going to get the vast majority of the funding. And the big plays there that are going to get the funding will be one, Eagle Ford and 2, the Bakken because they're primarily oil. The Permian Basin, even though people think of it as an oil play, it's really a combo play, as, of course, is our Barnett Combo. So both the Wolfcamp and the Leonard have -- about 40% of that production is oil, and the rest of it is NGL. So what you can look for are those 2 plays, the Eagle Ford, first, Bakken, second, are going to get the lion's share of the money. And then we'll look at some plays other than our big 4 plays. And if it makes sense, we may bring in a JV partner depending on what our cash flow, what our property sales balance is. So all we wanted to do, really, Brian, is just signal to you that at this stage, the plan is clearly, there will be a further ramp down of dry gas drilling and there'll be a definite shift of capital even more heavily likely toward the Eagle Ford and toward the Bakken and at some additional plays which -- we may look at the oil or combo plays other than the big 4. We may look at bringing in some outside capital."

But as you know, we're pretty conservative. And as we've done with volume growth projections this year, we'd rather be on the conservative side. So all I can tell you is the numbers we provided you earlier that come out to the 1.6 billion barrels and the average reserves, 450 are still the numbers we prefer that you use. But hopefully, some of the comments we provided on the call would convey our enthusiasm that the Eagle Ford is a very unique rock in that the more time we spend with it, the more enthused we are about the recovery factors and the ultimate potential of that rock.

We've got all this acreage to hold, and so we just have to -- we're driven a bit where we locate the rigs by our acreage earning calendar, and that's why we're -- and some of the well -- a higher percentage of the wells we drilled in the second half will be at a lower working interest than, generally, most the wells we drilled in the first half year are 100% working interest, and we won't have that benefit in the second half of the year. So that's why our overall production growth is going to be tempered. Total company oil production growth will be tempered a bit, as well as just a slowdown in our overall CapEx. In terms of the West, the wells in the West, as a rule, will not be quite as good as the wells in the East. They'll still be wildly economic. But it's -- on average, you're not going to be getting 4,000-barrel-a-day IP wells typically in the West as you're going to get in the East. So we're just -- we're not expecting those kind of well profiles out there, but we expect quite good wells, for sure. So we're just going to have to see. With our recent frac improvements, we expect to see better wells this pass in the West, and we've got a year or 2 going to West, so we'll see. And we've done some drilling in the West all this year, and we found some quite good wells out there. So all this is ground into the plan, Brian.

I quoted the number of completions in the second half versus the – on there and number of rigs we're running. So as you noticed, our burn rate in the first half on CapEx was at $4.1 billion, and we're trying to limit ourselves, just from capital discipline, to spending $7.5 billion or $7.6 billion for the full year. So we are consciously slowing down our CapEx. And our biggest CapEx consumer is the Eagle Ford. And the analogy I would give you is right now, EOG is like a coin-operated machine. You put in a lot of coins, and we are an oil-producing behemoth with 100% efficiency. You put in less coins, we don't produce as much oil. But we have 0 inefficiencies, no exploration inefficiencies or anything like that. And we're going to be putting in less coins in the second half than we put in, in the first half, and so the rate of oil growth is going to slow down a bit. So it's just that simple."

And currently, in the Houston market, we're getting the same price essentially as if we were selling that oil in St. James, Louisiana. So we're getting pretty much St. James price. And then the Bakken, we continue to move a little bit of the Bakken oil on pipeline and selling it at Clear Brook just to keep some pipeline access, and that little bit of oil is getting -- suffering a severe discount, like the Bakken oil does up there.

And then it's the same, really, on the Wolfcamp or the Eagle Ford. When we're in the early stages on these wells, we're doing 2 things. We're trying to make better wells but we're also downspacing. So as we drill wells closer and closer together, we're trying to measure what the EUR per well is going to be. And so we're very cautious on increasing the EUR until we really get the proper spacing. And that goes for, really, any of these plays. And the other thing I would say about the Wolfcamp is it's not -- it's clearly in third place as far as rock quality. And it's cleared us -- we've completed, I think, 72 wells so far to date. And it's going to be more difficult in the Wolfcamp play to get the recovery factor up. It's not certainly as easy as the Eagle Ford play or the Bakken play to get really high recovery factor. So we're being very prudent. We're doing everything we can, technically, to make the play better. And it's a really good play, and we're very, very satisfied with our results there. But I would just be somewhat cautious on trying to extrapolate that we're going to get 6% or some really high number recovery factor out of the Wolfcamp as we've done in the Eagle Ford and some of these other plays just because the rock quality and the difficulty there has got a higher degree of difficulty."

We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2012 earnings and operational results.
This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risk associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we include third quarter and full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our second quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow, then Bill, Thomas and I will provide operational results and our second half 2012 and preliminary 2013 business plan. Tim Driggers will then discuss financials and capital structure, and I'll follow with our macro view and hedge position and finish with concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release, for the second quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $395.8 million or $1.47 per diluted share. For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's second quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $312.4 million or $1.16 per diluted share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the second quarter was $1.4 billion.
I'll now address our operational results in key plays. During the second quarter, all 3 of our production components approached or exceeded the high end of our 8-K guidance. Our total crude and condensate production was up 52% year-over-year, and total liquids were up 49% year-over-year. Total EOG second quarter year-over-year production growth was 16.5%. North American gas was down 7%, as predicted, but Trinidad gas was up 21% due to higher contract takes. Our aggregate unit costs were below projections.
As we did on the first quarter call, we are again increasing our full year 2012 total company liquids production growth target, this time from 33% to 35%, consisting of 37% crude and condensate growth and 31% NGL growth. Our total company growth target has also increased again from 7% to 9%.
As we've previously stated, because of the value imbalance between crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, EOG's focus has been primarily on oil growth, which will continue to drive year-over-year increases in EPS, adjusted EBITDAX and DCF. The current imbalance between oil and gas is a 33:1 ratio. In the second quarter, our year-over-year increase in GAAP EPS was 34%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 19% and DCF increased 20%.
During the last 3 years, EOG has proven to be the large-cap independent E&P with the highest annual absolute organic crude oil growth rate, with increases of 35%, 52% and projected 37% for this year. This growth is more amazing when you consider we've sold $3.2 billion of assets during this period. A chart in our most recent IR presentation shows EOG is the industry leader in horizontal oil production by a 2:1 ratio over the #2 producer.  Additionally, we have quite a substantial amount of North American natural gas reserves in large resource plays, which we've inventoried until market conditions improve.
I'll now discuss the plays driving our extraordinarily high organic oil growth rate, starting with the Eagle Ford. On our May earnings call, I described EOG's Eagle Ford position as our 800-pound gorilla. Based on the results in the past 90 days, we still continue to believe our acreage is the largest domestic net oil discovery in the past 40 years and generates the highest after-tax reinvestment rate of return of any current large hydrocarbon play. We're the largest crude oil producer in the play, with 103,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net production for June, 76% of which was oil and 14% was NGLs.
I'll now discuss 5 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, this has been our strongest quarter ever for completion of what I'll call monster oil wells, which I'll define as wells having IP rates of 2,500 barrels of oil a day plus gas and NGLs. Our press release lists several of these, but by my count, we had 16 wells with initial production rates between 2,500 and 4,800 barrels of oil per day plus gas and NGLs this quarter, all in which EOG has 100% working interest.
The 16 monster wells in one quarter is particularly startling when we haven't seen any announcement by other Eagle Ford operators of even one such monster well to date. This is a testament to both the quality of our acreage and our completion expertise. 
During the quarter, we set a new record for the best single well, the Boothe 10H, which IP-ed at 4,820 barrels of oil per day with 7.5 million cubic feet a day of rich gas, which is the upper limit of our testing facilities.
Second, our rate of learning on optimizing oil recovery from this asset continues to dramatically improve. During the quarter, we made excellent technical progress in understanding how to get more oil out of the Eagle Ford, and the results are showing up in improved well quality. For proprietary reasons, I'm not going to go into specifics here other than to let you know I'm directionally very pleased with the results, and they're showing up in our well results like the Boothe #10H.
Third, we plan to drill 330 net wells this year, up from the 300 we previously indicated. Because our drilling time per well has declined from 21 days in 2009 to the current 14 days, but dropped from 23 to 20 rigs during the second half of the year. We also front-end loaded our 2012 Eagle Ford completion activity. So consequently, our rate of production growth will moderate in the second half. In the first half of the year, we brought 179 wells to sales and plan to bring 145 wells to sales during the second half. These nuances have been taken into account in our second half guidance.
Fourth, we're now connected to the Eagle Ford -- or excuse me, to the Enterprise oil pipeline and the new Enterprise natural gas processing plant and pipelines. So the go-forward concern regarding takeaway bottlenecks is considerably reduced. Essentially all of our Eagle Ford oil is currently priced off an OIX index. 
And fifth and finally, our logistics regarding our self-sourced Wisconsin frac sand have performed smoothly all quarter, and our frac cost savings are still $0.5 million a well. However, I will note that we are now pumping bigger fracs, and this has offset our cost savings. Combined with the higher cost of gel, our average well cost is about $6 million per well, higher than our $5.5 million target.
We've previously given you typical economics, noting we expected an 80% direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return or a $5.5 million well cost. For the first half of this year, our actual direct after-tax reinvestment rate of return exceeded 80% using the actual well cost, so our impressive economics are still intact.
To summarize the Eagle Ford, it continues to improve better than expected, and I expect to see further improvements in well quality and reserve recovery. We continue to test hydro-spacing in the play. 
I'll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss the Bakken, Wolfcamp and Combo plays."

I'll give you some updates regarding these reasons. First, 320-acre infill",633,"Thanks, Mark. Last quarter, we advised you that we were more optimistic about the Bakken and Three Forks as growth vehicles than in the past several years for 3 different reasons. I'll give you some updates regarding these reasons. First, 320-acre infill drilling in the Bakken Core continues to generate positive results. The press release shows several new infill wells. The reason we're so excited about EOG's core area down-spacing is that our 90,000 net acre core is the sweetest spot in the entire Bakken, and it's where 22 of the 30 best Bakken wells in the entire play have been drilled. So this is a rich hunting ground for down-spacing. With our Bakken acreage now held by production, we are shifting our focus to increasing the recovery factor with down-spacing and improved frac technology.
Second, we continue to have great results in our Antelope Extension area, which is 25 miles southwest of the core area. Typical recent wells here are the Riverview 100-3031H and 04-3031H, which tested at rates of 1,834 barrels of oil per day and 1,863 barrels of oil per day plus rich gas from the Three Forks and Bakken, respectively.
Third, the third growth area is our Stateline area, where we recently completed the Stateline 08-3328H in Eastern Montana at 1,260 barrels of oil per day. With confirmed success, we estimate 200 potential locations in this area. As you can see, we have plenty of room to run in the Bakken and Three Forks. Additionally, we continue our Bakken Core waterflood pilot project, and we expect to have preliminary results by year end. 
Shifting to our Permian Basin, Wolfcamp and Leonard horizontal plays, our results continue to be consistent with previous quarters. The recent Wolfcamp completions are the Munson #1001H, #1002H and #1003H and the University 43A-#0807H wells, which IP-ed at 1,110, 856, 1,015 and 760 barrels of oil per day, respectively, plus rich gas from the middle interval. We are currently completing a couple of Wolfcamp wells in the upper zone and expect results later in the year.
In the New Mexico Leonard, the Ross Draw 8 Fed #2H and  Ross Gulch 8 Fed Com #1H tested at 722 and 540 barrels of oil per day, with 270 and 145 barrels per day of NGLs and 1.9 million and 1 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, respectively. We have 88% and 91% working interest in these wells, respectively.
Also a significant Leonard step-out, the 100% working interest Pitchblende 29 Fed Com #1 was successful and tested at 1,026 barrels of oil per day, with 120 barrels per day of NGLs and 650 Mcf per day of gas. This well sets up a lot of additional locations.
To summarize, our Permian Basin program is generating excellent results. We continue to test spacing in multiple targets in both plays, and we believe our 240,000 acres has significant upside for EOG.
In the Barnett Combo, our results are consistently good. In the second quarter, we completed a 4-well pattern on our Tatum and Tatum A units with initial full well rates of 400 and 600 barrels of oil per day, with 100 to 140 barrels per day of NGLs and 700 to 900 Mcf per day of residual gas.
Our drilling times continue to improve, allowing us to drill more wells with fewer rigs, and we expect to complete 200 net wells this year. We've also been able to avoid any gas processing pinch points that we were concerned about earlier in the year.
In addition to our big 4 oil plays, we continue to have smaller levels of horizontal oil activity in the Mid-Continent, Powder River Basin, southern Manitoba, et cetera, and we continue to test new horizontal oil play concepts.
Now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Outside North America, we still expect our 100% working interest in East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil development project to start up in the second half of 2013. We recently installed the platform and expect to commence drilling in the first quarter 2013. 
In Argentina, our first horizontal Vaca Muerta oil well has been completed and is under evaluation. We hope to have some definitive results on next quarter's call. In Trinidad, recent gas takes have been higher than expected due to higher indigenous gas demand. We expect some methanol and ammonia plant maintenance downtime in the second half, and our full year guidance projects only slightly higher full year 2012 Trinidad gas production compared to 2011. There's nothing new to report on the Kitimat LNG project. 
I'll now address 2 other key EOG differentiators, crude-by-rail and sand plants. Our St. James, Louisiana crude-by-rail facility has been operational since mid-April, and the impact showed up in our overall second quarter U.S. crude oil realizations versus WTI. The terminal construction cost is already paid out. Now that the Eagle Ford oil pipeline is operational, we've moved a number of rail cars to the Bakken, and we're primarily using the crude-by-rail system to move our Bakken crude to Louisiana, capturing the current $20 differential between Clear Brook, Minnesota and St. James, Louisiana.
During July, we're selling about 20 -- excuse me, about 50,000 barrels gross at St. James, and we expect this volume to increase to approximately 80,000 barrels of oil a day by year end as more tank cars become available. 
Our Wisconsin frac sand system is also working as planned. The first sand shipments began late last year and, in combination with our Fort Worth plant, is currently providing our frac sand needs for more than 700 wells this year. Most importantly, the sand cost savings to our Eagle Ford program is still $0.5 million a well.
We've recently had several investor questions regarding NGLs and ethane rejection. In the second quarter and also in July, we experienced only minor NGL curtailments. Most of our NGLs are processed at Mont Belvieu and not Conwy. During the past few weeks, we've seen ethane prices rise as ethylene plants have come online after the planned maintenance shut-ins of the first half of the year. As a reminder, in the second quarter, only 9% of EOG's North American revenue emanated from NGLs, with 78% emanating from crude oil.
Now I'll discuss our second half 2012 and preliminary 2013 business plan. Because we're happy with our first half results, we're making only a few minor changes to our original 2012 plan. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to shift part of our drilling activity to the west, and we'll be drilling a number of lower working-interest wells. We've also reduced the number of rigs due to the increased drilling efficiencies.
On the natural gas side, the changes to our plan involve dry gas drilling. As previously disclosed, we plan to spend about 10% of our CapEx this year or about $750 million on dry gas drilling in the Haynesville, Horn River and Marcellus to HBP on our acreage positions. Essentially, all of these gas resource plays will be in good shape by year-end 2012 as far as acreage holding.
We also noted we would likely spend 5% on dry gas drilling next year. We now feel that our natural gas expenditures this year will lock up essentially all of the dry gas acreage we plan to keep and that unless 2013 gas prices rise dramatically, we will spend very minimal CapEx in 2013 on dry gas drilling. We will likely run only one dry gas rig next year. This will allow us to concentrate 2013 on oil and rich gas reinvestment opportunities while holding all of our quality multi-Tcf North American gas acreage.
We expect to sell between $1.2 billion and $1.25 billion of properties this year, and through the end of July, we've closed on $1.2 billion of sales. Our single biggest sale involved our outside-operated Bakken properties, which closed in the second quarter. Even with these sales, many of which involve oil or NGL production, we've increased our 2012 crude oil and liquids production growth target. 
We are considering doing a joint venture on at least one additional horizontal oil development play, but it won't be 1 of our big 4; in other words, not the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian Basin, or Barnett Combo plays.
Our current net debt level is 26%, and for 2013, we anticipate living within our self-imposed 30% max net debt-to-cap guideline and not issuing any equity.
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

Year-to-date, total cash exploration and development expenditures were $3.8 billion, excluding asset retirement obligations. Expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $316 million. Total acquisitions for the quarter were $108,000 and $435,000 for the first half.

At the end of June 2012, total debt outstanding was $5.0 billion and the debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 27%. At June 30, we had $280 million of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $4.7 billion or net debt-to-total cap ratio of 26%. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 39%, and the deferred tax ratio was 67%. 
Yesterday, we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the third quarter and the full year 2012. For the third quarter and full year, the effective tax rate is estimated to be 35% to 45%. We have also provided an estimated range of the dollar amount of current taxes that we expect to record during the third quarter and for the full year. Regarding price sensitivities, with our current hedge position for the second half of 2012, for each $1 move in crude oil prices, net income will be impacted by $14 million and cash flow will be impacted by $20.5 million. For each $0.10 move in natural gas prices, net income will be impacted by $4.3 million and cash flow will be impacted by $6.4 million.

Now I'll provide our views regarding macro hedging and the concluding remarks. Regarding oil, we still think the global supply-demand balance is tight, and we expect prices to strengthen throughout the remainder of the year. Two recent concerns I've heard from oil bears involve horizontal shale oil. One concern is will the U.S. create enough shale oil to affect global supply. EOG's forecast is an increase in the U.S. of 2 million barrels of oil per day by 2015, which, we believe, will not impact a 90 million barrel of oil a day global market. We think there are only 3 consequential horizontal oil plays in North America: the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Permian, and that all other alleged oil plays are either inconsequential on a national scale or really NGL plays. A picture is worth a thousand words, and Slide 7 -- if you take a look at Slide 7 on our website, it makes this blindingly obvious that there's only 3 plays that are meaningful in terms of U.S. oil impact.
The second concern relates to possible international horizontal oil shale plays and their potential impact on supply. My answer there is maybe it will happen, but it's not likely for another 10 years at least. Remember, it's been 10 years since horizontal drilling unlocked shale gas in the Barnett, and no one yet has found commercial shale gas outside North America. Also, the key to commercial shale oil or gas is the ability to drill thousands of wells at low per-well cost, and whether this can be done internationally is likely problematic.
For August to December 2012, we're approximately 22% hedged at $106.69 price. We've recently begun to layer in 2013 hedges and currently have 16,000 barrels a day hedged at $98.12 for the first half 2013.
We continue to have a cautious long-term view regarding North American gas, but we do believe that 2012 marks an aider [ph] for natural gas prices.
We're comfortably hedged for the second half of this year, 45% at $5.44 per MMBtu. For 2013, we have 150,000 MMBtu hedged at $4.79. We recently closed out our 2014 150,000 MMBtu natural gas hedge position. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
In summary, I want to leave you with 2 thoughts. First, how does an investor decide which company to own when it seems like every independent E&P is trying to become a liquids-rich company? How to decide when every company is touting new, often unproven, or marginal liquids-rich plays upon which they allege they'll drill thousands of wells. It's really simple. Go with the company that's generating results quarter after quarter, year after year. In this business, there's a lot of hype. Results matter, and they're easy to measure.
And second, there's been a slight change to my retirement timing. The original plan was that I would keep the Chairman and CEO jobs until midyear 2013, when I would retire and hand over both these jobs to Bill Thomas. The new plan is that in midyear 2013, I'll hand over the CEO job to Bill and I'll remain Chairman for 6 additional months until midyear 20 -- excuse me, until year-end 2013, when I'll retire. The only read-through on this change is that psychologically, after 31 years, it's a little harder for me to walk away from EOG cold turkey than I originally thought, so this plan provides a more gradual approach and orderly transition.
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

But the predicates of the plan are clearly that the amount of dry gas drilling we're going to do next year is going to be pretty close to nothing, only one rig, really, which is just going to be holding acreage primarily in Bradford County, in the Marcellus. And basically, we're going to attempt to hold to the 30% net debt. We'll consider selling some additional properties, and we're going to heavily fund the oil plays, and the NGL plays will be more -- we'll just see what happens to NGL prices. But the oil plays are going to get the vast majority of the funding. And the big plays there that are going to get the funding will be one, Eagle Ford and two, the Bakken because they're primarily oil. The Permian Basin, even though people think of it as an oil play, it's really a combo play, as, of course, is our Barnett Combo. So both the Wolfcamp and the Leonard have -- about 40% of that production is oil, and the rest of it is NGL. So what you can look for are those 2 plays, the Eagle Ford, first, Bakken, second, are going to get the lion's share of the money. And then we'll look at some plays other than our big 4 plays. And if it makes sense, we may bring in a JV partner depending on what our cash flow, what our property sales balance is. So all we wanted to do, really, Brian, is just signal to you that at this stage, the plan is clearly, there will be a further ramp down of dry gas drilling and there'll be a definite shift of capital even more heavily likely toward the Eagle Ford and toward the Bakken and at some additional plays which -- we may look at the oil or combo plays other than the big 4. We may look at bringing in some outside capital."

But as you know, we're pretty conservative. And as we've done with volume growth projections this year, we'd rather be on the conservative side. So all I can tell you is the numbers we provided you earlier that come out to the 1.6 billion barrels and the average reserves, 450 are still the numbers we prefer that you use. But hopefully, some of the comments we provided on the call would convey our enthusiasm that the Eagle Ford is a very unique rock in that the more time we spend with it, the more enthused we are about the recovery factors and the ultimate potential of that rock.

We've got all this acreage to hold, and so we just have to -- we're driven a bit where we locate the rigs by our acreage earning calendar, and that's why we're -- and some of the well -- a higher percentage of the wells we drilled in the second half will be at a lower working interest than, generally, most the wells we drilled in the first half year are 100% working interest, and we won't have that benefit in the second half of the year. So that's why our overall production growth is going to be tempered. Total company oil production growth will be tempered a bit, as well as just a slowdown in our overall CapEx. In terms of the West, the wells in the West, as a rule, will not be quite as good as the wells in the East. They'll still be wildly economic. But it's -- on average, you're not going to be getting 4,000-barrel-a-day IP wells typically in the West as you're going to get in the East. So we're just -- we're not expecting those kind of well profiles out there, but we expect quite good wells, for sure. So we're just going to have to see. With our recent frac improvements, we expect to see better wells this pass in the West, and we've got a year or 2 going to West, so we'll see. And we've done some drilling in the West all this year, and we found some quite good wells out there. So all this is ground into the plan, Brian. So what we're trying to do is not let you guys on the sell side take our first half results and extrapolate them to the second half and say, ""EOG's sandbagging, and their oil growth in the second half is going to be off the charts again.""

I'd just say the number of monster wells that we got in the second quarter that I bragged about, that was an extraordinarily high number of monster wells. We don't expect that we're going to see that in the third quarter. So to that degree, second quarter was maybe a little bit anomalous on there. So we're -- I'd say that there definitely is going to be a slowdown in the Eagle Ford growth, third quarter versus second quarter, because of the working interest issues and also because of the number of completions. I quoted the number of completions in the second half versus the – on there and number of rigs we're running. So as you noticed, our burn rate in the first half on CapEx was at $4.1 billion, and we're trying to limit ourselves, just from capital discipline, to spending $7.5 billion or $7.6 billion for the full year. So we are consciously slowing down our CapEx. And our biggest CapEx consumer is the Eagle Ford. And the analogy I would give you is right now, EOG is like a coin-operated machine. You put in a lot of coins, and we are an oil-producing behemoth with 100% efficiency. You put in less coins, we don't produce as much oil. But we have 0 inefficiencies, no exploration inefficiencies or anything like that. And we're going to be putting in less coins in the second half than we put in, in the first half, and so the rate of oil growth is going to slow down a bit. So it's just that simple."

As to the question on the Wolfcamp reserves, Bill?"

And then it's the same, really, on the Wolfcamp or the Eagle Ford. When we're in the early stages on these wells, we're doing 2 things. We're trying to make better wells but we're also downspacing. So as we drill wells closer and closer together, we're trying to measure what the EUR per well is going to be. And so we're very cautious on increasing the EUR until we really get the proper spacing. And that goes for, really, any of these plays. And the other thing I would say about the Wolfcamp is it's not -- it's clearly in third place as far as rock quality. And it's cleared us -- we've completed, I think, 72 wells so far to date. And it's going to be more difficult in the Wolfcamp play to get the recovery factor up. It's not certainly as easy as the Eagle Ford play or the Bakken play to get really high recovery factor. So we're being very prudent. We're doing everything we can, technically, to make the play better. And it's a really good play, and we're very, very satisfied with our results there. But I would just be somewhat cautious on trying to extrapolate that we're going to get 6% or some really high number recovery factor out of the Wolfcamp as we've done in the Eagle Ford and some of these other plays just because the rock quality and the difficulty there has got a higher degree of difficulty."

The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included fourth quarter and updated full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our third quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow. Then Bill, Thomas and I will provide operational results.
Tim Driggers will discuss financials and capital structure. I'll then follow with our macro view, our preliminary 2013 business plan and concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release for the third quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $355.5 million or $1.31 per diluted share. For investors focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts, and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's third quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $468.7 million or $1.73 per diluted share.
Our third quarter non-GAAP earnings versus guidance was a result of a pleasant trifecta. Higher oil volumes, higher oil price realizations and lower unit costs. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the third quarter was $1.6 billion.
I'll now address our operational results in key plays. For the third quarter, all 3 of our production components met or exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our total company crude oil and condensate production was up 42% year-over-year and total liquids were up 40%. Total EOG production increased 12.4% year-over-year for the third quarter. North American gas was down 10% as predicted, but Trinidad gas increased 17% due to higher than expected contract takes. I'll also note that essentially all of our unit costs were below midpoint projections and several, such as LOE and DD&A, were below the low point of our guidance range. The benefits of high volume growth on our unit cost is showing up in the numbers. We're also pleased to note that our G&A per dollar of revenue is one of the lowest in the peer group.
As we did following both first and second quarter results, we are again increasing our full year total company liquids production growth target, this time from 35% to 38%, boosting our crude oil growth target from 37% to 40%, and our NGL growth target from 31% to 33%. Our total company growth target has also increased from 9% to 10.6%. These increases are the result of continued out performance from our top oil plays.
As we've repeatedly stated, we're not interested in growing hydrocarbon volume simply for the sake of growth. In fact, we purposely shrunk our North American gas production for 4 straight years simply because it's a money leisure. We are, however, very interested in growing our financial metrics, such as EPS, adjusted EBITDAX and DCF.
In the third quarter, our year-over-year increase in non-GAAP EPS was 108%. Adjusted EBITDAX growth was 39% and DCF increased 37%. We believe we're one of very few large cap E&Ps who have shown a substantial increase in these financial metrics in both 2011 and 2012.
The biggest single driver for this growth in our financial metrics has been our high organic crude oil growth rate. 35% in 2010, 52% in 2011 and projected 40% this year in spite of $3.3 billion of total assets sales over the same period.
On a go-forward basis, we expect to continue to have the best organic oil growth rate of any large cap independent, although the year-over-year percentage numbers will be smaller as we become a large oil company.
I'll now discuss the plays driving our high organic crude oil growth rates starting with the Eagle Ford.
The play was again the biggest driver of our quarterly growth outperformance as it has been all year. We're the largest crude oil producer in the play with 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net after royalty for the quarter, 75% of which was oil and 13% was NGLs.
I'll now discuss 4 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, during the August call, I may have caused the flurry of comments among sell siders when I mentioned that during the second quarter, we completed 16 monster wells, which I defined as having IPs between 2,500 and 4,800 barrels of oil per day plus gas and NGLs. This reflects the quality of our acreage plus our completion methodology.
During the third quarter, we added 12 additional monster wells, one of which, the Baker deforest unit#4H tested at 4,598 barrels of oil per day which with 4 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas at a normal choke rate falling into production facilities. We have 100% working interest in 10 of 12 of these monster wells, several of which are outlined in our press release.
Second, we have drilled in our flow testing several multi-well spaced more densely than our current 65 to 90 acres spacing. We expect to have some spacing conclusions and the effect on the recovery factor from these pilots during the first half of 2013.
Third, the majority of our Eagle Ford crude is currently priced off an LLS premier market index, providing an advantage over WTI pricing. Additionally, with the cost advantage of our self-sourced frac sands and further efficiencies, our average well costs have been drifting back down towards our $5.5 million per well target instead of the $6 million I reported last quarter. Together, the LLS index oil price and the lower well costs have further improved and excellent economics of the play.
And fourth, we're currently running 20 rigs and expect to drill 320 net wells this year. Our current average drilling time has decreased to 13 days per well.
Overall, we've significantly slowed our total company capital activity to stay within our capital budget. We're currently running 52 rigs across the company compared to an average of 70 in the first half. To even further slow capital activity, we've dropped the number of completion crews and the number of these per crew. This is the primary reason we expect fourth quarter total EOG's liquid volumes to be slightly down from the third quarter. Besides, 40% year-over-year oil growth is plenty strong for a company our size. We have to catch our breath so we can come out of the starting gate strong in January.
I'll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss other North American plays."

We continue to be particularly upbeat about the Bakken and Three Forks potential in the acreage in the Williston basin and the Bakken core, the 320 acre downspacing has proven to be successful and 2 recent wells further confirmed the strength. The 461608H tested at 1,732 barrels of oil per day with 90 barrels per day of NGLs and 363 Mcf per day of natural gas. The 477128H tested at 1,258 barrels of oil per day, an 83 barrels per day of NGLs and 332 Mcf of gas. We have 92% and 78% working interest in these wells, respectively. We'll be testing 160-acre down spacing in the core late this year, and we hope to have some results from our water project by February.
In the Antelope area, we're applying improved frac technology to our current well completions. We recently completed an outstanding Antelope-Three Forks, the Hawk Eye well the 100 2501HR for 3,196 barrels of oil per day with 5.5 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas. EOG has a 73% working interest of this well. Other recent Antelope walls are listed in the press release.
In 2003 to 2015, we plan to spend most of our North Dakota capital in this same 2 areas, primarily down spacing in the Bakken quarter and further development of both the Bakken and Three Forks targets in the Antelope Extension area. We plan to develop our Bakken lot and Stateline areas in subsequent years.
Shifting our focus to the Permian Basin, Wolfcamp and Leonard horizontal plays, we're seeing Wolfcamp results similar to previous quarters. But in the Southeast New Mexico Leonard, we're seeing improved results. We previously said the returns in these 2 plays were equal. But we now write the Leonard above the Wolfcamp. The Wolfcamp well quality hasn't declined. It's just that the Leonard has improved.
Three recent Leonard wells are the Diamond 83H, 4H and 5H, were tested at 962, 1,148 and 1,162 barrels of oil per day with approximately 1 million cubic feet of rich natural gas each. We have 90% -- 96% working interest in these wells.
Our press release with several recent Wolfcamp wells and we continue to feel comfortable with our 430 Mboe per well growth factor. Most of our Wolfcamp completions are in the middle zone where several good wells noted in the press release. We completed the Mayor SL 513 LH in the lower Wolfcamp with an initial production rate of 1,290 barrels of oil per day with 946 Mcf per day of rich natural gas. We have 77% working interest in this well. This is our first long lateral completion in the lower zone and we're encouraged by the results. To date, we have completed 3 long laterals in the upper zones with mixed results.
We continue to evaluate the economic extent and productivity of the upper and lower zones across our acreage. Overall, both the Wolfcamp and Leonard are good plays, but they are combo-type plays and are inherently less economic than the Eagle Ford and Bakken, which are black oil plays. The same is true of the Barnett combo where results continue to be consistent with past quarters. The typical combo well recovers 80,000 barrels of oil, 140,000 barrels of NGLs and 850 million cubic feet of gas growth for $3.4 million. Completed well costs and yields are 25% after-tax rate of return at current product classes. This year, we drilled a number of successful step backs extending the product -- productive acreage of the play.
In addition to these plays, we have smaller levels of horizontal activity in the Midcontinent, Powder River basin in southern Manitoba. Also we continue to test new greenfield horizontal oil ideas in North America.
Now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Outside North America, we expect 100% working interest Conway crude oil development project to start up in the second half of 2013. In Argentina, our horizontal oil well yielded lower-than-expected results. The production results were similar to a nearby vertical well we had completed, indicating no multiplier effect for the horizontal versus the vertical. We're still evaluating results and plan to proceed cautiously during 2013.
In Trinidad, our third quarter gas takes were higher than expected due to incremental short-term market demands. There's nothing new to report on the Kittiman LNG project. I'll now address 2 other EOG differentiators, oil margins and sand plants.
You'll notice that for the third quarter, our U.S. crude oil price realization was $5.45 over WTI. Considering where our crude is produced, this is likely the most advantageous realization of any similarly situated company. Our 2 biggest production areas are the Eagle Ford and Bakken. As I previously mentioned, our Eagle Ford crude is currently priced off on LLS index. In the Bakken, almost all of our crew plus some third-party crew is being railed to our St. James, Louisiana terminal and receiving LLS prices. Additionally, we're railing a portion of our Wolfcamp crude to Louisiana.
On the well cost side, our San plants continue to function smoothly and provide the frac cost savings we've described in previous quarters.
EOG's success is based on a simple equation: Higher crude oil volumes and higher crude oil price realizations combined with lower well and unit cost and less money-losing North American natural gas volumes equals more net income.
I'll now turn it over to Tim to discuss financials and capital structure."

Regarding oil, we think the current NYMEX plus $2 to $3 per barrel reasonably reflects likely 2013 prices. We continue to believe that U.S. shale oil won't flood the global market for the reasons I articulated on our previous earnings call. Likewise, we think any meaningful supplier effect from shale oil outside North America is many years away and will be very slow to develop.
For the first half of 2013, we had 98,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $99.39 per barrel. And for the second half, we had 68,000 barrels per day hedged at $99.45 per barrel. We also have some options next year that may be exercised and will increase our hedge position by an average of 42,000 barrels of oil per day at an average price of $102.16. Regarding gas, we expect 2013 prices will be better than 2012 but not good enough to provide a cost of capital full cycle return on North American gas well drilling. Our current 2013 hedged position is 150,000 mmbtu per day at $4.79 per mmbtu, excluding unexercised options. Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
Now let me provide a brief outline of our 2013 business plan. As usual, we'll provide a specific 2013 planted volumes, CapEx, et cetera, in our February call. But today, we can provide 4 directional guidelines. First, we expect our overall 2013 CapEx to decline below 2012 levels primarily because we've accomplished our goal of converting our dry gas resource play acreage to held by production status. This year, we spent roughly $700 million, primarily in the Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River converting leases, to held by production and we expect to spend only about $100 million next year on dry gas drilling.
This 2013 reduction in dry gas CapEx will also boost our 2013 overall reinvestment rate of return. Second, our 2013 pattern of volume growth by product will continue to be dictated by returns and the trend will be similar to the past several years. In 2013, we expect another peer-leading oil growth year, although the year-over-year percentage increase won't be as robust as in the past since we're becoming a bigger oil company. We expect decent year-over-year NGL growth, but a lower rate than our higher rate of return oil trajectory.
We also expect another year, our fifth year, of declining North American gas production since its unprofitable.
In Trinidad, we'll likely have flat year-over-year gas production since this year, we sold at close to maximum deliverability.
Third, in 2013, we'll continue to find North American greenfield oil ideas as well as concepts to improve recovery factors. Because NGL prices how weakened relative to oil, we like the shift capital from the Barnett and Permian combo plays toward the Eagle Ford and Bakken.
And fourth, if one assumes that 2013 oil prices, WTI oil prices, average in the low 90s, then our preliminary plan of combined lower CapEx and increased oil volumes essentially shrinks our 2013 funding GAAP to a very manageable amount. This is important because for the past 3 years, one recurring theme from investors has been EOG's significant outspend of our organic cash flow, i.e. would be blow up our balance sheet while developing our oil reserves.
Today we sat at 27% net debt to total cap and A-, AAA credit ratings. And unless oil prices drop significantly in 2013, we'll approach neutral from a cash flow versus CapEx point. Since our strong oil growth will continue past 2013, this cash flow versus CapEx trend is positive for 2014 and should potentially allow us to return more cash to stockholders post 2013.
Now let me conclude. In summary, I want to leave you with one thought. In this business, there continues to be a lot of hype. The advent of oil resource plays has allowed many companies to talk about capturing billions of barrels of oil or billions of Boes as if they're talking about apples on a tree. Be careful of the hype. Go with the company that's putting the points on the board quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, whether it's financial metrics are operational metrics such as organic oil growth.

And we're now -- some of our fastest wells were drilling at 8 days. So we have room to beat the 13-day average timeframe. If you would have asked me 18 months ago, whether we would be able to drill our fastest wells in 8 days, I would have frankly told you, no way. So I would expect that we're going to see further improvements over the next 12 months in the average time to drill the wells, which is going to give us a good chance to drive the average well cost down even further. Right now, the direction we're seeing is the rig comps are trending down, some of the service costs are trending down. So I think that the average well cost of $5.5 million for 2013 is eminently achievable for our wells in Eagle Ford. And that probably beats the industry average in Eagle Ford by $2 million a well."

Let me segue that into kind of the production targets that we've given you for the fourth quarter, specifically the oil production numbers. The simple way I'd explain is we spent about $6 billion through the first 3 quarters of the year, and we give you an estimate that basically says we intend to spend about $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. So we have very roughly at $2 billion a quarter run rate and we tell you we're going to spend 1.6 in the fourth quarter roughly. And the growth rate of the company, the oil growth rate, I'd say is very similar to a coin-operated machine. EOG right now is very similar to coin-operated machine. You put dollars in and you have 100% efficiency. There's no inefficiency due to exploration and there is essentially no operational and efficiency. So our growth rate for the fourth quarter is essentially going to be a function of how many dollars we spend. And that's why our growth rate in the fourth quarter is going to be less than it was in the first 3 quarters. And we basically are just curbing our spending to stay within our capital budget and we're just slowing down pretty severely, really, in all of our plays. But the most severity is going to be in the Eagle Ford where we are cutting completion units cutting rigs and just slowing the process down. So and I've also seen a couple of early comments there on our where people have said well, you're probably sandbagging on oil volumes the fourth quarter and do you beaded the volumes the first 3 quarters on the guidance. But don't assume that we're sandbagging in the fourth quarter because we are putting the brakes on it quite hard on the CapEx spending. And frankly, I expect it will hit about the midpoint of our 8-K target in the fourth quarter on volumes and not overachieve. It's not due to lack of prospectivity, it's not due to well quality is just that due to a coin-operated machine that we're putting less going to there in the fourth quarter."

I would still say that the direction that we hope to be heading with the down spacing, if down spacing successful, is more likely to be that we end up with more locations at the 450 Mboe net reserve average as opposed to increasing the 450 Mboe average. So although certainly in certain areas, the wells are greater than 450. What we would hope the down spacing does for us is give us more locations within overall aggregate average of 450 as opposed to raising that average across the entire acreage. And that's what we hope the outcome is sometime in the first half of next year. And where we stand on the down spacing is we've got multiples, tighter spacing pilots than the 65 to 90 acres already drilled. We have initial tests on those tighter spacing pilots, they look good. And what they need now is time. We just need some time to observe the performance of those tighter spacing pilots to just see how they do and then cross check them against our computer models.

And then as you project 2014, 2015, 2016, we're still going to have, I believe, peer-leading, large-cap group oil growth during those time frames. And it's going to put us in a position where we're going to have flexibility to do some things that we haven't been able to do in the past, such as consider more significant dividend increases, consider accelerating our oil growth by additional CapEx increases if we wanted to. It certainly have put us in a position where we don't have to sell properties or possibly even buying any shares.

For example, in the Haynesville and in our Barnett combo, we actively pursue choke management, and we are looking at right now, choke management for our Wolfcamp areas. In the Eagle Ford, in the position where our acreage is, which is the black oil area or the area where we're fortunately have very high oil portions of mix, the choke management is not very important. Where other companies have acreage, where they have higher gas oil ratios, the choke management may be important to ultimate recoveries. But we can't speak about their positions and whether choke management works or doesn't work on our acreage. What we can say is that on our acreage, choke management on our opinion is not that critical to EURs. And that's because we have the preferred acreage frankly. It's just more oily. So that would be our response to that issue."

This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call. This conference call also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com.
The SEC permits oil and gas companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose not only proved reserves but also probable reserves, as well as possible reserves. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast may include potential reserves or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with or contemplated by the SEC's latest reserve reporting guidelines. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to U.S. investors that appears at the bottom of our press release in Investor Relations page of our website.
With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included fourth quarter and updated full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our third quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow. Then Bill, Thomas and I will provide operational results. Tim Driggers will discuss financials and capital structure. I'll then follow with our macro view, our preliminary 2013 business plan and concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release for the third quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $355.5 million or $1.31 per diluted share. 
For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's third quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $468.7 million or $1.73 per diluted share. Our third quarter non-GAAP earnings versus guidance was a result of a pleasant trifecta, higher oil volumes, higher oil price realizations and lower unit costs. 
For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the third quarter was $1.6 billion.
I'll now address our operational results in key plays. For the third quarter, all 3 of our production components met or exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our total company crude oil and condensate production was up 42% year-over-year, and total liquids were up 40%. Total EOG production increased 12.4% year-over-year for the third quarter. North American gas was down 10% as predicted, but Trinidad gas increased 17% due to higher than expected contract takes. 
I'll also note that essentially all of our unit costs were below midpoint projections and several, such as LOE and DD&A, were below the low point of our guidance range. The benefits of high volume growth on our unit cost is showing up in the numbers. 
We're also pleased to note that our G&A per dollar of revenue is one of the lowest in the peer group.
As we did following both first and second quarter results, we are again increasing our full year total company liquids production growth target, this time from 35% to 38%, boosting our crude oil growth target from 37% to 40% and our NGL growth target from 31% to 33%. Our total company growth target has also increased from 9% to 10.6%. These increases are the result of continued outperformance from our top oil plays.
As we've repeatedly stated, we're not interested in growing hydrocarbon volume simply for the sake of growth. In fact, we purposely shrunk our North American gas production for 4 straight years simply because it's a money loser. We are, however, very interested in growing our financial metrics, such as EPS, adjusted EBITDAX and DCF. 
In the third quarter, our year-over-year increase in non-GAAP EPS was 108%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 39% and DCF increased 37%. We believe we're one of very few large cap E&Ps who have shown a substantial increase in these financial metrics in both 2011 and 2012.
The biggest single driver for this growth in our financial metrics has been our high organic crude oil growth rate: 35% in 2010, 52% in 2011 and projected 40% this year in spite of $3.3 billion of total assets sales over the same period.
On a go-forward basis, we expect to continue to have the best organic oil growth rate of any large cap independent, although the year-over-year percentage numbers will be smaller as we become a large oil company.
I'll now discuss the plays driving our high organic crude oil growth rates, starting with the Eagle Ford. The play was again the biggest driver of our quarterly oil growth outperformance as it has been all year. We're the largest crude oil producer in the play with 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net after royalty for the quarter, 75% of which was oil and 13% was NGLs.
I'll now discuss 4 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, during the August call, I may have caused a flurry of comments among sell siders when I mentioned that during the second quarter, we completed 16 monster wells, which I defined as having IPs between 2,500 and 4,800 barrels of oil per day plus gas and NGLs. This reflects the quality of our acreage plus our completion methodology.
During the third quarter, we added 12 additional monster wells, one of which, the Baker-DeForest Unit #4H tested at 4,598 barrels of oil per day which -- with 4 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas at a normal choke rate flowing into production facilities. We have 100% working interest in 10 of 12 of these monster wells, several of which are outlined in our press release.
Second, we have drilled in our flow testing several multi-well pilots spaced more densely than our current 65 to 90 acres spacing. We expect to have some spacing conclusions in the effect on the recovery factor from these pilots during the first half of 2013.
Third, the majority of our Eagle Ford crude is currently priced off an LLS premier market index, providing an advantage over WTI pricing. Additionally, with the cost advantage of our self-sourced frac sand and further efficiencies, our average well costs have been drifting back down towards our $5.5 million per well target instead of the $6 million I reported last quarter. Together, the LLS indexed oil price and the lower well costs have further improved the excellent economics of the play.
And fourth, we're currently running 20 rigs and expect to drill 320 net wells this year. Our current average drilling time has decreased to 13 days per well.
Overall, we've significantly slowed our total company capital activity to stay within our capital budget. We're currently running 52 rigs across the company compared to an average of 70 in the first half. 
To even further slow capital activity, we've dropped the number of completion crews and the number of days per crew. This is the primary reason we expect fourth quarter total EOG liquid volumes to be slightly down from the third quarter. Besides, 40% year-over-year oil growth is plenty strong for a company our size. We have to catch our breath so we can come out of the starting gates strong in January.
I'll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss other North American plays."

We continue to be particularly upbeat about the Bakken and Three Forks potential on our acreage in the Williston Basin. 
In the Bakken Core area, the 320-acre downspacing has proven to be successful, and 2 recent wells further confirmed the strength. The Fertile 46-1608H tested at 1,732 barrels of oil per day, with 90 barrels per day of NGLs and 363 Mcf per day of natural gas. The Fertile 47-712H (sic) [Fertile 47-0712H] tested at 1,258 barrels of oil per day, an  83 barrels per day of NGLs and 332 Mcf of gas. We have 92% and 78% working interest in these wells, respectively. We'll be testing 160-acre downspacing in the Core late this year, and we hope to have some results from our pilot waterflood project by February.
In the Antelope area, we're applying improved frac technology to our current well completions. We recently completed an outstanding Antelope Three Forks well, the Hawkeye 100-2501H, for 3,196 barrels of oil per day with 5.5 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas. EOG has a 73% working interest of this well. Other recent Antelope wells are listed in the press release.
In 2003 to 2015, we plan to spend most of our North Dakota capital in a same 2 areas, primarily downspacing in the Bakken Core and further development of both the Bakken and Three Forks targets in the Antelope Extension area. We plan to develop our Bakken lot and Stateline areas in subsequent years.
Shifting our focus to the Permian Basin Wolfcamp and Leonard horizontal plays. We're seeing Wolfcamp results similar to previous quarters. But in the Southeast New Mexico Leonard, we're seeing improved results. We previously said the returns on these 2 plays were equal, but we now write the Leonard above the Wolfcamp. The Wolfcamp well quality hasn't declined. It's just that the Leonard has improved.
Three recent Leonard wells, or the Diamond 8 Fed Com 3H, 4H and 5H, were tested at 962, 1,148 and 1,162 barrels of oil per day with approximately 1 million cubic feet of rich natural gas each. We have 90% -- 96% working interest in these wells.
Our press release -- we have several recent Wolfcamp wells and we continue to feel comfortable with our 430 Mboe per well growth factor. Most of our Wolfcamp completions are in the middle zone, with several good wells noted in the press release. We completed the Mayer SL 513 LH (sic) [Mayer SL #5013LH] in the lower Wolfcamp with an initial production rate of 1,290 barrels of oil per day with 946 Mcf per day of rich natural gas. We have 77% working interest in this well. 
This is our first long lateral completion in the lower zone, and we're encouraged by the results. To date, we have completed 3 long laterals in the upper zones with mixed results. 
We continue to evaluate the economic extent and productivity of the upper and lower zones across our acreage. 
Overall, both the Wolfcamp and Leonard are good plays, but they are combo-type plays and are inherently less economic than the Eagle Ford and Bakken, which are black oil plays. 
The same is true of the Barnett Combo, where results continued to be consistent with past quarters. The typical Combo well recovers 80,000 barrels of oil, 140,000 barrels of NGLs and 850 million cubic feet of gas gross for $3.4 million completed well costs and yields a 25% after-tax rate of return at current product classes. This year, we drilled a number of successful step-outs, extending the product -- productive acreage of the play.
In addition to these plays, we have smaller levels of horizontal activity in the Mid-Continent Powder River Basin in Southern Manitoba. Also, we continue to test new greenfield horizontal oil ideas in North America.
Now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Outside North America, we expect our 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil development project to start up in the second half of 2013. 
In Argentina, our horizontal Vaca Muerta oil well yielded lower-than-expected results. The production results were similar to a nearby vertical well we had completed, indicating no multiplier effect for the horizontal versus the vertical. We're still evaluating results and plan to proceed cautiously during 2013.
In Trinidad, our third quarter gas takes were higher than expected due to incremental short-term market demands. There's nothing new to report on the Kitimat LNG project. 
I'll now address 2 other EOG differentiators, oil margins and sand plants. You'll notice that for the third quarter, our U.S. crude oil price realization was $5.45 over WTI. Considering where our crude is produced, this is likely the most advantageous realization of any similarly situated company. 
Our 2 biggest production areas are the Eagle Ford and Bakken. As I previously mentioned, our Eagle Ford crude is currently priced off on LLS index. In the Bakken, almost all of our crude plus some third-party crude is being railed to our St. James, Louisiana terminal and receiving LLS prices. Additionally, we're railing a portion of our Wolfcamp crude to Louisiana.
On the well cost side, our sand plants continue to function smoothly and provide the frac cost savings we've described in previous quarters.
EOG's success is based on a simple equation: higher crude oil volumes and higher crude oil price realizations combined with lower well and unit costs and less money-losing North American natural gas volumes equals more net income.
I'll now turn it over to Tim to discuss financials and capital structure."

Regarding oil, we think the current NYMEX plus $2 to $3 per barrel reasonably reflects likely 2013 prices. We continue to believe that U.S. shale oil won't flood the global market for the reasons I articulated on our previous earnings call. Likewise, we think any meaningful supply effect from shale oil outside North America is many years away and will be very slow to develop.
For the first half of 2013, we have 98,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $99.39 per barrel. And for the second half, we have 68,000 barrels per day hedged at $99.45 per barrel. 
We also have some options next year that may be exercised and would increase our hedge position by an average of 42,000 barrels of oil per day at an average price of $102.16. 
Regarding gas, we expect 2013 prices will be better than 2012, but not good enough to provide a cost of capital full cycle return on North American gas well drilling. Our current 2013 hedge position is 150,000 mmbtu per day at $4.79 per mmbtu excluding unexercised options. 
Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
Now let me provide a brief outline of our 2013 business plan. As usual, we'll provide our specific 2013 plan with volumes, CapEx, et cetera, in our February call. But today, we can provide 4 directional guidelines. 
First, we expect our overall 2013 CapEx to decline below 2012 levels, primarily because we've accomplished our goal of converting our dry gas resource play acreage to held by production status. This year, we spent roughly $700 million, primarily in the Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River converting leases to held by production, and we expect to spend only about $100 million next year on dry gas drilling. This 2013 reduction in dry gas CapEx will also boost our 2013 overall reinvestment rate of return. 
Second, our 2013 pattern of volume growth by product will continue to be dictated by returns, and the trend will be similar to the past several years. In 2013, we expect another peer-leading oil growth year, although the year-over-year percentage increase won't be as robust as in the past since we're becoming a bigger oil company. We expect decent year-over-year NGL growth, but a lower rate than our higher rate of return oil trajectory.
We also expect another year, our fifth year, of declining North American gas production since it's unprofitable. In Trinidad, we'll likely have flat year-over-year gas production since this year, we sold at close to maximum deliverability.
Third, in 2013, we'll continue to fund North American greenfield oil ideas, as well as concepts to improve recovery factors. Because NGL prices how weakened relative to oil, we'll likely shift capital from the Barnett and Permian Combo plays toward the Eagle Ford and Bakken.
And fourth, if one assumes that 2013 oil prices, WTI oil prices, average in the low 90s, then our preliminary plan of combined lower CapEx and increased oil volumes essentially shrinks our 2013 funding gap to a very manageable amount. This is important because for the past 3 years, one recurring theme from investors has been EOG's significant outspend of our organic cash flow, i.e., would we blow up our balance sheet while developing our oil reserves.
Today we sit at 27% net debt to total cap and A-, AAA credit ratings. And unless oil prices drop significantly in 2013, we'll approach neutral from a cash flow versus CapEx point. Since our strong oil growth will continue past 2013, this cash flow versus CapEx trend is positive for 2014 and should potentially allow us to return more cash to stockholders post 2013.
Now let me conclude. In summary, I want to leave you with one thought. In this business, there continues to be a lot of hype. The advent of oil resource play has allowed many companies to talk about capturing billions of barrels of oil or billions of Boes as if they're talking about apples on a tree. Be careful of the hype. Go with the company that's putting the points on the board quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, whether it's financial metrics or operational metrics, such as organic oil growth. Results matter and they're easy to measure.
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

If you would have asked me 18 months ago whether we'd be able to drill our fastest wells in 8 days, I would have frankly told you, no way. So I would expect that we're going to see further improvements over the next 12 months in the average time to drill the wells, which is going to give us a good chance to drive the average well cost down even further. I mean, right now, the direction we're seeing is the rig comps are trending down, some of the service costs are trending down. So I think that the average well cost of $5.5 million for 2013 is eminently achievable for our wells in the Eagle Ford.

And let me kind of segue that into kind of the production targets that we've given you for the fourth quarter, specifically the oil production numbers. The simple way I'd explain it is, we've -- we spend about $6 billion through the first 3 quarters of the year, and we gave you an estimate that basically says we intend to spend about $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. So we have very roughly a $2 billion a quarter run rate, and now we're telling you we're going to spend $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter roughly. And the growth rate of the company, the oil growth rate, I'd say is very similar to a coin-operated machine. EOG right now is very similar to a coin-operated machine. You put dollars in, and you have 100% efficiency. There is no inefficiency due to exploration, and there is essentially no operational inefficiency. So our growth rate for the fourth quarter and -- is essentially going to be a function of how many dollars we spend. And that's why our growth rate in the fourth quarter is going to be less than it was in the first 3 quarters. And we basically are just curbing our spending to stay within our capital budget, and we're just slowing down pretty severely, really, in all of our plays. But the most severity is going to be in the Eagle Ford where we are cutting completion units, cutting rigs and just slowing the process down. So -- and I've also seen a couple early comments, they are on our -- where people are saying, ""Well, you're probably sandbagging on your oil volumes in the fourth quarter."" I know we've beaten the volumes in the first 3 quarters on the guidance, but don't assume that we're sandbagging in the fourth quarter because we are putting the brakes on it quite hard on the CapEx spending. And frankly, I expect it will hit about the midpoint of our 8-K target for the fourth quarter on our oil volumes and not overachieve. It's not due to lack of prospectivity. It's not due to low quality. It's just flat due to a coin-operated machine that we're putting less coins in there in the fourth quarter."

And it has been a shareholder concern issue. And 2013, I think, as long as oil prices are in the low 90s for WTI, I think we are finally going to free ourselves from that burden. And then as you project 2014, 2015, 2016, we're still going to have, I believe, peer-leading large cap group oil growth during those timeframes. And it's going to put us in a position where we're going to have flexibility to do some things that we haven't been able to do in the past, such as consider more significant dividend increases, consider accelerating our oil growth by additional CapEx increases if we wanted to. It certainly have put us in a position where we don't have to sell properties or possibly even buying in shares. So what I just wanted to note is that the one shareholder concern that people have had the last 3 years about us in my opinion is going to go away starting next year, and it's going to turn into a positive starting in 2014."

For example, in the Haynesville and in our Barnett Combo, we actively pursue choke management, and we are looking at, right now, choke management for our Wolfcamp areas. In the Eagle Ford, in the position where our acreage is, which is the black oil area or the area where we fortunately have very high oil portions of the mix, the choke management is not very important. Where other companies have acreage, where they have higher gas-oil ratios, the choke management maybe important to ultimate recoveries. But we can't speak about their positions and whether choke management works or doesn't work on their acreage. What we can say is that on our acreage, choke management, in our opinion, is not that critical to EURs. And that's because we have the preferred acreage frankly. It's just more oily.

With me this morning are Bill Thomas, President; Gary Thomas, Chief Operating Officer; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations. An updated IR presentation was posted to our website last night, and we included fourth quarter and updated full year 2012 guidance in yesterday's press release.
This morning, I'll discuss topics in the following order: I'll initially review our third quarter 2012 net income and discretionary cash flow. Then Bill, Thomas and I will provide operational results. Tim Driggers will discuss financials and capital structure. I'll then follow with our macro view, our preliminary 2013 business plan and concluding remarks.
As outlined in our press release for the third quarter 2012, EOG reported net income of $355.5 million or $1.31 per diluted share. 
For investors who focus on non-GAAP net income to eliminate mark-to-market impacts and certain nonrecurring items as outlined in the press release, EOG's third quarter 2012 adjusted net income was $468.7 million or $1.73 per diluted share. Our third quarter non-GAAP earnings versus guidance was a result of a pleasant trifecta, higher oil volumes, higher oil price realizations and lower unit costs. 
For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the third quarter was $1.6 billion.
I'll now address our operational results in key plays. For the third quarter, all 3 of our production components met or exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our total company crude oil and condensate production was up 42% year-over-year, and total liquids were up 40%. Total EOG production increased 12.4% year-over-year for the third quarter. North American gas was down 10% as predicted, but Trinidad gas increased 17% due to higher than expected contract takes. 
I'll also note that essentially all of our unit costs were below midpoint projections and several, such as LOE and DD&A, were below the low point of our guidance range. The benefits of high volume growth on our unit cost is showing up in the numbers. 
We're also pleased to note that our G&A per dollar of revenue is one of the lowest in the peer group.
As we did following both first and second quarter results, we are again increasing our full year total company liquids production growth target, this time from 35% to 38%, boosting our crude oil growth target from 37% to 40% and our NGL growth target from 31% to 33%. Our total company growth target has also increased from 9% to 10.6%. These increases are the result of continued outperformance from our top oil plays.
As we've repeatedly stated, we're not interested in growing hydrocarbon volume simply for the sake of, growth. In fact, we purposely shrunk our North American gas production for 4 straight years simply because it's a money loser. We are, however, very interested in growing our financial metrics, such as EPS, adjusted EBITDAX and DCF. 
In the third quarter, our year-over-year increase in non-GAAP EPS was 108%, adjusted EBITDAX growth was 39% and DCF increased 37%. We believe we're one of very few large cap E&Ps who have shown a substantial increase in these financial metrics in both 2011 and 2012.
The biggest single driver for this growth in our financial metrics has been our high organic crude oil growth rate: 35% in 2010, 52% in 2011 and projected 40% this year in spite of $3.3 billion of total assets sales over the same period.
On a go-forward basis, we expect to continue to have the best organic oil growth rate of any large cap independent, although the year-over-year percentage numbers will be smaller as we become a large oil company.
I'll now discuss the plays driving our high organic crude oil growth rates, starting with the Eagle Ford. The play was again the biggest driver of our quarterly oil growth outperformance as it has been all year. We're the largest crude oil producer in the play with 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net after royalty for the quarter, 75% of which was oil and 13% was NGLs.
I'll now discuss 4 key points regarding the Eagle Ford. First, during the August call, I may have caused a flurry of comments among sell siders when I mentioned that during the second quarter, we completed 16 monster wells, which I defined as having IPs between 2,500 and 4,800 barrels of oil per day plus gas and NGLs. This reflects the quality of our acreage plus our completion methodology.
During the third quarter, we added 12 additional monster wells, one of which, the Baker-DeForest Unit #4H, tested at 4,598 barrels of oil per day which -- with 4 million cubic feet a day of rich natural gas at a normal choke rate flowing into production facilities. We have 100% working interest in 10 of 12 of these monster wells, several of which are outlined in our press release.
Second, we have drilled in our flow testing several multi-well pilots spaced more densely than our current 65 to 90 acres spacing. We expect to have some spacing conclusions in the effect on the recovery factor from these pilots during the first half of 2013.
Third, the majority of our Eagle Ford crude is currently priced off an LLS premier market index, providing an advantage over WTI pricing. Additionally, with the cost advantage of our self-sourced frac sand and further efficiencies, our average well costs have been drifting back down towards our $5.5 million per well target instead of the $6 million I reported last quarter. Together, the LLS indexed oil price and the lower well costs have further improved the excellent economics of the play.
And fourth, we're currently running 20 rigs and expect to drill 320 net wells this year. Our current average drilling time has decreased to 13 days per well.
Overall, we've significantly slowed our total company capital activity to stay within our capital budget. We're currently running 52 rigs across the company compared to an average of 70 in the first half. 
To even further slow capital activity, we've dropped the number of completion crews and the number of days per crew. This is the primary reason we expect fourth quarter total EOG liquid volumes to be slightly down from the third quarter. Besides, 40% year-over-year oil growth is plenty strong for a company our size. We have to catch our breath so we can come out of the starting gates strong in January.
I'll now turn it over to Bill Thomas to discuss other North American plays."

We continue to be particularly upbeat about the Bakken and Three Forks potential on our acreage in the Williston Basin. 
In the Bakken Core area, the 320-acre downspacing has proven to be successful, and 2 recent wells further confirmed the strength. The Fertile 46-1608H tested at 1,732 barrels of oil per day, with 90 barrels per day of NGLs and 363 Mcf per day of natural gas. The Fertile 47-712H (sic) [Fertile 47-0712H] tested at 1,258 barrels of oil per day, an  83 barrels per day of NGLs and 332 Mcf of gas. We have 92% and 78% working interest in these wells, respectively. We'll be testing 160-acre downspacing in the Core late this year, and we hope to have some results from our pilot waterflood project by February.
In the Antelope area, we're applying improved frac technology to our current well completions. We recently completed an outstanding Antelope Three Forks well, the Hawkeye 100-2501H, for 3,196 barrels of oil per day with 5.5 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas. EOG has a 73% working interest of this well. Other recent Antelope wells are listed in the press release.
In 2003 to 2015, we plan to spend most of our North Dakota capital in these same 2 areas, primarily downspacing in the Bakken Core and further development of both the Bakken and Three Forks targets in the Antelope Extension area. We plan to develop our Bakken lot and Stateline areas in subsequent years.
Shifting our focus to the Permian Basin Wolfcamp and Leonard horizontal plays. We're seeing Wolfcamp results similar to previous quarters. But in the Southeast New Mexico Leonard, we're seeing improved results. We previously said the returns on these 2 plays were equal, but we now rate the Leonard above the Wolfcamp. The Wolfcamp well quality hasn't declined, it's just that the Leonard has improved.
Three recent Leonard wells, or the Diamond 8 Fed Com 3H, 4H and 5H, were tested at 962, 1,148 and 1,162 barrels of oil per day with approximately 1 million cubic feet of rich natural gas each. We have 90% -- 96% working interest in these wells.
Our press release, we have several recent Wolfcamp wells and we continue to feel comfortable with our 430 Mboe per well growth factor. Most of our Wolfcamp completions are in the middle zone, with several good wells noted in the press release. We completed the Mayer SL 513LH (sic) [Mayer SL #5013LH] in the lower Wolfcamp with an initial production rate of 1,290 barrels of oil per day with 946 Mcf per day of rich natural gas. We have 77% working interest in this well. 
This is our first long lateral completion in the lower zone, and we're encouraged by the results. To date, we have completed 3 long laterals in the upper zones with mixed results. 
We continue to evaluate the economic extent and productivity of the upper and lower zones across our acreage. 
Overall, both the Wolfcamp and Leonard are good plays, but they are combo-type plays and are inherently less economic than the Eagle Ford and Bakken, which are black oil plays. 
The same is true of the Barnett Combo, where results continued to be consistent with past quarters. The typical Combo well recovers 80,000 barrels of oil, 140,000 barrels of NGLs and 850 million cubic feet of gas gross for $3.4 million completed well costs and yields a 25% after-tax rate of return at current product classes. This year, we drilled a number of successful step-outs, extending the product -- productive acreage of the play.
In addition to these plays, we have smaller levels of horizontal activity in the Mid-Continent Powder River Basin in Southern Manitoba. Also, we continue to test new greenfield horizontal oil ideas in North America.
Now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Outside North America, we expect our 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil development project to start up in the second half of 2013. 
In Argentina, our horizontal Vaca Muerta oil well yielded lower-than-expected results. The production results were similar to a nearby vertical well we had completed, indicating no multiplier effect for the horizontal versus the vertical. We're still evaluating results and plan to proceed cautiously during 2013.
In Trinidad, our third quarter gas takes were higher than expected due to incremental short-term market demands. There's nothing new to report on the Kitimat LNG project. 
I'll now address 2 other EOG differentiators, oil margins and sand plants. You'll notice that for the third quarter, our U.S. crude oil price realization was $5.45 over WTI. Considering where our crude is produced, this is likely the most advantageous realization of any similarly situated company. 
Our 2 biggest production areas are the Eagle Ford and Bakken. As I previously mentioned, our Eagle Ford crude is currently priced off on LLS index. In the Bakken, almost all of our crude plus some third-party crude is being railed to our St. James, Louisiana terminal and receiving LLS prices. Additionally, we're railing a portion of our Wolfcamp crude to Louisiana.
On the well cost side, our sand plants continue to function smoothly and provide the frac cost savings we've described in previous quarters.
EOG's success is based on a simple equation: higher crude oil volumes and higher crude oil price realizations combined with lower well and unit costs and less money-losing North American natural gas volumes equals more net income.
I'll now turn it over to Tim to discuss financials and capital structure."

Regarding oil, we think the current NYMEX plus $2 to $3 per barrel reasonably reflects likely 2013 prices. We continue to believe that U.S. shale oil won't flood the global market for the reasons I articulated on our previous earnings call. Likewise, we think any meaningful supply effect from shale oil outside North America is many years away and will be very slow to develop.
For the first half of 2013, we have 98,000 barrels of oil per day hedged at $99.39 per barrel. And for the second half, we have 68,000 barrels per day hedged at $99.45 per barrel. 
We also have some options next year that may be exercised and would increase our hedge position by an average of 42,000 barrels of oil per day at an average price of $102.16. 
Regarding gas, we expect 2013 prices will be better than 2012, but not good enough to provide a cost of capital full cycle return on North American gas well drilling. Our current 2013 hedge position is 150,000 mmbtu per day at $4.79 per mmbtu excluding unexercised options. 
Please see the table that was included in our earnings press release for the details of our hedging contracts.
Now let me provide a brief outline of our 2013 business plan. As usual, we'll provide our specific 2013 plan with volumes, CapEx, et cetera, in our February call. But today, we can provide 4 directional guidelines. 
First, we expect our overall 2013 CapEx to decline below 2012 levels, primarily because we've accomplished our goal of converting our dry gas resource play acreage to held by production status. This year, we spent roughly $700 million, primarily in the Haynesville, Marcellus and Horn River converting leases to held by production, and we expect to spend only about $100 million next year on dry gas drilling. This 2013 reduction in dry gas CapEx will also boost our 2013 overall reinvestment rate of return. 
Second, our 2013 pattern of volume growth by product will continue to be dictated by returns, and the trend will be similar to the past several years. In 2013, we expect another peer-leading oil growth year, although the year-over-year percentage increase won't be as robust as in the past since we're becoming a bigger oil company. We expect decent year-over-year NGL growth, but a lower rate than our higher rate of return oil trajectory.
We also expect another year, our fifth year, of declining North American gas production since it's unprofitable. In Trinidad, we'll likely have flat year-over-year gas production since this year, we sold at close to maximum deliverability.
Third, in 2013, we'll continue to fund North American greenfield oil ideas, as well as concepts to improve recovery factors. Because NGL prices how weakened relative to oil, we'll likely shift capital from the Barnett and Permian Combo plays toward the Eagle Ford and Bakken.
And fourth, if one assumes that 2013 oil prices, WTI oil prices, average in the low 90s, then our preliminary plan of combined lower CapEx and increased oil volumes essentially shrinks our 2013 funding gap to a very manageable amount. This is important because for the past 3 years, one recurring theme from investors has been EOG's significant outspend of our organic cash flow, i.e., would we blow up our balance sheet while developing our oil reserves.
Today we sit at 27% net debt to total cap and A-, AAA credit ratings. And unless oil prices drop significantly, in 2013 we'll approach neutral from a cash flow versus CapEx point. Since our strong oil growth will continue past 2013, this cash flow versus CapEx trend is positive for 2014 and should potentially allow us to return more cash to stockholders post 2013.
Now let me conclude. In summary, I want to leave you with one thought. In this business, there continues to be a lot of hype. The advent of oil resource play has allowed many companies to talk about capturing billions of barrels of oil or billions of Boes as if they're talking about apples on a tree. Be careful of the hype. Go with the company that's putting the points on the board quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, whether it's financial metrics or operational metrics, such as organic oil growth. Results matter and they're easy to measure.
Thanks for listening, and now we'll go to Q&A."

So I would expect that we're going to see further improvements over the next 12 months in the average time to drill the wells, which is going to give us a good chance to drive the average well cost down even further. I mean, right now, the direction we're seeing is the rig comps are trending down, some of the service costs are trending down. So I think that the average well cost of $5.5 million for 2013 is eminently achievable for our wells in the Eagle Ford.

So we have very roughly a $2 billion a quarter run rate, and now we're telling you we're going to spend $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter roughly. And the growth rate of the company, the oil growth rate, I'd say, is very similar to a coin-operated machine. EOG right now is very similar to a coin-operated machine. You put dollars in, and you have 100% efficiency. There is no inefficiency due to exploration, and there is essentially no operational inefficiency. So our growth rate for the fourth quarter and -- is essentially going to be a function of how many dollars we spend. And that's why our growth rate in the fourth quarter is going to be less than it was in the first 3 quarters. And we basically are just curbing our spending to stay within our capital budget, and we're just slowing down pretty severely, really, in all of our plays. But the most severity is going to be in the Eagle Ford where we are cutting completion units, cutting rigs and just slowing the process down. So -- and I've also seen a couple early comments there on our -- where people are saying, ""Well, you're probably sandbagging on your oil volumes in the fourth quarter."" I know we've beaten the volumes in the first 3 quarters on the guidance, but don't assume that we're sandbagging in the fourth quarter because we are putting the brakes on it quite hard on the CapEx spending. And frankly, I expect it will hit about the midpoint of our 8-K target for the fourth quarter on our oil volumes and not overachieve. It's not due to lack of prospectivity. It's not due to well quality. It's just flat due to a coin-operated machine that we're putting less coins in there in the fourth quarter."

But what we would hope the downspacing does for us is give us more locations with an overall aggregate average of 450 Mboe as opposed to raising that average across the entire acreage block. And that's what we hope the outcome is sometime in the first half of next year. And where we stand on the downspacing is we've got multiples, tighter spacing pilots than the 65 to 90 acres already drilled. We have initial tests on those tighter spacing pilots. They look good.

And then as you project 2014, 2015, 2016, we're still going to have, I believe, peer-leading large cap group oil growth during those timeframes. And it's going to put us in a position where we're going to have flexibility to do some things that we haven't been able to do in the past, such as consider more significant dividend increases, consider accelerating our oil growth by additional CapEx increases if we wanted to. It certainly would put us in a position where we don't have to sell properties or possibly even buying in shares.

As far as on a go-forward basis, we don't look at just the Eagle Ford in terms of, did our -- our plan would be to run the Eagle Ford 2013 or 2014 on a cash flow neutral basis. We -- our decision on what we do with the Eagle Ford on a go-forward basis is going to be more a function of what we think the true total reserves are in the Eagle Ford and what are our alternative investment opportunities and what's the reinvestment rate of return in the Eagle Ford versus other areas. So it's -- we don't look at it just on Eagle Ford alone, really, Biju."

The -- all this stuff about -- the stuff about what size choke and people producing in a link to the EURs, we probably have more knowledge, I mean, than any company, certainly on the Eagle Ford oil production than anybody.

The -- all this stuff about -- the stuff about what size choke and people producing in a link to the EURs, we probably have more knowledge, I mean, than any company, certainly on the Eagle Ford oil production than anybody. And what we have found is that the higher the gas-oil ratio, the more sensitivity the choke management -- the more important the choke management is. For example, in the Haynesville and in our Barnett Combo, we actively pursue choke management, and we are looking at, right now, choke management for our Wolfcamp areas. In the Eagle Ford, in the position where our acreage is, which is the black oil area or the area where we fortunately have very high oil portions of the mix, the choke management is not very important. Where other companies have acreage, where they have higher gas-oil ratios, the choke management may be important to ultimate recoveries. But we can't speak about their positions and whether choke management works or doesn't work on their acreage. What we can say is that on our acreage, choke management, in our opinion, is not that critical to EURs. And that's because we have the preferred acreage, frankly. It's just more oily. So that would be our response to that issue."

So what -- all -- essentially, all the 12 well -- monster wells that we would have related to you here in this particular quarter will be on pretty tight spacing on there. So it's -- what's happening is, it's -- the quality of acreage plus we're giving these wells larger fracs in terms of pounds of sand and number of stages relative to the fracs we would have given these identical wells, say, 12 or 18 months ago, and some other tweaks that are proprietary tweaks to the fracs. So those are the 2 things that are the keys to these monster wells."

And then they go on a decline and, eventually, they'll get back on the original curve that they were on, but there is some -- certainly some additional reserves in oil that we're contacting with these more aggressive fracs.
