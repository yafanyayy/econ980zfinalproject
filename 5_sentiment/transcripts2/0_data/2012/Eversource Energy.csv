Before we begin the discussion of NU's financial and operational results, I just like to thank everybody on the call for all the notes and cards and very good wishes that you've expressed to me over the past mon",1569,"Thank you, Jeff and good morning, everyone. Before we begin the discussion of NU's financial and operational results, I just like to thank everybody on the call for all the notes and cards and very good wishes that you've expressed to me over the past month and a half. I appreciate your thoughtful words since my heart attack during the 2nd week of January. Just want you to know that it really meant a lot to me. 
Now I'd like to turn to our results for last year and our outlook for 2012 and beyond. Last year resulted in many successes. Last year also produced the 2 worst storms in our 45-year history, which hit us 9 weeks apart in August and October. We will discuss some of the majors we have initiated to improve our reliability during major storms, And David will review the impact of storm cost on our financial statement. 
But before they do, I again want to thank the NU employees for their dedication and professionalism during these 2 events. Many left their homes, which were often without power to restore power to our customers. For their actions, I am very proud and very grateful. 
The same employees were responsible for last year's many successes. The company delivered solid financial performance for our investors in 2011. Reoccurring earnings and cash flows were higher than in 2010. We made progress on a number of our major capital investment initiatives that will benefit New England Energy customers, and we also received all but 2 of the approvals we need to consummate our merger with NSTAR. 
From a financial standpoint, 2011 was the fifth consecutive year of attractive earnings growth since we fundamentally restructured our business profile in 2006. 
From an operational standpoint, we achieved a number of milestones in 2011. We brought online our Merrimack Scrubber and the WWL natural gas pipeline project and made solid progress on our greatest Springfield transmission project. All 3 of those projects will bring significant benefits to our customers and our communities over the years to come. 
From a strategic standpoint, our pending merger with NSTAR was approved by both company shareholders, as well as by for, the Department of Justice, the FCC and at the end of the year, the NRC. We also believe we are in a good position to secure final regulatory approvals in Connecticut and Massachusetts over the next 6 weeks. 
Last week, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced that we and NSTAR had negotiated 2 settlements that will help ensure that Massachusetts customers of NSTAR and WMECO will see both immediate and long-term benefits from the merger and that the merger will be supportive of the Commonwealth long-term energy goals. 
Under the settlement with the Attorney General and the Department of Energy resources-based distribution rates of NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and WMECO will be frozen at current levels to least 2015. Additionally, customers of the 3 utilities will receive credits on their first bills after the merger is consummated totaling $21 million, -- $3 million of which would flow-through WMECO customers. 
A separate zone with the Department of Energy resources, among other conditions, will require NSTAR Electric to purchase 129 megawatts of output from Cape Wind and for our Massachusetts utilities to expand their energy conservation and renewable energy initiatives and to support an electric vehicle program in Massachusetts. 
We believe the settlements provide a clear path to approval by Massachusetts of the merger, which will benefit our customers, our communities and our investors. The parties have asked the DPU to approve the merger on April 4. 
As you know, Massachusetts is one of the 2 state approvals we still require, the other being the Connecticut Public Utility Regulatory Authority. On January 18, the PURA reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that we needed to secure its approval before we completed the merger. While we did not agree with that decision as a matter of law, we filed an application the next day, January 19, requesting the PURA's approval. We are pleased that the PURA set a docket schedule that will permit a prompt review of the merger. Initial hearings began Lassie, and are scheduled to be completed today. Hearings on late filed exhibits will take place next week with briefs through March 5, and a draft decision on March 26. Final decision is due April 2. 
If both Connecticut and Massachusetts approvals are received the first week of April, we believe we will be able to consummate this transaction before April 16, which is the 18 month anniversary of the signing of the merger agreements.
To date, the Connecticut hearings have gone well. We believe are witnesses have made a strong case in support of the transaction. Under the state statute, the acquiring company needs to show that the mergers in the public interest and that it has the financial and managerial capability to run a utility safely and meet the state's utility public service obligations. We were very confident we can meet all of the PURA standards and look forward to completing the remaining steps in this expeditious review. 
Let me now move to the Northern Pass transmission project. We continue to view this project as an innovative way to bring 1,200 megawatts of clean baseload power to New Hampshire and the remainder of New England. It will materially reduce fossil fuel usage by the Regents generators and lower power costs, not only in New Hampshire, but the rest of New England as well. It is expected to add 1,200 jobs and about $25 million of annual property tax revenue in New Hampshire.
We've made significant progress on securing the rights to build the northernmost 40 miles of the project in New Hampshire, but we are not yet in a position to file on amended group with the U.S. Department of Energy. 
As many of you know, the New Hampshire Legislature earlier this year, past and cents that Governor Lynch a bill that may restrict the use of eminent domain in construction transmission lines are just Northern Pass that are not expected to be subject to regional cost allocation. While we do not believe we need to use eminent domain in acquiring the property rights for the project, we also don't think this bill will be in the best long-term interest of the states. We will provide you with more of a status report on the project in just a moment. 
As you also may be aware that the New Hampshire House of Representatives is considering a bill that would require PSNH to divest its nearly 1,200 megawatts of generation by the end of 2013. PSNH customers have saved up to $700 million over the past decade because customers pay are only a regulated return on that generation, and we believe that generation, which currently has a rate base of about $700 million to $800 million, provides PSNH with a ability of energy cost that is not available to many other consumers in New England. 
We continue to believe that PSNH's ownership generation is firmly in the best interest of our customers and believe legislators will concur. Finally, both Governor Malloy and the Connecticut State Senate have proposed legislation that would enhance the state's preparedness for major storms, such as tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm. Elements that would affect us include expanded state tree trimming, a requirement for annual emergency preparedness drills and the establishment of certain service quality metrics. We believe the versions of the bills we have seen to date are very workable and will help all parties achieve the common goals of improved and timely response to national disasters. 
As we move further into 2012, we are very optimistic about our future. We believe that with timely state revelatory approval, our merger will be consummated by mid April and will be able to get to work on bringing the very significant benefits this business combination will provide to our customers and our investors. We expect significant progress this year on our transmission initiatives, which will significantly enhance the critical highways of electricity delivery in New England. And we believe that the low, the current low gas price environment will offer increasing economic and environmental benefits to New England consumers, and we expect to play a key role in delivering those benefits to our communities.
Now before I turn this call over to Leon, I have one more comment that I just like to make. If we end up closing this merger when we hope, which would be mid-April, this phone call will be the last time that I will have the opportunity to speak to this group, at least in this capacity. It's been a privilege to be involved with all of you over a very long number of years. I've known some of you for a very long time, others a little more recently. But I do appreciate all the friendships that we have developed and the professionalism that all of you has have displayed, as we have worked through the this process over the last number of years. I'm going to miss all of you guys, hopefully, I'll have the opportunity to see a different events but this could very easily be the last time that I have a chance to talk to you as we are right now. 
Now let me turn the call over to Lee."
292525,170977562,263659,"Northeast Utilities, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2012",2012-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Chuck. The mild weather this winter had a number of positive operational impacts on us. To start, we've had very little winter storm activity in 2012. Secondly, we have made very good progress on our construction program. Our greater Springfiel",1326,"Thank you, Chuck. The mild weather this winter had a number of positive operational impacts on us. To start, we've had very little winter storm activity in 2012. Secondly, we have made very good progress on our construction program. Our greater Springfield reliability part, the largest project of the Eastwest Solutions family of projects remains on schedule. And we're confident we will be able to complete the project in late 2013 on its budget of $718 million. 
As of the end of 2011, we have spent about $315 million on the project. And as of today, more than 55% of the work, including engineering and permitting, is complete. We placed in service the Cadwell switching station in Western Massachusetts in December  2011, and hope to complete the expansion of the Avalon substation around the middle of this year. Both are important project milestones. 
The next large segment of news is the interstate liability project, where we will build the Connecticut section and National Grid will build the Rhode Island and Massachusetts sections of the project. We follow the siting application of the Connecticut Siting Council on December 23, and evidentiary hearings are scheduled to commence May 1. A decision is expected nearly 2013. We expect National Grid to file its siting publication this spring, and we expect to receive all siting approvals by the end of 2013. That would support a construction schedule that will place the project into service by the end of 2015. We continue to estimate that our segment of the project will cost about $218 million. 
Continues to evaluate our third major initiative within use, the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. We expect ESA to recommence its needs analysis and transmission alternative study in the second half of this year and to recommend solutions in 2013. As I mentioned earlier, ESA was born in its analysis to include the greater Hartford area. We have previously indicated that the Central Connecticut Reliability Project is about 18 months behind the interstate project. That is still the case. 
ESA New England has allowed more time at the front end of the process to review study assumptions and results for stakeholders and state regulators. Meanwhile, the detailed planning studies necessary to support the overall schedule are being completed. 
Turning to Northern Pass, let me expand upon some of the comments Chuck provided earlier. We have now secured a substantial amount of the property we will require for the 40-mile section in the Northern New Hampshire area, where we currently do not have a right-of-way. While we have secured a significant amount of the property, we continue to negotiate with additional property owners to secure the remaining sections of the project. We believe we will be able to acquire acceptable route we should make it feasible constructive project, even if the legislation before government and is an active. However, given the ultimate design needs of the project, along with the fact that we still need to complete significant siding and permit requirements, which will vary based on the route we ultimately select, there is a possibility that the commencement of construction could be delayed beyond the beginning of 2014. 
We will update you on the progress we are making later this spring. Our transmission capital expenditures totaled $459 million in 2011, up significantly from the $261 million we invested in 2010 and higher than our initial $434 million capital projections for 2011. This was primarily due to the greatest Springfield project, where we invested nearly $200 million in 2011, $30 million more than we have projected earlier in the year. 
We project transmission capital expenditures in 2012 of $473 million, with about half of that spent on the greater Springfield project. Turning from transmission to generation, our $422 million Clean Air Project, a wet scrubber being installed at our 2 unit Merrimack coal-fired station, began removing pollutants from Merrimack commissions in September. In November, the second of our 2 coal-fired units at Merrimack was tied into the scrubber and the project is operating as designed, And we have significantly reduced mercury and sulfur admissions at Merrimack. 
By midyear, we expect to complete the secondary waterways treatment system, and the project will be complete. We expect that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission prudence review of the project will be completed by year-end and we are very comfortable that they will conclude that our expenditures at Merrimack will be deem prudent since to project, which was mandated by statute, is working soundly and we need service about $30 million under its initial budget. 
With the Clean Air Project nearly complete, we expect our generation capital expenditures to decline from $136.5 million in 2011 to about $64 million in 2012. About $21 million of that will be spent on completing the Clean Air Project. 
In 2011, Western Mass Electric invested nearly $12 million on its second solo facility located on at a Brownfield site. The 2.3-megawatt Springfield facility jointed a 1.8-megawatt Pittsfield facility we completed in 2010. There are 2 largest solar generating facilities in New England. We have authority from the Department of public of utilities to build another 2 megawatts of solar facilities in Massachusetts, and we are now evaluating 2 sites for this project. 
Moving from generation to distribution. As a result of the 2 devastating storms that took place in 2011, we have begun discussing with Connecticut State officials, long-term store handing initiatives that could make our infrastructure more resistant to national events, such as the tropical storm Irene and last year's October snowstorm. 
You have may have that CMP proposed to the government 2 storm panel a series of measures that with cost up to $2 billion over 10 years. We expect to engage our regulators in the discussion about such initiatives later this year. But in the meantime, we have increased CL&P's 2012 distribution capital investment budget from the $284 million level we showed you at EEI to $315 million. These dollars will be used primarily for enhanced tree trimming that will bring greater clearances around our distribution lines to improve our reliability long term. Additionally, we are increasing CL&P's description O&M by about $14 million to increase our routine tree trimming budget and expand certain storm preparedness activities. David will review financial impacts of those 2012 enhancements.
Turning from electric financial gas submission. In November, Yankee Gas completed this qualified project on schedule and $3.6 million below budget. The project enhances natural gas services, reliability to our system and is fully reflected in Yankee Gas rates as a result of last year's rate case. 
The most significant initiative now at Yankee involved $40 million year replacement of a bear still in gas earnings pipe. This initiatives fully reflected in current rates. As you can see from last night's news release, Yankee Gas burn seals rose by 8% in 2011 compared with 2010. They were up more than 5% on a weather-adjusted basis. We continue to see significant demand for new service and conversions on the Yankee Gas system, driven by the fact that natural gas is about half the price of heating oil and the fact that about 50% of Connecticut households heat with oil and 31% with natural gas. Conversions natural gas heat, which numbered a few hundred annually, a few years ago, now total about 1,000 in 2010, 2,000 in 2011. And we may have many more in the pipeline of the 2012. 
Nevertheless, Yankee Gas supply constraints that restricted buildings to connect significant additional load in certain parts of the service Terry need to be resolve. Certain constraints at Eastern Connecticut are prevented the firm delivery of up to 1.2 billion additional cubic feet of natural gas per year. We are currently exploring a number of initiatives, some of them similar to the Waterbury to Wallingford lines eliminate those constraints and serve the growing demand for natural gas across the state. Now I'd like to turn it over to David."

As Chuck mentioned earlier, we are quite pleased with our financial performance in 2011, excluding charges related to the merger and the CL&P storm fund, we are in $423.9 million or $2.38 per share, compared with recurring earnings of $381",2489,"Thank you, Lee. As Chuck mentioned earlier, we are quite pleased with our financial performance in 2011, excluding charges related to the merger and the CL&P storm fund, we are in $423.9 million or $2.38 per share, compared with recurring earnings of $381.6 million or $2,16 per share in 2010. Our cash flow improved as well, rising to $901 million in 2011, after repayment of reduction bonds, compared with $832.6 million in 2010. This increase occurred despite the payment of more than $150 million in power restoration cost in 2011 associated with the tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm, as well as the contribution of an additional $100 million into our pension plan in 2011 compared with 2010. 
Last spring, Standard & Poor's raised our credit ratings by one notch across the board and raise, give us an ratings by one notch and moved CL&P's outlook from stable to positive. 
NU's senior unsecured ratings are now BBB, BAA2 and BBB by S&P, Moody's and Fitch respectively. Still be senior secured mating are A-, A2 and A-. 
In over the course of 2011, we announced approximately $365 million of pollution control revenues meant at sylvian presentation that significantly lower interest rates, saving an estimated $57 million over the life of the bonds. I'll discuss our 2012 financing plans in a moment. But first, I want to announce our 2011 results in more detail, starting with our regulating companies. 
Regulating company earnings totaled $438.3 million in 2011, excluding the CL&P storm fund charge, up 14% from 2010 levels. The improvement occurred in both our distribution and transmission segments. 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, NU earned $132.4 million, or $0.74 per share on a recurring basis, compared with $123 million, or $0.69 per share we earned on a recurring basis in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter improvement was all on the transmission segment, which earned $71.2 million in the fourth quarter compared with $50.5 million in the fourth quarter of '10. That improvement was due primarily to higher rate base at WMECO transmission and a lower effective tax rate at CL&P transmission. 
Our transmission earnings totaled $199.6 million, or $1.12 per share in 2011, compared with $177.8 million, or $1 per share in 2010. The most significant improvement occurred at Western Mass, where earnings rose about $10 million, primarily due to the construction of the Greatest Springfed reliability project. WMECO's transmission rate base totaled $467 million at the end of 2011, compared with $269 million at the end of 2010, an increase of nearly 74%. 
CL&P's transmission earnings rose to $151.9 million in 2011 from $143.9 million in 2010. Most of that increase is due to lower effective tax rate. Transmission rate base declined by about 2.3% to $2.1 billion, primarily because of the completion of the planned sales of $42.5 million of transmission facilities to a Connecticut municipal electric cooperative. 
Turning from transmission to distribution, we earned $238.7 million in 2011, or $1.34 per share, excluding the CL&P storm fund, compared with $206.2 million or $1.16 per share in 2010. That was an increase of nearly 16%. However, in the fourth quarter, distribution earnings declined to $65.2 million in 2011 from $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
As I will discuss shortly, those declines were primarily at Yankee Gas, which was negatively affected by a mile Director in CL&P distribution, which had a higher effective tax rate. For the full year, CL&P's distribution earnings were $110.6 million in 2011, excluding the storm fund, compared with $94.1 million in 2010. Improvement was largely due to the distribution rate case decision of June in 2010. 
CL&P's distribution regulatory ROE was 9.4% in 2011, which achieves our allowed ROE compared with an earned ROE of 7.9% in the year 2010. DSNH Destination distribution and generation business current $18.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $76.2 million for the full year of 2011, compared with earnings of $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and $69.3 million for the full year. 
The higher full-year results were primarily due to the distribution rate increase that was effective July 1, 2010. That increase was partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes. PSNH's combined distribution and generation regulatory ROE was 9.7% in 2011, right around our weighted generation and distribution average allowed ROE, compared with 10.2% in 2010. 
WMECO's distribution and generation business earned $7.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $20.2 million for the full year of 2011, compared with $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of '10, and $10.1 million for the full year of 2010. The approved results were primarily due to the impacts of the rate case decision issued in January of 2011 by the Massachusetts GPU. That decision, which was effective February 1 of '11 provided Western Mass Electric with $16.8 million in higher annual distribution revenues, but also required us to take a $2.1 million after tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
WMECO's distribution regulatory ROE was 9% in 2011 compared with 4.6% in 2010 in an allowed level of 9.6%. Yankee Gas earned $11 million in the fourth quarter of '11 and $31.7 million for the full year 2011, compared with earnings of $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $32.7 million for the full year of 2010. 
This wrap in fourth quarter earnings was due to an 8.5% decline in firm natural gas sales is due to much warmer weather in late 2011, as well as a higher effective tax rate. Yankees regulatory ROE was 9.3% in 2011, compared with 8.6% in 2010 and an allowed level of 8.83%, which was set last summer at the conclusion of the Yankees rate case. 
For the full year, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 8% in 2011, due to much colder weather in the first quarter of 2011 than in the first quarter of '10, as well as a 5.1% weather-adjusted increase in sales. Those sales increases occurred primarily in the commercial and industrial sectors, where year-over-year sales were up 13.5% and 8.9%, respectively. 
The improvement was due primarily due to the increasing price advantage of natural gas compared with heating oil. As you can imagine, the continued warm weather in the first quarter of 2012 will not help Yankee Gas this year compared with '11. We estimate that Yankee Gas lost about $4 million of pre-tax margin due to the warmer than normal temperatures in the fourth quarter alone, and perhaps, another $2 million in January of '12. 
Aside from the impacts of the special contracts, we expect Yankees weather normalized firm sales to rise about 6% in 2012 compared with '11. The electric side remains quite different. Retail electric sales fell by 1.2% 2011 compared with 2010, but declined by only 0.3% on a weather-adjusted basis. PSNH retail weather-adjusted sales were up by 0.4%, while CNN went down 0.5% and Western Mass Electric was down by 0.2%. We attribute CL&P larger decline compared to the PSNH, WMECO in part to the power outages following Irene and the October snowstorm. 
In 2012, we expect weather-adjusted electric sales to be slightly flat compared with 2011. We continue to see the impact of a soft but recovering economy in our service territory, along with increased levels of company sponsored conservation. Just my way of some my background of the economy across our state's, the number of jobs at New Hampshire grow by about 1% in 2011 and the unemployment rate there ended the year at 5.1%, well below the national average of 8.5%. Average weekly hours for manufacturing employees grew by 0.7% and weekly unemployment claims fell by about 12% over the course of 2011. 
Hosing permits continue to be weak, however. In Connecticut, nonmanufacturing employment is up by 33,600 jobs since bottoming 2 years ago. exports grew by about 2% 2011 and new auto registration were up sharply. But housing permits are down about 4.6%. December, the state unemployment rate was 8.2%. In Western Massachusetts, the unemployment rate is down to about 7.7%, aided in part by an influx in construction jobs that resulted from continued repairs to the housing damage during last June's tornado that tore through Springfield and other segments of Western Massachusetts. 
Turning now to our financial results, NU parent and other companies had net expenses of $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $25.7 million for the full year 2011, compared with net income of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and net income of $3.9 million for the full year 2010. These figures include merger costs in both years and a nonrecurring tax gain of $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, when we settled a number of state tax items. 
Excluding all those impacts, we had net parent and other expenses of $14.4 million in 2011, or $0.08 per share, compared with recurring net expenses of $2.4 million, or less $0.01 per share in 2010. The decline is primarily due to the absence of earnings at our competitive businesses, which are now almost fully unwound. 
As we mentioned at the EI conference in November 2011, we are not providing standalone earnings guidance for 2012, since we provide merge company guidance following the close of our pending merger with NSTAR. However, there are few trends that should help you model and use earnings power this year. Let me talk about a few of those.
First, and perhaps most obvious, is a slow start of the year in terms of sales due to the warm-winter weather. This will clearly impact both electric and gas sales, but proportionally more so at Yankee. Offsetting this somewhat is the revenue decoupling mechanism at Western Mass Electric. And as you know, our transmission and generation business earnings are decoupled from sales volumes. 
As we continue to move forward on the Greater Springfield reliability project in 2010, we expect WMECO's transmission earnings to continue to rise meaningfully. At CL&P however, this project the higher active tax rate, resulting in lower CL&P transmission earnings in 2012, despite a roughly 2% increase in transmission rate base. 
Overall, we expect NU's 2012 transmission earnings to be relatively flat as compared with '11, with increases PSNH and Western Mass offsetting a decrease at CL&P. 
In terms of our FERC authorize ROE, we are not anticipating a change. You may recall that at the end of September of 2011, a number of New England parties filed a complaint with the FERC regarding the 11.14% base ROE that is allowed to all New England transmission owners on their reliability investments. There were several rounds of filings at FERC in the fourth quarter regarding this complaint. We continue to believe that the base ROE is well within FERC's range of reasonableness, it should not be changed. However, FERC has not yet said when or how it will process the complaint. It could be rejected it could be said for a consistent period or it could be assigned to the settlement judge. At the distribution businesses, we have the benefit of some modest rate increases, but also the headwind of higher pension and health-care expenses. Together, untracked employee-related expense, primarily related to pension at CL&P and the PSNH distribution and Yankee Gas is expected to cost us about $0.10 per share in '12 or about 2.5 cents per quarter compared with 2011. This is primarily due to 2 factors. 
The first is that lower interest rates have led us reduce our discount rate from about 5.6% in 2011 to a 5% in 2012. Additionally, the return on our investments in 2011 of about 2%, while competitive with other corporate plants, was still below our assumed long-term rate of return of 8.25%. 
I should note that we are currently -- we currently project that 2012 should be the high watermark for both pension expense and cash contribution to our pension plan. Some of the 2008 investment losses in our pension plan will be fully amortized by the end of this year. And as a result, we currently expect both pension plan expense and pension plan contributions to decline in 2013.compared with 2012. As you'll see on our 10K, we spent contribution of approximately $150 million annually from 2012 through 2015, compared with contributions of roughly $197 million in 2012. 
And then by return in discount rate expectations for 2012 turn out to be fairly accurate. We will expect 2013 pension expense to be more similar to 2011 than 2012. 
Other factors that will pressure results in 2012 are related to the tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm. As we mentioned earlier, we are increasing tree trimming and emergency preparedness budget, as well as adding about $30 million to CL&P distribution capital budget. Those expenditures and expect to reduce earnings by about $0.05 over the course of 2012 compared with 2011. 
We will also need to pay short-term interest cost on approximately $300 million of storm deferrals over the cause of '12. We expect impact of the short-term debt levels t reduced CL&P's distribution earnings by about $0.03 per share. Meaning the storm factors will cost about $0.08 per share in additional net cost in 2012. 
Now offsetting those increased cost are the $38 million of annualized distribution rate increases CL&P implemented in mid-2011 and an approximately $7 million rate increase Yankee Gas will implement in mid-2012 and the distribution rate increase of $5 million to $10 million we expect PSNH will be allowed to implement in mid-2012 as a result of its 2012 rate summit. Because of the mid-year timing of each of those rate increases, the total impact on revenues in 2012 versus last year is expected to be approximately $25 million pre-tax or about $0.09 per share. 
Benefiting both 2012 and '13, NU parent results should be refinancing at NU parent. A 7.25%, $263 million NU parent issuance will mature on April 1, 2012, and another $250 million of 5.65% NU parent debt on June 1, 2013. We expect that the favorable interest rate environment in addition to likely post merger credit upgrade will significantly lower interest cost on both parent issuance. 
In terms of additional financing, we need to reprice $62 million of CL&P tax bonds on April 1, and we are looking for WMECO and Yankee Gas to sell new debt rate of this year. We are also looking at increasing CL&P's short-term debt credit lines to help us handle the $250 million of storm costs CL&P is now carry. We currently expect no long-term debt issuance at CL&P or PSNH in 2012. 
Lastly, we expect 2012 to benefit from continued strong cost control, higher generation earnings at PSNH, a growing customer base and sales at Yankee, low interest rates, modest electric sales growth, lower NU parent expense and strong cash flow throughout the NU system.

So multiple sites, more construction, which could lead to an earlier conclusion of the construction window of the project. You asked about other variables clearly, we need to demonstrate political support for the project in the state. Although in our serving, we think of the support of the project continues to rise with the citizens of New Hampshire continues to rise with legislators.

And I will side with kind of just to summarizing where we are in transmission, which is probably the easy one. I said that Jason H and Western Mass transition earnings will be growing, but offset by CL&P that did receive a benefit this year of the lower tax rate particularly in Q4. So transmission will be roughly flat. On the sales side, we talked about some benefits in there. And I do think it will be modest for the electric businesses. In 2011, we saw some similar trends around demand, stronger growth in New Hampshire, weaker growth in Massachusetts that's really in the middle and that Connecticut and I think you should expect that going forward. Save a bit of an uplift there and I think strong growth for Yankee, driven by both the demand for gas, given the price advantage and conversions of new customers as they seek out to convert to these natural gas instead of home meeting all. So that, I think, is a benefit. I also kind of rattled off, but did not quantify other than a follow-up on Jay's question on a number of additional items. So strong cost control. We don't see that as a real big pressure on us so I'll come back to that. Growth and generation earnings at PSNH. Low interest rates across the board. And then, I did highlight, Maury, then you period to another segment, low interest rates on the refinancing fees being a big driver of the 7 1/4 $263 million bond coming due. And you can perform a what you think will fit refinance of that. So clearly, in that segment you can get some up with. The bigger drivers, we noted that for the storm between the O&M investments that we discussed, a $14 million incrementally and for the additional capital, $30 million incrementally. That's going to be about a $0.10, excuse me, a $0.09 number for us. For the -- let me jump over to the contract benefit expenses for both the I know budget and employee benefits. We said relative to 2011 is going to be a $0.10 increase, with 2012 being the high watermark. We expect that 2013 will actually decline from there. We also then said, I guess, lastly, that the offsets would be rate increases that go into affect they're going to provide about $25 million of pre-tax benefit or $0.09 per share of benefit. And let me just correct myself on the storms. That was a net $0.08 negative, not net $0.09 or $0.10 negative."

Before we begin the discussion of NU's financial and operational results, I just like to thank everybody on the call for all the notes and cards and very good wishes that you've expressed to me over the past month and a half. I appreciate your thoughtful words since my heart attack during the second week of January. I just want you to know that it really meant a lot to me. 
Now I'd like to turn to our results for last year and our outlook for 2012 and beyond. Last year resulted in many successes. Last year also produced the 2 worst storms in our 45-year history, which hit us 9 weeks apart in August and October. We will discuss some of the measures we have initiated to improve our reliability during major storms, And David will review the impact of storm cost on our financial statement. 
But before they do, I again want to thank the NU employees for their dedication and professionalism during these 2 events. Many left their homes, which were often without power to restore power to our customers. For their actions, I am very proud and very grateful. 
Those same employees were responsible for last year's many successes. The company delivered solid financial performance for our investors in 2011. Reoccurring earnings and cash flows were higher than in 2010. We made progress on a number of our major capital investment initiatives that will benefit New England energy customers, and we also received all but 2 of the approvals we need to consummate our merger with NSTAR. 
From a financial standpoint, 2011 was the fifth consecutive year of attractive earnings growth since we fundamentally restructured our business profile in 2006. 
From an operational standpoint, we achieved a number of milestones in 2011. We brought online our Merrimack Scrubber and the WWL natural gas pipeline project and made solid progress on our Greater Springfield Transmission Project. All 3 of those projects will bring significant benefits to our customers and our communities over the years to come. 
From a strategic standpoint, our pending merger with NSTAR was approved by both company shareholders as well as by FERC, the Department of Justice, the FCC and, at the end of the year, the NRC. We also believe we are in a good position to secure final regulatory approvals in Connecticut and Massachusetts over the next 6 weeks. 
Last week, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced that we and NSTAR had negotiated 2 settlements that will help ensure that Massachusetts customers of NSTAR and WMECO will see both immediate and long-term benefits from the merger and that the merger will be supportive of the Commonwealth long-term energy goals. 
Under the settlement with the Attorney General and the Department of Energy Resources base distribution rates of NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and WMECO will be frozen at current levels through at least 2015. Additionally, customers of the 3 utilities will receive credits on their first bills after the merger is consummated, totaling $21 million, $3 million of which would flow through WMECO customers. 
A separate settlement with the Department of Energy Resources among other conditions will require NSTAR Electric to purchase 129 megawatts of output from Cape Wind and for our Massachusetts utilities to expand their energy conservation and renewable energy initiatives and to support an electric vehicle program in Massachusetts. 
We believe the settlements provide a clear path to approval by Massachusetts of the merger, which will benefit our customers, our communities and our investors. The parties have asked the DPU to approve the merger on April 4. 
As you know, Massachusetts is one of the 2 state approvals we still require, the other being the Connecticut Public Utility Regulatory Authority. On January 18, the PURA reversed its earlier decision and ruled that we needed to secure its approval before we completed the merger. While we do not agree with that decision as a matter of law, we filed an application the next day, January 19, requesting the PURA's approval. We are pleased that the PURA set a docket schedule that will permit a prompt review of the merger. Initial hearings began last week and are scheduled to be completed today. Hearings on late-filed exhibits will take place next week, with briefs due March 5, and a draft decision on March 26. Final decision is due April 2. 
If both Connecticut and Massachusetts approvals are received the first week of April, we believe we will be able to consummate this transaction before April 16, which is the 18-month anniversary of the signing of the merger agreements.
To date, the Connecticut hearings have gone well. We believe our witnesses have made a strong case in support of the transaction. Under the state statute, the acquiring company needs to show that the merger is in the public interest and that it has the financial and managerial capability to run a utility safely and meet the state's utility public service obligations. We were very confident we can meet all of the PURA standards and look forward to completing the remaining steps in this expeditious review. 
Let me now move to the Northern Pass Transmission Project. We continue to view this project as an innovative way to bring 1,200 megawatts of clean base-load power to New Hampshire and the remainder of New England. It will materially reduce fossil fuel usage by the region's generators and lower power costs not only in New Hampshire, but the rest of New England as well. It is expected to add 1,200 jobs and about $25 million in annual property tax revenue in New Hampshire.
We've made significant progress on securing the rights to build the northernmost 40 miles of the project in New Hampshire, but we are not yet in a position to file an amended group with the U.S. Department of Energy. 
As many of you know, the New Hampshire Legislature earlier this year passed and sent to Governor Lynch a bill that may restrict the use of eminent domain in construction transmission lines, such as Northern Pass, that are not expected to be subject to regional cost allocation. While we do not believe we need to use eminent domain in acquiring the property rights for the project, we also don't think this bill will be in the best long-term interest of the states. We will provide you with more of a status report on the project in just a moment. 
As you also maybe aware that the New Hampshire House of Representatives is considering a bill that would require PSNH to divest its nearly 1,200 megawatts of generation by the end of 2013. PSNH customers have saved up to $700 million over the past decade because customers pay for only a regulated return on that generation, and we believe that generation, which currently has a rate base of about $700 million to $800 million, provides PSNH with a stability of energy cost that is not available to many other consumers in New England. 
We continue to believe that PSNH's ownership of generation is firmly in the best interest of our customers and believe legislators will concur. Finally, both Governor Malloy and the Connecticut State Senate have proposed legislation that would enhance the state's preparedness for major storms, such as tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm. Elements that would affect us include expanded state tree trimming, a requirement for annual emergency preparedness drills and the establishment of certain service quality metrics. We believe diversions of the bills we have seen to date are very workable and will help all parties achieve the common goals of improved and timely response to national disasters. 
As we move further into 2012, we are very optimistic about our future. We believe that with timely state regulatory approval, our merger will be consummated by mid-April, and we'll be able to get to work on bringing the very significant benefits this business combination will provide to our customers and our investors. We expect significant progress this year on our transmission initiatives, which will significantly enhance the critical highways of electricity delivery in New England. And we believe that the low -- the current low gas price environment will offer increasing economic and environmental benefits to New England consumers, and we expect to play a key role in delivering those benefits to our communities.
Now before I turn this call over to Lee, I have one more comment that I just like to make. If we end up closing this merger when we hoped, which would be mid-April, this phone call will be the last time that I will have the opportunity to speak to this group, at least in this capacity. It's been a privilege to be involved with all of you over a very long number of years. I've known some of you for a very long time, others a little more, more recently. But I do appreciate all the friendships that we have developed and the professionalism that all of you have displayed as we have worked through this process over our last number of years. I'm going to miss all of you guys. Hopefully, I'll have the opportunity to see you at different events, but this could very easily be the last time that I have a chance to talk to you as we are right now. 
Now let me turn the call over to Lee."

The mild weather this winter has had a number of positive operational impacts on us. To start, we've had very little winter storm activity in 2012. Secondly, we have made very good progress on our construction program. Our Greater Spring",1335,"Thank you, Chuck. The mild weather this winter has had a number of positive operational impacts on us. To start, we've had very little winter storm activity in 2012. Secondly, we have made very good progress on our construction program. Our Greater Springfield Reliability Project, the largest component of the New England East-West Solutions family of projects, remains on schedule. We are confident we will be able to complete the project in late 2013 on its budget of $718 million. 
As of the end of 2011, we have spent about $315 million on the project. And as of today, more than 55% of the work, including engineering and permitting, is complete. We placed on service the Cadwell Switching Station in Western Massachusetts in December 2011, and hope to complete the expansion of the Agalomm [ph] substation around the middle of this year. Both are important project milestones. 
The next large segment of news is the Interstate Reliability Project, where we will build the Connecticut section, and National Grid will build the Rhode Island and Massachusetts sections of the project. We filed a siting application with the Connecticut Siting Council on December 23, and evidentiary hearings are scheduled to commence May 1. A decision is expected nearly 2013. We expect National Grid to file its siting application this spring, and we expect to receive all siting approvals by the end of 2013. That would support a construction schedule that would place the project into service by the end of 2015. We continue to estimate that our segment of the project will cost about $218 million. 
ISO New England continues to evaluate our third major initiative within NEEWS, the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. We expect ISO to recommence its needs analysis and transmission alternative study in the second half of this year and to recommend solutions in 2013. As I mentioned earlier, ISO has broadened its analysis to include the Greater Hartford area. We have previously indicated that the Central Connecticut Reliability Project is about 18 months behind the Interstate Project. That is still the case. 
ISO New England has allowed more time at the front end of the process to review study assumptions and results for the stakeholders and state regulators. Meanwhile, the detailed planning studies necessary to support the overall schedule are being completed. 
Turning to Northern Pass, let me expand upon some of the comments Chuck provided earlier. We have now secured a substantial amount of the property we will require for the 40-mile section in the Northern New Hampshire area, where we currently do not have a right of way. While we have secured a significant amount of the property, we continue to negotiate with additional property owners to secure the remaining sections of the project. We believe we will be able to acquire an acceptable route, which should make it a feasible constructive project even if the legislation before Governor Lynch gets enacted. However, given the ultimate design needs of the project, along with the fact that we still need to complete significant siting and permit requirements, which will vary based on the route we ultimately select, there is a possibility that the commencement of construction could be delayed beyond the beginning of 2014. We will update you on the progress we are making later this spring. 
Our transmission capital expenditures totaled $459 million in 2011, up significantly from the $261 million we invested in 2010 and higher than our initial $434 million capital projections for 2011. This was primarily due to the Greater Springfield Project, where we invested nearly $200 million in 2011, $30 million more than we projected earlier in the year. 
We project transmission capital expenditures in 2012 of $473 million, with about half of that spent on the Greater Springfield Project. Turning from transmission to generation, our $422 million Clean Air Project, a wet scrubber being installed at our 2-unit Merrimack coal-fired station, began removing pollutants from Merrimack commissions in September. In November, the second of our 2 coal-fired units at Merrimack was tied into the scrubber, and the project is operating as designed. And we have significantly reduced mercury and sulfur emissions at Merrimack. 
By midyear, we expect to complete the secondary water waste treatment system, and the project will be complete. We expect that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission prudence review of the project will be completed by yearend, and we are very comfortable that they will conclude that our expenditures at Merrimack will be deemed prudent since the project, which was mandated by statute, is working soundly and went into service for about $35 million under its initial budget. 
With the Clean Air Project nearly complete, we expect our generation capital expenditures to decline from $136.5 million in 2011 to about $64 million in 2012. About $21 million of that will be spent on completing the Clean Air Project. 
In 2011, Western Mass Electric invested nearly $12 million on its second solar facility located at a brownfield site. The 2.3-megawatt Springfield facility joined a 1.8-megawatt Pittsfield facility we completed in 2010. They are 2 of the largest solar generating facilities in New England. We have authority from the Department of Public Utilities to build another 2 megawatts of solar facilities in Massachusetts, and we are now evaluating 2 sites for this project. 
Moving from generation to distribution. As a result of the 2 devastating storms that took place in 2011, we have begun discussing with Connecticut State officials long-term storm handling [ph] initiatives that could make our infrastructure more resistant to natural events, such as the tropical storm Irene and last year's October snowstorm. 
You have may have seen that CL&P proposed to the governments 2 stone panel a series of measures that would cost up to $2 billion over 10 years. We expect to engage our regulators in a discussion about such initiatives later this year. But in the meantime, we have increased CL&P's 2012 distribution capital investment budget from the $284 million level we showed you at EEI to $315 million. These dollars will be used primarily for enhanced tree trimming that will create greater clearances around our distribution lines to improve our reliability long term. Additionally, we are increasing CL&P's distribution O&M by about $14 million to increase our routine tree-trimming budget and expand certain storm-preparedness activities. David will review financial impacts of those 2012 enhancements.
Turning from electric and natural gas distribution.  In November, Yankee Gas completed this Waterbury-to-Wallingford project on schedule and $3.6 million below budget. The project enhances natural gas services, reliability to our system and is fully reflected in Yankee Gas rates as a result of last year's rate case. 
The most significant initiative now at Yankee involves the $40 million-a-year replacement of a bear steel and cast-iron pipe. This initiative's fully reflected in current rates. As you can see from last night's news release, Yankee Gas firm sales rose by 8% in 2011 compared with 2010. They were up more than 5% on a weather-adjusted basis. We continue to see significant demand for new service and conversions on the Yankee Gas system, driven by the fact that natural gas is about half the price of heating oil and the fact that about 50% of Connecticut households heat with oil and only 31% with natural gas. Conversions to natural gas heat, which numbered a few hundred annually a few years ago, now total about 1,000 in 2010, 2,000 in 2011, and we may have many more in the pipeline for 2012. 
Nevertheless, Yankee Gas supply constraints that restrictive billing to connect significant additional load in certain parts of the service need to be resolved. Certain constraints at Eastern Connecticut are preventing the firm delivery of up to 1.2 billion additional cubic feet of natural gas per year. We are currently exploring a number of initiatives, some of them similar to the Waterbury-to-Wallingford line to eliminate those constraints and serve the growing demand for natural gas across the state. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to David."

As Chuck mentioned earlier, we are quite pleased with our financial performance in 2011. Excluding charges related to the merger and the CL&P storm fund, we are in $423.9 million or $2.38 per share compared with recurring earnings of $381.",2486,"Thank you, Lee. As Chuck mentioned earlier, we are quite pleased with our financial performance in 2011. Excluding charges related to the merger and the CL&P storm fund, we are in $423.9 million or $2.38 per share compared with recurring earnings of $381.6 million or $2.16 per share in 2010. Our cash flow improved as well, rising to $901 million in 2011, after repayment of reduction bonds compared with $832.6 million in 2010. This increase occurred despite the payment of more than $150 million in power restoration cost in 2011 associated with the tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm, as well as the contribution of an additional $100 million into our pension plan in 2011 compared with 2010. 
Last spring, Standard & Poor's raised our credit ratings by one notch across the board, and Fitch raised PSNH's ratings by one notch and moved CL&P's outlook from stable to positive. 
NU's senior unsecured ratings are now BBB, BAA2 and BBB by S&P, Moody's and Fitch respectively. CL&P senior secured ratings are A-, A2 and A-. 
In over the course of 2011, we refinanced approximately $365 million of pollution control revenue bond at CL&P and PSNH. That significantly lower interest rates, saving an estimated $57 million over the life of the bonds. I'll discuss our 2012 financing plans in a moment. But first, I want to discuss our 2011 results in more detail, starting with our regulating companies. 
Regulating company earnings totaled $438.3 million in 2011, excluding the CL&P storm fund charge, up 14% from 2010 levels. The improvement occurred in both our distribution and transmission segments. 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, NU earned $132.4 million or $0.74 per share on a recurring basis compared with $123 million or $0.69 per share we earned on a recurring basis in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter improvement was all on the transmission segment, which earned $71.2 million in the fourth quarter compared with $50.5 million in the fourth quarter of '10. That improvement was due primarily to higher rate base at WMECO transmission and a lower effective tax rate at CL&P transmission. 
Our transmission earnings totaled $199.6 million or $1.12 per share in 2011 compared with $177.8 million or $1 per share in 2010. The most significant improvement occurred at Western Mass, where earnings rose about $10 million, primarily due to the construction of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. WMECO's transmission rate base totaled $467 million at the end of 2011 compared with $269 million at the end of 2010, an increase of nearly 74%. 
CL&P's transmission earnings rose to $151.9 million in 2011 from $143.9 million in 2010. Most of that increase was due to a lower effective tax rate. Transmission rate base declined by about 2.3% to $2.1 billion, primarily because of the completion of the planned sale of $42.5 million of transmission facilities to a Connecticut municipal electric cooperative. 
Turning from transmission to distribution, we earned $238.7 million in 2011, or $1.34 per share excluding the CL&P storm fund, compared with $206.2 million or $1.16 per share in 2010. That was an increase of nearly 16%. However, in the fourth quarter, distribution earnings declined to $65.2 million in 2011 from $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. As I will discuss shortly, those declines were primarily at Yankee Gas, which was negatively affected by milder weather in CL&P distribution, which had a higher effective tax rate. 
For the full year, CL&P's distribution earnings were $110.6 million in 2011 excluding the storm fund compared with $94.1 million in 2010. Improvement was largely due to the distribution rate case decision of June 2010. CL&P's distribution regulatory ROE was 9.4% in 2011, which achieves our allowed ROE compared with an earned ROE of 7.9% in the year 2010. 
PSNH's distribution and generation business earned $18.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $76.2 million for the full year of 2011 compared with earnings of $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and $69.3 million for the full year. The higher full year results were primarily due to the distribution rate increase that was effective July 1, 2010. That increase was partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes. PSNH's combined distribution and generation regulatory ROE was 9.7% in 2011, right around our weighted generation and distribution average allowed ROE, compared with 10.2% in 2010. 
WMECO's distribution and generation business earned $7.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $20.2 million for the full year of 2011 compared with $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and $10.1 million for the full year of 2010. The approved results were primarily due to the impacts of the rate case decision issued in January of 2011 by the Massachusetts DPU. That decision, which was effective February 1, 2011, provided Western Mass Electric with $16.8 million in higher annual distribution revenues, but also required us to take a $2.1 million after tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
WMECO's distribution regulatory ROE was 9% in 2011 compared with 4.6% in 2010 in an allowed level of 9.6%. Yankee Gas earned $11 million in the fourth quarter of '11 and $31.7 million for the full year 2011, compared with earnings of $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $32.7 million for the full year of 2010. This drop in the fourth quarter earnings was due to an 8.5% decline in firm natural gas sales due to much warmer weather in late 2011, as well as a higher effective tax rate. Yankees regulatory ROE was 9.3% in 2011, compared with 8.6% in 2010 and an allowed level of 8.83%, which was set last summer at the conclusion of Yankees' rate case. 
For the full year, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 8% in 2011 due to much colder weather in the first quarter of 2011 than in the first quarter of '10, as well as a 5.1% weather-adjusted increase in sales. Those sales increases occurred primarily in the commercial and industrial sectors, where year-over-year sales were up 13.5% and 8.9%, respectively. The improvement was due primarily to the increasing price advantage of natural gas compared with heating oil. 
As you can imagine, the continued warm weather in the first quarter of 2012 will not help Yankee Gas sales this year compared with '11. We estimate that Yankee Gas lost about $4 million of pre-tax margin due to the warmer-than-normal temperatures in the fourth quarter alone and, perhaps, another $2 million in January of '12. 
Aside from the impacts of the special contracts, we expect Yankees' weather-normalized firm sales to rise about 6% in 2012 compared with '11. The electric side remains quite different. Retail electric sales fell by 1.2% in 2011 compared with 2010, but declined by only 0.3% on a weather-adjusted basis. PSNH retail weather-adjusted sales were up by 0.4%, while CL&Ps were down 0.5% and Western Mass Electric was down by 0.2%. We attribute CL&P's larger decline compared to the PSNH, WMECO in part to the power outages following Irene and the October snowstorm. 
In 2012, we expect weather-adjusted electric sales to be slightly flat compared with 2011. We continue to see the impact of a soft but recovering economy in our service territory, along with increased levels of company-sponsored conservation. 
Just my way of some background on the economy across our states, the number of jobs in New Hampshire grew by about 1% in 2011, and the unemployment rate there ended the year at 5.1%, well below the national average of 8.5%. Average weekly hours for manufacturing employees grew by 0.7% and weekly unemployment claims fell by about 12% over the course of 2011. Housing permits continue to be weak, however. In Connecticut, nonmanufacturing employment is up by 33,600 jobs since bottoming 2 years ago, exports grew by about 2% in 2011 and new auto registration were up sharply. But housing permits are down about 4.6%. December, the state unemployment rate was 8.2%. In Western Massachusetts, the unemployment rate is down to about 7.7%, aided in part by an influx in construction jobs that resulted from continued repairs to the housing damage during last June's tornado that tore through Springfield and other segments of Western Massachusetts. 
Turning back to our financial results, NU parent and other companies had net expenses of $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $25.7 million for the full year 2011 compared with net income of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and net income of $3.9 million for the full year 2010. These figures include merger costs in both years and a nonrecurring tax gain of $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, when we settled a number of state tax items. 
Excluding all those impacts, we had net parent and other expenses of $14.4 million in 2011 or $0.08 per share compared with recurring net expenses of $2.4 million or less than $0.01 per share in 2010. The decline is primarily due to the absence of earnings at our competitive businesses, which are now almost fully unwound. 
As we mentioned at the EEI conference in November 2011, we are not providing standalone earnings guidance for 2012 since we expect to provide merged company guidance following the close of our pending merger with NSTAR. However, there are few trends that should help you model and use earnings power this year. Let me talk about a few of those.
First, and perhaps most obvious, is a slow start of the year in terms of sales due to the warm-winter weather. This will clearly impact both electric and gas sales, but proportionally more so at Yankee. Offsetting this somewhat is the revenue decoupling mechanism at Western Mass Electric. And as you know, our transmission and generation business earnings are decoupled from sales volumes. 
As we continue to move forward on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in 2012, we expect WMECO's transmission earnings to continue to rise meaningfully. At CL&P, however, we project a higher effective tax rate, resulting in lower CL&P transmission earnings in 2012 despite a roughly 2% increase in transmission rate base. 
Overall, we expect NU's 2012 transmission earnings to be relatively flat as compared with '11, with increases at PSNH and Western Mass offsetting a decrease at CL&P. 
In terms of our FERC-authorized ROE, we are not anticipating a change. You may recall that at the end of September of 2011, a number of New England parties filed a complaint with the FERC regarding the 11.14% base ROE that is allowed to all New England transmission owners on their reliability investments. There were several rounds of filings at FERC in the fourth quarter regarding this complaint. We continue to believe that the base ROE is well within FERC's range of reasonableness, it should not be changed. However, FERC has not yet said when or how it will process the complaint. It could be rejected, it could be set for a contest of hearing or it could be assigned to a settlement judge. 
At the distribution businesses, we have the benefit of some modest rate increases, but also the headwind of higher pension and health care expenses. Together, untracked employee-related expense primarily related to pension that CL&P and PSNH distribution and Yankee Gas is expected to cost us about $0.10 per share in '12 or about $0.025 per quarter compared with 2011. This is primarily due to 2 factors. The first is that lower interest rates have led us to reduce our discount rate from about 5.6% in 2011 to about 5% in 2012. Additionally, the return on our investments in 2011 of about 2%, while competitive with other corporate plans, was still below our assumed long-term rate of return of 8.25%. 
I should note that we are currently -- we currently project that 2012 should be the high watermark for both pension expense and cash contribution to our pension plan. Some of the 2008 investment losses in our pension plan will be fully amortized by the end of this year, and as a result, we currently expect both pension plan expense and pension plan contributions to decline in 2013 compared with 2012. As you'll see on our 10-K, we expect contributions of approximately $150 million annually from 2012 through 2015 compared with contributions of roughly $197 million in 2012. 
And if I return in discount rate expectations for 2012 turned out to be fairly accurate. We will expect 2013 pension expense to be more similar to 2011 than 2012. 
Other factors that will pressure results in 2012 are related to the tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm. As we mentioned earlier, we are increasing tree trimming and emergency preparedness budgets, as well as adding about $30 million to CL&P's distribution capital budgets. Those expenditures are expected to reduce earnings by about $0.05 over the course of 2012 compared with 2011. We will also need to pay short-term interest cost on approximately $300 million of storm deferrals over the course of '12. We expect the impact of the short-term debt levels to reduced CL&P's distribution earnings by about $0.03 per share, meaning the storm factors will cost about $0.08 per share in additional net cost in 2012. 
Now offsetting those increased costs are the $38 million of annualized distribution rate increases CL&P implemented in mid-2011 and approximately $7 million rate increase in Yankee Gas will implement in mid-2012, and the distribution rate increase of $5 million to $10 million we expect PSNH will be allowed to implement in mid-2012 as a result of its 2010 rate settlement. Because of the mid-year timing of each of those rate increases, the total impact on revenues in 2012 versus last year is expected to be approximately $25 million pre-tax or about $0.09 per share. 
Benefiting both 2012 and '13, NU parent results should be refinancings at NU parent. A 7.25%, $263 million NU parent issuance will mature on April 1, 2012, and another $250 million of 5.65% NU parent debt on June 1, 2013. We expect that the favorable interest rate environment in addition to likely post-merger credit upgrades will significantly lower interest cost on both parent issuance. 
In terms of additional financing, we need to reprice $62 million of CL&P tax-exempt bonds on April 1, and we're looking for WMECO and Yankee Gas to sell a new debt later this year. We are also looking at increasing CL&P's short-term debt credit lines to help us handle the $250 million of storm costs CL&P is now carrying. We currently expect no long-term debt issuance at CL&P or PSNH in 2012. 
Lastly, we expect 2012 to benefit from continued strong cost control, higher generation earnings at PSNH, a growing customer base and sales at Yankee, low interest rates, modest electric sales growth, lower NU parent expense and strong cash flow throughout the NU system.

There may be some additional environmental studies that have to take place in and around certain areas as a result of the initial findings. So that could change the schedule, and they can put in here is the fact that the environmental surveys that we need to do are really based around 2 seasons. They're based around the winter season and a kind of a spring-summer season. So you can't complete all of the environmental surveys until you know exactly what the route is.

So multiple sites, more construction, which could lead to an earlier conclusion of the construction window of the project. You asked about other variables. Clearly, we need to demonstrate political support for the project in the state. Although in our surveying, we think the support of the project continues to rise with the citizens of New Hampshire, continues to rise with legislators. We need to finalize that route and then work on gaining additional political support. So you need political support. And of course, the other variable is we have a partner, which is HQ.

And of course, there will be, as we consummate the transaction, we believe, in April, there will be some additional merger-related costs that you will see. But starting with the $14.4 million, recall that NU parent and other, that segment, if you will, is a collection of a number of companies including unregulated businesses, our service company and a number of land holding companies. I think among those companies are going to see some modest improvements that will contribute to less net expense. So that's one part of the answer. The second part of the answer, we touched on and you alluded to, is the refinancing of $263 million of debt at the NU parent level. We anticipate doing that in the next couple of months. It currently has a coupon of 7.25%, and we'll be kind of formulating a strategy into the market shortly on that security. So that will move the needle significantly as well."

And I'll start with kind of just summarizing where we are in transmission, which is probably the easy one. I said that PSNH and Western Mass transmission earnings will be growing, but offset by CL&P that did receive a benefit this year of below our tax rate, particularly in Q4. So transmission will be roughly flat. On the sales side, we talked about some benefits there. And I do think it will be modest for the electric businesses. In 2011, we saw some similar trends around demand, stronger growth in New Hampshire, weaker growth in Massachusetts, squarely in the middle in Connecticut. And I think you should expect that going forward. Saw a little bit of an uplift there, and I think strong growth for Yankee, driven by both the demand for gas, given the price advantage, and conversions of new customers as they seek out to convert to use natural gas instead of home heating oil. So that, I think, is a benefit. I also kind of rattled off, but did not quantify other than a follow-up on Jay's question on a number of additional items. So strong cost control. We don't see that as being a real big pressure on us, so I'll come back to that. Growth and generation earnings at PSNH. Low interest rates across the board. And then, I did highlight, Murray, for the NU parent and other segment, low interest rates on the refinancing fees being a big driver of the $7.25, $263 million bond coming due. And you can pro forma in what you think we'll refinance that at. So clearly, in that segment, you're going to get some uplift. The bigger drivers, we noted that for the storm between the O&M investments that we discussed, a $14 million incrementally, and for the additional capital, $30 million incrementally. That's going to be about a $0.10 -- excuse me, a $0.09 number for us. For the -- let me jump over to the non-tracked benefit expenses for both the pension and employee benefits. We said relative to 2011, it's going to be a $0.10 increase, with 2012 being the high watermark. We expect that 2013 will actually decline from there. We also then said, I guess, lastly, that the offsets would be rate increases that go into effect that are going to provide about $25 million of pre-tax benefit or $0.09 per share of benefit.

292525,170977562,264066,"Northeast Utilities, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2012",2012-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin the discussion of NU's financial and operational results, I just like to thank everybody on the call for all the notes and cards and very good wishes that you've expressed to me over the past mo",1571,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin the discussion of NU's financial and operational results, I just like to thank everybody on the call for all the notes and cards and very good wishes that you've expressed to me over the past month and a half. I appreciate your thoughtful words since my heart attack during the second week of January. I just want you to know that they really meant a lot to me. 
Now I'd like to turn to our results for last year and our outlook for 2012 and beyond. Last year resulted in many successes. Last year also produced the 2 worst storms in our 45-year history, which hit us 9 weeks apart in August and October. We will discuss some of the measures we have initiated to improve our reliability during major storms, and David will review the impact of storm costs on our financial statement. 
But before they do, I again want to thank the NU employees for their dedication and professionalism during these 2 events. Many left their homes, which were often without power, to restore power to our customers. For their actions, I am very proud and very grateful. 
Those same employees were responsible for last year's many successes. The company delivered solid financial performance for our investors in 2011. Reoccurring earnings and cash flows were higher than in 2010. We made progress on a number of our major capital investment initiatives that will benefit New England energy customers, and we also received all but 2 of the approvals we need to consummate our merger with NSTAR. 
From a financial standpoint, 2011 was the fifth consecutive year of attractive earnings growth since we fundamentally restructured our business profile in 2006. 
From an operational standpoint, we achieved a number of milestones in 2011. We brought online our Merrimack Scrubber and the WWL natural gas pipeline project and made solid progress on our Greater Springfield Transmission Project. All 3 of those projects will bring significant benefits to our customers and our communities over the years to come. 
From a strategic standpoint, our pending merger with NSTAR was approved by both company shareholders as well as by FERC, the Department of Justice, the FCC and, at the end of the year, the NRC. We also believe we are in a good position to secure final regulatory approvals in Connecticut and Massachusetts over the next 6 weeks. 
Last week, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced that we and NSTAR had negotiated 2 settlements that will help ensure that Massachusetts customers of NSTAR and WMECO will see both immediate and long-term benefits from the merger and that the merger will be supportive of the Commonwealth long-term energy goals. 
Under the settlement with the Attorney General and the Department of Energy Resources, base distribution rates of NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and WMECO will be frozen at current levels through at least 2015. Additionally, customers of the 3 utilities will receive credits on their first bills after the merger is consummated, totaling $21 million, $3 million of which would flow through WMECO customers. 
A separate settlement with the Department of Energy Resources among other conditions will require NSTAR Electric to purchase 129 megawatts of output from Cape Wind and for our Massachusetts utilities to expand their energy conservation and renewable energy initiatives and to support an electric vehicle program in Massachusetts. 
We believe the settlements provide a clear path to approval by Massachusetts of the merger, which will benefit our customers, our communities and our investors. The parties have asked the DPU to approve the merger on April 4. 
As you know, Massachusetts is one of the 2 state approvals we still require, the other being the Connecticut Public Utility Regulatory Authority. On January 18, the PURA reversed its earlier decision and ruled that we needed to secure its approval before we completed the merger. While we do not agree with that decision as a matter of law, we filed an application the next day, January 19, requesting the PURA's approval. We are pleased that the PURA set a docket schedule that will permit a prompt review of the merger. Initial hearings began last week and are scheduled to be completed today. Hearings on late-filed exhibits will take place next week, with briefs due March 5, and a draft decision on March 26. Final decision is due April 2. 
If both Connecticut and Massachusetts approvals are received the first week of April, we believe we will be able to consummate this transaction before April 16, which is the 18-month anniversary of the signing of the merger agreement.
To date, the Connecticut hearings have gone well. We believe our witnesses have made a strong case in support of the transaction. Under the state statute, the acquiring company needs to show that the merger is in the public interest and that it has the financial and managerial capability to run a utility safely and meet the state's utility public service obligations. We were very confident we can meet all of the PURA standards and look forward to completing the remaining steps in this expeditious review. 
Let me now move to the Northern Pass Transmission Project. We continue to view this project as an innovative way to bring 1,200 megawatts of clean base-load power to New Hampshire and the remainder of New England. It will materially reduce fossil fuel usage by the region's generators and lower power costs not only in New Hampshire, but the rest of New England as well. It is expected to add 1,200 jobs and about $25 million in annual property tax revenue in New Hampshire.
We've made significant progress on securing the rights to build the northernmost 40 miles of the project in New Hampshire, but we are not yet in a position to file an amended route with the U.S. Department of Energy. 
As many of you know, the New Hampshire Legislature earlier this year passed and sent to Governor Lynch a bill that may restrict the use of eminent domain in construction transmission lines, such as Northern Pass, that are not expected to be subject to regional cost allocation. While we do not believe we need to use eminent domain in acquiring the property rights for the project, we also don't think this bill will be in the best long-term interests of the state. We will provide you with more of a status report on the project in just a moment. 
As you also may be aware, the New Hampshire House of Representatives is considering a bill that would require PSNH to divest its nearly 1,200 megawatts of generation by the end of 2013. PSNH customers have saved up to $700 million over the past decade because customers pay for only a regulated return on that generation, and we believe the generation, which currently has a rate base of about $700 million to $800 million, provides PSNH with a stability of energy cost that is not available to many other consumers in New England. 
We continue to believe that PSNH's ownership of generation is firmly in the best interest of our customers and believe legislatures will concur. Finally, both Governor Malloy and the Connecticut State Senate have proposed legislation that would enhance the state's preparedness for major storms, such as tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm. Elements that would affect us include expanded state tree trimming, a requirement for annual emergency preparedness drills and the establishment of certain service quality metrics. We believe diversions of the bills we have seen to date are very workable and will help all parties achieve the common goals of improved and timely response to natural disasters. 
As we move further into 2012, we are very optimistic about our future. We believe that with timely state regulatory approval, our merger will be consummated by mid-April, and we'll be able to get to work on bringing the very significant benefits this business combination will provide to our customers and our investors. We expect significant progress this year on our transmission initiatives, which will significantly enhance the critical highways of electricity delivery in New England. And we believe that the low -- the current low gas price environment will offer increasing economic and environmental benefits to New England consumers, and we expect to play a key role in delivering those benefits to our communities.
Now before I turn this call over to Lee, I have one more comment that I just like to make. If we end up closing this merger when we hope, which would be mid-April, this phone call will be the last time that I will have the opportunity to speak to this group, at least in this capacity. It's been a privilege to be involved with all of you over a very long number of years. I've known some of you for a very long time, others a little more, more recently. But I do appreciate all the friendships that we have developed and the professionalism that all of you have displayed as we have worked through this process over the last number of years. I'm going to miss all of you guys. Hopefully, I'll have the opportunity to see you at different events, but this could very easily be the last time that I have a chance to talk to you as we are right now. 
Now let me turn the call over to Lee."

The mild weather this winter has had a number of positive operational impacts on us. To start, we've had very little winter storm activity in 2012. Secondly, we have made very good progress on our construction program. Our Greater Spring",1333,"Thank you, Chuck. The mild weather this winter has had a number of positive operational impacts on us. To start, we've had very little winter storm activity in 2012. Secondly, we have made very good progress on our construction program. Our Greater Springfield Reliability Project, the largest component of the New England East-West Solutions family of projects, remains on schedule. We are confident we will be able to complete the project in late 2013 on its budget of $718 million. 
As of the end of 2011, we have spent about $315 million on the project. And as of today, more than 55% of the work, including engineering and permitting, is complete. We placed in service the Cadwell Switching Station in Western Massachusetts in December 2011, and hope to complete the expansion of the Agawam substation around the middle of this year. Both are important project milestones. 
The next large segment of news is the Interstate Reliability Project, where we will build the Connecticut section, and National Grid will build the Rhode Island and Massachusetts sections of the project. We filed a siting application with the Connecticut Siting Council on December 23, and evidentiary hearings are scheduled to commence May 1. A decision is expected in early 2013. We expect National Grid to file its siting application this spring, and we expect to receive all siting approvals by the end of 2013. That would support a construction schedule that would place the project into service by the end of 2015. We continue to estimate that our segment of the project will cost about $218 million. 
ISO New England continues to evaluate our third major initiative within NEEWS, the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. We expect ISO to recommence its needs analysis and transmission alternative study in the second half of this year and to recommend solutions in 2013. As I mentioned earlier, ISO has broadened its analysis to include the Greater Hartford area. We have previously indicated that the Central Connecticut Reliability Project is about 18 months behind the Interstate Project. That is still the case. 
ISO New England has allowed more time at the front end of the process to review study assumptions and results with stakeholders and state regulators. Meanwhile, the detailed planning studies necessary to support the overall schedule are being completed. 
Turning to Northern Pass, let me expand upon some of the comments Chuck provided earlier. We have now secured a substantial amount of the property we will require for the 40-mile section in the Northern New Hampshire area, where we currently do not have a right of way. While we have secured a significant amount of the property, we continue to negotiate with additional property owners to secure the remaining sections of the project. We believe we will be able to acquire an acceptable route, which would make it feasible to construct the project even if the legislation before Governor Lynch is enacted. However, given the ultimate design needs of the project, along with the fact that we still need to complete significant siting and permit requirements, which will vary based on the route we ultimately select, there is a possibility that the commencement of construction could be delayed beyond the beginning of 2014. We will update you on the progress we are making later this spring. 
Our transmission capital expenditures totaled $459 million in 2011, up significantly from the $261 million we invested in 2010 and higher than our initial $434 million capital projections for 2011. This was primarily due to the Greater Springfield Project, where we invested nearly $200 million in 2011, $30 million more than we projected earlier in the year. 
We project transmission capital expenditures in 2012 of $473 million, with about half of that spent on the Greater Springfield Project. Turning from transmission to generation, our $422 million Clean Air Project, a wet scrubber being installed at our 2-unit Merrimack coal-fired station, began removing pollutants from Merrimack emissions in September. In November, the second of our 2 coal-fired units at Merrimack was tied into the scrubber, and the project is operating as designed. And we have significantly reduced mercury and sulfur emissions at Merrimack. 
By midyear, we expect to complete the secondary water waste treatment system, and the project will be complete. We expect that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission prudence review of the project will be completed by year-end, and we are very comfortable that they will conclude that our expenditures at Merrimack will be deemed prudent since the project, which was mandated by statute, is working soundly and went into service for about $35 million under its initial budget. 
With the Clean Air Project nearly complete, we expect our generation capital expenditures to decline from $136.5 million in 2011 to about $64 million in 2012. About $21 million of that will be spent on completing the Clean Air Project. 
In 2011, Western Mass Electric invested nearly $12 million on its second solar facility located at a Brimfield site. The 2.3-megawatt Springfield facility joined a 1.8-megawatt Pittsfield facility we completed in 2010. They are 2 of the largest solar generating facilities in New England. We have authority from the Department of Public Utilities to build another 2 megawatts of solar facilities in Massachusetts, and we are now evaluating 2 sites for this project. 
Moving from generation to distribution. As a result of the 2 devastating storms that took place in 2011, we have begun discussing with Connecticut State officials long-term storm-hardening initiatives that could make our infrastructure more resistant to natural events, such as the tropical storm Irene and last year's October snowstorm. 
You have may have seen that CL&P proposed to the government's 2 ston[ph] panel a series of measures that would cost up to $2 billion over 10 years. We expect to engage our regulators in a discussion about such initiatives later this year. But in the meantime, we have increased CL&P's 2012 distribution capital investment budget from the $284 million level we showed you at EEI to $315 million. These dollars will be used primarily for enhanced tree trimming that will create greater clearances around our distribution lines to improve our reliability long term. Additionally, we are increasing CL&P's distribution O&M by about $14 million to increase our routine tree-trimming budget and expand certain storm-preparedness activities. David will review financial impacts of those 2012 enhancements.
Turning from electric to natural gas distribution.  In November, Yankee Gas completed its Waterbury-to-Wallingford project on schedule and $3.6 million below budget. The project enhances natural gas services, reliability to our system and is fully reflected in Yankee Gas rates as a result of last year's rate case. 
The most significant initiative now at Yankee involves the $40 million-a-year replacement of bare steel and cast-iron pipe. This initiative's fully reflected in current rates. As you can see from last night's news release, Yankee Gas firm sales rose by 8% in 2011 compared with 2010. They were up more than 5% on a weather-adjusted basis. We continue to see significant demand for new service and conversions on the Yankee Gas system, driven by the fact that natural gas is about half the price of heating oil and the fact that about 50% of Connecticut households heat with oil and only 31% with natural gas. Conversions to natural gas heat, which numbered a few hundred annually a few years ago, now total about 1,000 in 2010, 2,000 in 2011, and we may have many more in the pipeline for 2012. 
Nevertheless, Yankee Gas supply constraints that restrict ability to connect significant additional load in certain parts of the service area need to be resolved. Certain constraints at Eastern Connecticut are preventing the firm delivery of up to 1.2 billion additional cubic feet of natural gas per year. We are currently exploring a number of initiatives, some of them similar to the Waterbury-to-Wallingford line to eliminate those constraints and serve the growing demand for natural gas across the state. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to David."

As Chuck mentioned earlier, we are quite pleased with our financial performance in 2011. Excluding charges related to the merger and the CL&P storm fund, we earned $423.9 million or $2.38 per share compared with recurring earnings of $381.",2483,"Thank you, Lee. As Chuck mentioned earlier, we are quite pleased with our financial performance in 2011. Excluding charges related to the merger and the CL&P storm fund, we earned $423.9 million or $2.38 per share compared with recurring earnings of $381.6 million or $2.16 per share in 2010. Our cash flow improved as well, rising to $901 million in 2011, after repayment of reduction bonds compared with $832.6 million in 2010. This increase occurred despite the payment of more than $150 million in power restoration costs in 2011 associated with the tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm, as well as the contribution of an additional $100 million into our pension plan in 2011 compared with 2010. 
Last spring, Standard & Poor's raised our credit ratings by one notch across the board, and Fitch raised PSNH's ratings by one notch and moved CL&P's outlook from stable to positive. 
NU's senior unsecured ratings are now BBB, BAA2 and BBB by S&P, Moody's and Fitch respectively. CL&P senior secured ratings are A-, A2 and A-. 
And over the course of 2011, we refinanced approximately $365 million of pollution control revenue bond at CL&P and PSNH, at significantly lower interest rates, saving an estimated $57 million over the life of the bonds. I'll discuss our 2012 financing plans in a moment. But first, I want to discuss our 2011 results in more detail, starting with our regulated companies. 
Regulated company earnings totaled $438.3 million in 2011, excluding the CL&P storm fund charge, up 14% from 2010 levels. The improvement occurred in both our distribution and transmission segments. 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, NU earned $132.4 million or $0.74 per share on a recurring basis compared with $123 million or $0.69 per share we earned on a recurring basis in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter improvement was all on the transmission segment, which earned $71.2 million in the fourth quarter compared with $50.5 million in the fourth quarter of '10. That improvement was due primarily to higher rate base at WMECO transmission and a lower effective tax rate at CL&P transmission. 
Our transmission earnings totaled $199.6 million or $1.12 per share in 2011 compared with $177.8 million or $1 per share in 2010. The most significant improvement occurred at Western Mass, where earnings rose about $10 million, primarily due to the construction of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. WMECO's transmission rate base totaled $467 million at the end of 2011 compared with $269 million at the end of 2010, an increase of nearly 74%. 
CL&P's transmission earnings rose to $151.9 million in 2011 from $143.9 million in 2010. Most of that increase was due to a lower effective tax rate. Transmission rate base declined by about 2.3% to $2.1 billion, primarily because of the completion of the planned sale of $42.5 million of transmission facilities to a Connecticut municipal electric cooperative. 
Turning from transmission to distribution, we earned $238.7 million in 2011, or $1.34 per share excluding the CL&P storm fund, compared with $206.2 million or $1.16 per share in 2010. That was an increase of nearly 16%. However, in the fourth quarter, distribution earnings declined to $65.2 million in 2011 from $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. As I will discuss shortly, those declines were primarily at Yankee Gas, which was negatively affected by milder weather in CL&P distribution, which had a higher effective tax rate. 
For the full year, CL&P's distribution earnings were $110.6 million in 2011 excluding the storm fund compared with $94.1 million in 2010. Improvement was largely due to the distribution rate case decision of June 2010. CL&P's distribution regulatory ROE was 9.4% in 2011, which achieves our allowed ROE compared with an earned ROE of 7.9% in the year 2010. 
PSNH's distribution and generation business earned $18.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $76.2 million for the full year of 2011 compared with earnings of $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and $69.3 million for the full year. The higher full year results were primarily due to the distribution rate increase that was effective July 1, 2010. That increase was partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes. PSNH's combined distribution and generation regulatory ROE was 9.7% in 2011, right around our weighted generation and distribution average allowed ROE, compared with 10.2% in 2010. 
WMECO's distribution and generation business earned $7.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $20.2 million for the full year of 2011 compared with $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and $10.1 million for the full year of 2010. The improved results were primarily due to the impacts of the rate case decision issued in January of 2011 by the Massachusetts DPU. That decision, which was effective February 1, 2011, provided Western Mass Electric with $16.8 million in higher annual distribution revenues, but also required us to take a $2.1 million after tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
WMECO's distribution regulatory ROE was 9% in 2011 compared with 4.6% in 2010 in an allowed level of 9.6%. Yankee Gas earned $11 million in the fourth quarter of '11 and $31.7 million for the full year 2011, compared with earnings of $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $32.7 million for the full year of 2010. The drop in the fourth quarter earnings was due to an 8.5% decline in firm natural gas sales due to much warmer weather in late 2011, as well as a higher effective tax rate. Yankees regulatory ROE was 9.3% in 2011, compared with 8.6% in 2010 and an allowed level of 8.83%, which was set last summer at the conclusion of Yankees' rate case. 
For the full year, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 8% in 2011 due to much colder weather in the first quarter of 2011 than in the first quarter of '10, as well as a 5.1% weather-adjusted increase in sales. Those sales increases occurred primarily in the commercial and industrial sectors, where year-over-year sales were up 13.5% and 8.9%, respectively. The improvement was due primarily to the increasing price advantage of natural gas compared with heating oil. 
As you can imagine, the continued warm weather in the first quarter of 2012 will not help Yankee Gas sales this year compared with '11. We estimate that Yankee Gas lost about $4 million of pre-tax margin due to the warmer-than-normal temperatures in the fourth quarter alone and, perhaps, another $2 million in January of '12. 
Aside from the impacts of the special contracts, we expect Yankees' weather-normalized firm sales to rise about 6% in 2012 compared with '11. The electric side remains quite different. Retail electric sales fell by 1.2% in 2011 compared with 2010, but declined by only 0.3% on a weather-adjusted basis. PSNH retail weather-adjusted sales were up by 0.4%, while CL&Ps were down 0.5% and Western Mass Electric was down by 0.2%. We attribute CL&P's larger decline compared with PSNH or WMECO in part to the power outages following Irene and the October snowstorm. 
In 2012, we expect weather-adjusted electric sales to be slightly flat compared with 2011. We continue to see the impact of a soft but recovering economy in our service territory, along with increased levels of company-sponsored conservation. 
Just by way of some background on the economy across our states, the number of jobs in New Hampshire grew by about 1% in 2011, and the unemployment rate there ended the year at 5.1%, well below the national average of 8.5%. Average weekly hours for manufacturing employees grew by 0.7% and weekly unemployment claims fell by about 12% over the course of 2011. Housing permits continue to be weak, however. In Connecticut, nonmanufacturing employment is up by 33,600 jobs since bottoming 2 years ago, exports grew by about 2% in 2011 and new auto registrations were up sharply. But housing permits are down about 4.6%. December, the state unemployment rate was 8.2%. In Western Massachusetts, the unemployment rate is down to about 7.7%, aided in part by an influx in construction jobs that resulted from continued repairs to the housing damage during last June's tornado that tore through Springfield and other segments of Western Massachusetts. 
Turning back to our financial results, NU parent and other companies had net expenses of $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $25.7 million for the full year 2011 compared with net income of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and net income of $3.9 million for the full year 2010. These figures include merger costs in both years and a nonrecurring tax gain of $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, when we settled a number of state tax items. 
Excluding all those impacts, we had net parent and other expenses of $14.4 million in 2011 or $0.08 per share compared with recurring net expenses of $2.4 million or less than $0.01 per share in 2010. The decline is primarily due to the absence of earnings at our competitive businesses, which are now almost fully unwound. 
As we mentioned at the EEI conference in November 2011, we are not providing standalone earnings guidance for 2012 since we expect to provide merged company guidance following the close of our pending merger with NSTAR. However, there are a few trends that should help you model and use earnings power this year. Let me talk about a few of those.
First, and perhaps most obvious, is a slow start to the year in terms of sales due to the warm-winter weather. This will clearly impact both electric and gas sales, but proportionally more so at Yankee. Offsetting this somewhat is the revenue decoupling mechanism at Western Mass Electric. And as you know, our transmission and generation business earnings are decoupled from sales volumes. 
As we continue to move forward on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in 2012, we expect WMECO's transmission earnings to continue to rise meaningfully. At CL&P, however, we project a higher effective tax rate, resulting in lower CL&P transmission earnings in 2012 despite a roughly 2% increase in transmission rate base. 
Overall, we expect NU's 2012 transmission earnings to be relatively flat as compared with '11, with increases at PSNH and Western Mass offsetting a decrease at CL&P. 
In terms of our FERC-authorized ROE, we are not anticipating a change. You may recall that at the end of September of 2011, a number of New England parties filed a complaint with the FERC regarding the 11.14% base ROE that is allowed to all New England transmission owners on their reliability investments. There were several rounds of filings at FERC in the fourth quarter regarding this complaint. We continue to believe that the base ROE is well within FERC's range of reasonableness, it should not be changed. However, FERC has not yet said when or how it will process the complaint. It could be rejected, it could be set for a contested hearing or it could be assigned to a settlement judge. 
At the distribution businesses, we have the benefit of some modest rate increases, but also the headwind of higher pension and health care expenses. Together, untracked employee-related expense primarily related to pensions at CL&P and PSNH distribution and Yankee Gas is expected to cost us about $0.10 per share in '12 or about $0.025 per quarter compared with 2011. This is primarily due to 2 factors. The first is that lower interest rates have led us to reduce our discount rate from about 5.6% in 2011 to about 5% in 2012. Additionally, the return on our investments in 2011 of about 2%, while competitive with other corporate plans, was still below our assumed long-term rate of return of 8.25%. 
I should note that we are currently -- we currently project that 2012 should be the high watermark for both pension expense and cash contribution to our pension plan. Some of the 2008 investment losses in our pension plan will be fully amortized by the end of this year, and as a result, we currently expect both pension plan expense and pension plan contributions to decline in 2013 compared with 2012. As you'll see on our 10-K, we expect contributions of approximately $150 million annually from 2012 through 2015 compared with contributions of roughly $197 million in 2012. 
And if our return in discount rate expectations for 2012 turn out to be fairly accurate, we will expect 2013 pension expense to be more similar to 2011 than 2012. 
Other factors that will pressure results in 2012 are related to the tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm. As we mentioned earlier, we are increasing tree trimming and emergency preparedness budgets, as well as adding about $30 million to CL&P's distribution capital budgets. Those expenditures are expected to reduce earnings by about $0.05 over the course of 2012 compared with 2011. We will also need to pay short-term interest cost on approximately $300 million of storm deferrals over the course of '12. We expect the impact of the short-term debt levels to reduce CL&P's distribution earnings by about $0.03 per share, meaning the storm factors will cost about $0.08 per share in additional net cost in 2012. 
Now offsetting those increased costs are the $38 million of annualized distribution rate increases CL&P implemented in mid-2011 and approximately $7 million rate increase Yankee Gas will implement in mid-2012, and the distribution rate increase of $5 million to $10 million we expect PSNH will be allowed to implement in mid-2012 as a result of its 2010 rate settlement. Because of the mid-year timing of each of those rate increases, the total impact on revenues in 2012 versus last year is expected to be approximately $25 million pre-tax or about $0.09 per share. 
Benefiting both 2012 and '13, NU parent results should be refinancings at NU parent. A 7.25%, $263 million NU parent issuance will mature on April 1, 2012, and another $250 million of 5.65% NU parent debt on June 1, 2013. We expect that the favorable interest rate environment in addition to likely post-merger credit upgrades will significantly lower interest cost on both parent issuance. 
In terms of additional financing, we need to reprice $62 million of CL&P tax-exempt bonds on April 1, and we're looking for WMECO and Yankee Gas to sell new debt later this year. We are also looking at increasing CL&P's short-term debt credit lines to help us handle the $250 million of storm costs CL&P is now carrying. We currently expect no long-term debt issuance at CL&P or PSNH in 2012. 
Lastly, we expect 2012 to benefit from continued strong cost control, higher generation earnings at PSNH, a growing customer base and sales at Yankee, low interest rates, modest electric sales growth, lower NU parent expense and strong cash flow throughout the NU system.

In other words, some areas may need to require a monopole, some areas may be need to be moved away from wetlands. There may be some additional environmental studies that have to take place in and around certain areas as a result of the initial findings. So that could change the schedule, and I think important here is the fact that the environmental surveys that we need to do are really based around 2 seasons. They're based around a winter season and a kind of a spring-summer season. So you can't complete all of the environmental surveys until you know exactly what the route is. So we would have liked to have had all of the winter environmental sampling done by this spring. So the fact that we don't have the route completely in place, we'll have to do more of that next winter.

And one of the things we're doing now is looking at the options in and around, more construction on the right of way. So multiple sites, more construction, which could lead to an earlier conclusion of the construction window of the project. You ask about other variables. Clearly, we need to demonstrate political support for the project in the state. Although in our surveying, we think the support of the project continues to rise with the citizens of New Hampshire, continues to rise with legislators. We need to finalize that route and then work on gaining additional political support. So you need political support. And of course, the other variable is we have a partner, which is HQ. And HQ, who is very much obviously supportive of the project and sees this as a major channel, if you will, to sell their power into New England, will need to be ready to move forward with us when we're ready to stop that construction."

I think among those companies you are going to see some modest improvements that will contribute to less net expense. So that's one part of the answer.

And I'll start with kind of just summarizing where we are in transmission, which is probably the easy one. I said that PSNH and Western Mass transmission earnings will be growing, but offset by CL&P that did receive a benefit this year of below our tax rate, particularly in Q4. So transmission will be roughly flat. On the sales side, we talked about some benefits there. And I do think it will be modest for the electric businesses. In 2011, we saw some similar trends around demand, stronger growth in New Hampshire, weaker growth in Massachusetts, squarely in the middle in Connecticut. And I think you should expect that going forward. So a little bit of an uplift there, and I think strong growth for Yankee, driven by both the demand for gas, given the price advantage, and conversions of new customers as they seek out to convert to use natural gas instead of home heating oil. So that, I think, is a benefit. I also kind of rattled off, but did not quantify other than to follow-up on Jay's question, on a number of additional items. So strong cost control. We don't see that as being a real big pressure on us, so I'll come back to that. Growth and generation earnings at PSNH. Low interest rates across the board. And then, I did highlight, Murray, for the NU parent and other segment, lower interest rates on the refinancing fees being a big driver of the $7.25, $263 million bond coming due. And you can pro forma in what you think we'll refinance that at. So clearly, in that segment, you're going to get some uplift. On the bigger drivers, we noted that for the storm between the O&M investments that we discussed, $14 million incrementally, and for the additional capital, $30 million incrementally. That's going to be about a $0.10 -- excuse me, a $0.09 number for us. For the -- let me jump over to the non-tracked benefit expenses for both the pension and employee benefits. We said relative to 2011, it's going to be a $0.10 increase, with 2012 being the high watermark. We expect that 2013 will actually decline from there. We also then said, I guess, lastly, that the offsets would be rate increases that go into effect that are going to provide about $25 million of pre-tax benefit or $0.09 per share of benefit. And let me just correct myself on the storms. That was a net $0.08 negative, not net $0.09 or $0.10 negative."

Before we begin the discussion of NU's financial and operational results, I just like to thank everybody on the call for all the notes and cards and very good wishes that you've expressed to me over the past month and a half. I appreciate your thoughtful words since my heart attack during the second week of January. I just want you to know that they really meant a lot to me. 
Now I'd like to turn to our results for last year and our outlook for 2012 and beyond. Last year resulted in many successes. Last year also produced the 2 worst storms in our 45-year history, which hit us 9 weeks apart in August and October. We will discuss some of the measures we have initiated to improve our reliability during major storms, and David will review the impact of storm costs on our financial statement. 
But before they do, I again want to thank the NU employees for their dedication and professionalism during these 2 events. Many left their homes, which were often without power, to restore power to our customers. For their actions, I am very proud and very grateful. 
Those same employees were responsible for last year's many successes. The company delivered solid financial performance for our investors in 2011. Reoccurring earnings and cash flows were higher than in 2010. We made progress on a number of our major capital investment initiatives that will benefit New England energy customers, and we also received all but 2 of the approvals we need to consummate our merger with NSTAR. 
From a financial standpoint, 2011 was the fifth consecutive year of attractive earnings growth since we fundamentally restructured our business profile in 2006. 
From an operational standpoint, we achieved a number of milestones in 2011. We brought online our Merrimack Scrubber and the WWL natural gas pipeline project and made solid progress on our Greater Springfield Transmission Project. All 3 of those projects will bring significant benefits to our customers and our communities over the years to come. 
From a strategic standpoint, our pending merger with NSTAR was approved by both company shareholders as well as by FERC, the Department of Justice, the FCC and, at the end of the year, the NRC. We also believe we are in a good position to secure final regulatory approvals in Connecticut and Massachusetts over the next 6 weeks. 
Last week, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced that we and NSTAR had negotiated 2 settlements that will help ensure that Massachusetts customers of NSTAR and WMECO will see both immediate and long-term benefits from the merger and that the merger will be supportive of the Commonwealth long-term energy goals. 
Under the settlement with the Attorney General and the Department of Energy Resources, base distribution rates of NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and WMECO will be frozen at current levels through at least 2015. Additionally, customers of the 3 utilities will receive credits on their first bills after the merger is consummated, totaling $21 million, $3 million of which would flow through WMECO customers. 
A separate settlement with the Department of Energy Resources among other conditions will require NSTAR Electric to purchase 129 megawatts of output from Cape Wind and for our Massachusetts utilities to expand their energy conservation and renewable energy initiatives and to support an electric vehicle program in Massachusetts. 
We believe the settlements provide a clear path to approval by Massachusetts of the merger, which will benefit our customers, our communities and our investors. The parties have asked the DPU to approve the merger on April 4. 
As you know, Massachusetts is one of the 2 state approvals we still require, the other being the Connecticut Public Utility Regulatory Authority. On January 18, the PURA reversed its earlier decision and ruled that we needed to secure its approval before we completed the merger. While we do not agree with that decision as a matter of law, we filed an application the next day, January 19, requesting the PURA's approval. We are pleased that the PURA set a docket schedule that will permit a prompt review of the merger. Initial hearings began last week and are scheduled to be completed today. Hearings on late-filed exhibits will take place next week, with briefs due March 5, and a draft decision on March 26. Final decision is due April 2. 
If both Connecticut and Massachusetts approvals are received the first week of April, we believe we will be able to consummate this transaction before April 16, which is the 18-month anniversary of the signing of the merger agreement.
To date, the Connecticut hearings have gone well. We believe our witnesses have made a strong case in support of the transaction. Under the state statute, the acquiring company needs to show that the merger is in the public interest and that it has the financial and managerial capability to run a utility safely and meet the state's utility public service obligations. We were very confident we can meet all of the PURA standards and look forward to completing the remaining steps in this expeditious review. 
Let me now move to the Northern Pass Transmission Project. We continue to view this project as an innovative way to bring 1,200 megawatts of clean base-load power to New Hampshire and the remainder of New England. It will materially reduce fossil fuel usage by the region's generators and lower power costs not only in New Hampshire, but the rest of New England as well. It is expected to add 1,200 jobs and about $25 million in annual property tax revenue in New Hampshire.
We've made significant progress on securing the rights to build the northernmost 40 miles of the project in New Hampshire, but we are not yet in a position to file an amended route with the U.S. Department of Energy. 
As many of you know, the New Hampshire Legislature earlier this year passed and sent to Governor Lynch a bill that may restrict the use of eminent domain in construction transmission lines, such as Northern Pass, that are not expected to be subject to regional cost allocation. While we do not believe we need to use eminent domain in acquiring the property rights for the project, we also don't think this bill will be in the best long-term interests of the state. We will provide you with more of a status report on the project in just a moment. 
As you also may be aware, the New Hampshire House of Representatives is considering a bill that would require PSNH to divest its nearly 1,200 megawatts of generation by the end of 2013. PSNH customers have saved up to $700 million over the past decade because customers pay for only a regulated return on that generation, and we believe the generation, which currently has a rate base of about $700 million to $800 million, provides PSNH with a stability of energy cost that is not available to many other consumers in New England. 
We continue to believe that PSNH's ownership of generation is firmly in the best interest of our customers and believe legislatures will concur. Finally, both Governor Malloy and the Connecticut State Senate have proposed legislation that would enhance the state's preparedness for major storms, such as tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm. Elements that would affect us include expanded state tree trimming, a requirement for annual emergency preparedness drills and the establishment of certain service quality metrics. We believe diversions of the bills we have seen to date are very workable and will help all parties achieve the common goals of improved and timely response to natural disasters. 
As we move further into 2012, we are very optimistic about our future. We believe that with timely state regulatory approval, our merger will be consummated by mid-April, and we'll be able to get to work on bringing the very significant benefits this business combination will provide to our customers and our investors. We expect significant progress this year on our transmission initiatives, which will significantly enhance the critical highways of electricity delivery in New England. And we believe that the low -- the current low gas price environment will offer increasing economic and environmental benefits to New England consumers, and we expect to play a key role in delivering those benefits to our communities.
Now before I turn this call over to Lee, I have one more comment that I just like to make. If we end up closing this merger when we hope, which would be mid-April, this phone call will be the last time that I will have the opportunity to speak to this group, at least in this capacity. It's been a privilege to be involved with all of you over a very long number of years. I've known some of you for a very long time, others a little more, more recently. But I do appreciate all the friendships that we have developed and the professionalism that all of you have displayed as we have worked through this process over the last number of years. I'm going to miss all of you guys. Hopefully, I'll have the opportunity to see you at different events, but this could very easily be the last time that I have a chance to talk to you as we are right now. 
Now let me turn the call over to Lee."

The mild weather this winter has had a number of positive operational impacts on us. To start, we've had very little winter storm activity in 2012. Secondly, we have made very good progress on our construction program. Our Greater Spring",1333,"Thank you, Chuck. The mild weather this winter has had a number of positive operational impacts on us. To start, we've had very little winter storm activity in 2012. Secondly, we have made very good progress on our construction program. Our Greater Springfield Reliability Project, the largest component of the New England East-West Solutions family of projects, remains on schedule. We are confident we will be able to complete the project in late 2013 on its budget of $718 million. 
As of the end of 2011, we have spent about $315 million on the project. And as of today, more than 55% of the work, including engineering and permitting, is complete. We placed in service the Cadwell Switching Station in Western Massachusetts in December 2011, and hope to complete the expansion of the Agawam substation around the middle of this year. Both are important project milestones. 
The next large segment of news is the Interstate Reliability Project, where we will build the Connecticut section, and National Grid will build the Rhode Island and Massachusetts sections of the project. We filed a siting application with the Connecticut Siting Council on December 23, and evidentiary hearings are scheduled to commence May 1. A decision is expected in early 2013. We expect National Grid to file its siting application this spring, and we expect to receive all siting approvals by the end of 2013. That would support a construction schedule that would place the project into service by the end of 2015. We continue to estimate that our segment of the project will cost about $218 million. 
ISO New England continues to evaluate our third major initiative within NEEWS, the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. We expect ISO to recommence its needs analysis and transmission alternative study in the second half of this year and to recommend solutions in 2013. As I mentioned earlier, ISO has broadened its analysis to include the Greater Hartford area. We have previously indicated that the Central Connecticut Reliability Project is about 18 months behind the Interstate Project. That is still the case. 
ISO New England has allowed more time at the front end of the process to review study assumptions and results with stakeholders and state regulators. Meanwhile, the detailed planning studies necessary to support the overall schedule are being completed. 
Turning to Northern Pass, let me expand upon some of the comments Chuck provided earlier. We have now secured a substantial amount of the property we will require for the 40-mile section in the Northern New Hampshire area, where we currently do not have a right of way. While we have secured a significant amount of the property, we continue to negotiate with additional property owners to secure the remaining sections of the project. We believe we will be able to acquire an acceptable route, which would make it feasible to construct the project even if the legislation before Governor Lynch is enacted. However, given the ultimate design needs of the project, along with the fact that we still need to complete significant siting and permit requirements, which will vary based on the route we ultimately select, there is a possibility that the commencement of construction could be delayed beyond the beginning of 2014. We will update you on the progress we are making later this spring. 
Our transmission capital expenditures totaled $459 million in 2011, up significantly from the $261 million we invested in 2010 and higher than our initial $434 million capital projections for 2011. This was primarily due to the Greater Springfield Project, where we invested nearly $200 million in 2011, $30 million more than we projected earlier in the year. 
We project transmission capital expenditures in 2012 of $473 million, with about half of that spent on the Greater Springfield Project. Turning from transmission to generation, our $422 million Clean Air Project, a wet scrubber being installed at our 2-unit Merrimack coal-fired station, began removing pollutants from Merrimack emissions in September. In November, the second of our 2 coal-fired units at Merrimack was tied into the scrubber, and the project is operating as designed. And we have significantly reduced mercury and sulfur emissions at Merrimack. 
By midyear, we expect to complete the secondary water waste treatment system, and the project will be complete. We expect that the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission prudence review of the project will be completed by year-end, and we are very comfortable that they will conclude that our expenditures at Merrimack will be deemed prudent since the project, which was mandated by statute, is working soundly and went into service for about $35 million under its initial budget. 
With the Clean Air Project nearly complete, we expect our generation capital expenditures to decline from $136.5 million in 2011 to about $64 million in 2012. About $21 million of that will be spent on completing the Clean Air Project. 
In 2011, Western Mass Electric invested nearly $12 million on its second solar facility located at a Brimfield site. The 2.3-megawatt Springfield facility joined a 1.8-megawatt Pittsfield facility we completed in 2010. They are 2 of the largest solar generating facilities in New England. We have authority from the Department of Public Utilities to build another 2 megawatts of solar facilities in Massachusetts, and we are now evaluating 2 sites for this project. 
Moving from generation to distribution. As a result of the 2 devastating storms that took place in 2011, we have begun discussing with Connecticut State officials long-term storm-hardening initiatives that could make our infrastructure more resistant to natural events, such as the tropical storm Irene and last year's October snowstorm. 
You have may have seen that CL&P proposed to the government's Two Storm panel a series of measures that would cost up to $2 billion over 10 years. We expect to engage our regulators in a discussion about such initiatives later this year. But in the meantime, we have increased CL&P's 2012 distribution capital investment budget from the $284 million level we showed you at EEI to $315 million. These dollars will be used primarily for enhanced tree trimming that will create greater clearances around our distribution lines to improve our reliability long term. Additionally, we are increasing CL&P's distribution O&M by about $14 million to increase our routine tree-trimming budget and expand certain storm-preparedness activities. David will review financial impacts of those 2012 enhancements.
Turning from electric to natural gas distribution.  In November, Yankee Gas completed its Waterbury-to-Wallingford project on schedule and $3.6 million below budget. The project enhances natural gas services, reliability to our system and is fully reflected in Yankee Gas rates as a result of last year's rate case. 
The most significant initiative now at Yankee involves the $40 million-a-year replacement of bare steel and cast-iron pipe. This initiative's fully reflected in current rates. As you can see from last night's news release, Yankee Gas firm sales rose by 8% in 2011 compared with 2010. They were up more than 5% on a weather-adjusted basis. We continue to see significant demand for new service and conversions on the Yankee Gas system, driven by the fact that natural gas is about half the price of heating oil and the fact that about 50% of Connecticut households heat with oil and only 31% with natural gas. Conversions to natural gas heat, which numbered a few hundred annually a few years ago, now total about 1,000 in 2010, 2,000 in 2011, and we may have many more in the pipeline for 2012. 
Nevertheless, Yankee Gas supply constraints that restrict ability to connect significant additional load in certain parts of the service area need to be resolved. Certain constraints at Eastern Connecticut are preventing the firm delivery of up to 1.2 billion additional cubic feet of natural gas per year. We are currently exploring a number of initiatives, some of them similar to the Waterbury-to-Wallingford line to eliminate those constraints and serve the growing demand for natural gas across the state. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to David."

Excluding charges related to the merger and the CL&P storm fund, we earned $423.9 million or $2.38 per share compared with recurring earnings of $381.",2483,"Thank you, Lee. As Chuck mentioned earlier, we are quite pleased with our financial performance in 2011. Excluding charges related to the merger and the CL&P storm fund, we earned $423.9 million or $2.38 per share compared with recurring earnings of $381.6 million or $2.16 per share in 2010. Our cash flow improved as well, rising to $901 million in 2011, after repayment of reduction bonds compared with $832.6 million in 2010. This increase occurred despite the payment of more than $150 million in power restoration costs in 2011 associated with the tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm, as well as the contribution of an additional $100 million into our pension plan in 2011 compared with 2010. 
Last spring, Standard & Poor's raised our credit ratings by one notch across the board, and Fitch raised PSNH's ratings by one notch and moved CL&P's outlook from stable to positive. 
NU's senior unsecured ratings are now BBB, BAA2 and BBB by S&P, Moody's and Fitch respectively. CL&P senior secured ratings are A-, A2 and A-. 
And over the course of 2011, we refinanced approximately $365 million of pollution control revenue bond at CL&P and PSNH, at significantly lower interest rates, saving an estimated $57 million over the life of the bonds. I'll discuss our 2012 financing plans in a moment. But first, I want to discuss our 2011 results in more detail, starting with our regulated companies. 
Regulated company earnings totaled $438.3 million in 2011, excluding the CL&P storm fund charge, up 14% from 2010 levels. The improvement occurred in both our distribution and transmission segments. 
In the fourth quarter of 2011, NU earned $132.4 million or $0.74 per share on a recurring basis compared with $123 million or $0.69 per share we earned on a recurring basis in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter improvement was all on the transmission segment, which earned $71.2 million in the fourth quarter compared with $50.5 million in the fourth quarter of '10. That improvement was due primarily to higher rate base at WMECO transmission and a lower effective tax rate at CL&P transmission. 
Our transmission earnings totaled $199.6 million or $1.12 per share in 2011 compared with $177.8 million or $1 per share in 2010. The most significant improvement occurred at Western Mass, where earnings rose about $10 million, primarily due to the construction of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. WMECO's transmission rate base totaled $467 million at the end of 2011 compared with $269 million at the end of 2010, an increase of nearly 74%. 
CL&P's transmission earnings rose to $151.9 million in 2011 from $143.9 million in 2010. Most of that increase was due to a lower effective tax rate. Transmission rate base declined by about 2.3% to $2.1 billion, primarily because of the completion of the planned sale of $42.5 million of transmission facilities to a Connecticut municipal electric cooperative. 
Turning from transmission to distribution, we earned $238.7 million in 2011, or $1.34 per share excluding the CL&P storm fund, compared with $206.2 million or $1.16 per share in 2010. That was an increase of nearly 16%. However, in the fourth quarter, distribution earnings declined to $65.2 million in 2011 from $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. As I will discuss shortly, those declines were primarily at Yankee Gas, which was negatively affected by milder weather in CL&P distribution, which had a higher effective tax rate. 
For the full year, CL&P's distribution earnings were $110.6 million in 2011 excluding the storm fund compared with $94.1 million in 2010. Improvement was largely due to the distribution rate case decision of June 2010. CL&P's distribution regulatory ROE was 9.4% in 2011, which achieves our allowed ROE compared with an earned ROE of 7.9% in the year 2010. 
PSNH's distribution and generation business earned $18.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $76.2 million for the full year of 2011 compared with earnings of $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and $69.3 million for the full year. The higher full year results were primarily due to the distribution rate increase that was effective July 1, 2010. That increase was partially offset by higher depreciation and property taxes. PSNH's combined distribution and generation regulatory ROE was 9.7% in 2011, right around our weighted generation and distribution average allowed ROE, compared with 10.2% in 2010. 
WMECO's distribution and generation business earned $7.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $20.2 million for the full year of 2011 compared with $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and $10.1 million for the full year of 2010. The improved results were primarily due to the impacts of the rate case decision issued in January of 2011 by the Massachusetts DPU. That decision, which was effective February 1, 2011, provided Western Mass Electric with $16.8 million in higher annual distribution revenues, but also required us to take a $2.1 million after tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
WMECO's distribution regulatory ROE was 9% in 2011 compared with 4.6% in 2010 in an allowed level of 9.6%. Yankee Gas earned $11 million in the fourth quarter of '11 and $31.7 million for the full year 2011, compared with earnings of $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $32.7 million for the full year of 2010. The drop in the fourth quarter earnings was due to an 8.5% decline in firm natural gas sales due to much warmer weather in late 2011, as well as a higher effective tax rate. Yankees regulatory ROE was 9.3% in 2011, compared with 8.6% in 2010 and an allowed level of 8.83%, which was set last summer at the conclusion of Yankees' rate case. 
For the full year, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 8% in 2011 due to much colder weather in the first quarter of 2011 than in the first quarter of '10, as well as a 5.1% weather-adjusted increase in sales. Those sales increases occurred primarily in the commercial and industrial sectors, where year-over-year sales were up 13.5% and 8.9%, respectively. The improvement was due primarily to the increasing price advantage of natural gas compared with heating oil. 
As you can imagine, the continued warm weather in the first quarter of 2012 will not help Yankee Gas sales this year compared with '11. We estimate that Yankee Gas lost about $4 million of pre-tax margin due to the warmer-than-normal temperatures in the fourth quarter alone and, perhaps, another $2 million in January of '12. 
Aside from the impacts of the special contracts, we expect Yankees' weather-normalized firm sales to rise about 6% in 2012 compared with '11. The electric side remains quite different. Retail electric sales fell by 1.2% in 2011 compared with 2010, but declined by only 0.3% on a weather-adjusted basis. PSNH retail weather-adjusted sales were up by 0.4%, while CL&Ps were down 0.5% and Western Mass Electric was down by 0.2%. We attribute CL&P's larger decline compared with PSNH or WMECO in part to the power outages following Irene and the October snowstorm. 
In 2012, we expect weather-adjusted electric sales to be slightly flat compared with 2011. We continue to see the impact of a soft but recovering economy in our service territory, along with increased levels of company-sponsored conservation. 
Just by way of some background on the economy across our states, the number of jobs in New Hampshire grew by about 1% in 2011, and the unemployment rate there ended the year at 5.1%, well below the national average of 8.5%. Average weekly hours for manufacturing employees grew by 0.7% and weekly unemployment claims fell by about 12% over the course of 2011. Housing permits continue to be weak, however. In Connecticut, nonmanufacturing employment is up by 33,600 jobs since bottoming 2 years ago, exports grew by about 2% in 2011 and new auto registrations were up sharply. But housing permits are down about 4.6%. December, the state unemployment rate was 8.2%. In Western Massachusetts, the unemployment rate is down to about 7.7%, aided in part by an influx in construction jobs that resulted from continued repairs to the housing damage during last June's tornado that tore through Springfield and other segments of Western Massachusetts. 
Turning back to our financial results, NU parent and other companies had net expenses of $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $25.7 million for the full year 2011 compared with net income of $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of '10 and net income of $3.9 million for the full year 2010. These figures include merger costs in both years and a nonrecurring tax gain of $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, when we settled a number of state tax items. 
Excluding all those impacts, we had net parent and other expenses of $14.4 million in 2011 or $0.08 per share compared with recurring net expenses of $2.4 million or less than $0.01 per share in 2010. The decline is primarily due to the absence of earnings at our competitive businesses, which are now almost fully unwound. 
As we mentioned at the EEI conference in November 2011, we are not providing standalone earnings guidance for 2012 since we expect to provide merged company guidance following the close of our pending merger with NSTAR. However, there are a few trends that should help you model and use earnings power this year. Let me talk about a few of those.
First, and perhaps most obvious, is a slow start to the year in terms of sales due to the warm-winter weather. This will clearly impact both electric and gas sales, but proportionally more so at Yankee. Offsetting this somewhat is the revenue decoupling mechanism at Western Mass Electric. And as you know, our transmission and generation business earnings are decoupled from sales volumes. 
As we continue to move forward on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in 2012, we expect WMECO's transmission earnings to continue to rise meaningfully. At CL&P, however, we project a higher effective tax rate, resulting in lower CL&P transmission earnings in 2012 despite a roughly 2% increase in transmission rate base. 
Overall, we expect NU's 2012 transmission earnings to be relatively flat as compared with '11, with increases at PSNH and Western Mass offsetting a decrease at CL&P. 
In terms of our FERC-authorized ROE, we are not anticipating a change. You may recall that at the end of September of 2011, a number of New England parties filed a complaint with the FERC regarding the 11.14% base ROE that is allowed to all New England transmission owners on their reliability investments. There were several rounds of filings at FERC in the fourth quarter regarding this complaint. We continue to believe that the base ROE is well within FERC's range of reasonableness, it should not be changed. However, FERC has not yet said when or how it will process the complaint. It could be rejected, it could be set for a contested hearing or it could be assigned to a settlement judge. 
At the distribution businesses, we have the benefit of some modest rate increases, but also the headwind of higher pension and health care expenses. Together, untracked employee-related expense primarily related to pensions at CL&P and PSNH distribution and Yankee Gas is expected to cost us about $0.10 per share in '12 or about $0.025 per quarter compared with 2011. This is primarily due to 2 factors. The first is that lower interest rates have led us to reduce our discount rate from about 5.6% in 2011 to about 5% in 2012. Additionally, the return on our investments in 2011 of about 2%, while competitive with other corporate plans, was still below our assumed long-term rate of return of 8.25%. 
I should note that we are currently -- we currently project that 2012 should be the high watermark for both pension expense and cash contribution to our pension plan. Some of the 2008 investment losses in our pension plan will be fully amortized by the end of this year, and as a result, we currently expect both pension plan expense and pension plan contributions to decline in 2013 compared with 2012. As you'll see on our 10-K, we expect contributions of approximately $150 million annually from 2012 through 2015 compared with contributions of roughly $197 million in 2012. 
And if our return in discount rate expectations for 2012 turn out to be fairly accurate, we will expect 2013 pension expense to be more similar to 2011 than 2012. 
Other factors that will pressure results in 2012 are related to the tropical storm Irene and the October snowstorm. As we mentioned earlier, we are increasing tree trimming and emergency preparedness budgets, as well as adding about $30 million to CL&P's distribution capital budgets. Those expenditures are expected to reduce earnings by about $0.05 over the course of 2012 compared with 2011. We will also need to pay short-term interest cost on approximately $300 million of storm deferrals over the course of '12. We expect the impact of the short-term debt levels to reduce CL&P's distribution earnings by about $0.03 per share, meaning the storm factors will cost about $0.08 per share in additional net cost in 2012. 
Now offsetting those increased costs are the $38 million of annualized distribution rate increases CL&P implemented in mid-2011 and approximately $7 million rate increase Yankee Gas will implement in mid-2012, and the distribution rate increase of $5 million to $10 million we expect PSNH will be allowed to implement in mid-2012 as a result of its 2010 rate settlement. Because of the mid-year timing of each of those rate increases, the total impact on revenues in 2012 versus last year is expected to be approximately $25 million pre-tax or about $0.09 per share. 
Benefiting both 2012 and '13, NU parent results should be refinancings at NU parent. A 7.25%, $263 million NU parent issuance will mature on April 1, 2012, and another $250 million of 5.65% NU parent debt on June 1, 2013. We expect that the favorable interest rate environment in addition to likely post-merger credit upgrades will significantly lower interest cost on both parent issuance. 
In terms of additional financing, we need to reprice $62 million of CL&P tax-exempt bonds on April 1, and we're looking for WMECO and Yankee Gas to sell new debt later this year. We are also looking at increasing CL&P's short-term debt credit lines to help us handle the $250 million of storm costs CL&P is now carrying. We currently expect no long-term debt issuance at CL&P or PSNH in 2012. 
Lastly, we expect 2012 to benefit from continued strong cost control, higher generation earnings at PSNH, a growing customer base and sales at Yankee, low interest rates, modest electric sales growth, lower NU parent expense and strong cash flow throughout the NU system.

There may be some additional environmental studies that have to take place in and around certain areas as a result of the initial findings. So that could change the schedule, and I think important here is the fact that the environmental surveys that we need to do are really based around 2 seasons. They're based around a winter season and a kind of a spring-summer season. So you can't complete all of the environmental surveys until you know exactly what the route is. So we would have liked to have had all of the winter environmental sampling done by this spring.

So multiple sites, more construction, which could lead to an earlier conclusion of the construction window of the project. You ask about other variables.

We need to finalize that route and then work on gaining additional political support. So you need political support. And of course, the other variable is we have a partner, which is HQ. And HQ, who is very much obviously supportive of the project and sees this as a major channel, if you will, to sell their power into New England, will need to be ready to move forward with us when we're ready to stop that construction."

But starting with the $14.4 million, recall that NU parent and other, that segment, if you will, is a collection of a number of companies including unregulated businesses, our service company and a number of land holding companies. I think among those companies you are going to see some modest improvements that will contribute to less net expense. So that's one part of the answer. The second part of the answer, we touched on and you alluded to, is the refinancing of $263 million of debt at the NU parent level. We anticipate doing that in the next couple of months. It currently has a coupon of 7.25%, and we'll be kind of formulating a strategy and entering the market shortly on that security. So that will move the needle significantly as well."

And I'll start with kind of just summarizing where we are in transmission, which is probably the easy one. I said that PSNH and Western Mass transmission earnings will be growing, but offset by CL&P that did receive a benefit this year of below our tax rate, particularly in Q4. So transmission will be roughly flat. On the sales side, we talked about some benefits there. And I do think it will be modest for the electric businesses. In 2011, we saw some similar trends around demand, stronger growth in New Hampshire, weaker growth in Massachusetts, squarely in the middle in Connecticut. And I think you should expect that going forward. So a little bit of an uplift there, and I think strong growth for Yankee, driven by both the demand for gas, given the price advantage, and conversions of new customers as they seek out to convert to use natural gas instead of home heating oil. So that, I think, is a benefit. I also kind of rattled off, but did not quantify other than to follow-up on Jay's question, on a number of additional items. So strong cost control. We don't see that as being a real big pressure on us, so I'll come back to that. Growth and generation earnings at PSNH. Low interest rates across the board. And then, I did highlight, Murray, for the NU parent and other segment, lower interest rates on the refinancing fees being a big driver of the $7.25, $263 million bond coming due. And you can pro forma in what you think we'll refinance that at. So clearly, in that segment, you're going to get some uplift. On the bigger drivers, we noted that for the storm between the O&M investments that we discussed, $14 million incrementally, and for the additional capital, $30 million incrementally. That's going to be about a $0.10 -- excuse me, a $0.09 number for us. For the -- let me jump over to the non-tracked benefit expenses for both the pension and employee benefits. We said relative to 2011, it's going to be a $0.10 increase, with 2012 being the high watermark. We expect that 2013 will actually decline from there. We also then said, I guess, lastly, that the offsets would be rate increases that go into effect that are going to provide about $25 million of pre-tax benefit or $0.09 per share of benefit. And let me just correct myself on the storms. That was a net $0.08 negative, not net $0.09 or $0.10 negative."

Here I am. I'm excited to be the new CEO of NU. 3 weeks on the job, and I can tell you I'm more excited now that I thought I'd be.

I'm excited to be the new CEO of NU. 3 weeks on the job, and I can tell you I'm more excited now that I thought I'd be. We really do have a great opportunity here and hopefully, I can share some thoughts with you on why I am so excited about this. 
This merger between the 2 largest New England-based utilities ensures that 3.5 million electric and gas customers are going to be served by a company whose only roots are here in New England. And as many of you know, I'm about customer service. It means that policymakers in Boston, Hartford only have to look in their backyards to find the management of the largest regulated utility, and it means that the 3.5 million customers that we serve won't have to look too far to see a Northeast Utilities employees since you all live right here in New England. 
In fact, I've been spending a lot of time going out to the field with townhall meetings talking to my line, talking to my troops to make sure that we recognize that we are in the customer Service business. That's my focus. But I need everyone of those 9,000 strong to focus on the customers for us to be successful, and I think we're making some great progress.
But this company is much more than a regional energy provider. We're going to have the scale to manage a highly effective and efficient company, and I think you know I'm mad about efficiency also. And $11 billion to $12 billion market cap company, we're going to be able to access the capital markets on very attractive terms, better than we could do individually. But we can continue make investments in wires and pipes that our customers and our communities need. 
We've married one of the nation's most reliable operators electric distribution systems with probably the most preeminent planner, designer, builder and operator of electric transmission systems. We also will operate 2 natural gas systems serving 500,000 customers. But when we look at those franchises and those communities, we think there's probably twice that number of homes and businesses that we can serve in the future. In an arrow when economic and eventual benefits of converting from heating oil to natural gas never been greater. We hope to expand our pipeline infrastructure to really save a whole bunch of New Englanders, tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars annually so that we can put that back into the economies of our states. 
We have gas at $1.25 a gallon versus $4 heating oil. I think you can appreciate how many of our customers are begging us to expect expand our infrastructure. To our investors on the call, I think we offer a very attractive value proposition from 2 companies that have provided some attractive total returns over the last 5 to 7 years we formed one larger cap utility with a single are focus on energy delivery in New England, a market we know and understand. 
Over the past 10 years, NU and NSTAR have offered one of the most compelling dividend growth stories in the industry. And as you noticed yesterday, our dividend growth is continuing as we've promised at the beginning of this transaction to align the 2 companies dividends. And so we provided the legacy NU shareholders with a 16%, 17% increase, and yet our payout ratio is still low for the industry especially for someone who is predominantly a delivery company and preserves the potential for pretty attractive dividend growth in the future.
Also we think it will allow us to reserve considerable capital to reinvest in accretive projects that our customers need regarding their reliability. Earlier today, the newly formed Board of Trustees of Northeast Utilities completed 2 days of meetings. Members of the board who unanimously endorsed our merger what it was brought to them in October 2010 were again even more excited just like me as we talked about this great combination and the potential we have going forward. 
We believe that state policy holders and utility regulators share our views in how this can benefit the region. The settlements that produce this merger were announced enthusiastically by the Governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Participation in the negotiations of those settlement agreements by the state's attorneys general and high-level energy policymakers were a key to their success. 
We're thankful for their hard work in achieving a balanced outcome that treat all parties fairly, and over the next several weeks, the consumers will see the first of that in the form of $46 million of rate credits that flow out of these negotiated rate settlements. Additionally, we will begin, and we have focused on the fact that we will now live through multiyear rate freezes that are in effect for most of our utilities, but do allow us to keep the benefits of our good work to offset the impact of rising costs and fixed delivery rates. 
We understand we need to implement efficiencies in our business processes commonly referred to as synergies. But we also are immediately benefiting from reduced financing costs and lower cost of purchasing equipment and services. When NU and NSTAR shareholders overwhelmingly approved this transaction back in March of 2011, we had a vision of how attractive a merged company could become. Now where it's up to us, and we are in the process of delivering on those commitments, and we're ready and excited about the opportunity. 
So that's all I want to say to open this up, and now let me turn it over to Leo to talk a little bit about our capital programs at some of our big projects."
292525,204862889,296770,"Northeast Utilities, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Allow me to start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives beginning with our NEEWS project. With extremely favorable weather, excuse me, that we've had to date we're about 64% complete with the Greater Springfield reliability pro",1117,"Thanks, Tom. Allow me to start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives beginning with our NEEWS project. With extremely favorable weather, excuse me, that we've had to date we're about 64% complete with the Greater Springfield reliability project. The project will provide an important new 40-mile pathway to move power reliably between Western Massachusetts and Connecticut. We continue to expect the projects to be completed by late 2013 on a cost of $718 million. Of that sum, $426 million was invested as of March 31.
Turning to the Interstate Reliability Project. You may recall that we filed our application with the Connecticut Siting Council in December. Last month, we completed 3 days of field reviews and 3 evenings of public hearings in Northeastern Connecticut on the project. Based in New England and we are updating the planning studies to reflect the latest available data and are scheduled to submit testimony in support of the project later this month. Hearings are scheduled to begin in June, and we continue to expect a final decision in 2013.
While we're building the 40-mile, $218 million Connecticut section of this project, National Grid Rhode Island and Massachusetts sections. After receiving updated planning studies for ISO New England later this month, we expect National Grid to file its setting application later this quarter and to receive final approval through late 2013. We continue to expect the project to enter service in late 2015. 
The final major element of NEEWS is the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. As we've mentioned earlier, ISO New England will review this project as part of a comprehensive study known as the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut study. We continue to expect ISO to issue a preliminary needs analysis and related transmission solutions next year.
Turning to Wind Star Electric, the most significant project in 2012 is a new 18-mile, 345 kv line to be built to Cape Cod. The project received final Massachusetts energy facility siting board approval in April, and we expect to complete the approximately $110 million project in the first quarter of 2013.
Overall, we expect NSTAR Electric to invest approximately $190 million in transmission infrastructure in 2012.
When we consummated the merger last month, we also brought together the 2 owners of the Northern Pass Transmission Project. As a result, we have consolidated NSTAR's investment in Northern Pass. So when we discuss the projects cost going forward, it will affect 100% of the project. In Northern Pass project a $1.1 billion, 180-mile primarily high-voltage D.C. project to move 1,200 megawatts of clean power out of Québec and into Southern New Hampshire continues to make progress. 
You may recall that 140 miles of the project would be built along existing rights-of-way. The other 40 miles in Northern New Hampshire is where we need to secure a new right-of-way. We continue to make good progress on securing the additional 40 miles and plan to present a new route to federal regulators in the third quarter of this year. I would support the start of construction in 2014 and completing it by the end of 2016.
Earlier this year, Governor Lynch signed legislation that would prohibit the use of imminent domain for transmission projects that are not subject to regional cost allocation. While we continue to believe we can secure a right-of-way without using imminent domain. This line remains the most innovative proposal now before regulators who appreciably lower both the cost of electricity and the amount of carbon emissions in New England. That also will provide Hydro-Québec with important new pathway to move power into New England with this generation now under construction in Central and Northern Québec. 
NU's transmission capital expenditures totaled $137 million in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $68 million in the first quarter of 2011. For the year, including NSTAR's expenditures, we project approximately $675 million of transmission capital expenditures included in Northern Pass.
Turning from transmission to generation. PSNH is near completion of the secondary wastewater handling facilities associated with the clean air project at Merrimack Station. This is the last major segment of the project. We continue to project the total expenditures of $422 million, about $35 million below budget. The wet scrubber has been operating well since last September, and the results have been excellent. We have seen a 97% to 98% reduction in mercury emissions and a 96% to 98% reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions, well beyond our initial projections. 
On April 16, 2012, we began collecting a significant portion of the carrying costs on the clean air project through a Public Utility Commission-approved temporary rates, and we expect New Hampshire regulators to review the prudence of the project over the balance of this year. Given the fact that we are completing the project well below budget and with very favorable emission reduction results, we believe that the Public Utility Commission review will reach a favorable conclusion, and the scrubber costs will be fully recoverable with our allowed 9.81% return on equity on our generating assets. 
Our electric distribution reliability was strong across all 3 states in the first quarter due to our continued investment, ongoing preventative maintenance and the lack of storm activity. CL&P, PSNH and WMECO invested a combined $125 million in distribution capital from the first quarter of 2012 compared with $98 million in the first quarter of 2011. 
For the merged company, we expect to invest a total of approximately $1.7 billion in our infrastructure in 2012. Turning to our Natural Gas Distribution business. We saw 2 impacts in the first quarter. The first and most apparent impact was the decline in sales due to the very mild winter. 
Yankee Gas firm sales were off by 13.2% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with 2011. The continued fuel switching among all classes of customers meant that weather-adjusted Yankee gas sales continue to rise by 5% annually as they have over the past several years. Between Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas more than 4,000 residential units were converted to natural gas in 2011, more than double the previous year. 
We continue to see significant opportunities ahead. Together, Yankee Gas and NSTAR gas have approximately 500,000 customers. About 38,000 of our residential customers have gas in their home but do not use it for space heating. Now the 90,000 customers are located within 150 feet of our gas mains but they are not connected to our system. But natural gas price at less than half the cost of oil on a BTU basis we expect solid growth going forward, as customers switch to a much less expensive and more environmentally friendly fuel source. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

Let me start by saying how pleased I am to speak to you all today as Northeast Utilities Chief Financial Officer. 
Before beginning with my formal remarks, I want to reiterate earlier comments about how pleased we all are that we're able to merge these 2 companies into the new NU. We have tremendous opportunities available to enhance the benefits we can bring to our customers and our region while simultaneously creating very attractive value for our investors. 
There's several areas I want to focus on before we turn to your questions. The first area involves the settlements we reached in Massachusetts and Connecticut that moved us to the regulatory approval. Second will be our financial results for the first quarter, the expected impact of the merger on our second quarter results and the state of our region's economy. The third area involves financings we have accomplished thus far this year and what we project for the balance of the year. 
And lastly, I want to discuss the work that are now undertaking to create a high-performing customer-responsive and cost-efficient merged organization. I'll start with the merger settlements that Tom touched on a little earlier. In Massachusetts, we reached 2 comprehensive settlements, one with both the attorney general and the State Department of Energy resources and the other exclusively with the DOER. The 3-party settlement incorporated several key provisions. 
First, it freezes base distribution rates through 2015 for NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and Western Mass Electric Company. Second, it provides a $21 million rate credit to customers in the current going cycle. That's $15 million for NSTAR Electric customers and $3 million each for NSTAR Gas and Western Mass customers. 
While base delivery rates are frozen, this settlement continues to allow NSTAR Electric's recovery of loss base revenues that results from energy efficiency programs. It also allows all 3 companies pension trackers to continue functioning. And for Western Mass Electric Company, revenues decoupling mechanism that was approved in its most recent case will remain in place.
NSTAR Electric's 2011 major storm costs, which total $38 million will be recovered over 5 years beginning January 1, 2014, while Western Mass' storm cost will be subject to the recovery mechanism allowed in its rate case. As is typical, these storm recoveries are subject to DPU approval.
Under the other Massachusetts settlement with the DOER, NSTAR Electric will execute a 15-year contracts with Cape Wind for up to 129 megawatts of power, which equates to 27.5% of Cape Wind's projected output. Costs associated with that contract will be recovered from customers and as permitted by statute, NSTAR Electric will be allowed a 4% remuneration to offset any balance sheet impacts. 
NSTAR Electric also agreed to increase energy efficiency targets, procure up to 10 megawatts of new solar generation and implement an electric vehicle pilot program. These initiatives will contribute significantly to meeting the state's energy policy goals.
Connecticut settlement was similar to our Massachusetts settlement in some ways and different in others. Both support each respective state's priorities. Under the Connecticut settlement, CL&P will provide a $25 million rate credit to customers in the current billing cycle and will freeze base distribution rates until December 2014. 
CL&P also agreed to fund $15 million of state energy initiatives to forgo recovery of $40 million of deferred storm costs from tropical storm Irene and the devastating October snowstorm. Importantly, the agreement will allow CL&P to recover storm costs following a prudence review over a 6-year period beginning December 1, 2014. We believe having a known recovery period over a reasonable number of years was a positive outcome from the settlement. 
Separately, CL&P agreed to propose a multi-year $300 million system resiliency program to regulators, about $100 million of which we expect to spend between 2013 and 2014. We will recover the full revenue requirements associated with this program, and we're tracking charge of customers' bills. Up to $25 million of the associated revenue requirements will be recovered during 2013 and 2014. 
We believe this was an important and positive condition in the settlement. Our 2 operating utilities that are not covered by these rate settlements, Public Service of New Hampshire and the Yankee Gas, are currently operating under multi-year rate case decisions. PSNH's plan goes through mid-2015 and the last summer's rate case decision Yankee Gas will implement a rate increase of approximately $7 million this July 1.
The impact of all these settlements is that we undertake the significant task of merging our operations. And as we do that, we can do so without the distraction and cost of preparing, filing, testifying at and otherwise supporting distribution rate cases. This will be very helpful as we create a merged organization that can instead totally focus on providing significant benefits to New England energy consumers and a very attractive value proposition to our investors.
Many on this call know that during the hearings in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, David McHale and I testified that our net benefit analysis indicated that there would be nearly $1 billion of savings over the first 10 years of the merger. The focus now is to realize these savings and potentially more.
The work that will underlie future financial projections is underway, and we expect to provide you with a comprehensive update either at an Analyst Day or at our traditional EEI breakfast during the fall. As we stated during the merger hearings, we believe that the savings estimates will prove to be conservative. 
So what does that mean for 2012? I will discuss the first quarter results in a moment. Second quarter results, which have traditionally been the weakest of the year for both NU and NSTAR this year, you'll also include the nonrecurring impact of merger settlement agreements that I noted earlier. 
In addition, we will recognize other merger-related nonrecurring costs such as financial advisory fees and costs related to change of control agreements affecting a number of offices. As a result, we believe that the second half of 2012 rather than the first half of the year will provide you with more representative basis from which you will be able to measure our financial progress in the years to come.
Turning to the first quarter. I will briefly discuss NU's standalone results. NU earned $99.3 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of the year compared with $114.2 million, a $0.64 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Distribution earnings declined by $21.5 million, a $0.12 per share from $78.2 million in the first quarter of 2011 or $56.7 million in the first quarter of 2012. 
Connecticut Light and Power, Public Service of New Hampshire and Yankee all experienced distribution earnings declines through the exceptionally mild weather and higher pension costs. Of that $0.12 decline, about $0.07 were due to the weather. 
Compared with the first quarter of 2011, heating degree days in 2012 were down 23.4%, and Bradley Airport in Northern Connecticut down 19.2% in Concord, New Hampshire. In fact, the first quarter of 2012 was the warmest on record in Hartford, in Boston and in Concord. 
In Hartford, the average temperature was 38.2 degrees in the first quarter of 2012 compared with an average of 31.3 degrees from the previous record from 1998, which was 36.3 degrees. So weather records were absolutely shattered in this first quarter with the extremely mild temperatures.
Another $0.03 of the earnings decline from 2011 were due primarily to higher pension and other employee benefit costs, and that impact is very consistent with the comments David McHale made in February when we projected that higher on track pension and health care costs will result in an annualized $0.10 decline in NU's standalone earnings in 2012. 
It's worth noting that WMECO, which has both revenue decoupling and a pension tracker, experienced a modest $400,000 increase in first quarter earnings.
Offsetting these negative items was a $7.2 million decline in merger-related costs from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, transmission earnings rose by $1.6 million or about 3.6% due to a near doubling of WMECO's transmission earnings related to the construction progress on the Greater Springfield project that Lee referenced earlier. 
Based on my comments, I'm sure you can summarize that we view 2012 as a transition year. From an earnings perspective, it's a year when we record almost all the costs related to the merger, and due to the timing of the closing, it's a year when the benefits of the merger on recurring earnings will only be modestly apparent.
Although we're not ready to provide you with 2013 guidance at this time, there are a number of factors that we believe will provide significantly better results next year. First, we estimate that a return of normal first quarter weather in 2013 should restore $0.06 per share to NU's earnings. Second, we continue to expect much of the incremental 2012 pension costs to fully reverse in 2013 as a result of increased pension contributions, asset performance, a similar discount rate and lower amortizations on prior year actuarial losses. 
Third, as the Greater Springfield Reliability Project and Cape Cod line are built out, we expect strong transmission earnings in 2013. On the merged company basis, we had about $3.8 billion transmission rate base at the end of 2011. We expect that to rise to $4.1 billion by the end of this year and $4.4 billion by the end of 2013. 
Fourth, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to be able to reduce our operating costs as we implement cost efficiencies and merger synergies. Finally, we expect to see the benefits of an improving economy. Overall, I would characterize our economy as improving and still better than the rest of the country. 
Boston area unemployment rate is now 5.5%. New Hampshire rate is down to 5.2%. Connecticut's unemployment rate of 7.7%, and Western Mass' rate of 7.3% are somewhat higher but is still well below the national average of 8.2%.
Both initial and continued unemployment claims are down in all 3 states, and building permits in the first 2 months of 2012 were up by more than 125% in both Massachusetts and Connecticut over 2011 levels helped somewhat by the mild weather this year. We saw some of that economic impact in our first quarter sales. PSNH weather-adjusted sales rose 0.5% in the first quarter compared with last year. And CL&P and WMECO's weather-adjusted sales were essentially flat compared with sales declines in most recent years. 
Yankee Gas' weather-adjusted sales rose 5%, similar to the increases Yankee has experienced for the past several years. Turning to financing. NU had a significant amount of activity just prior to the merger closing. In March, NU parent sold $300 million of 18-month floating rate notes to refinance $263 million of 10-year notes that mature at April 1. The initial rate on those NU notes is 1.22% -- excuse me. So interest cost will be about 1/3 of what we had been paying on that series. 
CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt dilution control bonds, locking in an attractive 1.55% rate for the next 3 years. Over the balance of the year, the most significant refinancing involves $400 million of NSTAR Electric notes that mature this fall. The current coupon on those notes is 4.875%. We also expect small and new debt issuances at WMECO and Yankee Gas. 
You may have also seen that all 3 credit rating agencies completed their comprehensive reviews of NU and its subsidiaries around the closing of the merger. Some ratings on our system rose, some fell, but all ratings are now stable. Only one electric utility family, Southern Company, has a higher credit rating than NU. And we will continue to enjoy very strong access to low-cost capital. NSTAR Electric continues to have a very highly rated economical commercial paper program.
We currently have about $1.9 billion of credit lines along with attractive active commercial paper programs in NSTAR Electric NSTAR LLC. Over the coming months, we will begin utilizing our capital requirements to determine where further savings can be realized as a result of the economies of financing a much larger, stronger and more liquid company. 
We'll also move ahead steadily on our integration work. While the merger was pending, we engaged 11 teams and 175 subject matter experts focused on both day one requirements and develop a deep understanding of each company's operations and organization. During the week before the merger, we announced the next level of leadership, primarily at the officer level, and the next level beyond that will be announced in a few weeks. 
We're very encouraged by the quality of the team, by the teamwork that they're showing. Confident that this merger will work and deliver the value to customers and investors that we have discussed for the past 18 months.

At some point are you going to be able to A, give us what you see as sort of a normalized earnings number for this year? And B, confirm that you still believe that this is a company that can grow at the 6% to 9% earnings growth rate that was articulated when the deal was announced off of what would otherwise be a normal base level of earnings?"

I think you've got a sense from Tom, Lee and my comments that we're bullish on the company. We think we've got great opportunity ahead. When you look at both of these companies, NU and NSTAR and their track record certainly over the past 5 or 10 years, the performance has been well above industry average in terms of earnings growth, in terms of total shareholder return. So the new NU has a very long track record of notable and consistent success for investors. What we'd like to do is make sure that we have the team in place that we develop a plan that we have right consensus upon we review that plan and get the endorsement of our board. And at that point in time, we will provide guidance to Wall Street of a plan that we're very confident and that we'll be able to achieve.

And I can tell you, I'm more excited now that I thought I'd be. We really do have a great opportunity here. And hopefully, I can share some thoughts with you on why I am so excited about this. 
This merger between the 2 largest New England-based utilities ensures that 3.5 million electric and gas customers are going to be served by a company whose only roots are here in New England. And as many of you know, I'm a nut about customer service. It means the policymakers in Boston, Hartford, Concord only have to look in their backyards to find the management of the largest regulated utility. And it means that the 3.5 million customers that we serve won't have to look too far to see a Northeast Utilities employee, since you all live right here in New England. 
In fact, I've been spending a lot of time going out to the field with town hall meetings talking to my linemen, talking to my troops to make sure they recognize that we are in the customer service business. That's my focus. But I need every one of those 9,000 strong to focus on the customers for us to be successful, and I think we're making some great progress.
But this company is much more than a regional energy provider. We're going to have the scale to manage a highly effective and efficient company, and I think you know I am a nut about efficiency also. And as a $11 billion to $12 billion market cap company, we're going to be able to access the capital markets on very attractive terms, better than we could do individually. But we can continue to make investments in wires and pipes that our customers and our communities need. 
We've married one of the nation's most reliable operators of electric distribution systems, with probably the most preeminent planner, designer, builder and operator of electric transmission systems. We also will operate 2 natural gas systems, serving 500,000 customers. But when we look at those franchises and those communities, we think there's probably twice that number of homes and businesses we can serve in the future. 
In an era when economic and eventual benefits of converting from heating oil to natural gas has never been greater, we hope to expand our pipeline infrastructure to really save a whole bunch of New Englanders, tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars annually so that we can put that back into the economies of our states. We have gas at $1.25 a gallon versus $4 heating oil. I think you can appreciate how many of our customers are begging us to expect expand our infrastructure. 
To our investors on the call, I think we offer a very attractive value proposition from 2 companies that have provided some attractive total returns over the last 5 to 7 years. We formed one larger cap utility, with a single are focus on energy delivery in New England, a market we know and understand. 
Over the past 10 years, NU and NSTAR have offered one of the most compelling dividend growth stories in the industry. And as you noticed yesterday, that dividend growth is continuing as we've promised at the beginning of this transaction to align the 2 companies' dividends. And so we've provided the legacy NU shareholders with a 16%, 17% increase. And yet, our payout ratio is still low for the industry, especially for someone who is a predominantly delivery company and preserves the potential for a pretty attractive dividend growth in the future. Also, it will allow us to reserve considerable capital to reinvest in accretive projects that our customers need regarding their reliability. 
Earlier today, the newly formed Board of Trustees of Northeast Utilities completed 2 days of meetings. Members of the board, who unanimously endorsed our merger when it was brought to them in October 2010, were, again, even more excited just like me as we talked about this great combination and the potential we have going forward. We believe that state policy holders and utility regulators share our views on how this can benefit the region. 
The settlements that produced this merger were announced enthusiastically by the Governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Participation in the negotiations of those settlement agreements by the states' attorneys general and high-level energy policymakers were a key to their success. We're thankful for their hard work in achieving a balanced outcome that treat all parties fairly. And over the next several weeks, the consumers will see the first of that in the form of $46 million of rate credits that flow out of these negotiated rate settlements. 
Additionally, we will begin and we have focused on the fact that we will now live through multi-year rate freezes that are in effect for most of our utilities, but do allow us to keep the benefits of our good work to offset the impact of rising costs and fixed delivery rates. We understand we need to implement efficiencies in our business processes, commonly referred to as synergies. But we also are immediately benefiting from reduced financing costs and lower cost of purchasing equipment and services. 
When NU and NSTAR shareholders overwhelmingly approved this transaction back in March of 2011, we had a vision of how attractive a merged company could become. Now we're -- it's up to us. And we are in the process of delivering on those commitments, and we're ready and excited about the opportunity. So that's all I want to say to open this up. 
And now let me turn it over to Leo to talk a little bit about our capital programs and some of our big projects."

Allow me to start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives, beginning with our NEEWS project. With extremely favorable weather that we have had to date, we're about 64% complete with the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. The project will provide an important new 40-mile pathway to move power reliably between Western Massachusetts and Connecticut. We continue to expect the projects to be completed by late 2013 at a cost of $718 million. Of that sum, $426 million was invested as of March 31.
Turning to the Interstate Reliability Project. You may recall that we filed our application with the Connecticut Siting Council in December. Last month, we completed 3 days of field reviews and 3 evenings of public hearings in Northeastern Connecticut on the project. ISO New England and we are updating the planning studies to reflect the latest available data and are scheduled to submit testimony in support of the project later this month. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in June, and we continue to expect a final decision in 2013.
While we were building the 40-mile, $218 million Connecticut section of this project, National Grid will build the Rhode Island and Massachusetts sections. After receiving updated planning studies from ISO New England later this month, we expect National Grid to file its siting application later this quarter and to receive final approval in late 2013. We continue to expect the project to enter service in late 2015. 
The final major element of NEEWS is the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. As we've mentioned earlier, ISO New England will review this project as part of a comprehensive study known as the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut study. We continue to expect ISO to issue a preliminary needs analysis and related transmission solutions next year.
Turning to NSTAR Electric. The most significant project in 2012 is a new 18-mile, 345-kV line to be built to Cape Cod. The project received final Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board approval in April, and we expect to complete the approximately $110 million project in the first quarter of 2013. Overall, we expect NSTAR Electric to invest approximately $190 million in transmission infrastructure in 2012.
When we consummated the merger last month, we also brought together the 2 owners of the Northern Pass Transmission Project. As a result, we have consolidated NSTAR's 25% investment in Northern Pass. So when we discuss the project's cost going forward, it will reflect 100% of the project. 
Another Northern Pass project, a $1.1 billion, 180-mile primarily high voltage DC project to move 1,200 megawatts of clean power out of Québec and into Southern New Hampshire, continues to make progress. You may recall that 140 miles of the project would be built along existing rights-of-way. The other 40 miles in Northern New Hampshire is where we need to secure a new right-of-way. We continue to make good progress on securing the additional 40 miles and plan to present a new route to federal regulators in the third quarter of this year. That would support the start of construction in 2014 and completing it by the end of 2016.
Earlier this year, Governor Lynch signed legislation that would prohibit the use of imminent domain for transmission projects that are not subject to regional cost allocation, but we continue to believe we can secure a right-of-way without using imminent domain. This line remains the most innovative proposal now before regulators to appreciably lower both the cost of electricity and the amount of carbon emissions in New England. That also would provide Hydro-Québec an important new pathway to move power into New England from its generation now under construction in Central and Northern Québec. 
NU's transmission capital expenditures totaled $137 million in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $68 million in the first quarter of 2011. For the year, including NSTAR's expenditures, we project approximately $675 million of transmission capital expenditures, including work on Northern Pass.
Turning from transmission to generation. PSNH is near completion of the secondary wastewater handling facilities associated with the Clean Air Project of Merrimack Station. This is the last major segment of the project. We continue to project the total expenditures of $422 million, about $35 million below budget. The wet scrubber has been operating well since last September, and the results have been excellent. We have seen a 97% to 98% reduction in mercury emissions and a 96% to 98% reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions, well beyond our initial projections. 
On April 16, 2012, we began collecting a significant portion of the carrying cost on the Clean Air Project through a Public Utility Commission-approved temporary rates, and we expect New Hampshire regulators to review the prudence of the project over the balance of this year. Given the fact that we are completing the project well below budget and with very favorable emission reduction results, we believe that the Public Utility Commission review will reach a favorable conclusion, and the scrubber costs will be fully recoverable with our allowed 9.81% return on equity on our generating assets. 
Our electric distribution reliability was strong across all 3 states in the first quarter due to our continued investment, ongoing preventative maintenance and the lack of storm activity. CL&P, PSNH and WMECO invested a combined $125 million in distribution capital from the first quarter of 2012 compared with $98 million in the first quarter of 2011. For the merged company, we expect to invest a total of approximately $1.7 billion in our infrastructure in 2012. 
Turning to our natural gas distribution business. We saw 2 impacts in the first quarter. The first and most apparent impact was the decline in sales due to the very mild winter. Yankee Gas firm sales were off by 13.2% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with 2011. The continued fuel switching among all classes of customers meant that weather-adjusted Yankee Gas sales continued to rise by 5% annually as they have over the past several years. Between Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas more than 4,000 residential units were converted to natural gas in 2011, more than double the previous year. 
We continue to see significant opportunities ahead. Together, Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas have approximately 500,000 customers. About 38,000 of our residential customers have gas in their home but do not use it for space heating. Now the 90,000 customers are located within 150 feet of our gas mains, but they are not connected to our system. With natural gas price at less than half the cost of oil on a BTU basis, we expect solid growth going forward as customers switch to a much less expensive and more environmentally friendly fuel source. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

Let me start by saying how pleased I am to speak to you all today as Northeast Utilities' Chief Financial Officer. Before beginning with my formal remarks, I want to reiterate earlier comments about how pleased we all are that we're able to merge these 2 companies into the new NU. We have tremendous opportunities available to enhance the benefits we can bring to our customers and our region while simultaneously creating very attractive value for our investors. 
There's several areas I want to focus on before we turn to your questions. The first area involves the settlements we reached in Massachusetts and Connecticut that moved us to the regulatory approval. The second will be our financial results for the first quarter, the expected impact of the merger on our second quarter results and the state of our region's economy. The third area involves financings we have accomplished thus far this year and what we project for the balance of the year. And lastly, I want to discuss the work we are now undertaking to create a high-performing, customer-responsive and cost-efficient merged organization. 
I'll start with the merger settlements that Tom touched on a little earlier. In Massachusetts, we reached 2 comprehensive settlements, one with both the attorney general and the State Department of Energy resources, and the other exclusively with the DOER. The 3-party settlement incorporated several key provisions. 
First, it freezes base distribution rates through 2015 for NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and Western Mass Electric Company. Second, it provides a $21 million rate credit to customers in the current going cycle. That's $15 million for NSTAR Electric customers and $3 million each for NSTAR Gas and Western Mass customers. 
While base delivery rates are frozen, this settlement continues to allow NSTAR Electric's recovery of loss base revenues that result from energy efficiency programs. It also allows all 3 companies pension trackers to continue functioning. And for Western Mass Electric Company, revenue decoupling mechanism that was approved in its most recent case will remain in place.
NSTAR Electric's 2011 major storm costs, which total $38 million, will be recovered over 5 years beginning January 1, 2014, while Western Mass' storm costs will be subject to the recovery mechanism allowed in its rate case. As is typical, these storm recoveries are subject to DPU approval.
Under the other Massachusetts settlement with the DOER, NSTAR Electric will execute a 15-year contract with Cape Wind for up to 129 megawatts of power, which equates to 27.5% of Cape Wind's projected output. Costs associated with that contract will be recovered from customers. And as permitted by statute, NSTAR Electric will be allowed a 4% remuneration to offset any balance sheet impacts. 
NSTAR Electric also agreed to increase energy efficiency targets, procure up to 10 megawatts of new solar generation and implement an electric vehicle pilot program. These initiatives will contribute significantly to meeting the state's energy policy goals.
Connecticut settlement was similar to our Massachusetts settlement in some ways and different in others. Both support each respective state's priorities. Under the Connecticut settlement, CL&P will provide a $25 million rate credit to customers in the current billing cycle and will freeze base distribution rates until December 2014. 
CL&P also agreed to fund $15 million of state energy initiatives to forgo recovery of $40 million of deferred storm costs from tropical storm Irene and the devastating October snowstorm. Importantly, the agreement will allow CL&P to recover storm costs following a prudence review over a 6-year period beginning December 1, 2014. We believe having a known recovery period over a reasonable number of years was a positive outcome from the settlement. 
Separately, CL&P agreed to propose a multi-year $300 million system resiliency program to regulators, about $100 million of which we expect to spend between 2013 and 2014. We will recover the full revenue requirements associated with this program. And we're tracking charge of customers' bills. Up to $25 million of the associated revenue requirements will be recovered during 2013 and 2014. 
We believe this was an important and positive condition in the settlement. Our 2 operating utilities that are not covered by these rate settlements, Public Service of New Hampshire and Yankee Gas, are currently operating under multi-year rate case decisions. PSNH's rate plan goes through mid-2015. Under last summer's rate case decision, Yankee Gas will implement a rate increase of approximately $7 million this July 1.
The impact of all these settlements is that we undertake the significant task of merging our operations. And as we do that, we can do so without the distraction and cost of preparing, filing, testifying at and otherwise supporting distribution rate cases. This will be very helpful as we create a merged organization that can instead totally focus on providing significant benefits to New England's energy consumers and a very attractive value proposition to our investors.
Many on this call know that during the hearings in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, David McHale and I testified that our net benefit analysis indicated that there would be nearly $1 billion of savings over the first 10 years of the merger. Our focus now is to realize these savings and potentially more.
The work that will underlie future financial projections is underway, and we expect to provide you with a comprehensive update either at an Analyst Day or at our traditional EEI breakfast during the fall. As we stated during the merger hearings, we believe that the savings estimates will prove to be conservative. 
So what does that mean for 2012? I will discuss the first quarter results in a moment. Second quarter results, which have traditionally been the weakest of the year for both NU and NSTAR, this year will also include the nonrecurring impact of the merger settlement agreements that I noted earlier. In addition, we will recognize other merger-related nonrecurring costs such as financial advisory fees and costs related to change of control agreements affecting a number of offices. As a result, we believe that the second half of 2012 rather than the first half of the year will provide you with more representative basis from which you will be able to measure our financial progress in the years to come.
Turning to the first quarter, I will briefly discuss NU's stand-alone results. NU earned $99.3 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of the year compared with $114.2 million or $0.64 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Distribution earnings declined by $21.5 million or $0.12 per share from $78.2 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $56.7 million in the first quarter of 2012. 
Connecticut Light and Power, Public Service of New Hampshire and Yankee all experienced distribution earnings declines due to the exceptionally mild weather and higher pension costs. Of that $0.12 decline, about $0.07 were due to the weather. 
Compared with the first quarter of 2011, heating degree days in 2012 were down 23.4% at Bradley Airport in Northern Connecticut and down 19.2% in Concord, New Hampshire. In fact, the first quarter of 2012 was the warmest on record in Hartford, in Boston and in Concord. 
In Hartford, the average temperature was 38.2 degrees in the first quarter of 2012 compared with an average of 31.3 degrees from the previous record from 1998, which was 36.3 degrees. So weather records were absolutely shattered in this first quarter with the extremely mild temperatures.
Another $0.03 of the earnings decline from 2011 were due primarily to higher pension and other employee benefit costs, and that impact is very consistent with the comments David McHale made in February when we projected that higher untracked pension and health care costs will result in an annualized $0.10 decline in NU's stand-alone earnings in 2012. 
It's worth noting that WMECO, which has both revenue decoupling and a pension tracker, experienced a modest $400,000 increase in first quarter earnings. Offsetting these negative items was a $7.2 million decline in merger-related costs from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, transmission earnings rose by $1.6 million or about 3.6% due to a near doubling of WMECO's transmission earnings related to the construction progress on the Greater Springfield Project that Lee referenced earlier. 
Based on my comments, I'm sure you can surmise that we view 2012 as a transition year. From an earnings perspective, it's a year when we record almost all the costs related to the merger. And due to the timing of the closing, it's a year when the benefits of the merger on recurring earnings will only be modestly apparent.
Although we're not ready to provide you with 2013 guidance at this time, there are a number of factors that we believe will provide significantly better results next year. First, we estimate that a return of normal first quarter weather in 2013 should restore $0.06 per share to NU's earnings. 
Second, we continue to expect much of the incremental 2012 pension costs to fully reverse in 2013 as a result of increased pension contributions, asset performance, a similar discount rate and lower amortizations on prior year actuarial losses. 
Third, as the Greater Springfield Reliability Project and Cape Cod line are built out, we expect strong transmission earnings in 2013. On the merged company basis, we had about $3.8 billion of transmission rate base at the end of 2011. We expect that to rise to $4.1 billion by the end of this year and $4.4 billion by the end of 2013. 
Fourth, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to be able to reduce our operating costs as we implement cost efficiencies and merger synergies. 
Finally, we expect to see the benefits of an improving economy. Overall, I would characterize our economy as improving and still better than the rest of the country. The boston area unemployment rate is now 5.5%. New Hampshire rate is down to 5.2%. Connecticut's unemployment rate of 7.7%, and Western Mass' rate of 7.3% are somewhat higher but is still well below the national average of 8.2%.
Both initial and continued unemployment claims are down in all 3 states, and building permits in the first 2 months of 2012 were up by more than 125% in both Massachusetts and Connecticut over 2011 levels, helped somewhat by the mild weather this year. 
We saw some of that economic impact in our first quarter sales. PSNH weather-adjusted sales rose 0.5% in the first quarter compared with last year, and CL&P and WMECO's weather-adjusted sales were essentially flat compared with sales declines in most recent years. Yankee Gas' weather-adjusted sales rose 5%, similar to the increases Yankee has experienced for the past several years. 
Turning to financing. NU had a significant amount of activity just prior to the merger closing. In March, NU parent sold $300 million of 18-month floating rate notes to refinance $263 million of 10-year notes that mature at April 1. The initial rate on those NU notes is 1.22%, so interest cost will be about 1/3 of what we had been paying on that series. 
CL&P re-marketed $62 million of tax exempt dilution control bonds, locking in an attractive 1.55% rate for the next 3 years. Over the balance of the year, the most significant refinancing involves $400 million of NSTAR Electric notes that mature this fall. The current coupon on those notes is 4.875%. We also expect small and new debt issuances at WMECO and Yankee Gas. 
You may have also seen that all 3 credit rating agencies completed their comprehensive reviews of NU and its subsidiaries around the closing of the merger. Some ratings on our system rose, some fell, but all ratings are now stable. Only one electric utility family, Southern Company, has a higher credit rating than NU. And we will continue to enjoy very strong access to low-cost capital. NSTAR Electric continues to have a very highly rated economical commercial paper program.
We currently have about $1.9 billion of credit lines, along with attractive active commercial paper programs in NSTAR Electric and NSTAR LLC. Over the coming months, we will begin analyzing our capital requirements to determine where further savings can be realized as a result of the economies of financing a much larger, stronger and more liquid company. 
We also move ahead steadily on our integration work. While the merger was pending, we engaged 11 teams and 175 subject matter experts to focus on both day one requirements and develop a deep understanding of each company's operations and organization. 
During the week before the merger, we announced the next level of leadership, primarily at the officer level, and the next level beyond that will be announced in a few weeks. We're very encouraged by the quality of the team and by the teamwork that they're showing, confident that this merger will work and deliver the value to customers and investors that we have discussed for the past 18 months. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jeff for your questions."

When you look at both of these companies, NU and NSTAR and their track record, certainly, over the past 5 or 10 years, the performance has been well above industry average in terms of earnings growth, in terms of total shareholder return. So the new NU offers a very long track record of notable and consistent success for investors. What we'd like to do is make sure that we have the team in place, that we develop a plan, that we have broad consensus upon when we review that plan and get the endorsement of our board. And at that point in time, we will provide guidance to Wall Street of a plan that we're very confident and that we'll be able to achieve.

It could be a mitigated outcome that would take 15 months or it could be a settlement prior to that.

So I can see us doing a lot of work during the summer and coalescing on a plan that we have some consensus on the end of the summer into September potentially. So I consider maybe the options would be a September Analyst Day, where we could provide some insight as to the new company's prospects. Potentially, EEI is not far behind that.

And when they own it, they commit to deliver it. And we haven't missed too many estimates because of the process that we use. So that's why we're -- we don't want you to seem like we're too cautious. We're just in a mode here where we initially thought that we would have our management team all picked and in place and up and running by now. But because we had so much trouble getting this merger through the different gates, we sort of held off so that we wouldn't be in a situation of selecting certain executives, which meant you unselected others. And as a result, if it didn't go through, we would have had some broken China in the process. So we're a little bit behind. You have to be patient with us.

And I can tell you, I'm more excited now that I thought I'd be. We really do have a great opportunity here. And hopefully, I can share some thoughts with you on why I am so excited about this. 
This merger between the 2 largest New England-based utilities ensures that 3.5 million electric and gas customers are going to be served by a company whose only roots are here in New England. And as many of you know, I'm a nut about customer service. It means the policymakers in Boston, Hartford, Concord only have to look in their backyards to find the management of the largest regulated utility. And it means that the 3.5 million customers that we serve won't have to look too far to see a Northeast Utilities employee, since you all live right here in New England. 
In fact, I've been spending a lot of time going out to the field with town hall meetings talking to my linemen, talking to my troops to make sure they recognize that we are in the customer service business. That's my focus. But I need every one of those 9,000 strong to focus on the customers for us to be successful, and I think we're making some great progress.
But this company is much more than a regional energy provider. We're going to have the scale to manage a highly effective and efficient company, and I think you know I am a nut about efficiency also. And as a $11 billion to $12 billion market cap company, we're going to be able to access the capital markets on very attractive terms, better than we could do individually. But we can continue to make investments in wires and pipes that our customers and our communities need. 
We've married one of the nation's most reliable operators of electric distribution systems, with probably the most preeminent planner, designer, builder and operator of electric transmission systems. We also will operate 2 natural gas systems, serving 500,000 customers. But when we look at those franchises and those communities, we think there's probably twice that number of homes and businesses we can serve in the future. 
In an era when economic and environmental benefits of converting from heating oil to natural gas has never been greater, we hope to expand our pipeline infrastructure to really save a whole bunch of New Englanders, tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars annually so that we can put that back into the economies of our states. We have gas at $1.25 a gallon versus $4 heating oil. I think you can appreciate how many of our customers are begging us to expand our infrastructure. 
To our investors on the call, I think we offer a very attractive value proposition from 2 companies that have provided some attractive total returns over the last 5 to 7 years. We formed one larger cap utility, with a singular focus on energy delivery in New England, a market we know and understand. 
Over the past 10 years, NU and NSTAR have offered one of the most compelling dividend growth stories in the industry. And as you noticed yesterday, that dividend growth is continuing as we've promised at the beginning of this transaction to align the 2 companies' dividends. And so we've provided the legacy NU shareholders with a 16%, 17% increase. And yet, our payout ratio is still low for the industry, especially for someone who is a predominantly delivery company and preserves the potential for a pretty attractive dividend growth in the future. Also, it will allow us to reserve considerable capital to reinvest in accretive projects that our customers need regarding their reliability. 
Earlier today, the newly formed Board of Trustees of Northeast Utilities completed 2 days of meetings. Members of the board, who unanimously endorsed our merger when it was brought to them in October 2010, were, again, even more excited just like me as we talked about this great combination and the potential we have going forward. We believe that state policy holders and utility regulators share our views on how this can benefit the region. 
The settlements that produced this merger were announced enthusiastically by the Governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Participation in the negotiations of those settlement agreements by the states' attorneys general and high-level energy policymakers were a key to their success. We're thankful for their hard work in achieving a balanced outcome that treat all parties fairly. And over the next several weeks, the consumers will see the first of that in the form of $46 million of rate credits that flow out of these negotiated rate settlements. 
Additionally, we will begin and we have focused on the fact that we will now live through multi-year rate freezes that are in effect for most of our utilities, but do allow us to keep the benefits of our good work to offset the impact of rising costs and fixed delivery rates. We understand we need to implement efficiencies in our business processes, commonly referred to as synergies. But we also are immediately benefiting from reduced financing costs and lower cost of purchasing equipment and services. 
When NU and NSTAR shareholders overwhelmingly approved this transaction back in March of 2011, we had a vision of how attractive a merged company could become. Now we're -- it's up to us. And we are in the process of delivering on those commitments, and we're ready and excited about the opportunity. So that's all I want to say to open this up. 
And now let me turn it over to Lee to talk a little bit about our capital programs and some of our big projects."

Allow me to start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives, beginning with our NEEWS project. With extremely favorable weather that we have had to date, we're about 64% complete with the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. The project will provide an important new 40-mile pathway to move power reliably between Western Massachusetts and Connecticut. We continue to expect the projects to be completed by late 2013 at a cost of $718 million. Of that sum, $426 million was invested as of March 31.
Turning to the Interstate Reliability Project. You may recall that we filed our application with the Connecticut Siting Council in December. Last month, we completed 3 days of field reviews and 3 evenings of public hearings in Northeastern Connecticut on the project. ISO New England and we are updating the planning studies to reflect the latest available data and are scheduled to submit testimony in support of the project later this month. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in June, and we continue to expect a final decision in 2013.
While we were building the 40-mile, $218 million Connecticut section of this project, National Grid will build the Rhode Island and Massachusetts sections. After receiving updated planning studies from ISO New England later this month, we expect National Grid to file its siting application later this quarter and to receive final approval in late 2013. We continue to expect the project to enter service in late 2015. 
The final major element of NEEWS is the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. As we've mentioned earlier, ISO New England will review this project as part of a comprehensive study known as the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut study. We continue to expect ISO to issue a preliminary needs analysis and related transmission solutions next year.
Turning to NSTAR Electric. The most significant project in 2012 is a new 18-mile, 345-kV line to be built to Cape Cod. The project received final Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board approval in April, and we expect to complete the approximately $110 million project in the first quarter of 2013. Overall, we expect NSTAR Electric to invest approximately $190 million in transmission infrastructure in 2012.
When we consummated the merger last month, we also brought together the 2 owners of the Northern Pass Transmission Project. As a result, we have consolidated NSTAR's 25% investment in Northern Pass. So when we discuss the project's cost going forward, it will reflect 100% of the project. 
A Northern Pass project, a $1.1 billion, 180-mile primarily high voltage DC project to move 1,200 megawatts of clean power out of Québec and into Southern New Hampshire, continues to make progress. You may recall that 140 miles of the project would be built along existing rights-of-way. The other 40 miles in Northern New Hampshire is where we need to secure a new right-of-way. We continue to make good progress on securing the additional 40 miles and plan to present a new route to federal regulators in the third quarter of this year. That would support the start of construction in 2014 and completing it by the end of 2016.
Earlier this year, Governor Lynch signed legislation that would prohibit the use of imminent domain for transmission projects that are not subject to regional cost allocation, but we continue to believe we can secure a right-of-way without using imminent domain. This line remains the most innovative proposal now before regulators to appreciably lower both the cost of electricity and the amount of carbon emissions in New England. It also would provide Hydro-Québec an important new pathway to move power into New England from its generation now under construction in Central and Northern Québec. 
NU's transmission capital expenditures totaled $137 million in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $68 million in the first quarter of 2011. For the year, including NSTAR's expenditures, we project approximately $675 million of transmission capital expenditures, included in work on Northern Pass.
Turning from transmission to generation. PSNH is near completion of the secondary wastewater handling facilities associated with the Clean Air Project of Merrimack Station. This is the last major segment of the project. We continue to project the total expenditures of $422 million, about $35 million below budget. The wet scrubber has been operating well since last September, and the results have been excellent. We have seen a 97% to 98% reduction in mercury emissions and a 96% to 98% reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions, well beyond our initial projections. 
On April 16, 2012, we began collecting a significant portion of the carrying cost on the Clean Air Project through a Public Utility Commission-approved temporary rates, and we expect New Hampshire regulators to review the prudence of the project over the balance of this year. Given the fact that we are completing the project well below budget and with very favorable emission reduction results, we believe that the Public Utility Commission review will reach a favorable conclusion, and the scrubber costs will be fully recoverable with our allowed 9.81% return on equity on our generating assets. 
Our electric distribution reliability was strong across all 3 states in the first quarter due to our continued investment, ongoing preventative maintenance and the lack of storm activity. CL&P, PSNH and WMECO invested a combined $125 million in distribution capital from the first quarter of 2012 compared with $98 million in the first quarter of 2011. For the merged company, we expect to invest a total of approximately $1.7 billion in our infrastructure in 2012. 
Turning to our natural gas distribution business. We saw 2 impacts in the first quarter. The first and most apparent impact was the decline in sales due to the very mild winter. Yankee Gas firm sales were off by 13.2% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with 2011. The continued fuel switching among all classes of customers meant that weather-adjusted Yankee Gas sales continued to rise by 5% annually as they have over the past several years. Between Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas more than 4,000 residential units were converted to natural gas in 2011, more than double the previous year. 
We continue to see significant opportunities ahead. Together, Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas have approximately 500,000 customers. About 38,000 of our residential customers have gas in their home but do not use it for space heating. Now the 90,000 customers are located within 150 feet of our gas mains, but they are not connected to our system. With natural gas priced at less than half the cost of oil on a BTU basis, we expect solid growth going forward as customers switch to a much less expensive and more environmentally friendly fuel source. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

Let me start by saying how pleased I am to speak to you all today as Northeast Utilities' Chief Financial Officer. Before beginning with my formal remarks, I want to reiterate earlier comments about how pleased we all are that we're able to merge these 2 companies into the new NU. We have tremendous opportunities available to enhance the benefits we can bring to our customers and our region while simultaneously creating very attractive value for our investors. 
There's several areas I want to focus on before we turn to your questions. The first area involves the settlements we reached in Massachusetts and Connecticut that moved us to the regulatory approval. The second will be our financial results for the first quarter, the expected impact of the merger on our second quarter results and the state of our region's economy. The third area involves financings we have accomplished thus far this year and what we project for the balance of the year. And lastly, I want to discuss the work we are now undertaking to create a high-performing, customer-responsive and cost-efficient merged organization. 
I'll start with the merger settlements that Tom touched on a little earlier. In Massachusetts, we reached 2 comprehensive settlements, one with both the attorney general and the State Department of Energy resources, and the other exclusively with the DOER. The 3-party settlement incorporated several key provisions. 
First, it freezes base distribution rates through 2015 for NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and Western Mass Electric Company. Second, it provides a $21 million rate credit to customers in the current billing cycle. That's $15 million for NSTAR Electric customers and $3 million each for NSTAR Gas and Western Mass customers. 
While base delivery rates are frozen, this settlement continues to allow NSTAR Electric's recovery of loss base revenues that result from energy efficiency programs. It also allows all 3 companies pension trackers to continue functioning. And for Western Mass Electric Company, revenue decoupling mechanism that was approved in its most recent case will remain in place.
NSTAR Electric's 2011 major storm costs, which total $38 million, will be recovered over 5 years beginning January 1, 2014, while Western Mass' storm costs will be subject to the recovery mechanism allowed in its rate case. As is typical, these storm recoveries are subject to DPU approval.
Under the other Massachusetts settlement with the DOER, NSTAR Electric will execute a 15-year contract with Cape Wind for up to 129 megawatts of power, which equates to 27.5% of Cape Wind's projected output. Costs associated with that contract will be recovered from customers. And as permitted by statute, NSTAR Electric will be allowed a 4% remuneration to offset any balance sheet impacts. 
NSTAR Electric also agreed to increase energy efficiency targets, procure up to 10 megawatts of new solar generation and implement an electric vehicle pilot program. These initiatives will contribute significantly to meeting the state's energy policy goals.
Connecticut settlement was similar to our Massachusetts settlement in some ways and different in others. Both support each respective state's priorities. Under the Connecticut settlement, CL&P will provide a $25 million rate credit to customers in the current billing cycle and will freeze base distribution rates until December 2014. 
CL&P also agreed to fund $15 million of state energy initiatives to forgo recovery of $40 million of deferred storm costs from tropical storm Irene and the devastating October snowstorm. Importantly, the agreement will allow CL&P to recover storm costs following a prudence review over a 6-year period beginning December 1, 2014. We believe having a known recovery period over a reasonable number of years was a positive outcome from the settlement. 
Separately, CL&P agreed to propose a multi-year $300 million system resiliency program to regulators, about $100 million of which we expect to spend between 2013 and 2014. We will recover the full revenue requirements associated with this program through a tracking charge on customers' bills. Up to $25 million of the associated revenue requirements will be recovered during 2013 and 2014. 
We believe this was an important and positive condition in the settlement. Our 2 operating utilities that are not covered by these rate settlements, Public Service of New Hampshire and Yankee Gas, are currently operating under multi-year rate case decisions. PSNH's rate plan goes through mid-2015. Under last summer's rate case decision, Yankee Gas will implement a rate increase of approximately $7 million this July 1.
The impact of all these settlements is that we undertake the significant task of merging our operations. And as we do that, we can do so without the distraction and cost of preparing, filing, testifying at and otherwise supporting distribution rate cases. This will be very helpful as we create a merged organization that can instead totally focus on providing significant benefits to New England's energy consumers and a very attractive value proposition to our investors.
Many on this call know that during the hearings in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, David McHale and I testified that our net benefit analysis indicated that there would be nearly $1 billion of savings over the first 10 years of the merger. Our focus now is to realize these savings and potentially more.
The work that will underlie future financial projections is underway, and we expect to provide you with a comprehensive update either at an Analyst Day or at our traditional EEI breakfast during the fall. As we stated during the merger hearings, we believe that the savings estimates will prove to be conservative. 
So what does that mean for 2012? I will discuss the first quarter results in a moment. Second quarter results, which have traditionally been the weakest of the year for both NU and NSTAR, this year will also include the nonrecurring impact of the merger settlement agreements that I noted earlier. In addition, we will recognize other merger-related nonrecurring costs such as financial advisory fees and costs related to change of control agreements affecting a number of offices. As a result, we believe that the second half of 2012 rather than the first half of the year will provide you with more representative basis from which you will be able to measure our financial progress in the years to come.
Turning to the first quarter, I will briefly discuss NU's stand-alone results. NU earned $99.3 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of the year compared with $114.2 million or $0.64 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Distribution earnings declined by $21.5 million or $0.12 per share from $78.2 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $56.7 million in the first quarter of 2012. 
Connecticut Light and Power, Public Service of New Hampshire and Yankee all experienced distribution earnings declines due to the exceptionally mild weather and higher pension costs. Of that $0.12 decline, about $0.07 were due to the weather. 
Compared with the first quarter of 2011, heating degree days in 2012 were down 23.4% at Bradley Airport in Northern Connecticut and down 19.2% in Concord, New Hampshire. In fact, the first quarter of 2012 was the warmest on record in Hartford, in Boston and in Concord. 
In Hartford, the average temperature was 38.2 degrees in the first quarter of 2012 compared with an average of 31.3 degrees from the previous record from 1998, which was 36.3 degrees. So weather records were absolutely shattered in this first quarter with the extremely mild temperatures.
Another $0.03 of the earnings decline from 2011 were due primarily to higher pension and other employee benefit costs, and that impact is very consistent with the comments David McHale made in February when we projected that higher untracked pension and health care costs will result in an annualized $0.10 decline in NU's stand-alone earnings in 2012. 
It's worth noting that WMECO, which has both revenue decoupling and a pension tracker, experienced a modest $400,000 increase in first quarter earnings. Offsetting these negative items was a $7.2 million decline in merger-related costs from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, transmission earnings rose by $1.6 million or about 3.6% due to a near doubling of WMECO's transmission earnings related to the construction progress on the Greater Springfield Project that Lee referenced earlier. 
Based on my comments, I'm sure you can surmise that we view 2012 as a transition year. From an earnings perspective, it's a year when we record almost all the costs related to the merger. And due to the timing of the closing, it's a year when the benefits of the merger on recurring earnings will only be modestly apparent.
Although we're not ready to provide you with 2013 guidance at this time, there are a number of factors that we believe will provide significantly better results next year. First, we estimate that a return of normal first quarter weather in 2013 should restore $0.06 per share to NU's earnings. 
Second, we continue to expect much of the incremental 2012 pension costs to fully reverse in 2013 as a result of increased pension contributions, asset performance, a similar discount rate and lower amortizations on prior year actuarial losses. 
Third, as the Greater Springfield Reliability Project and Cape Cod line are built out, we expect strong transmission earnings growth in 2013. On the merged company basis, we had about $3.8 billion of transmission rate base at the end of 2011. We expect that to rise to $4.1 billion by the end of this year and $4.4 billion by the end of 2013. 
Fourth, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to be able to reduce our operating costs as we implement cost efficiencies and merger synergies. 
Finally, we expect to see the benefits of an improving economy. Overall, I would characterize our economy as improving and still better than the rest of the country. The Boston area unemployment rate is now 5.5%. New Hampshire rate is down to 5.2%. Connecticut's unemployment rate of 7.7%, and Western Mass' rate of 7.3% are somewhat higher but they are still well below the national average of 8.2%.
Both initial and continued unemployment claims are down in all 3 states, and building permits in the first 2 months of 2012 were up by more than 125% in both Massachusetts and Connecticut over 2011 levels, helped somewhat by the mild weather this year. 
We saw some of that economic impact in our first quarter sales. PSNH weather-adjusted sales rose 0.5% in the first quarter compared with last year, and CL&P and WMECO's weather-adjusted sales were essentially flat compared with sales declines in most recent years. Yankee Gas' weather-adjusted sales rose 5%, similar to the increases Yankee has experienced for the past several years. 
Turning to financing. NU had a significant amount of activity just prior to the merger closing. In March, NU parent sold $300 million of 18-month floating rate notes to refinance $263 million of 10-year notes that mature at April 1. The initial rate on those NU notes is 1.22%, so interest cost will be about 1/3 of what we had been paying on that series. 
CL&P re-marketed $62 million of tax exempt dilution control bonds, locking in an attractive 1.55% rate for the next 3 years. Over the balance of the year, the most significant refinancing involves $400 million of NSTAR Electric notes that mature this fall. The current coupon on those notes is 4.875%. We also expect small and new debt issuances at WMECO and Yankee Gas. 
You may have also seen that all 3 credit rating agencies completed their comprehensive reviews of NU and its subsidiaries around the closing of the merger. Some ratings on our system rose, some fell, but all ratings are now stable. Only one electric utility family, Southern Company, has a higher credit rating than NU. And we will continue to enjoy very strong access to low-cost capital. NSTAR Electric continues to have a very highly rated economical commercial paper program.
We currently have about $1.9 billion of credit lines, along with attractive active commercial paper programs in NSTAR Electric and NSTAR LLC. Over the coming months, we will be analyzing our capital requirements to determine where further savings can be realized as a result of the economies of financing a much larger, stronger and more liquid company. 
We also move ahead steadily on our integration work. While the merger was pending, we engaged 11 teams and 175 subject matter experts to focus on both day one requirements and develop a deep understanding of each company's operations and organization. 
During the week before the merger, we announced the next level of leadership, primarily at the officer level, and the next level beyond that will be announced in a few weeks. We're very encouraged by the quality of the team and by the teamwork that they're showing, confident that this merger will work and deliver the value to customers and investors that we have discussed for the past 18 months. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jeff for your questions."

When you look at both of these companies, NU and NSTAR and their track record, certainly, over the past 5 or 10 years, the performance has been well above industry average in terms of earnings growth, in terms of total shareholder return. So the new NU offers a very long track record of notable and consistent success for investors. What we'd like to do is make sure that we have the team in place, that we develop a plan, that we have broad consensus upon, we review that plan and get the endorsement of our board.

And I can tell you, I'm more excited now that I thought I'd be. We really do have a great opportunity here. And hopefully, I can share some thoughts with you on why I am so excited about this. 
This merger between the 2 largest New England-based utilities ensures that 3.5 million electric and gas customers are going to be served by a company whose only roots are here in New England. And as many of you know, I'm a nut about customer service. It means the policymakers in Boston, Hartford, Concord only have to look in their backyards to find the management of the largest regulated utility. And it means that the 3.5 million customers that we serve won't have to look too far to see a Northeast Utilities employee, since you all live right here in New England. 
In fact, I've been spending a lot of time going out to the field with town hall meetings talking to my linemen, talking to my troops to make sure they recognize that we are in the customer service business. That's my focus. But I need every one of those 9,000 strong to focus on the customers for us to be successful, and I think we're making some great progress.
But this company is much more than a regional energy provider. We're going to have the scale to manage a highly effective and efficient company, and I think you know I am a nut about efficiency also. And as a $11 billion to $12 billion market cap company, we're going to be able to access the capital markets on very attractive terms, better than we could do individually. But we can continue to make investments in wires and pipes that our customers and our communities need. 
We've married one of the nation's most reliable operators of electric distribution systems, with probably the most preeminent planner, designer, builder and operator of electric transmission systems. We also will operate 2 natural gas systems, serving 500,000 customers. But when we look at those franchises and those communities, we think there's probably twice that number of homes and businesses we can serve in the future. 
In an era when economic and environmental benefits of converting from heating oil to natural gas has never been greater, we hope to expand our pipeline infrastructure to really save a whole bunch of New Englanders, tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars annually so that we can put that back into the economies of our states. We have gas at $1.25 a gallon versus $4 heating oil. I think you can appreciate how many of our customers are begging us to expand our infrastructure. 
To our investors on the call, I think we offer a very attractive value proposition from 2 companies that have provided some attractive total returns over the last 5 to 7 years. We formed one larger cap utility, with a singular focus on energy delivery in New England, a market we know and understand. 
Over the past 10 years, NU and NSTAR have offered one of the most compelling dividend growth stories in the industry. And as you noticed yesterday, that dividend growth is continuing as we've promised at the beginning of this transaction to align the 2 companies' dividends. And so we've provided the legacy NU shareholders with a 16%, 17% increase. And yet, our payout ratio is still low for the industry, especially for someone who is a predominantly delivery company and preserves the potential for a pretty attractive dividend growth in the future. Also, it will allow us to reserve considerable capital to reinvest in accretive projects that our customers need regarding their reliability. 
Earlier today, the newly formed Board of Trustees of Northeast Utilities completed 2 days of meetings. Members of the board, who unanimously endorsed our merger when it was brought to them in October 2010, were, again, even more excited just like me as we talked about this great combination and the potential we have going forward. We believe that state policy holders and utility regulators share our views on how this can benefit the region. 
The settlements that produced this merger were announced enthusiastically by the Governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Participation in the negotiations of those settlement agreements by the states' attorneys general and high-level energy policymakers were a key to their success. We're thankful for their hard work in achieving a balanced outcome that treat all parties fairly. And over the next several weeks, the consumers will see the first of that in the form of $46 million of rate credits that flow out of these negotiated rate settlements. 
Additionally, we will begin and we have focused on the fact that we will now live through multi-year rate freezes that are in effect for most of our utilities, but do allow us to keep the benefits of our good work to offset the impact of rising costs and fixed delivery rates. We understand we need to implement efficiencies in our business processes, commonly referred to as synergies. But we also are immediately benefiting from reduced financing costs and lower cost of purchasing equipment and services. 
When NU and NSTAR shareholders overwhelmingly approved this transaction back in March of 2011, we had a vision of how attractive a merged company could become. Now we're -- it's up to us. And we are in the process of delivering on those commitments, and we're ready and excited about the opportunity. So that's all I want to say to open this up. 
And now let me turn it over to Lee to talk a little bit about our capital programs and some of our big projects."
292525,204862889,297401,"Northeast Utilities, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Allow me to start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives, beginning with our NEEWS project.

Allow me to start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives, beginning with our NEEWS project. With extremely favorable weather that we have had to date, we're about 64% complete with the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. The project will provide an important new 40-mile pathway to move power reliably between Western Massachusetts and Connecticut. We continue to expect the projects to be completed by late 2013 at a cost of $718 million. Of that sum, $426 million was invested as of March 31.
Turning to the Interstate Reliability Project. You may recall that we filed our application with the Connecticut Siting Council in December. Last month, we completed 3 days of field reviews and 3 evenings of public hearings in Northeastern Connecticut on the project. ISO New England and we are updating the planning studies to reflect the latest available data and are scheduled to submit testimony in support of the project later this month. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in June, and we continue to expect a final decision in 2013.
While we were building the 40-mile, $218 million Connecticut section of this project, National Grid will build the Rhode Island and Massachusetts sections. After receiving updated planning studies from ISO New England later this month, we expect National Grid to file its siting application later this quarter and to receive final approval in late 2013. We continue to expect the project to enter service in late 2015. 
The final major element of NEEWS is the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. As we've mentioned earlier, ISO New England will review this project as part of a comprehensive study known as the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut study. We continue to expect ISO to issue a preliminary needs analysis and related transmission solutions next year.
Turning to NSTAR Electric. The most significant project in 2012 is a new 18-mile, 345-kV line to be built to Cape Cod. The project received final Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board approval in April, and we expect to complete the approximately $110 million project in the first quarter of 2013. Overall, we expect NSTAR Electric to invest approximately $190 million in transmission infrastructure in 2012.
When we consummated the merger last month, we also brought together the 2 owners of the Northern Pass Transmission Project. As a result, we have consolidated NSTAR's 25% investment in Northern Pass. So when we discuss the project's cost going forward, it will reflect 100% of the project. 
A Northern Pass project, a $1.1 billion, 180-mile primarily high voltage DC project to move 1,200 megawatts of clean power out of Québec and into Southern New Hampshire, continues to make progress. You may recall that 140 miles of the project would be built along existing rights-of-way. The other 40 miles in Northern New Hampshire is where we need to secure a new right-of-way. We continue to make good progress on securing the additional 40 miles and plan to present a new route to federal regulators in the third quarter of this year. That would support the start of construction in 2014 and completing it by the end of 2016.
Earlier this year, Governor Lynch signed legislation that would prohibit the use of imminent domain for transmission projects that are not subject to regional cost allocation, but we continue to believe we can secure a right-of-way without using imminent domain. This line remains the most innovative proposal now before regulators to appreciably lower both the cost of electricity and the amount of carbon emissions in New England. It also would provide Hydro-Québec an important new pathway to move power into New England from its generation now under construction in Central and Northern Québec. 
NU's transmission capital expenditures totaled $137 million in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $68 million in the first quarter of 2011. For the year, including NSTAR's expenditures, we project approximately $675 million of transmission capital expenditures, included in work on Northern Pass.
Turning from transmission to generation. PSNH is near completion of the secondary wastewater handling facilities associated with the Clean Air Project of Merrimack Station. This is the last major segment of the project. We continue to project the total expenditures of $422 million, about $35 million below budget. The wet scrubber has been operating well since last September, and the results have been excellent. We have seen a 97% to 98% reduction in mercury emissions and a 96% to 98% reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions, well beyond our initial projections. 
On April 16, 2012, we began collecting a significant portion of the carrying cost on the Clean Air Project through a Public Utility Commission-approved temporary rates, and we expect New Hampshire regulators to review the prudence of the project over the balance of this year. Given the fact that we are completing the project well below budget and with very favorable emission reduction results, we believe that the Public Utility Commission review will reach a favorable conclusion, and the scrubber costs will be fully recoverable with our allowed 9.81% return on equity on our generating assets. 
Our electric distribution reliability was strong across all 3 states in the first quarter due to our continued investment, ongoing preventative maintenance and the lack of storm activity. CL&P, PSNH and WMECO invested a combined $125 million in distribution capital from the first quarter of 2012 compared with $98 million in the first quarter of 2011. For the merged company, we expect to invest a total of approximately $1.7 billion in our infrastructure in 2012. 
Turning to our natural gas distribution business. We saw 2 impacts in the first quarter. The first and most apparent impact was the decline in sales due to the very mild winter. Yankee Gas firm sales were off by 13.2% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with 2011. The continued fuel switching among all classes of customers meant that weather-adjusted Yankee Gas sales continued to rise by 5% annually as they have over the past several years. Between Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas more than 4,000 residential units were converted to natural gas in 2011, more than double the previous year. 
We continue to see significant opportunities ahead. Together, Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas have approximately 500,000 customers. About 38,000 of our residential customers have gas in their home but do not use it for space heating. Now the 90,000 customers are located within 150 feet of our gas mains, but they are not connected to our system. With natural gas priced at less than half the cost of oil on a BTU basis, we expect solid growth going forward as customers switch to a much less expensive and more environmentally friendly fuel source. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."

Let me start by saying how pleased I am to speak to you all today as Northeast Utilities' Chief Financial Officer. Before beginning with my formal remarks, I want to reiterate earlier comments about how pleased we all are that we're able to merge these 2 companies into the new NU. We have tremendous opportunities available to enhance the benefits we can bring to our customers and our region while simultaneously creating very attractive value for our investors. 
There's several areas I want to focus on before we turn to your questions. The first area involves the settlements we reached in Massachusetts and Connecticut that moved us to the regulatory approval. The second will be our financial results for the first quarter, the expected impact of the merger on our second quarter results and the state of our region's economy. The third area involves financings we have accomplished thus far this year and what we project for the balance of the year. And lastly, I want to discuss the work we are now undertaking to create a high-performing, customer-responsive and cost-efficient merged organization. 
I'll start with the merger settlements that Tom touched on a little earlier. In Massachusetts, we reached 2 comprehensive settlements, one with both the attorney general and the State Department of Energy resources, and the other exclusively with the DOER. The 3-party settlement incorporated several key provisions. 
First, it freezes base distribution rates through 2015 for NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and Western Mass Electric Company. Second, it provides a $21 million rate credit to customers in the current billing cycle. That's $15 million for NSTAR Electric customers and $3 million each for NSTAR Gas and Western Mass customers. 
While base delivery rates are frozen, this settlement continues to allow NSTAR Electric's recovery of loss base revenues that result from energy efficiency programs. It also allows all 3 companies pension trackers to continue functioning. And for Western Mass Electric Company, revenue decoupling mechanism that was approved in its most recent case will remain in place.
NSTAR Electric's 2011 major storm costs, which total $38 million, will be recovered over 5 years beginning January 1, 2014, while Western Mass' storm costs will be subject to the recovery mechanism allowed in its rate case. As is typical, these storm recoveries are subject to DPU approval.
Under the other Massachusetts settlement with the DOER, NSTAR Electric will execute a 15-year contract with Cape Wind for up to 129 megawatts of power, which equates to 27.5% of Cape Wind's projected output. Costs associated with that contract will be recovered from customers. And as permitted by statute, NSTAR Electric will be allowed a 4% remuneration to offset any balance sheet impacts. 
NSTAR Electric also agreed to increase energy efficiency targets, procure up to 10 megawatts of new solar generation and implement an electric vehicle pilot program. These initiatives will contribute significantly to meeting the state's energy policy goals.
Connecticut settlement was similar to our Massachusetts settlement in some ways and different in others. Both support each respective state's priorities. Under the Connecticut settlement, CL&P will provide a $25 million rate credit to customers in the current billing cycle and will freeze base distribution rates until December 2014. 
CL&P also agreed to fund $15 million of state energy initiatives to forgo recovery of $40 million of deferred storm costs from tropical storm Irene and the devastating October snowstorm. Importantly, the agreement will allow CL&P to recover storm costs following a prudence review over a 6-year period beginning December 1, 2014. We believe having a known recovery period over a reasonable number of years was a positive outcome from the settlement. 
Separately, CL&P agreed to propose a multi-year $300 million system resiliency program to regulators, about $100 million of which we expect to spend between 2013 and 2014. We will recover the full revenue requirements associated with this program through a tracking charge on customers' bills. Up to $25 million of the associated revenue requirements will be recovered during 2013 and 2014. 
We believe this was an important and positive condition in the settlement. Our 2 operating utilities that are not covered by these rate settlements, Public Service of New Hampshire and Yankee Gas, are currently operating under multi-year rate case decisions. PSNH's rate plan goes through mid-2015. Under last summer's rate case decision, Yankee Gas will implement a rate increase of approximately $7 million this July 1.
The impact of all these settlements is that we undertake the significant task of merging our operations. And as we do that, we can do so without the distraction and cost of preparing, filing, testifying at and otherwise supporting distribution rate cases. This will be very helpful as we create a merged organization that can instead totally focus on providing significant benefits to New England's energy consumers and a very attractive value proposition to our investors.
Many on this call know that during the hearings in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, David McHale and I testified that our net benefit analysis indicated that there would be nearly $1 billion of savings over the first 10 years of the merger. Our focus now is to realize these savings and potentially more.
The work that will underlie future financial projections is underway, and we expect to provide you with a comprehensive update either at an Analyst Day or at our traditional EEI breakfast during the fall. As we stated during the merger hearings, we believe that the savings estimates will prove to be conservative. 
So what does that mean for 2012? I will discuss the first quarter results in a moment. Second quarter results, which have traditionally been the weakest of the year for both NU and NSTAR, this year will also include the nonrecurring impact of the merger settlement agreements that I noted earlier. In addition, we will recognize other merger-related nonrecurring costs such as financial advisory fees and costs related to change of control agreements affecting a number of offices. As a result, we believe that the second half of 2012 rather than the first half of the year will provide you with more representative basis from which you will be able to measure our financial progress in the years to come.
Turning to the first quarter, I will briefly discuss NU's stand-alone results. NU earned $99.3 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of the year compared with $114.2 million or $0.64 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Distribution earnings declined by $21.5 million or $0.12 per share from $78.2 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $56.7 million in the first quarter of 2012. 
Connecticut Light and Power, Public Service of New Hampshire and Yankee all experienced distribution earnings declines due to the exceptionally mild weather and higher pension costs. Of that $0.12 decline, about $0.07 were due to the weather. 
Compared with the first quarter of 2011, heating degree days in 2012 were down 23.4% at Bradley Airport in Northern Connecticut and down 19.2% in Concord, New Hampshire. In fact, the first quarter of 2012 was the warmest on record in Hartford, in Boston and in Concord. 
In Hartford, the average temperature was 38.2 degrees in the first quarter of 2012 compared with an average of 31.3 degrees from the previous record from 1998, which was 36.3 degrees. So weather records were absolutely shattered in this first quarter with the extremely mild temperatures.
Another $0.03 of the earnings decline from 2011 were due primarily to higher pension and other employee benefit costs, and that impact is very consistent with the comments David McHale made in February when we projected that higher untracked pension and health care costs will result in an annualized $0.10 decline in NU's stand-alone earnings in 2012. 
It's worth noting that WMECO, which has both revenue decoupling and a pension tracker, experienced a modest $400,000 increase in first quarter earnings. Offsetting these negative items was a $7.2 million decline in merger-related costs from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, transmission earnings rose by $1.6 million or about 3.6% due to a near doubling of WMECO's transmission earnings related to the construction progress on the Greater Springfield Project that Lee referenced earlier. 
Based on my comments, I'm sure you can surmise that we view 2012 as a transition year. From an earnings perspective, it's a year when we record almost all the costs related to the merger. And due to the timing of the closing, it's a year when the benefits of the merger on recurring earnings will only be modestly apparent.
Although we're not ready to provide you with 2013 guidance at this time, there are a number of factors that we believe will provide significantly better results next year. First, we estimate that a return of normal first quarter weather in 2013 should restore $0.06 per share to NU's earnings. 
Second, we continue to expect much of the incremental 2012 pension costs to fully reverse in 2013 as a result of increased pension contributions, asset performance, a similar discount rate and lower amortizations on prior year actuarial losses. 
Third, as the Greater Springfield Reliability Project and Cape Cod line are built out, we expect strong transmission earnings growth in 2013. On the merged company basis, we had about $3.8 billion of transmission rate base at the end of 2011. We expect that to rise to $4.1 billion by the end of this year and $4.4 billion by the end of 2013. 
Fourth, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to be able to reduce our operating costs as we implement cost efficiencies and merger synergies. 
Finally, we expect to see the benefits of an improving economy. Overall, I would characterize our economy as improving and still better than the rest of the country. The Boston area unemployment rate is now 5.5%. New Hampshire rate is down to 5.2%. Connecticut's unemployment rate of 7.7%, and Western Mass' rate of 7.3% are somewhat higher but they are still well below the national average of 8.2%.
Both initial and continued unemployment claims are down in all 3 states, and building permits in the first 2 months of 2012 were up by more than 125% in both Massachusetts and Connecticut over 2011 levels, helped somewhat by the mild weather this year. 
We saw some of that economic impact in our first quarter sales. PSNH weather-adjusted sales rose 0.5% in the first quarter compared with last year, and CL&P and WMECO's weather-adjusted sales were essentially flat compared with sales declines in most recent years. Yankee Gas' weather-adjusted sales rose 5%, similar to the increases Yankee has experienced for the past several years. 
Turning to financing. NU had a significant amount of activity just prior to the merger closing. In March, NU parent sold $300 million of 18-month floating rate notes to refinance $263 million of 10-year notes that mature at April 1. The initial rate on those NU notes is 1.22%, so interest cost will be about 1/3 of what we had been paying on that series. 
CL&P re-marketed $62 million of tax exempt dilution control bonds, locking in an attractive 1.55% rate for the next 3 years. Over the balance of the year, the most significant refinancing involves $400 million of NSTAR Electric notes that mature this fall. The current coupon on those notes is 4.875%. We also expect small and new debt issuances at WMECO and Yankee Gas. 
You may have also seen that all 3 credit rating agencies completed their comprehensive reviews of NU and its subsidiaries around the closing of the merger. Some ratings on our system rose, some fell, but all ratings are now stable. Only one electric utility family, Southern Company, has a higher credit rating than NU. And we will continue to enjoy very strong access to low-cost capital. NSTAR Electric continues to have a very highly rated economical commercial paper program.
We currently have about $1.9 billion of credit lines, along with attractive active commercial paper programs in NSTAR Electric and NSTAR LLC. Over the coming months, we will be analyzing our capital requirements to determine where further savings can be realized as a result of the economies of financing a much larger, stronger and more liquid company. 
We also move ahead steadily on our integration work. While the merger was pending, we engaged 11 teams and 175 subject matter experts to focus on both day one requirements and develop a deep understanding of each company's operations and organization. 
During the week before the merger, we announced the next level of leadership, primarily at the officer level, and the next level beyond that will be announced in a few weeks. We're very encouraged by the quality of the team and by the teamwork that they're showing, confident that this merger will work and deliver the value to customers and investors that we have discussed for the past 18 months.

And apparently, Commissioner Moeller who dissented actually agreed, so we're not going to speculate on our response. It's too early to predict an outcome. It could be a litigated outcome that would take 15 months or it could be a settlement prior to that. What I would point out is that we have a very good track record in both arenas, litigated cases, as well as rate settlements.

First, I want to say that we're very pleased with the results for the first quarter as a merged company. We achieved the financial results we have targeted, experienced very strong operational results, made significant progress on our capital projects and made a strong start in integrating the 2 companies and achieving the synergies that will discuss with you. 
For first time, NU's financial results include NSTAR's results for operation. As you can see from the earnings news release we issued yesterday, we are providing results in some granularity. We also want to ensure that we provide enough detail so that you can identify our onetime merger-related costs in the quarter, including $46 million of customer made credits, as well as identifying our earnings on a recurring basis. We hope you find this clear and helpful. 
In addition to the financial results, I will also cover key legislative and regulatory issues, including the recent draft decision from the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority regarding our storm restoration efforts in Connecticut last year. The third area I will cover is the progress we have made in the financing arena with regards to new credit facilities and related commercial paper programs that we'll put in place just lastly. Lastly, I will briefly discuss the on-going integration process that is well underway as he moved forward in creating a high-performing customer responsive and efficient organization. 
Let me start with a brief discussion of our second quarter results. Excluding merger-related costs, we earned $0.45 per share this year compared to $0.44 last year. There were several items that contributed to this $0.01 change, which equates to about a 2.3% earnings increase. 
First, the addition of NSTAR to NU's reported results at a very positive impact NSTAR Electric distribution and transmission operations contributed approximately $0.19 to the quarter's results. However, the impact of these earnings was exactly offset by the higher level of shares outstanding, which increased to 314 million shares from NU's 177 million shares last year as a result of the merger. 
Second, transmission earnings from CL&P, public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass together increased the quarter's results by about $0.05 per share and reflect our continued investment and transmission infrastructure. That increase occurred primarily in Western Mass where earnings more than doubled this quarter as a result of the phase of investment in the Greater Springfield project. NU parent and other company earnings also had a positive impact on the quarter, contributing about $0.03 per share versus 2011. Reflecting NSTAR communications earnings, as well as lower interest expense at the parent. 
Factors that of a negative impact on the quarter included an increase in O&M costs, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. That decline was due primarily to higher non-tracked pension and health care costs. And increasing other operating costs primarily related to higher depreciation and amortization and higher property taxes reduced earnings by another $0.03 per share. A decline in electric sales reduced earnings by $0.01 per share and can be largely attributable to successfully implementation of various energy efficiency programs. And lastly, higher interest expense cost us another $0.01 per share. These results where very much in line with our internal expectations and spot on with Wall Street's estimate for the quarter. 
While we do not plan to provide specific guidance for the second half of this year, we are comfortable with consensus earnings forecast for us for the second half of 2012. However, we believe that the split between quarters, which averages $0.56 per quarter -- excuse me, $0.56 per share in the third quarter and $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter does not take into consideration NSTAR's historic quarterly earnings patent, during which the third quarter typically accounted for 35% to 40% of the company's annual earnings. 
So going forward, Northeast Utilities postmerger earnings would be more weighted towards the third quarter than the fourth. 
As we've said in the past, we view 2012 as a transition year. From an earnings perspective, it's a year when earnings -- NSTAR earnings are only included in that NU consolidated results for 3 quarters of the year. We will have recorded nearly all the costs related to the merger and related regulatory settlement. However, the benefits of the merger on recurring earnings will only be modestly apparent as we early on our integration. Earnings drivers for the second half of the year include continued investment in our transmission business, a $7 million distribution rate increase for Yankee Gas that became effective July 1 of this year, a distribution rate increase to public service in New Hampshire also effective July 1, that includes $7 million for the recovery of infrastructure cost, continued higher pension and postretirement benefit cost that Connecticut Light and Power public service New Hampshire distribution and Yankee Gas. Weather impacts, additional training, emergency preparedness and barring cost at Connecticut Light and Power that resulted from the 2011 storms and subsequent commitments that we made. You can see the impact of these higher costs on Connecticut Light and Power's year-to-date distribution results and largely in line with our expectations. 
Also, another earnings driver for the second half of the year will include synergy savings from the merger. Before moving on to a discussion of the economy, I'd like to mentione a couple of positive rate developments of customers, public service in New Hampshire, NSTAR Electric and Western Mass. Effective July 1st of this year, the energy service rate for customers of public service in New Hampshire declined 18%, while the basic service rates for customers of NSTAR Electric and Western Mass declined 16% and 4% respectively. A good example of how low natural gas prices are benefiting our customers. 
At the halfway point of 2012, I would still characterize the economy in the states we serve as improving and better than the rest of the country. Unemployment rates continue be favorably last year. The New Hampshire rate is down to 5% compared to 5.5% at this time last year. The Massachusetts rate is now at 6% compared to 7.4% last year. And Connecticut's unemployment rate is 8.1% versus 8.9% last year, all of which is still below the national average of 8.2%. 
Initial and continued employment claims continue to decline in all 3 states also housing permits are up significantly in each of the 3 states, most notably in Connecticut. And the legislative and regulatory front there were several items pending. First, on June 4, the Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court ordered the Massachusetts' Department of Public Utilities to vacate its earlier order that prohibited NSTAR Electric from fully recovering bad debt expense associated with basic service. We view this as a positive development and await future action DPU on the issue. This development did not have an impact on our second quarter results because it is a tentative decision and there was more process involved before the ultimate outcome is determined by the DPU. 
The second item is one that you're familiar with, it involves a complaint filed by a number of parties of the current base return on equities earned by New England transmission owners. That complaint was filed with Perk. 3 months ago, the issued an order establishing hearing and settlement procedures for the complaint. Assembling conference between the parties is scheduled for tomorrow. I cannot predict whether the case will be settled or not, but we do feel comfortable with our position that the current base ROE of 11.14% is reasonable. if the case does not settle, we believe that litigation and decision process will take more than a year. 
More recently, a draft order was issued on July 17th, by the Connecticut PURA addressed the response of the 2011 storm by all companies under its jurisdiction including, Connecticut Light and Power. The draft decision had a number of positive comments about CL&P's performance concluded the company was efficient in several areas. PURA suggested that Connecticut Light and Power's ROE could be reduced in our late 2014 rate case, if it does not implement significant improvements, many of which are now underway. 
We submitted written exceptions and also participated in arguments last week regarding the decision and a final order is expected to be issued tomorrow. In those exceptions, we noted that the power restoration was completed safely and consistently with industry norms and that we're making good progress in improving our emergency preparedness and response efforts. This is not the investigation in the recoverability of CL&P's deferred storm costs, which currently total approximately 285 million. We still need to file for recovery of these costs, but you may recall that on the merger settlement agreement, we will begin that recovery on December 1, 2014. 
Additionally, we have agreed as part of our merger settlement, not to recover $40 million of those costs and that $40 million was among the charges in the second quarter. Also, as part of the merger settlement agreement, CL&P agreed to initiate a $300 million distribution resiliency program. We filed that program with PURA earlier this month and Lee will provide you with some additional details in a moment. 
Perhaps in all the tension last year storm is the very solid customer service and reliability performance we have been providing our customers this year, despite some extremely temperatures in July. Our electric system has held up very well as you as best. 
Now, I'd like to discuss some very positive recent developments around financing activity. We were successful in executing 2 new credit agreements that totaled $1.6 billion. This 5-year revolving credit agreements will serve as backup to commercial paper programs as Northeastern utilities and NSTAR Electric. Together with Connecticut Light and Power's existing $300 million facility, we now have access to $1.9 billion of liquidity of financing the capital of our much larger company. We expect that expanding NSTAR's commercial paper program to the NU family of companies, lower interest cost by about $10 million annually going forward. 
We continue to make good progress with our integration efforts and remain optimistic that we will be able to achieve and exceed the synergy targets that we're provided in regulatory filings. We expect that our integration plans will be essentially completed by late summer and the results of this process will be discussed with our board in early September and direction will be provided to you as part of the analyst day that we have planned for Boston on October 5. So mark your calendars, more specific of details on this event will be made available to you very soon. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lee for an update on our operations."
292525,214558537,335055,"Northeast Utilities, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 31, 2012",2012-07-31,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thanks, Jim. I'll start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives beginning with our NEEWS project. We made significant progress on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in the second quarter, and the project was 75% complete at the end o",1632,"Thanks, Jim. I'll start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives beginning with our NEEWS project. We made significant progress on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in the second quarter, and the project was 75% complete at the end of June, compared with 63% complete at the end of March. The project will provide an important new 40-mile pathway to move power reliably from Western Massachusetts to Connecticut. We continue to expect the project to be complete by late 2013 at the cost of $718 million. Of that sum, nearly $500 million was invested as of June of this year. 
Turning to the Interstate Reliably Project filed application with the Connecticut Siting Council in December and commenced hearings in June. Earlier this month, we and ISO New England attesting to the need of the project. Our partner in the project, National Grid, filed a citing application in Massachusetts in June and in Rhode Island in July. 
With these filings, all major permit and signing processes are now underway. We expect to receive final state approvals from the project by the end of 2013, which would support construction in 2014 and 2015. We continue to forecast CL&P share to be $218 million. 
The third major element of NEEWS is the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. ISO New England previously announced that it would review the CCRP project, along with the other Central Connecticut projects as part of a study known as the greater Hartford central Connecticut or GHCC study. There some new developments on this project. We expect that ISO New England will issue preliminary results by its August planning and advisory committee meeting, which we expect will show many reliability problems across the state of Connecticut. 
In addition, we expect ISO New England to identify and publish transmission solutions for these problems in 2013. While the final solutions have not yet known, the widespread concerns across Connecticut identified as part of the GHCC study may require several 115 KB line and related substation upgrades across Connecticut rather than the original central Connecticut 345 KB line project. 
Although the precise scope and cost of these are still being evaluated, we expect sizable group of projects that come out of the GACC study. 
Turning to NSTAR Electric, the most significant project in 2012 w is a new 18-mile, 345 KB line to be build in Cape. We received Massachusetts energy facilities siting board approval and expect to have our Army core of engineer's permit. We expect to begin the construction at $110 million project later this quarter and expect to complete it by middle of next year. 
Including the $207 million NSTAR Electric expects to invest this year, we have raised our projected transmission capital expenditures by $44 million to $718 million in 2012, which includes investments NSTAR Electric made this year prior to the merger. 
Turning to our Northern Pass project, a $1.1 billion, 180-mile primarily high voltage DC line to move 1,200 megawatts of clean power out of Québec and into southern New Hampshire, we continue to make progress. 
You may recall that a 140 miles of the project would be built along existing rights-of-ways. The other 40 miles in Northern New Hampshire is where we need to secure a new right-of-way. We've made additional progress in last quarterly earnings call and expect to purchase the remaining segment and finalize the road in the third quarter. 
There will be an extensive outreach in New Hampshire and the communities to the regulatory review in project development process. We want them to be partners in this process which will bring very significant economic and other benefits to New Hampshire. And we want to be sure we fully benefit from the community input. 
As we begin the community outreach process, the new route will be filed with the U.S. Department of Energy in the fourth quarter of this year, that should support the start of construction in the second half of 2014 and completion by the end of 2016. However, should the process of securing the property continue beyond the end of this quarter, the project completion would move to early 2017. 
Turning from transmission to generation on June 21, public service of New Hampshire plays into service the final major component of our clean air project, the secondary wastewater treatment system. All of the major equipment is operating well and we are very pleased as we continue to see mercury and sulfur emissions well below target levels and well beyond the state's 2013 mercury and sulfur emission requirement. As expected, New Hampshire and regulated set of scheduled to review the presence of our strategies and the project. And we expect a decision in early next year. 
As noted earlier, the project costs are coming in at $422 million, about $35 million below budget. And we believe we are well-positioned for the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission to review. In mid-April, the Public Utility Commission granted PSNH temporary rates to reflect in our energy service charge about 2/3 of all of the operating and capital costs of the project. The other third is being deferred and we expect recovery of those to be addressed in the PUC decision next year. 
Turning from generation to electric distribution, our reliability was strong in all 3 states in the first half of 2012, due to continued investment and ongoing preventative maintenance. Across all 4 electric companies, our overall relativity for the first 6 months of 2012 was 20% better than it was in 2011. 
Earlier, from PURA concerning the performance of Connecticut's utilities during the 2 storms of last year. We continue to make a significant number of steps to improve performance across the company in emergency preparedness. We want to move the company's performance to the very best top-tier performance of utilities in the U.S. 
CL&P has already significantly expanded it's tree trimming and removal program and has implemented a number of organizational changes. These week, we are participating in a 2-day emergency drill organized by the Connecticut Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, which followed an internal emergency drill that CL&P undertook earlier this month. 
You may recall that one of the key aspects of our merger settlement agreement in Connecticut, which Jim touched on earlier, was a commitment to invest $300 million to improve the resiliency of CL&P's overhead electric distribution system. On July 9, CL&P filed a plan to invest $300 million over a 5-year period from 2013 through 2017. 
Of that sum, we expect about $258 million would be related to new capital investment, and $42 million will be related to incremental expense. The majority of those expenditures would be spent on both routine and enhanced tree trimming. Most of the remaining dollars would be invested in structural and electrical of our system. 
As part of these upgrade CL&P will move from trimming trees along its overheard was from once every 5 years to once every 4 years. We will also enhance our program to remove trees in major lamps that are weak, decease or leaning into our wires. We estimate that circuit that benefit from this enhanced tree trimming will experience a 35% reduction in outages during major storms and a 50% reduction in outages during routine conditions. 
After the 5-year program is complete, we project an improvement in the reliability for approximately 15% across the entire CL&P system. Consistent with the merger settlement, we have scheduled the proposed spending so that we would need to recover no more than $25 million from customers during CL&P's fixed rate period, which runs through November of 2014. 
Also consistent with the settlement agreement, we are requesting the recovery of the program, including our capital costs, which will earn at CL&P's most recent authorized return equity of 9.4% through a tracking mechanism. This spending would be incremental to CL&P's existing distribution capital investment program, which reflected in today's distribution rates. Electric distribution companies, CL&P, NSTAR and PSNH and Western Mass Electric invested a combined $357 million of distribution capital in the first half of 2012, including NSTAR Electric's first quarter capital expenditure of $56 million. We currently project an electric distribution capital expenditure for NU's 4 electric distribution utilities of $667 million for the full year 2012. 
Overall, we expect to invest a total of approximately $1.7 billion in our infrastructure in 2012, including NSTAR's first quarter capital expenditures. In addition to the $718 million of transmission, and the $667 million in electric distribution, we expect invest $173 million in natural gas distribution and $53 million in generation. 
Our corporate services companies are projected to invest another $100 million, primarily in information technology, which is included in the $1.7 billion number. 
Turning to our natural gas distribution business, we continue to see significant opportunities ahead. In the first half of this year, NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas together completed the conversion of approximately 2,350 homes from oil to gas space saving. But the end of the year, we expect that number to grow to approximately 6,500. That would be a record level. This is primarily driven by the very large price advantage natural gas continues to have over heating oil on in New England. We expect interest to continue to rise within our natural gas service territory and we look forward to serving a growing number of gas heating customers. 
Additionally, we continue to add new natural gas customers, both residential -- residential and commercial construction. We added more than 1,400 new customers in the first 6 months of the year to the new construction and expect that number to grow to 3,000 by the end of the year. So that would be additive to the 6,500 conversions that we expect to complete this year. So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff."

And if I was to comment on one area in particular that's been a pleasant surprise, I have to say it's in the financing area. We have -- in my comments, I mentioned that we expect $10 million of short-term interest savings as a result of implementing the commercial paper program that we did last week. We also anticipate some refinancing opportunities as well, in today's lower interest rate that are going to help financials as well. So I'd say no negative surprises. There's a lot of potential. We continue to think the net benefit analysis that we filed in both Connecticut and Massachusetts is conservative as we characterize it when we filed it. So lot of potential in terms of this combination going forward, and I think as we've indicated, you can expect to see good things in terms of financial results going forward."

During our studies and they have revealed other reliability issues that go beyond the scope of the original project. And we've also completed other projects that affect the overall modeling of Connecticut. So the scope is expanded. Do we look at this thing, the scope has expanded and to all of central Connecticut to the North, were at Borders, new Massachusetts and to the south where it goes to the shoreline and to the Northwest of Connecticut. So the 2 areas that are really excluded from the study or have any real needs or Southwest Connecticut which would result in Eastern Connecticut. So what you're looking at instead of building that 345 KB line down through an existing right-of-way that we had owned, is probably going to be more upgrades of 115 KB lines which already exist on right-of-way, which makes it significantly easier to site. And also more upgrades in sight of existing substations adding additional transformation equipment, which again is inside the fence which would make that project a series of projects, easier to get through the siting process. So that's kind of where we are with that project. So the project is actually firming up, but it's not the project that we envisioned 4 years ago, as a single 345 KB line."

There are several items I'll cover before turning the call over to Lee for his report on operations.

There are several items I'll cover before turning the call over to Lee for his report on operations. First, I want to say that we're very pleased with the results for the first quarter as a merged company. We achieved the financial results we have targeted, experienced very strong operational results, made significant progress on our capital projects and made a strong start in integrating the 2 companies and achieving the synergies that we've discussed with you. 
For the first time, NU's financial results include NSTAR's results of operations. As you can see from the earnings news release we issued yesterday, we are providing results in some granularity. We also want to ensure that we provide enough detail so that you can identify our onetime merger-related costs in the quarter, including $46 million of customer rate credits, as well as identifying our earnings on a recurring basis. We hope you find this clear and helpful. 
In addition to financial results, I will also cover key legislative and regulatory issues, including the recent draft decision from the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority regarding our storm restoration efforts in Connecticut last year. The third area I will cover is the progress we have made in the financing arena with regards to new credit facilities and related commercial paper programs that were put in place just last week. Lastly, I will briefly discuss the on-going integration process that is well underway as we move forward in creating a high-performing customer-responsive and efficient organization. 
Let me start with a brief discussion of our second quarter results. Excluding merger-related costs, we earned $0.45 per share this year compared to $0.44 last year. There were several items that contributed to this $0.01 change, which equates to about a 2.3% earnings increase. 
First, the addition of NSTAR to NU's reported results had a very positive impact as NSTAR Electric's distribution and transmission operations contributed approximately $0.19 to the quarter's results. However, the impact of these earnings was exactly offset by the higher level of shares outstanding, which increased to 314 million shares from NU's 177 million shares last year as a result of the merger. 
Second, transmission earnings from CL&P, public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass together increased the quarter's results by about $0.05 per share and reflect our continued investment in transmission infrastructure. That increase occurred primarily in Western Mass where earnings more than doubled this quarter as a result of the pace of investment in the Greater Springfield Project. 
NU parent and other company earnings also had a positive impact on the quarter, contributing about $0.03 per share versus 2011. Reflecting NSTAR communications earnings, as well as lower interest expense at the parent. 
Factors that had a negative impact on the quarter included an increase in O&M costs, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. That decline was due primarily to higher nontracked pension and health care costs. An increase in other operating costs, primarily related to higher depreciation and amortization and higher property taxes, reduced earnings by another $0.03 per share. A decline in Electric sales reduced earnings by $0.01 per share and can be largely attributable to successful implementation of various energy efficiency programs. And lastly, higher interest expense cost us another $0.01 per share. These results were very much in line with our internal expectations and spot on with Wall Street's estimate for the quarter. 
While we do not plan to provide specific guidance for the second half of this year, we are comfortable with consensus earnings forecast for us for the second half of 2012. However, we believe that the split between quarters, which averages $0.56 per quarter -- excuse me, $0.56 per share in the third quarter and $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter does not take into consideration NSTAR's historic quarterly earnings patent, during which the third quarter typically accounted for 35% to 40% of the company's annual earnings. 
So going forward, Northeast Utilities postmerger earnings would be more weighted towards the third quarter than the fourth. 
As we've said in the past, we view 2012 as a transition year. From an earnings perspective, it's a year when earnings -- NSTAR earnings are only included in that NU consolidated results for 3 quarters of the year. We will have recorded nearly all the costs related to the merger and related regulatory settlements. However, the benefits of the merger on recurring earnings will only be modestly apparent as we are early on in our integration. 
Earnings drivers for the second half of the year include continued investment in our transmission business; a $7 million distribution rate increase for Yankee Gas that became effective July 1 of this year; a distribution rate increase to public service in New Hampshire, also effective July 1, that includes $7 million for the recovery of infrastructure cost; continued higher pension and postretirement benefit costs at Connecticut Light and Power, Public Service New Hampshire distribution and Yankee Gas. Weather impacts, additional tree trimming, emergency preparedness and borrowing costs at Connecticut Light and Power that resulted from the 2011 storms and subsequent commitments that we made. You can see the impact of these higher costs on Connecticut Light and Power's year-to-date distribution results, and they're largely in line with our expectations. 
Also, another earnings driver for the second half of the year will include synergy savings from the merger. Before moving on to a discussion of the economy, I'd like to mention a couple of positive rate developments for customers of Public Service in New Hampshire, NSTAR Electric and Western Mass. Effective July 1 of this year, the energy service rate for customers of Public Service of New Hampshire declined 18%, while the basic service rates for customers of NSTAR Electric and Western Mass declined 16% and 4% respectively. A good example of how low natural gas prices are benefiting our customers. 
At the halfway point of 2012, I would still characterize the economy in the states we serve as improving and better than the rest of the country. Unemployment rates compare favorably to last year. The New Hampshire rate is down to 5% compared to 5.5% at this time last year. The Massachusetts rate is now at 6% compared to 7.4% last year. And Connecticut's unemployment rate is 8.1% versus 8.9% last year, all of which is still below the national average of 8.2%. 
Initial and continued unemployment claims continue to decline in all 3 states. Also, housing permits are up significantly in each of the 3 states, most notably in Connecticut. In the legislative and regulatory front there were several items pending. First, on June 4, the Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court ordered the Massachusetts' Department of Public Utilities to vacate its earlier order that prohibited NSTAR Electric from fully recovering bad debt expense associated with basic service. We view this as a positive development and await future action from the DPU on the issue. This development did not have an impact on our second quarter results because it is a tentative decision and there was more process involved before the ultimate outcome is determined by the DPU. 
The second item is one that you're all familiar with, it involves a complaint filed by a number of parties about the current base return on equities earned by New England transmission owners. That complaint was filed with FERC. 3 months ago, the FERC issued an order establishing hearing and settlement procedures for the complaint. Assembling conference between the parties is scheduled for tomorrow. I cannot predict whether the case will be settled or not, but we do feel comfortable with our position that the current base ROE of 11.14% is reasonable. if the case does not settle, we believe that FERC's litigation and decision process will take more than a year. 
More recently, a draft order was issued on July 17 by the Connecticut PURA that addressed the response to the 2011 storms by all companies under its jurisdiction including, Connecticut Light and Power. The draft decision had a number of positive comments about CL&P's performance but concluded the company was deficient in several areas. The PURA suggested that Connecticut Light and Power's ROE could be reduced in our late 2014 rate case, if it did not implement significant improvements, many of which are now underway. 
We submitted written exceptions and also participated in all arguments last week regarding the decision and a final order is expected to be issued tomorrow. In those exceptions, we noted that the power restoration was completed safely and consistent with industry norms and that we're making good progress in improving our emergency preparedness and response efforts. This docket is not the investigation into the recoverability of CL&P's deferred storm costs, which currently total approximately $285 million. We still need to file for recovery of these costs, but you may recall that under the merger settlement agreement, we will begin that recovery on December 1, 2014. 
Additionally, we have agreed as part of our merger settlement, not to recover $40 million of those costs and that $40 million was among the charges in the second quarter. Also as part of the merger settlement agreement, CL&P agreed to initiate a $300 million distribution resiliency program. We filed that program with PURA earlier this month and Lee will provide you with some additional details in a moment. 
Perhaps lost in all the attention around last year's storms is the very solid customer service and reliability performance we have been providing for our customers this year, despite some extremely odd temperatures in July. Our electric system has held up very well as we will attest to later. 
Now, I'd like to discuss some very positive recent developments around financing activity. We were successful in executing 2 new credit agreements that total $1.6 billion. This 5-year revolving credit agreements will serve as backup to commercial paper programs at Northeastern Utilities and NSTAR Electric. Together with Connecticut Light and Power's existing $300 million facility, we now have access to $1.9 billion of liquidity for financing the capital requirements of our much larger company. We expect that expanding NSTAR's commercial paper program to the NU family of companies will lower interest costs by about $10 million annually going forward. 
We continue to make good progress with our integration efforts and remain optimistic that we will be able to achieve and exceed the synergy targets that were provided in regulatory filings. We expect that our integration plans will be essentially completed by late summer and the results of this process will be discussed with our board in early September and direction will be provided to you as part of the Analyst Day that we have planned for Boston on October 5. So mark your calendars, more specific details on this event will be made available to you very soon. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Lee for an update on our operations."

I'll start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives beginning with our NEEWS project. We made significant progress on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in the second quarter, and the project was 75% complete at the",1655,"Okay. Thanks, Jim. I'll start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives beginning with our NEEWS project. We made significant progress on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in the second quarter, and the project was 75% complete at the end of June, compared with 63% complete at the end of March. The project will provide an important new 40-mile pathway to move power reliably from Western Massachusetts to Connecticut. We continue to expect the project to be complete by late 2013 at a cost of $718 million. Of that sum, nearly $500 million was invested as of June of this year. 
Turning to the Interstate Reliability Project CL&P filed this application with the Connecticut Siting Council in December and commenced evidentiary hearings in June. Earlier this month, we and ISO New England filed testimony in Connecticut attesting to the need of the project. Our partner in the project, National Grid, filed the citing application in Massachusetts in June and in Rhode Island in July. 
With these filings, all major permit and signing processes are now underway. We expect to receive final state approvals for the project by the end of 2013, which would support construction in 2014 and 2015. We continue to forecast CL&P share to be $218 million. 
The third major element of NEEWS is the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. ISO New England previously announced that it would review the CCRP project, along with the other Central Connecticut projects as part of a study known as the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut or GHCC study. There's some new developments on this project. We expect that ISO New England will issue preliminary needs results at its August planning and advisory committee meeting, which we expect will show many reliability problems across the state of Connecticut. 
In addition, we expect ISO New England to identify and publish transmission solutions for these problems in 2013. While the final solutions are not yet known, the widespread concerns across Connecticut identified as part of the GHCC study may require several 115 kV lines and related substation upgrades across Connecticut rather than the original Central Connecticut 345 kV line project. 
Although the precise scope and cost of these are still being evaluated, we expect there to be a sizable group of projects that come out of the GHCC study. 
Turning to NSTAR Electric, the most significant project in 2012 is a new 18-mile, 345 kV line to be built to Cape Cod. We received Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board approval and expect to have our Army Corps of Engineers permit shortly. We expect to begin the construction of $110 million project later this quarter and expect to complete it by middle of next year. 
Including the $207 million NSTAR Electric expects to invest this year, we have raised our projected transmission capital expenditures by $44 million to $718 million in 2012, which includes investments NSTAR Electric made this year prior to the merger. 
Turning to our Northern Pass project, a $1.1 billion, 180-mile primarily high voltage DC line to move 1,200 megawatts of clean power out of Québec and into southern New Hampshire, we continue to make progress. 
You may recall that a 140 miles of the project would be built along existing rights-of-ways. The other 40 miles in Northern New Hampshire is where we need to secure a new right-of-way. We've made additional progress since our last quarterly earnings call and expect to purchase the remaining segments and finalize the route in the third quarter. 
There will be an extensive outreach in New Hampshire and the communities to the regulatory review in project development process. We want them to be partners in this process which will bring very significant economic and other benefits to New Hampshire. And we want to be sure we fully benefit from the community input. 
As we begin the community outreach process, the new route will be filed with the U.S. Department of Energy in the fourth quarter of this year, that should support the start of construction in the second half of 2014 and completion by the end of 2016. However, should the process of securing the property continue beyond the end of this quarter, the project completion would move to early 2017. 
Turning from transmission to generation. On June 21, Public Service of New Hampshire placed into service the final major component of our Clean Air Project, the secondary wastewater treatment system. All of the major equipment is operating well and we are very pleased as we continue to see mercury and sulfur emissions well below target levels and well beyond the state's 2013 mercury emission requirements. As expected, New Hampshire regulators have set a schedule to review the prudence of our expenditures on the project. And we expect a decision in early next year. 
As I've noted earlier, the project costs are coming in at $422 million, about $35 million below budget. And we believe we are well-positioned for the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission to review. In mid-April, the Public Utility Commission granted PSNH temporary rates to reflect in our energy service charge about 2/3 of all of the operating and capital costs of the project. The other third is being deferred and we expect recovery of those to be addressed in the PUC decision next year. 
Turning from generation to electric distribution, our reliability was strong in all 3 states in the first half of 2012, due to continued investment and ongoing preventative maintenance. Across all 4 electric companies, our overall reliability for the first 6 months of 2012 was 20% better than it was in 2011. 
Earlier, Jim mentioned the draft audit from PURA concerning the performance of Connecticut's utilities during the 2 storms of last year. We continue to make a significant number of steps to improve performance across the company in emergency preparedness. We want to move the company's performance to the very best top-tier performance of utilities in the U.S. 
CL&P has already significantly expanded it's tree trimming and removal program, and has implemented a number of organizational changes. These week, we are participating in a 2-day emergency drill organized by the Connecticut Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, which followed an internal emergency drill that CL&P undertook earlier this month. 
You may recall that one of the key aspects of our merger settlement agreement in Connecticut, which Jim touched on earlier, was a commitment to invest $300 million to improve the resiliency of CL&P's overhead electric distribution system. On July 9, CL&P filed a plan to invest $300 million over a 5-year period from 2013 through 2017. 
Of that sum, we expect about $258 million would be related to new capital investment, and $42 million would be related to incremental expense. The majority of those expenditures would be spent on both routine and enhanced tree trimming. Most of the remaining dollars would be invested in structural and electrical improvement of our system. 
As part of this upgrade, CL&P will move from trimming trees along its overheard wires from once every 5 years to once every 4 years. We will also enhance our program to remove trees and major lamps that are weak, deceases or leaning into our wires. We estimate that circuits that benefit from this enhanced tree trimming will experience a 35% reduction in outages during major storms and a 50% reduction in outages during more routine conditions. 
After the 5-year program is complete, we project an improvement in the reliability of approximately 15% across the entire CL&P system. Consistent with the merger settlement, we have scheduled the proposed spending so that we would need to recover no more than $25 million from customers during CL&P's fixed rate period, which runs through November of 2014. 
Also consistent with the settlement agreement, we are requesting the recovery of the program, including our capital costs, which will earn at CL&P's most recent authorized return on equity of 9.4% through a tracking mechanism. This spending would be incremental to CL&P's existing distribution capital investment program, which reflected in today's distribution rates. 
Our Electric distribution companies, CL&P, NSTAR, PSNH and Western Mass Electric invested a combined $357 million of distribution capital in the first half of 2012, including NSTAR Electric's first quarter capital expenditures of $56 million. We currently project an electric distribution capital expenditures for NU's 4 electric distribution utilities of $667 million for the full year 2012. 
Overall, we expect to invest a total of approximately $1.7 billion in our infrastructure in 2012, including NSTAR's first quarter capital expenditures. In addition to the $718 million of transmission, and the $667 million in electric distribution, we expect to invest $173 million in natural gas distribution and $53 million in generation. 
Our corporate services companies are projected to invest another $100 million, primarily in information technology, which is included in the $1.7 billion number. 
Turning to our Natural Gas distribution business, we continue to see significant opportunities ahead. In the first half of this year, NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas together completed the conversion of approximately 2,350 homes from oil to gas space heating. By the end of the year, we expect that number to grow to approximately 6,500. That would be a record level. This is primarily driven by the very large price advantage natural gas continues to have over heating oil in New England. We expect interest to continue to rise within our natural gas service territory and we look forward to serving a growing number of gas heating customers. 
Additionally, we continue to add new natural gas customers, both residential -- through residential and commercial construction. We added more than 1,400 new customers in the first 6 months of the year due to new construction and expect that number to grow to 3,000 by the end of the year. So that would be additive to the 6,500 conversions that we expect to complete this year. 
So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff."

And if I was to comment on one area in particular that's been a pleasant surprise, I have to say it's in the financing area. We have -- in my comments, I mentioned that we expect $10 million of short-term interest savings as a result of implementing the commercial paper program that we did last week. We also anticipate some refinancing opportunities as well, in today's low interest rate environments that are going to help our financials as well. So I'd say no negative surprises. There's a lot of potential. We continue to think the net benefit analysis that we filed in both Connecticut and Massachusetts is conservative, as we characterized it when we filed it. So a lot of potential in terms of this combination going forward, and I think as we've indicated, you can expect to see good things in terms of financial results going forward."

During our studies, and ISO New England studies, they have revealed other NERC reliability issues that go beyond the scope of the original project. And we've also completed other projects that would affect the overall modeling of Connecticut. So the scope is expanded. The way to look at this thing, the scope has expanded and through all of Central Connecticut to the north, where it borders into Massachusetts and to the south, where it goes to the shoreline and to the Northwest of Connecticut. So the 2 areas that are really excluded from the study or have any real needs are Southwest Connecticut which we've solved and Eastern Connecticut. So what we're looking at, instead of building that 345 kV line down through an existing right-of-way that we had owned, there's probably going to be more upgrades of 115 kV lines which already exist on right-of-ways, which makes it significantly easier to site. And also more upgrades inside of existing substations adding additional transformation equipment, which again is inside the fence which would make that project or series of projects, easier to get through the siting process. So that's kind of where we are with that project. So the project is actually firming up, but it's not the project that we envisioned 4 years ago, as a single 345 kV line."

And I mean if the old legacy plan that we provided at EEI for NU is about $2.8 billion of transmission.

There's a whole series of projects that we have not discussed with you at this time, that are resulting out of the various work that ISO New England is doing and in and around the Greater Boston area to get power in from Northern Boston, Western Boston and of course, the Southeast Massachusetts project that we're already working on now. So there is more needs based upon NERC requirements and other issues that we will be addressing and talking about more in the fall."

It's going to lower locational marginal prices, so they can see lower prices right out of the marketplace in New Hampshire. There is, over the life of the projects, a significant amount of tax revenue associated with it. There is some economic development we have put together, proposed economic development should the project go through. So what we have to do is make our clear the case.

There are several items I'll cover before turning the call over to Lee for his report on operations. First, I want to say that we're very pleased with the results for the first quarter as a merged company. We achieved the financial result",1821,"Thank you, Jeff. There are several items I'll cover before turning the call over to Lee for his report on operations. First, I want to say that we're very pleased with the results for the first quarter as a merged company. We achieved the financial results we have targeted, experienced very strong operational results, made significant progress on our capital projects and made a strong start in integrating the 2 companies and achieving the synergies that we've discussed with you. 
For the first time, NU's financial results include NSTAR's results of operations. As you can see from the earnings news release we issued yesterday, we are providing results in some granularity. We also want to ensure that we provide enough detail so that you can identify our onetime merger-related costs in the quarter, including $46 million of customer rate credits, as well as identifying our earnings on a recurring basis. We hope you find this clear and helpful. 
In addition to financial results, I will also cover key legislative and regulatory issues, including the recent draft decision from the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority regarding our storm restoration efforts in Connecticut last year. The third area I will cover is the progress we have made in the financing arena with regards to new credit facilities and related commercial paper programs that were put in place just last week. Lastly, I will briefly discuss the on-going integration process that is well underway as we move forward in creating a high-performing customer-responsive and efficient organization. 
Let me start with a brief discussion of our second quarter results. Excluding merger-related costs, we earned $0.45 per share this year compared to $0.44 last year. There were several items that contributed to this $0.01 change, which equates to about a 2.3% earnings increase. 
First, the addition of NSTAR to NU's reported results had a very positive impact as NSTAR Electric's distribution and transmission operations contributed approximately $0.19 to the quarter's results. However, the impact of these earnings was exactly offset by the higher level of shares outstanding, which increased to 314 million shares from NU's 177 million shares last year as a result of the merger. 
Second, transmission earnings from CL&P, public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass together increased the quarter's results by about $0.05 per share and reflect our continued investment in transmission infrastructure. That increase occurred primarily in Western Mass where earnings more than doubled this quarter as a result of the pace of investment in the Greater Springfield Project. 
NU parent and other company earnings also had a positive impact on the quarter, contributing about $0.03 per share versus 2011. Reflecting NSTAR communications earnings, as well as lower interest expense at the parent. 
Factors that had a negative impact on the quarter included an increase in O&M costs, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. That decline was due primarily to higher nontracked pension and health care costs. An increase in other operating costs, primarily related to higher depreciation and amortization and higher property taxes, reduced earnings by another $0.03 per share. A decline in Electric sales reduced earnings by $0.01 per share and can be largely attributable to successful implementation of various energy efficiency programs. And lastly, higher interest expense cost us another $0.01 per share. These results were very much in line with our internal expectations and spot on with Wall Street's estimate for the quarter. 
While we do not plan to provide specific guidance for the second half of this year, we are comfortable with consensus earnings forecast for us for the second half of 2012. However, we believe that the split between quarters, which averages $0.56 per quarter -- excuse me, $0.56 per share in the third quarter and $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter does not take into consideration NSTAR's historic quarterly earnings patent, during which the third quarter typically accounted for 35% to 40% of the company's annual earnings. 
So going forward, Northeast Utilities postmerger earnings would be more weighted towards the third quarter than the fourth. 
As we've said in the past, we view 2012 as a transition year. From an earnings perspective, it's a year when earnings -- NSTAR earnings are only included in the NU consolidated results for 3 quarters of the year. We will have recorded nearly all the costs related to the merger and related regulatory settlements. However, the benefits of the merger on recurring earnings will only be modestly apparent as we are early on in our integration. 
Earnings drivers for the second half of the year include continued investment in our transmission business; a $7 million distribution rate increase for Yankee Gas that became effective July 1 of this year; a distribution rate increase of public service in New Hampshire, also effective July 1, that includes $7 million for the recovery of infrastructure cost; continued higher pension and postretirement benefit costs at Connecticut Light and Power, Public Service New Hampshire distribution and Yankee Gas. Weather impacts, additional tree trimming, emergency preparedness and borrowing costs at Connecticut Light and Power that resulted from the 2011 storms and subsequent commitments that we made. You can see the impact of these higher costs on Connecticut Light and Power's year-to-date distribution results, and they're largely in line with our expectations. 
Also, another earnings driver for the second half of the year will include synergy savings from the merger. Before moving on to a discussion of the economy, I'd like to mention a couple of positive rate developments for customers of Public Service in New Hampshire, NSTAR Electric and Western Mass. Effective July 1 of this year, the energy service rate for customers of Public Service of New Hampshire declined 18%, while the basic service rates for customers of NSTAR Electric and Western Mass declined 16% and 4% respectively. A good example of how low natural gas prices are benefiting our customers. 
At the halfway point of 2012, I would still characterize the economy in the states we serve as improving and better than the rest of the country. Unemployment rates compare favorably to last year. The New Hampshire rate is down to 5% compared to 5.5% at this time last year. The Massachusetts rate is now at 6% compared to 7.4% last year. And Connecticut's unemployment rate is 8.1% versus 8.9% last year, all of which is still below the national average of 8.2%. 
Initial and continued unemployment claims continue to decline in all 3 states. Also, housing permits are up significantly in each of the 3 states, most notably in Connecticut. In the legislative and regulatory front there were several items pending. First, on June 4, the Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court ordered the Massachusetts' Department of Public Utilities to vacate its earlier order that prohibited NSTAR Electric from fully recovering bad debt expense associated with basic service. We view this as a positive development and await future action from the DPU on the issue. This development did not have an impact on our second quarter results because it is a tentative decision and there is more process involved before the ultimate outcome is determined by the DPU. 
The second item is one that you're all familiar with, it involves a complaint filed by a number of parties about the current base return on equities earned by New England transmission owners. That complaint was filed with FERC. 3 months ago, the FERC issued an order establishing hearing and settlement procedures for the complaint. A settlement conference between the parties is scheduled for tomorrow. I cannot predict whether the case will be settled or not, but we do feel comfortable with our position that the current base ROE of 11.14% is reasonable. if the case does not settle, we believe that FERC's litigation and decision process will take more than a year. 
More recently, a draft order was issued on July 17 by the Connecticut PURA that addressed the response to the 2011 storms by all companies under its jurisdiction including, Connecticut Light and Power. The draft decision had a number of positive comments about CL&P's performance but concluded the company was deficient in several areas. The PURA suggested that Connecticut Light and Power's ROE could be reduced in our late 2014 rate case, if it did not implement significant improvements, many of which are now underway. 
We submitted written exceptions and also participated in all arguments last week regarding the decision and a final order is expected to be issued tomorrow. In those exceptions, we noted that the power restoration was completed safely and consistent with industry norms and that we're making good progress in improving our emergency preparedness and response efforts. This docket is not the investigation into the recoverability of CL&P's deferred storm costs, which currently total approximately $285 million. We still need to file for recovery of these costs, but you may recall that under the merger settlement agreement, we will begin that recovery on December 1, 2014. 
Additionally, we have agreed as part of our merger settlement, not to recover $40 million of those costs and that $40 million was among the charges in the second quarter. Also as part of the merger settlement agreement, CL&P agreed to initiate a $300 million distribution resiliency program. We filed that program with PURA earlier this month and Lee will provide you with some additional details in a moment. 
Perhaps lost in all the attention around last year's storms is the very solid customer service and reliability performance we have been providing for our customers this year, despite some extremely hot temperatures in July. Our electric system has held up very well as we will attest to later. 
Now, I'd like to discuss some very positive recent developments around financing activity. We were successful in executing 2 new credit agreements that total $1.6 billion. These 5-year revolving credit agreements will serve as backup to commercial paper programs at Northeast Utilities and NSTAR Electric. Together with Connecticut Light and Power's existing $300 million facility, we now have access to $1.9 billion of liquidity for financing the capital requirements of our much larger company. We expect that expanding NSTAR's commercial paper program to the NU family of companies will lower interest costs by about $10 million annually going forward. 
We continue to make good progress with our integration efforts and remain optimistic that we will be able to achieve and exceed the synergy targets that were provided in regulatory filings. We expect that our integration plans will be essentially completed by late summer and the results of this process will be discussed with our board in early September and direction will be provided to you as part of the Analyst Day that we have planned for Boston on October 5. So mark your calendars, more specific details on this event will be made available to you very soon. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Lee for an update on our operations."

I'll start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives beginning with our NEEWS project. We made significant progress on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in the second quarter, and the project was 75% complete at the",1656,"Okay. Thanks, Jim. I'll start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives beginning with our NEEWS project. We made significant progress on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in the second quarter, and the project was 75% complete at the end of June, compared with 63% complete at the end of March. The project will provide an important new 40-mile pathway to move power reliably from Western Massachusetts to Connecticut. We continue to expect the project to be complete by late 2013 at a cost of $718 million. Of that sum, nearly $500 million was invested as of June of this year. 
Turning to the Interstate Reliability Project CL&P filed this application with the Connecticut Siting Council in December and commenced evidentiary hearings in June. Earlier this month, we and ISO New England filed testimony in Connecticut attesting to the need of the project. Our partner in the project, National Grid, filed the citing application in Massachusetts in June and in Rhode Island in July. 
With these filings, all major permit and siting processes are now underway. We expect to receive final state approvals for the project by the end of 2013, which would support construction in 2014 and 2015. We continue to forecast CL&P share to be $218 million. 
The third major element of NEEWS is the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. ISO New England previously announced that it would review the CCRP project, along with the other Central Connecticut projects as part of a study known as the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut or GHCC study. There's some new developments on this project. We expect that ISO New England will issue preliminary needs results at its August planning and advisory committee meeting, which we expect will show many reliability problems across the state of Connecticut. 
In addition, we expect ISO New England to identify and publish transmission solutions for these problems in 2013. While the final solutions are not yet known, the widespread concerns across Connecticut identified as part of the GHCC study may require several 115 kV line and related substation upgrades across Connecticut rather than the original Central Connecticut 345 kV line project. 
Although the precise scope and cost of these are still being evaluated, we expect there to be a sizable group of projects that come out of the GHCC study. 
Turning to NSTAR Electric, the most significant project in 2012 is a new 18-mile, 345 kV line to be built to Cape Cod. We received Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board approval and expect to have our Army Corps of Engineers permit shortly. We expect to begin the construction of $110 million project later this quarter and expect to complete it by middle of next year. 
Including the $207 million NSTAR Electric expects to invest this year, we have raised our projected transmission capital expenditures by $44 million to $718 million in 2012, which includes investments NSTAR Electric made this year prior to the merger. 
Turning to our Northern Pass project, a $1.1 billion, 180-mile primarily high voltage DC line to move 1,200 megawatts of clean power out of Québec and into southern New Hampshire, we continue to make progress. 
You may recall that a 140 miles of the project would be built along existing right-of-ways. The other 40 miles in Northern New Hampshire is where we need to secure a new right-of-way. We've made additional progress since our last quarterly earnings call and expect to purchase the remaining segments and finalize the route in the third quarter. 
There will be an extensive outreach in New Hampshire in the communities to the regulatory review in project development process. We want them to be partners in this process which will bring very significant economic and other benefits to New Hampshire. And we want to be sure we fully benefit from the community input. 
As we begin the community outreach process, the new route will be filed with the U.S. Department of Energy in the fourth quarter of this year, that should support the start of construction in the second half of 2014 and completion by the end of 2016. However, should the process of securing the property continue beyond the end of this quarter, the project completion would move to early 2017. 
Turning from transmission to generation. On June 21, Public Service of New Hampshire placed into service the final major component of our Clean Air Project, the secondary wastewater treatment system. All of the major equipment is operating well and we are very pleased as we continue to see mercury and sulfur emissions well below target levels and well beyond the state's 2013 mercury emission requirements. As expected, New Hampshire regulators have set a schedule to review the prudence of our expenditures on the project. And we expect a decision in early next year. 
As I've noted earlier, the project costs are coming in at $422 million, about $35 million below budget. And we believe we are well-positioned for the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission to review. In mid-April, the Public Utility Commission granted PSNH temporary rates to reflect in our energy service charge about 2/3 of all of the operating and capital costs of the project. The other third is being deferred and we expect recovery of those to be addressed in the PUC decision next year. 
Turning from generation to electric distribution, our reliability was strong in all 3 states in the first half of 2012, due to continued investment and ongoing preventative maintenance. Across all 4 electric companies, our overall reliability for the first 6 months of 2012 was 20% better than it was in 2011. 
Earlier, Jim mentioned the draft audit from PURA concerning the performance of Connecticut's utilities during the 2 storms of last year. We continue to make a significant number of steps to improve performance across the company in emergency preparedness. We want to move the company's performance to the very best top-tier performance of utilities in the U.S. 
CL&P has already significantly expanded its tree trimming and removal program, and has implemented a number of organizational changes. This week, we are participating in a 2-day emergency drill organized by the Connecticut Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, which followed an internal emergency drill that CL&P undertook earlier this month. 
You may recall that one of the key aspects of our merger settlement agreement in Connecticut, which Jim touched on earlier, was a commitment to invest $300 million to improve the resiliency of CL&P's overhead electric distribution system. On July 9, CL&P filed a plan to invest $300 million over a 5-year period from 2013 through 2017. 
Of that sum, we expect about $258 million would be related to new capital investment, and $42 million would be related to incremental expense. The majority of those expenditures would be spent on both routine and enhanced tree trimming. Most of the remaining dollars would be invested in structural and electrical hardening [ph] of our system. 
As part of this upgrade, CL&P will move from trimming trees along its overheard wires from once every 5 years to once every 4 years. We will also enhance our program to remove trees and major limbs that are weak, diseased or leaning into our wires. We estimate that circuits that benefit from this enhanced tree trimming will experience a 35% reduction in outages during major storms and a 50% reduction in outages during more routine conditions. 
After the 5-year program is complete, we project an improvement in the reliability of approximately 15% across the entire CL&P system. Consistent with the merger settlement, we have scheduled the proposed spending so that we would need to recover no more than $25 million from customers during CL&P's fixed rate period, which runs through November of 2014. 
Also consistent with the settlement agreement, we are requesting the recovery of the program, including our capital costs, which will earn at CL&P's most recent authorized return on equity of 9.4% through a tracking mechanism. This spending would be incremental to CL&P's existing distribution capital investment program, which reflected in today's distribution rates. 
Our Electric distribution companies, CL&P, NSTAR, PSNH and Western Mass Electric invested a combined $357 million of distribution capital in the first half of 2012, including NSTAR Electric's first quarter capital expenditures of $56 million. We currently project an electric distribution capital expenditures for NU's 4 electric distribution utilities of $667 million for the full year 2012. 
Overall, we expect to invest a total of approximately $1.7 billion in our infrastructure in 2012, including NSTAR's first quarter capital expenditures. In addition to the $718 million of transmission, and the $667 million in electric distribution, we expect to invest $173 million in natural gas distribution and $53 million in generation. 
Our corporate services companies are projected to invest another $100 million, primarily in information technology, which is included in the $1.7 billion number. 
Turning to our Natural Gas distribution business, we continue to see significant opportunities ahead. In the first half of this year, NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas together completed the conversion of approximately 2,350 homes from oil to gas space heating. By the end of the year, we expect that number to grow to approximately 6,500. That would be a record level. This is primarily driven by the very large price advantage natural gas continues to have over heating oil in New England. We expect interest to continue to rise within our natural gas service territory and we look forward to serving a growing number of gas heating customers. 
Additionally, we continue to add new natural gas customers, both residential -- through residential and commercial construction. We added more than 1,400 new customers in the first 6 months of the year due to new construction and expect that number to grow to 3,000 by the end of the year. So that would be additive to the 6,500 conversions that we expect to complete this year. 
So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff."

And if I was to comment on one area in particular that's been a pleasant surprise, I have to say it's in the financing area. We have -- in my comments, I mentioned that we expect $10 million of short-term interest savings as a result of implementing the commercial paper program that we did last week. We also anticipate some refinancing opportunities as well, in today's low interest rate environments that are going to help our financials as well. So I'd say no negative surprises. There's a lot of potential. We continue to think the net benefit analysis that we filed in both Connecticut and Massachusetts is conservative, as we characterized it when we filed it.

During our studies, and ISO New England studies, they have revealed other NERC reliability issues that go beyond the scope of the original project. And we have also completed other projects that would affect the overall modeling of Connecticut. So the scope is expanded. The way to look at this thing, the scope has expanded and through all of Central Connecticut to the north, where it borders into Massachusetts and to the south, where it goes to the shoreline and to the Northwest of Connecticut. So the 2 areas that are really excluded from the study or have any real needs are Southwest Connecticut which we've solved and Eastern Connecticut. So what we're looking at, instead of building that 345 kV line down through an existing right-of-way that we had owned, it's probably going to be more upgrades of 115 kV lines which already exist on right-of-ways, which makes it significantly easier to site. And also more upgrades inside of existing substations adding additional transformation equipment, which again is inside the fence which would make that project or series of projects, easier to get through the siting process. So that's kind of where we are with that project. So the project is actually firming up, but it's not the project that we envisioned 4 years ago as a single 345 kV line."

I think the bigger issue is that what we have to do for the New Hampshire is demonstrate the value. We have to demonstrate what's in it for New Hampshire. We think, as I've indicated in my remarks, that there is hundreds of millions of dollars of value in New Hampshire as a result of the fact that where this line interconnects in Southern New Hampshire it's going to lower locational marginal prices, so they can see lower prices right out of the marketplace in New Hampshire. There is, over the life of the projects, a significant amount of tax revenue associated with it. There is some economic development we have put together, proposed economic development should the project go through. So what we have to do is make our clear case. And of course, the fact of the matter is, when that 1,200 megawatts shows up, that will displace other less efficient -- not just clean generation capacity, so it has a huge environmental benefit to the region, has a huge reduction in terms of CO2 to the region as well. So it's really win-win-win, we believe for all of the parties and all of the stakeholders."

There are several items I'll cover before turning the call over to Lee for his report on operations. First, I want to say that we're very pleased with the results for the first quarter as a merged company. We achieved the financial results we have targeted, experienced very strong operational results, made significant progress on our capital projects and made a strong start in integrating the 2 companies and achieving the synergies that we've discussed with you. 
For the first time, NU's financial results include NSTAR's results of operations. As you can see from the earnings news release we issued yesterday, we are providing results in some granularity. We also want to ensure that we provide enough detail so that you can identify our onetime merger-related costs in the quarter, including $46 million of customer rate credits, as well as identifying our earnings on a recurring basis. We hope you find this clear and helpful. 
In addition to financial results, I will also cover key legislative and regulatory issues, including the recent draft decision from the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority regarding our storm restoration efforts in Connecticut last year. The third area I will cover is the progress we have made in the financing arena with regards to new credit facilities and related commercial paper programs that were put in place just last week. Lastly, I will briefly discuss the on-going integration process that is well underway as we move forward in creating a high-performing customer-responsive and efficient organization. 
Let me start with a brief discussion of our second quarter results. Excluding merger-related costs, we earned $0.45 per share this year compared to $0.44 last year. There were several items that contributed to this $0.01 change, which equates to about a 2.3% earnings increase. 
First, the addition of NSTAR to NU's reported results had a very positive impact as NSTAR Electric's distribution and transmission operations contributed approximately $0.19 to the quarter's results. However, the impact of these earnings was exactly offset by the higher level of shares outstanding, which increased to 314 million shares from NU's 177 million shares last year as a result of the merger. 
Second, transmission earnings from CL&P, public service in New Hampshire and Western Mass together increased the quarter's results by about $0.05 per share and reflect our continued investment in transmission infrastructure. That increase occurred primarily in Western Mass where earnings more than doubled this quarter as a result of the pace of investment in the Greater Springfield Project. 
NU parent and other company earnings also had a positive impact on the quarter, contributing about $0.03 per share versus 2011. Reflecting NSTAR communications earnings, as well as lower interest expense at the parent. 
Factors that had a negative impact on the quarter included an increase in O&M costs, which reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. That decline was due primarily to higher nontracked pension and health care costs. An increase in other operating costs, primarily related to higher depreciation and amortization and higher property taxes, reduced earnings by another $0.03 per share. A decline in Electric sales reduced earnings by $0.01 per share and can be largely attributable to successful implementation of various energy efficiency programs. And lastly, higher interest expense cost us another $0.01 per share. These results were very much in line with our internal expectations and spot on with Wall Street's estimate for the quarter. 
While we do not plan to provide specific guidance for the second half of this year, we are comfortable with consensus earnings forecast for us for the second half of 2012. However, we believe that the split between quarters, which averages $0.56 per quarter -- excuse me, $0.56 per share in the third quarter and $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter does not take into consideration NSTAR's historic quarterly earnings patent, during which the third quarter typically accounted for 35% to 40% of the company's annual earnings. 
So going forward, Northeast Utilities postmerger earnings would be more weighted towards the third quarter than the fourth. 
As we've said in the past, we view 2012 as a transition year. From an earnings perspective, it's a year when earnings -- NSTAR earnings are only included in the NU consolidated results for 3 quarters of the year. We will have recorded nearly all the costs related to the merger and related regulatory settlements. However, the benefits of the merger on recurring earnings will only be modestly apparent as we are early on in our integration. 
Earnings drivers for the second half of the year include continued investment in our transmission business; a $7 million distribution rate increase for Yankee Gas that became effective July 1 of this year; a distribution rate increase of public service in New Hampshire, also effective July 1, that includes $7 million for the recovery of infrastructure cost; continued higher pension and postretirement benefit costs at Connecticut Light and Power, Public Service New Hampshire distribution and Yankee Gas. Weather impacts, additional tree trimming, emergency preparedness and borrowing costs at Connecticut Light and Power that resulted from the 2011 storms and subsequent commitments that we made. You can see the impact of these higher costs on Connecticut Light and Power's year-to-date distribution results, and they're largely in line with our expectations. 
Also, another earnings driver for the second half of the year will include synergy savings from the merger. Before moving on to a discussion of the economy, I'd like to mention a couple of positive rate developments for customers of Public Service in New Hampshire, NSTAR Electric and Western Mass. Effective July 1 of this year, the energy service rate for customers of Public Service of New Hampshire declined 18%, while the basic service rates for customers of NSTAR Electric and Western Mass declined 16% and 4% respectively. A good example of how low natural gas prices are benefiting our customers. 
At the halfway point of 2012, I would still characterize the economy in the states we serve as improving and better than the rest of the country. Unemployment rates compare favorably to last year. The New Hampshire rate is down to 5% compared to 5.5% at this time last year. The Massachusetts rate is now at 6% compared to 7.4% last year. And Connecticut's unemployment rate is 8.1% versus 8.9% last year, all of which is still below the national average of 8.2%. 
Initial and continued unemployment claims continue to decline in all 3 states. Also, housing permits are up significantly in each of the 3 states, most notably in Connecticut. In the legislative and regulatory front there were several items pending. First, on June 4, the Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court ordered the Massachusetts' Department of Public Utilities to vacate its earlier order that prohibited NSTAR Electric from fully recovering bad debt expense associated with basic service. We view this as a positive development and await future action from the DPU on the issue. This development did not have an impact on our second quarter results because it is a tentative decision and there is more process involved before the ultimate outcome is determined by the DPU. 
The second item is one that you're all familiar with, it involves a complaint filed by a number of parties about the current base return on equities earned by New England transmission owners. That complaint was filed with FERC. 3 months ago, the FERC issued an order establishing hearing and settlement procedures for the complaint. A settlement conference between the parties is scheduled for tomorrow. I cannot predict whether the case will be settled or not, but we do feel comfortable with our position that the current base ROE of 11.14% is reasonable. if the case does not settle, we believe that FERC's litigation and decision process will take more than a year. 
More recently, a draft order was issued on July 17 by the Connecticut PURA that addressed the response to the 2011 storms by all companies under its jurisdiction including, Connecticut Light and Power. The draft decision had a number of positive comments about CL&P's performance but concluded the company was deficient in several areas. The PURA suggested that Connecticut Light and Power's ROE could be reduced in our late 2014 rate case, if it did not implement significant improvements, many of which are now underway. 
We submitted written exceptions and also participated in all arguments last week regarding the decision and a final order is expected to be issued tomorrow. In those exceptions, we noted that the power restoration was completed safely and consistent with industry norms and that we're making good progress in improving our emergency preparedness and response efforts. This docket is not the investigation into the recoverability of CL&P's deferred storm costs, which currently total approximately $285 million. We still need to file for recovery of these costs, but you may recall that under the merger settlement agreement, we will begin that recovery on December 1, 2014. 
Additionally, we have agreed as part of our merger settlement, not to recover $40 million of those costs and that $40 million was among the charges in the second quarter. Also as part of the merger settlement agreement, CL&P agreed to initiate a $300 million distribution resiliency program. We filed that program with PURA earlier this month and Lee will provide you with some additional details in a moment. 
Perhaps lost in all the attention around last year's storms is the very solid customer service and reliability performance we have been providing for our customers this year, despite some extremely hot temperatures in July. Our electric system has held up very well as we will attest to later. 
Now, I'd like to discuss some very positive recent developments around financing activity. We were successful in executing 2 new credit agreements that total $1.6 billion. These 5-year revolving credit agreements will serve as backup to commercial paper programs at Northeast Utilities and NSTAR Electric. Together with Connecticut Light and Power's existing $300 million facility, we now have access to $1.9 billion of liquidity for financing the capital requirements of our much larger company. We expect that expanding NSTAR's commercial paper program to the NU family of companies will lower interest costs by about $10 million annually going forward. 
We continue to make good progress with our integration efforts and remain optimistic that we will be able to achieve and exceed the synergy targets that were provided in regulatory filings. We expect that our integration plans will be essentially completed by late summer and the results of this process will be discussed with our board in early September and direction will be provided to you as part of the Analyst Day that we have planned for Boston on October 5. So mark your calendars, more specific details on this event will be made available to you very soon. 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Lee for an update on our operations."

I'll start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives beginning with our NEEWS project. We made significant progress on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in the second quarter, and the project was 75% complete at the",1656,"Okay. Thanks, Jim. I'll start by reviewing our transmission investment initiatives beginning with our NEEWS project. We made significant progress on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project in the second quarter, and the project was 75% complete at the end of June, compared with 63% complete at the end of March. The project will provide an important new 40-mile pathway to move power reliably from Western Massachusetts to Connecticut. We continue to expect the project to be complete by late 2013 at a cost of $718 million. Of that sum, nearly $500 million was invested as of June of this year. 
Turning to the Interstate Reliability Project CL&P filed this application with the Connecticut Siting Council in December and commenced evidentiary hearings in June. Earlier this month, we and ISO New England filed testimony in Connecticut attesting to the need of the project. Our partner in the project, National Grid, filed the citing application in Massachusetts in June and in Rhode Island in July. 
With these filings, all major permit and siting processes are now underway. We expect to receive final state approvals for the project by the end of 2013, which would support construction in 2014 and 2015. We continue to forecast CL&P share to be $218 million. 
The third major element of NEEWS is the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. ISO New England previously announced that it would review the CCRP project, along with the other Central Connecticut projects as part of a study known as the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut or GHCC study. There's some new developments on this project. We expect that ISO New England will issue preliminary needs results at its August planning and advisory committee meeting, which we expect will show many reliability problems across the state of Connecticut. 
In addition, we expect ISO New England to identify and publish transmission solutions for these problems in 2013. While the final solutions are not yet known, the widespread concerns across Connecticut identified as part of the GHCC study may require several 115 kV line and related substation upgrades across Connecticut rather than the original Central Connecticut 345 kV line project. 
Although the precise scope and cost of these are still being evaluated, we expect there to be a sizable group of projects that come out of the GHCC study. 
Turning to NSTAR Electric, the most significant project in 2012 is a new 18-mile, 345 kV line to be built to Cape Cod. We received Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board approval and expect to have our Army Corps of Engineers permit shortly. We expect to begin the construction of $110 million project later this quarter and expect to complete it by middle of next year. 
Including the $207 million NSTAR Electric expects to invest this year, we have raised our projected transmission capital expenditures by $44 million to $718 million in 2012, which includes investments NSTAR Electric made this year prior to the merger. 
Turning to our Northern Pass project, a $1.1 billion, 180-mile primarily high voltage DC line to move 1,200 megawatts of clean power out of Québec and into southern New Hampshire, we continue to make progress. 
You may recall that a 140 miles of the project would be built along existing right-of-ways. The other 40 miles in Northern New Hampshire is where we need to secure a new right-of-way. We've made additional progress since our last quarterly earnings call and expect to purchase the remaining segments and finalize the route in the third quarter. 
There will be an extensive outreach in New Hampshire in the communities to the regulatory review in project development process. We want them to be partners in this process which will bring very significant economic and other benefits to New Hampshire. And we want to be sure we fully benefit from the community input. 
As we begin the community outreach process, the new route will be filed with the U.S. Department of Energy in the fourth quarter of this year, that should support the start of construction in the second half of 2014 and completion by the end of 2016. However, should the process of securing the property continue beyond the end of this quarter, the project completion would move to early 2017. 
Turning from transmission to generation. On June 21, Public Service of New Hampshire placed into service the final major component of our Clean Air Project, the secondary wastewater treatment system. All of the major equipment is operating well and we are very pleased as we continue to see mercury and sulfur emissions well below target levels and well beyond the state's 2013 mercury emission requirements. As expected, New Hampshire regulators have set a schedule to review the prudence of our expenditures on the project. And we expect a decision in early next year. 
As I've noted earlier, the project costs are coming in at $422 million, about $35 million below budget. And we believe we are well-positioned for the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission to review. In mid-April, the Public Utility Commission granted PSNH temporary rates to reflect in our energy service charge about 2/3 of all of the operating and capital costs of the project. The other third is being deferred and we expect recovery of those to be addressed in the PUC decision next year. 
Turning from generation to electric distribution, our reliability was strong in all 3 states in the first half of 2012, due to continued investment and ongoing preventative maintenance. Across all 4 electric companies, our overall reliability for the first 6 months of 2012 was 20% better than it was in 2011. 
Earlier, Jim mentioned the draft audit from PURA concerning the performance of Connecticut's utilities during the 2 storms of last year. We continue to make a significant number of steps to improve performance across the company in emergency preparedness. We want to move the company's performance to the very best top-tier performance of utilities in the U.S. 
CL&P has already significantly expanded its tree trimming and removal program, and has implemented a number of organizational changes. This week, we are participating in a 2-day emergency drill organized by the Connecticut Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, which followed an internal emergency drill that CL&P undertook earlier this month. 
You may recall that one of the key aspects of our merger settlement agreement in Connecticut, which Jim touched on earlier, was a commitment to invest $300 million to improve the resiliency of CL&P's overhead electric distribution system. On July 9, CL&P filed a plan to invest $300 million over a 5-year period from 2013 through 2017. 
Of that sum, we expect about $258 million would be related to new capital investment, and $42 million would be related to incremental expense. The majority of those expenditures would be spent on both routine and enhanced tree trimming. Most of the remaining dollars would be invested in structural and electrical hardening [ph] of our system. 
As part of this upgrade, CL&P will move from trimming trees along its overheard wires from once every 5 years to once every 4 years. We will also enhance our program to remove trees and major limbs that are weak, diseased or leaning into our wires. We estimate that circuits that benefit from this enhanced tree trimming will experience a 35% reduction in outages during major storms and a 50% reduction in outages during more routine conditions. 
After the 5-year program is complete, we project an improvement in the reliability of approximately 15% across the entire CL&P system. Consistent with the merger settlement, we have scheduled the proposed spending so that we would need to recover no more than $25 million from customers during CL&P's fixed rate period, which runs through November of 2014. 
Also consistent with the settlement agreement, we are requesting the recovery of the program, including our capital costs, which will earn at CL&P's most recent authorized return on equity of 9.4% through a tracking mechanism. This spending would be incremental to CL&P's existing distribution capital investment program, which reflected in today's distribution rates. 
Our Electric distribution companies, CL&P, NSTAR, PSNH and Western Mass Electric invested a combined $357 million of distribution capital in the first half of 2012, including NSTAR Electric's first quarter capital expenditures of $56 million. We currently project an electric distribution capital expenditures for NU's 4 electric distribution utilities of $667 million for the full year 2012. 
Overall, we expect to invest a total of approximately $1.7 billion in our infrastructure in 2012, including NSTAR's first quarter capital expenditures. In addition to the $718 million of transmission, and the $667 million in electric distribution, we expect to invest $173 million in natural gas distribution and $53 million in generation. 
Our corporate services companies are projected to invest another $100 million, primarily in information technology, which is included in the $1.7 billion number. 
Turning to our Natural Gas distribution business, we continue to see significant opportunities ahead. In the first half of this year, NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas together completed the conversion of approximately 2,350 homes from oil to gas space heating. By the end of the year, we expect that number to grow to approximately 6,500. That would be a record level. This is primarily driven by the very large price advantage natural gas continues to have over heating oil in New England. We expect interest to continue to rise within our natural gas service territory and we look forward to serving a growing number of gas heating customers. 
Additionally, we continue to add new natural gas customers, both residential -- through residential and commercial construction. We added more than 1,400 new customers in the first 6 months of the year due to new construction and expect that number to grow to 3,000 by the end of the year. So that would be additive to the 6,500 conversions that we expect to complete this year. 
So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff."

We wanted to make sure that the quarters were adjusted to reflect what we think to be the flow. So instead of the third quarter being smaller than the fourth quarter, it's very likely that the opposite is going to be true. The second point I'd make is when you add those 2 quarters to what we've already earned, I think that gives you a number somewhere around $2.24. I think we'll do modestly better than that. So we're comfortable with those 2 quarters and expect to do a little bit better. But again, the key message was to sequence the quarters correctly."

The second part of that question, an easier answer in that we essentially have multiyear rate settlements in all of our jurisdictions.

I think we remain very encouraged and optimistic at the potential in terms of cost reductions. And if I was to comment on one area in particular that's been a pleasant surprise, I have to say it's in the financing area. We have -- in my comments, I mentioned that we expect $10 million of short-term interest savings as a result of implementing the commercial paper program that we did last week. We also anticipate some refinancing opportunities as well, in today's low interest rate environments that are going to help our financials as well. So I'd say no negative surprises. There's a lot of potential. We continue to think the net benefit analysis that we filed in both Connecticut and Massachusetts is conservative, as we characterized it when we filed it. So a lot of potential in terms of this combination going forward, and I think as we've indicated, you can expect to see good things in terms of financial results going forward."

During our studies, and ISO New England studies, they have revealed other NERC reliability issues that go beyond the scope of the original project. And we have also completed other projects that would affect the overall modeling of Connecticut. So the scope is expanded. The way to look at this thing, the scope has expanded and through all of Central Connecticut to the north, where it borders into Massachusetts and to the south, where it goes to the shoreline and to the Northwest of Connecticut. So the 2 areas that are really excluded from the study or have any real needs are Southwest Connecticut which we've solved and Eastern Connecticut. So what we're looking at, instead of building that 345 kV line down through an existing right-of-way that we had owned, it's probably going to be more upgrades of 115 kV lines which already exist on right-of-ways, which makes it significantly easier to site. And also more upgrades inside of existing substations adding additional transformation equipment, which again is inside the fence which would make that project or series of projects, easier to get through the siting process. So that's kind of where we are with that project. So the project is actually firming up, but it's not the project that we envisioned 4 years ago as a single 345 kV line."

So if more of the new generation comes on as natural gas, they will have to have redundant fuel supplies, could be oil, could be an LNG facility, could be dedicated or firm pipeline capacities. So the likelihood that you're going to see a number of things happen. You're going to see more existing capacity retire, 8,000 to 9,000 megawatts. You're going to see new capacity come on. [indiscernible] Entry cost that would be above where HQ would come into the market.
