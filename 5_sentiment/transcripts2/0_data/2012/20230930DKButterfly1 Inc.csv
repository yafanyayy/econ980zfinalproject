I'm pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 32% in both the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year to approximately $1.48 and $4.06, respectively. We're pleased that we've been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength as we constantly challenge ourselves to improve in every aspect of our operation.
Our unique decentralized corporate culture continues to produce positive results, and we remain confident that our business will continue to grow successfully in the years ahead. Our entire organization is dedicated to providing our customers with the best possible shopping experience.
During the fourth quarter, we opened 3 buybuy BABY stores, bringing the total number of stores opened in fiscal 2011 to 38 stores across all our concepts, as well as relocated 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and closed one Harmon store. 
Consolidated store space at February 25, 2012, is approximately 36.1 million square feet, an increase of approximately 3% over the end of last year's fourth quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal first quarter of 2012, we've opened 2 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,175 stores, consisting of 995 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 71 Christmas Tree Shop stores; 64 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. 
In addition, we're a partner in a joint venture which operates 2 stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2012, including the 2 additional stores we've opened to date, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 40 stores across all our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2012 mix of store openings by concept will be comparable to fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility. 
As always, we apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or right-size our stores in response to changing market conditions.
We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there's an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as continue to grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in stores across all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise categories.
We're focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continued redevelopment of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers. 
As we've consistently said, the continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. 
We have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals. Now I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in this conference call. As Warren said, we are pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. 
While consumer confidence and spending continues to be impacted by the continuing economic challenges, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service. As always, we will continue to invest in all aspects of our company and work to enhance our customer's overall experience in store, online and through social media and mobile devices. We remain committed to being our customer's first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, compete for and increase our market share and over the long term, continue to grow shareholder value. And taking this long-term approach to the growth and development of our business and through the ongoing efforts to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices throughout our organization, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers.
As we previously announced, we're in the process of relocating our offices in Farmingdale and Garden City, New York to our corporate headquarters here in Union, New Jersey. This transition is being made to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all our concepts, activities and platforms and to support the continuing growth of our company. We expect this transition to be substantially completed by the end of this summer.
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $1.48, an increase of approximately 32% when compared to the $1.12 per diluted share that we earned in last year's fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2011, net earnings per diluted share were $4.06 compared with $3.07 earned last year, also an increase of approximately 32%. 
Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, approximately 9.1% higher than in the prior year. For all of fiscal 2011, net sales were approximately $9.5 billion, about 8.5% higher than last year. Fourth quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 6.8% compared with an increase of 8.5% last year. For the full year, comp store sales increased by approximately 5.9%, compared with an increase of approximately 7.8% last year. The increases in comp store sales for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2011 were attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount. 
Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 42.6% of net sales compared to approximately 43% of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in inventory acquisition costs, coupons, shrink and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, partially offset by a reduction in markdowns. 
Gross profit for the full fiscal year was approximately 41.4% of net sales, the same as the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales included a reduction in markdowns, offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
In the fiscal fourth quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 22.4% of net sales as compared to approximately 24.6% of net sales in last year's fiscal fourth quarter, a decrease of approximately 220 basis points. For all of fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 24.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.7% of net sales for all of fiscal 2010, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points. These decreases can primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy, advertising and store expenses as a percentage of net sales, all of which benefited from the positive comp for both the fiscal fourth quarter and full year. In addition, advertising as a percentage of net sales for both the fiscal fourth quarter and full year benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. 
Reflecting the movement in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margins for both the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year were higher than in the same periods a year ago by approximately 180 basis points. 
Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 36.6% compared to approximately 38.7% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 210 basis points. For all of fiscal 2011, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37% compared to approximately 38.8% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points. 
These provisions for the current fiscal quarter and full year of 2011 included net after-tax benefits of $6.6 million and $20.7 million, respectively, due to distinct tax events occurring during the periods. 
Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2011 were approximately $243.4 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
Our company's board of directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As you heard from Warren and Steve, we earned $1.48 per diluted share in our fiscal fourth quarter and $4.06 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2011. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal fourth quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the coming year. 
Our planning assumptions for fiscal 2012 which began on February 26, 2012, and which will be 53 weeks, include the following: One, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 40 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2012's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility. 
We also will continue to place Harmon Face Values health and beauty care offerings in selected stores across all our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. 
Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012. Three, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are planned to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, which, of course, remains subject to the timing and composition of the projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square-foot e-commerce fulfillment center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support our ongoing technology initiatives. 
Currently, we estimate the incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.09 per diluted share, including -- I'm sorry, occurring primarily in the second half of fiscal 2012. 
Four, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the first quarter and full year. 
Five, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 4% to 6% for the first quarter and 5% to 7% for the full year. 
Six, depreciation for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $180 million to $190 million. 
Seven, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are relatively consistent with last year, in addition to the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise to lower margin categories, and including the incremental operating costs associated with the previously discussed major initiatives, we are modeling operating profit margin as a percentage of net sales to be flat for the first quarter and to be in the range of flat to deleveraged for the full year. 
Eight, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2011. 
Nine, the first quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid to high 30s percentage range, with the expected variability as distinct tax events occur. 
Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. 
Eleven, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by the end of the fiscal year. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors including business and market conditions. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.79 to $0.83 for the fiscal first quarter of 2012. For all of fiscal 2012, including the benefit of the 53rd week and the incremental operating costs from the previously discussed major initiatives, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage range. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes approximately $83.9 million of investments related to auction rate securities. 
These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately cover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities. 
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of February 25, 2012, inventories at cost were approximately $2.1 billion or $57.35 per square foot, an increase of approximately 2.1% on a per square foot basis over last year. 
Consolidated shareholders equity at February 25, 2012, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $359 million, representing approximately 5.9 million shares repurchased during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011. As of February 25, 2012, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $919 million. 
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the first quarter ending on May 26, 2012, will be on Wednesday, June 20, 2012. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, April 4, to take your calls. 
As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 performance. As we reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $1.48, an increase of approximately 32% when compared to the $1.12 per diluted share that we earned in last year's fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2011, net earnings per diluted share were $4.06 compared with $3.07 earned last year, also an increase of approximately 32%. 
Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, approximately 9.1% higher than in the prior year. For all of fiscal 2011, net sales were approximately $9.5 billion, about 8.5% higher than last year. Fourth quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 6.8% compared with an increase of 8.5% last year. For the full year, comp store sales increased by approximately 5.9%, compared with an increase of approximately 7.8% last year. The increases in comp store sales for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2011 were attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount. 
Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 42.6% of net sales compared to approximately 43% of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in inventory acquisition costs, coupons, shrink and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, partially offset by a reduction in markdowns. 
Gross profit for the full fiscal year was approximately 41.4% of net sales, the same as the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales included a reduction in markdowns, offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
In the fiscal fourth quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 22.4% of net sales as compared to approximately 24.6% of net sales in last year's fiscal fourth quarter, a decrease of approximately 220 basis points. For all of fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 24.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.7% of net sales for all of fiscal 2010, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points. These decreases can primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy, advertising and store expenses as a percentage of net sales, all of which benefited from the positive comp for both the fiscal fourth quarter and full year. In addition, advertising as a percentage of net sales for both the fiscal fourth quarter and full year benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. 
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margins for both the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year were higher than in the same periods a year ago by approximately 180 basis points. 
Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 36.6% compared to approximately 38.7% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 210 basis points. For all of fiscal 2011, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37% compared to approximately 38.8% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points. 
These provisions for the current fiscal quarter and full year of 2011 included net after-tax benefits of $6.6 million and $20.7 million, respectively, due to distinct tax events occurring during the periods. 
Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2011 were approximately $243.4 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer. 
I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"

As you heard from Warren and Steve, we earned $1.48 per diluted share in our fiscal fourth quarter and $4.06 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2011. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal fourth quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the coming year. 
Our planning assumptions for fiscal 2012 which began on February 26, 2012, and which will be 53 weeks, include the following: One, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 40 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2012's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility. 
We also will continue to place Harmon Face Values health and beauty care offerings in selected stores across all our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. 
Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012. 
Three, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are planned to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million which, of course, remains subject to the timing and composition of the projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square-foot e-commerce fulfillment center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey, and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support our ongoing technology initiatives. 
Currently, we estimate the incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.09 per diluted share, including -- I'm sorry, occurring primarily in the second half of fiscal 2012. 
Four, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the first quarter and full year. 
Five, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 4% to 6% for the first quarter and 5% to 7% for the full year. 
Six, depreciation for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $180 million to $190 million. 
Seven, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are relatively consistent with last year, in addition to the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, and including the incremental operating costs associated with the previously discussed major initiatives, we are modeling operating profit margin as a percentage of net sales to be flat for the first quarter and to be in the range of flat to deleveraged for the full year. 
Eight, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2011. 
Nine, the first quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid to high 30s percentage range, with the expected variability as distinct tax events occur. 
Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally-generated sources. 
Eleven, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by the end of the fiscal year. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors including business and market conditions. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.79 to $0.83 for the fiscal first quarter of 2012. For all of fiscal 2012, including the benefit of the 53rd week and the incremental operating costs from the previously discussed major initiatives, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high-single-digit to a low-double-digit percentage range. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes approximately $83.9 million of investments related to auction rate securities. 
These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities. 
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of February 25, 2012, inventories at cost were approximately $2.1 billion or $57.35 per square foot, an increase of approximately 2.1% on a per square foot basis over last year. 
Consolidated shareholders equity at February 25, 2012, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $359 million, representing approximately 5.9 million shares repurchased during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011. As of February 25, 2012, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $919 million. 
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the first quarter ending on May 26, 2012, will be on Wednesday, June 20, 2012. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, April 4, to take your calls.

I'm pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 32% in both the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year to approximately $1.48 and $4.06, respectively. We're pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength as we constantly challenge ourselves to improve in every aspect of our operation.
Our unique decentralized corporate culture continues to produce positive results, and we remain confident that our business will continue to grow successfully in the years ahead. Our entire organization is dedicated to providing our customers with the best possible shopping experience.
During the fourth quarter, we opened 3 buybuy BABY stores, bringing the total number of stores opened in fiscal 2011 to 38 stores across all our concepts, as well as relocated 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and closed one Harmon store. 
Consolidated store space at February 25, 2012, is approximately 36.1 million square feet, an increase of approximately 3% over the end of last year's fourth quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal first quarter of 2012, we've opened 2 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,175 stores, consisting of 995 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 71 Christmas Tree Shop stores; 64 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. 
In addition, we're a partner in a joint venture which operates 2 stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2012, including the 2 additional stores we've opened to date, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 40 stores across all our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2012 mix of store openings by concept will be comparable to fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility. 
As always, we apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or right-size our stores in response to changing market conditions.
We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there's an opportunity to operate an excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as continue to grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in stores across all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise categories.
We're focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers. 
As we consistently said, the continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. 
We have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in this conference call. As Warren said, we are pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. 
While consumer confidence and spending continues to be impacted by the continuing economic challenges, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service. As always, we will continue to invest in all aspects of our company and work to enhance our customer's overall experience in store, online and through social media and mobile devices. We remain committed to being our customer's first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, compete for and increase our market share and over the long term, continue to grow shareholder value. And taking this long-term approach to the growth and development of our business and through the ongoing efforts to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices throughout our organization, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers.
As we previously announced, we're in the process of relocating our offices in Farmingdale and Garden City, New York to our corporate headquarters here in Union, New Jersey. This transition is being made to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all our concepts, activities and platforms and to support the continuing growth of our company. We expect this transition to be substantially completed by the end of this summer.
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $1.48, an increase of approximately 32% when compared to the $1.12 per diluted share that we earned in last year's fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2011, net earnings per diluted share were $4.06 compared with $3.07 earned last year, also an increase of approximately 32%. 
Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, approximately 9.1% higher than in the prior year. For all of fiscal 2011, net sales were approximately $9.5 billion, about 8.5% higher than last year. Fourth quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 6.8% compared with an increase of 8.5% last year. For the full year, comp store sales increased by approximately 5.9%, compared with an increase of approximately 7.8% last year. The increases in comp store sales for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2011 were attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount. 
Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 42.6% of net sales compared to approximately 43% of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in inventory acquisition costs, coupons, shrink and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, partially offset by a reduction in markdowns. 
Gross profit for the full fiscal year was approximately 41.4% of net sales, the same as the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales included a reduction in markdowns, offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
In the fiscal fourth quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 22.4% of net sales as compared to approximately 24.6% of net sales in last year's fiscal fourth quarter, a decrease of approximately 220 basis points. For all of fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 24.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.7% of net sales for all of fiscal 2010, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points. These decreases can primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy, advertising and store expenses as a percentage of net sales, all of which benefited from the positive comp for both the fiscal fourth quarter and full year. In addition, advertising as a percentage of net sales for both the fiscal fourth quarter and full year benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. 
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margins for both the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year were higher than in the same periods a year ago by approximately 180 basis points. 
Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 36.6% compared to approximately 38.7% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 210 basis points. For all of fiscal 2011, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37% compared to approximately 38.8% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points. 
These provisions for the current fiscal quarter and full year of 2011 included net after-tax benefits of $6.6 million and $20.7 million, respectively, due to distinct tax events occurring during the periods. 
Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2011 were approximately $243.4 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

Our planning assumptions for fiscal 2012 which began on February 26, 2012, and which will be 53 weeks, include the following: One, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 40 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2012's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to fiscal 2011.

Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012. 
Three, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are planned to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million which, of course, remains subject to the timing and composition of the projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square-foot e-commerce fulfillment center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey, and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support our ongoing technology initiatives. Currently, we estimate the incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.09 per diluted share, including -- I'm sorry, occurring primarily in the second half of fiscal 2012. 
Four, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the first quarter and full year. 
Five, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 4% to 6% for the first quarter and 5% to 7% for the full year. 
Six, depreciation for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $180 million to $190 million. 
Seven, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are relatively consistent with last year, in addition to the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, and including the incremental operating costs associated with the previously discussed major initiatives, we are modeling operating profit margin as a percentage of net sales to be flat for the first quarter and to be in the range of flat to deleveraged for the full year. 
Eight, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2011. 
Nine, the first quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid to high 30s percentage range, with the expected variability as distinct tax events occur. 
Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally-generated sources. 
Eleven, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by the end of the fiscal year. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors including business and market conditions. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.79 to $0.83 for the fiscal first quarter of 2012. For all of fiscal 2012, including the benefit of the 53rd week and the incremental operating costs from the previously discussed major initiatives, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high-single-digit to a low-double-digit percentage range. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes approximately $83.9 million of investments related to auction rate securities. 
These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities. 
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of February 25, 2012, inventories at cost were approximately $2.1 billion or $57.35 per square foot, an increase of approximately 2.1% on a per square foot basis over last year. 
Consolidated shareholders equity at February 25, 2012, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $359 million, representing approximately 5.9 million shares repurchased during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011. As of February 25, 2012, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $919 million. 
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the first quarter ending on May 26, 2012, will be on Wednesday, June 20, 2012. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, April 4, to take your calls.

I'm pleased to report that our company's net earnings per diluted share increased approximately 32% in both the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year to approximately $1.48 and $4.06, respectively. We're pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength as we constantly challenge ourselves to improve in every aspect of our operation.
Our unique decentralized corporate culture continues to produce positive results, and we remain confident that our business will continue to grow successfully in the years ahead. Our entire organization is dedicated to providing our customers with the best possible shopping experience.
During the fourth quarter, we opened 3 buybuy BABY stores, bringing the total number of stores opened in fiscal 2011 to 38 stores across all our concepts, as well as relocated 3 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and closed one Harmon store. 
Consolidated store space at February 25, 2012, is approximately 36.1 million square feet, an increase of approximately 3% over the end of last year's fourth quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal first quarter of 2012, we've opened 2 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,175 stores, consisting of 995 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 71 Christmas Tree Shop stores; 64 buybuy BABY stores and 45 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. 
In addition, we're a partner in a joint venture which operates 2 stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2012, including the 2 additional stores we've opened to date, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 40 stores across all our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2012 mix of store openings by concept will be comparable to fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility. 
As always, we apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or right-size our stores in response to changing market conditions.
We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there's an opportunity to operate an excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as continue to grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in stores across all our concepts. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise categories.
We're focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and continue the development of our interactive platforms has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers. 
As we consistently said, the continued success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. 
We have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in this conference call. As Warren said, we are pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the continued strong results we have experienced. 
While consumer confidence and spending continues to be impacted by the continuing economic challenges, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service. As always, we will continue to invest in all aspects of our company and work to enhance our customer's overall experience in store, online and through social media and mobile devices. We remain committed to being our customer's first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, compete for and increase our market share and over the long term, continue to grow shareholder value. And taking this long-term approach to the growth and development of our business and through the ongoing efforts to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices throughout our organization, we expect, over time, to do more for and with our customers.
As we previously announced, we're in the process of relocating our offices in Farmingdale and Garden City, New York to our corporate headquarters here in Union, New Jersey. This transition is being made to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all our concepts, activities and platforms and to support the continuing growth of our company. We expect this transition to be substantially completed by the end of this summer.
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 performance. As reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $1.48, an increase of approximately 32% when compared to the $1.12 per diluted share that we earned in last year's fourth quarter. For all of fiscal 2011, net earnings per diluted share were $4.06 compared with $3.07 earned last year, also an increase of approximately 32%. 
Net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, approximately 9.1% higher than in the prior year. For all of fiscal 2011, net sales were approximately $9.5 billion, about 8.5% higher than last year. Fourth quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 6.8% compared with an increase of 8.5% last year. For the full year, comp store sales increased by approximately 5.9%, compared with an increase of approximately 7.8% last year. The increases in comp store sales for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2011 were attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount. 
Gross profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 42.6% of net sales compared to approximately 43% of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in inventory acquisition costs, coupons, shrink and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, partially offset by a reduction in markdowns. 
Gross profit for the full fiscal year was approximately 41.4% of net sales, the same as the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales included a reduction in markdowns, offset by an increase in inventory acquisition costs and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
In the fiscal fourth quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 22.4% of net sales as compared to approximately 24.6% of net sales in last year's fiscal fourth quarter, a decrease of approximately 220 basis points. For all of fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 24.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.7% of net sales for all of fiscal 2010, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points. These decreases can primarily be attributed to lower payroll, occupancy, advertising and store expenses as a percentage of net sales, all of which benefited from the positive comp for both the fiscal fourth quarter and full year. In addition, advertising as a percentage of net sales for both the fiscal fourth quarter and full year benefited from a reduction in the mailing of advertising pieces. 
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margins for both the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year were higher than in the same periods a year ago by approximately 180 basis points. 
Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 36.6% compared to approximately 38.7% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 210 basis points. For all of fiscal 2011, our provision for income taxes was approximately 37% compared to approximately 38.8% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 180 basis points. 
These provisions for the current fiscal quarter and full year of 2011 included net after-tax benefits of $6.6 million and $20.7 million, respectively, due to distinct tax events occurring during the periods. 
Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2011 were approximately $243.4 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
We again want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing to improve our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As you heard from Warren and Steve, we earned $1.48 per diluted share in our fiscal fourth quarter and $4.06 per diluted share for all of fiscal 2011. We were encouraged by our positive fiscal fourth quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the coming year. 
Our planning assumptions for fiscal 2012 which began on February 26, 2012, and which will be 53 weeks, include the following: One, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 40 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2012's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility. 
We also will continue to place Harmon Face Values health and beauty care offerings in selected stores across all our concepts. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. 
Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012. 
Three, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are planned to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million which, of course, remains subject to the timing and composition of the projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square-foot e-commerce fulfillment center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey, and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support our ongoing technology initiatives. Currently, we estimate the incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.09 per diluted share, including -- I'm sorry, occurring primarily in the second half of fiscal 2012. 
Four, we are modeling a 2 to 4 percentage increase in comparable store sales for the first quarter and full year. 
Five, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 4% to 6% for the first quarter and 5% to 7% for the full year. 
Six, depreciation for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $180 million to $190 million. 
Seven, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are relatively consistent with last year, in addition to the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, and including the incremental operating costs associated with the previously discussed major initiatives, we are modeling operating profit margin as a percentage of net sales to be flat for the first quarter and to be in the range of flat to deleveraged for the full year. 
Eight, interest income is expected to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2011. 
Nine, the first quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid to high 30s percentage range, with the expected variability as distinct tax events occur. 
Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally-generated sources. 
Eleven, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by the end of the fiscal year. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors including business and market conditions. 
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.79 to $0.83 for the fiscal first quarter of 2012. For all of fiscal 2012, including the benefit of the 53rd week and the incremental operating costs from the previously discussed major initiatives, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high-single-digit to a low-double-digit percentage range. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes approximately $83.9 million of investments related to auction rate securities. 
These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3.7 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Since this valuation adjustment is deemed temporary, it did not affect the company's earnings. As we have said in the past and as we have experienced to date, we believe that given the high credit quality of these investments, we will ultimately recover, at par, all amounts invested in these securities. 
Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. As of February 25, 2012, inventories at cost were approximately $2.1 billion or $57.35 per square foot, an increase of approximately 2.1% on a per square foot basis over last year. 
Consolidated shareholders equity at February 25, 2012, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $359 million, representing approximately 5.9 million shares repurchased during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011. As of February 25, 2012, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $919 million. 
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the first quarter ending on May 26, 2012, will be on Wednesday, June 20, 2012. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, April 4, to take your calls. 
As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

We are extremely excited about the opportunities provided by these acquisitions.  In a few minutes, Steven and Gene will also provide some additional information regarding these transactions.
On the first quarter activities included the opening of 2 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 4 buybuy BABY stores, and 1 Christmas Tree Shop stores. But additionally, we continue to relocate and renovate Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Consolidated store space at May 26, 2012 was approximately 36.3 million square feet, an increase of approximately 3% over the end of last year's first quarter.

Turning to our fiscal first quarter of 2012 performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.89, an increase of approximately 24% when compared to the $0.72 per diluted share that we earned in last year's first quarter. Net sales for the fiscal first quarter were approximately $2.2 billion, approximately 5.1% higher than in the prior year. First quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 3% compared with an increase of approximately 7% last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal first quarter was attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount.
Gross profit for the fiscal first quarter was approximately 40% of net sales compared to approximately 40.6% of net sales for the first quarter of 2011. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in coupons, due to increases in both the redemptions and the average coupon amount, as well as a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter were approximately 25.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.9% of net sales in last year's fiscal first quarter, a decrease of approximately 100 basis points. This decrease can primarily be attributed to lower payroll and payroll-related expenses and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, both of which benefited from the positive comp.  Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal first quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 40 basis points.
Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal first quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 33.8% compared to approximately 37.6% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 380 basis points. These provisions included net after-tax benefits of $14.6 million this year and $3.8 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these periods.
Capital expenditures for the fiscal first quarter of 2012 were approximately $70.8 million, principally from new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
As Len said, we announced on May 9, 2012, that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of Cost Plus Inc., a retailer selling a wide range of home decorating grading items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items, and gourmet food and beverages. We expect the tender offer for Cost Plus outstanding shares to be completed during our fiscal second quarter. 
Additionally, on June 1, 2012, subsequent to our fiscal first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Linen Holdings LLC, a business to business distributer of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to customers in the hospitality, cruise line, food service, health care and other industries. We welcome all of our new associates, customers and suppliers to the Bed Bath & Beyond family.
Both of these companies are run by experienced management who will enable us to enhance our combined operations going forward. We are excited about these acquisitions and their potential for furtherer our mission of doing more for and with our current and prospective customers.
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders, through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
As always, we want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunity to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, continuing our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

One, the benefit from the results of operations for Linen Holdings is included in our modeling. However, it did not have a material effect for the fiscal second quarter or for all of fiscal 2012.

Four, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012  are planned to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, which of course remains subject to the timing and composition of the projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: The development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square-foot e-commerce fulfillment center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey; and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support our ongoing technology initiatives.  Currently, we estimate the incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.09 per diluted share, occurring primarily in the second half of fiscal 2012.
Five, we are modeling a 25 to 4% increase in comparable store sales for the second quarter and full fiscal year.
Six, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 5% to 7% for the second quarter and 6% to 8% for the full fiscal year.
Seven, depreciation for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $180 million to $190 million.
Eight, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are relatively consistent with last year, in addition to the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories and including the incremental operating costs associated with the previously discussed major initiatives, we are modeling operating profit margin as a percent of net sales to deleverage for the second quarter and slightly deleverage for the full year.
Nine, the second quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid to high 30% range, with expected variability as distinct tax events occur.
Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources.
Eleven, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by the end of the fiscal year. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.97 to $1.03 for the fiscal second quarter of 2012. For all of fiscal 2012, including the benefit of the 53rd week and the incremental operating cost from the previously discussed major initiatives, we continue to model net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single digit to a low double-digit percentage range over fiscal 2011.
While our planning assumptions do not include the results of Cost Plus Inc., in the event that the tender offer is completed as anticipated during the fiscal second quarter, we expect the inclusion of Cost Plus Inc.'s results would impact our previously discussed modeling as follows:
One, in our fiscal second quarter, net earnings per diluted share, including transaction and integration costs, would decrease by several cents.
Two, in our second half of fiscal 2012, net earnings per diluted share, including integration costs, would increase and be slightly accretive.
Three, for fiscal year 2012, net earnings per diluted share would remain in the range of a high single-digit to a low double-digit increase over fiscal 2011.
Four, the acquisition will not impact our plan to completion of the current share repurchase program by the end of fiscal 2012. As always, the share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal first quarter, which, as a reminder, due to the timing and status, do not include the results of Linen Holdings and Cost Plus.  Our balance sheet and cash flows remains strong. We ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.8 billion. Assuming the completion of the Cost Plus transaction in our fiscal second quarter, we would expect cash used in our fiscal second quarter for both the Linen Holdings and Cost Plus acquisitions to be approximately $650 million.
As of May 26, 2012, inventories at cost were approximately $2.2 billion or $60.63 per square foot, an increase of approximately 2.4% on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's first quarter. Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Consolidated shareholders equity at May 26, 2012 was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $306 million, representing approximately 4.6 million shares repurchased during the fiscal first quarter of 2012. As of May 26, 2012, the remaining balance of the share of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $613 million.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the second quarter ending on August 25, 2012, will be on Wednesday, September 19, 2012. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, June 20, to take your calls.
As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond"

And subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Linen Holdings, LLC, a business-to-business distributor of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods. We are extremely excited about the opportunities provided by these acquisitions. In a few minutes, Steven and Gene will also provide some additional information regarding these transactions.
Other first quarter activities included the opening of 2 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 4 buybuy BABY stores and 1 Christmas Tree Shops stores. Additionally, we continue to relocate and renovate Bed Bath & Beyond stores. 
Consolidated store space at May 26, 2012, was approximately 36.3 million square feet, an increase of approximately 3% over the end of last year's first quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2012, we have opened 2 additional Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 3 additional buybuy BABY stores. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,185 stores, consisting of 997 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 72 Christmas Tree Shops stores; 71 buybuy BABY stores; and 45 stores under the name Harmon or Harmon Face Values.  
In addition, we are a partner in a joint venture which operates 2 stores in the Mexico City market under the name Home & More.
During fiscal 2012, including the 12 additional stores we have opened to date, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 40 stores across all our concepts, excluding Cost Plus World Market stores, as the transaction has not yet been completed. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2012's  mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility.
As always, we apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions.  
We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, again, excluding Cost Plus World Market stores as the transaction has not yet been completed, there's an opportunity to operate an excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in selected stores across all of our concepts, as well as World Market food departments in selected Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise categories.  
We are focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, to grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and to continue the development of our interactive platform has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers.
As we have consistently said, the success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market by market basis. We have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in this conference call. We are pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation and overall financial strength. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the strong results we have experienced.
Despite the ongoing economic challenges that are affecting consumers, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service. As always, we will continue to invest in all aspects of our company and work to enhance our customer's overall experience in store, online and through mobile devices and social media. We remain committed to being our customer's first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, compete for and increase our market share and to grow shareholder value over time. And taking this long-term approach to the growth and development of our business and through the ongoing efforts to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices throughout our organization, we expect over time to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal first quarter of 2012 performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.89, an increase of approximately 24% when compared to the $0.72 per diluted share that we earned in last year's first quarter. Net sales for the fiscal first quarter were approximately $2.2 billion, approximately 5.1% higher than in the prior year. First quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 3% compared with an increase of approximately 7% last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal first quarter was attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount.
Gross profit for the fiscal first quarter was approximately 40% of net sales compared to approximately 40.6% of net sales for the first quarter of 2011. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in coupons, due to increases in both the redemptions and the average coupon amount, as well as a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter were approximately 25.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.9% of net sales in last year's fiscal first quarter, a decrease of approximately 100 basis points. This decrease can primarily be attributed to lower payroll and payroll-related expenses and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, both of which benefited from the positive comp.  
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal first quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 40 basis points.
Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal first quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 33.8% compared to approximately 37.6% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 380 basis points. These provisions included net after-tax benefits of $14.6 million this year and $3.8 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these periods.
Capital expenditures for the fiscal first quarter of 2012 were approximately $70.8 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
As Len said, we announced on May 9, 2012, that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Cost Plus, Inc., a retailer selling a wide range of home decorating items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items, and gourmet food and beverages. We expect the tender offer for Cost Plus outstanding shares to be completed during our fiscal second quarter. 
Additionally, on June 1, 2012, subsequent to our fiscal first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Linen Holdings, LLC, a business-to-business distributer of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to customers in the hospitality, cruise line, food service, health care and other industries. 
We welcome all of our new associates, customers and suppliers to the Bed Bath & Beyond family  Both of these companies are run by experienced management who will enable us to enhance our combined operations going forward. We are excited about these acquisitions and their potential for furthering our mission of doing more for and with our current and prospective customers.
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
As always, we want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunity to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As you heard from Len and Steve, we earned $0.89 per diluted share in our fiscal first quarter. While we are encouraged by our positive fiscal first quarter results, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the coming year. 
The following are the planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2012, which consist of 53 weeks and exclude Cost Plus, Inc. as the transaction has not yet been completed. 
One, the benefit from the results of operations for Linen Holdings is included in our modeling. However, it did not have a material effect for the fiscal second quarter or for all of fiscal 2012.
Two, including the 12 stores opened so far this year, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 40 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2012's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2011.

Four, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012  are planned to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, which, of course, remain subject to the timing and composition of the projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square-foot e-commerce fulfillment center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey; and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support our ongoing technology initiatives.

Five, we are modeling a 2% to 4% increase in comparable store sales for the second quarter and full fiscal year.
Six, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 5% to 7% for the second quarter and 6% to 8% for the full fiscal year.

As always, we apply our stringent standards to growth as we evaluate new store sites, as well as continue to review our existing locations and lease terms for opportunities to relocate and/or rightsize our stores in response to changing market conditions.
We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, again, excluding Cost Plus World Market stores as the transaction has not yet been completed, there is an opportunity to operate an excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in selected stores across all of our concepts, as well as World Market food departments in selected Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise categories.
We are focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores by evolving the merchandise offerings, as well as by expanding, renovating, and/or relocating stores to enhance our customer shopping experience. Our ability to leverage the breadth and depth of our merchandise offerings, to grow our bridal, baby and gift registries and to continue the development of our interactive platform has afforded us additional opportunities to attract new customers.
As we have consistently said, the success of our company is due to the tremendous efforts of our associates and to our unique decentralized culture. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market by market basis. We have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in this conference call. We are pleased that we have been able to continue our strong performance in terms of earnings growth, cash flow generation, and overall financial strength. We believe the dedication and talents of our associates and their constant focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the strong results we have experienced.
Despite the ongoing economic challenges that are affecting consumers, our fundamental business strategy remains unchanged: to offer a broad assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service. As always, we will continue to invest in all aspects of our company and work to enhance our customer's overall experience in store, online and through mobile devices and social media. We remain committed to being our customer's first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably, compete for, and increase our market share and to grow shareholder value over time. In taking this long-term approach to the growth and development of our business and through the ongoing efforts to cross-merchandise and leverage our best practices throughout our organization, we expect over time to do more for and with our customers.
Turning to our fiscal first quarter of 2012 performance, as reported earlier today, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.89, an increase of approximately 24% when compared to the $0.72 per diluted share that we earned in last year's first quarter. Net sales for the fiscal first quarter were approximately $2.2 billion, approximately 5.1% higher than in the prior year. First quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 3% compared with an increase of approximately 7% to last year. The increase in comp store sales for the fiscal first quarter was attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount.
Gross profit for the fiscal first quarter was approximately 40% of net sales compared to approximately 40.6% of net sales for the first quarter of 2011. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in coupons, due to increases in both the redemptions and the average coupon amount, as well as a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal first quarter were approximately 25.9% of net sales as compared to approximately 26.9% of net sales in last year's fiscal first quarter, a decrease of approximately 100 basis points. This decrease can primarily be attributed to lower payroll and payroll-related expenses and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales, both of which benefited from the positive comp.
Reflecting the movements in gross profit margin and SG&A expenses, the operating profit margin for the fiscal first quarter was higher than in the same period a year ago by approximately 40 basis points.
Our provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal first quarter, our provision for income taxes was approximately 33.8% compared to approximately 37.6% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 380 basis points. These provisions included net after-tax benefits of $14.6 million this year and $3.8 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these periods.
Capital expenditures for the fiscal first quarter of 2012 were approximately $70.8 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
As Len said, we announced on May 9, 2012, that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Cost Plus, Inc., a retailer selling a wide range of home decorating items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items, and gourmet food and beverages. We expect the tender offer for Cost Plus' outstanding shares to be completed during our fiscal second quarter.
Additionally, on June 1, 2012, subsequent to our fiscal first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Linen Holdings, LLC, a business-to-business distributer of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods to customers in the hospitality, cruise line, food service, health care and other industries.
We welcome all of our new associates, customers and suppliers to the Bed Bath & Beyond family  Both of these companies are run by experienced management who will enable us to enhance our combined operations going forward. We are excited about these acquisitions and their potential for furthering our mission of doing more for and with our current and prospective customers.
Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
As always, we want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, continuing our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As you heard from Len and Steve, we earned $0.89 per diluted share in our fiscal first quarter. While we are encouraged by our positive fiscal first quarter results, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the coming year.
The following are the planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2012, which consist of 53 weeks and exclude Cost Plus, Inc. as the transaction has not yet been completed.
One, the benefit from the results of operations for Linen Holdings is included in our modeling. However, it did not have a material effect for the fiscal second quarter or for all of fiscal 2012.
Two, including the 12 stores opened so far this year, we anticipate opening a total of approximately 40 stores across all of our concepts. Currently, we believe that fiscal 2012's mix of store openings by concept will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Also, we will continue to place Harmon Face Values health and beauty care offerings in selected stores across all of our concepts, as well as add World Market food departments in selected Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
Three, we expect to continue our program of relocating, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012.
Four, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012  are planned to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, which, of course, remain subject to the timing and composition of the projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square-foot e-commerce fulfillment center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey; and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support our ongoing technology initiatives.  Currently, we estimate the incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.09 per diluted share occurring primarily in the second half of fiscal 2012.
Five, we are modeling a 2% to 4% increase in comparable store sales for the second quarter and full fiscal year.
Six, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 5% to 7% for the second quarter and 6% to 8% for the full fiscal year.
Seven, depreciation for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $180 million to $190 million.
Eight, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are relatively consistent with last year, in addition to the continuation of the shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories, and including the incremental operating costs associated with the previously discussed major initiatives, we are modeling operating profit margin as a percent of net sales to deleverage for the second quarter and slightly deleverage for the full year.
Nine, the second quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid- to high 30s percent range, with expected variability as distinct tax events occur.
Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources.
Eleven, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by the end of the fiscal year. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.97 to $1.03 for the fiscal second quarter of 2012. For all of fiscal 2012, including the benefit of the 53rd week and the incremental operating cost from the previously discussed major initiatives, we continue to model net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage range over fiscal 2011.
While our planning assumptions do not include the results of Cost Plus, Inc., in the event that the tender offer is completed as anticipated during the fiscal second quarter, we expect the inclusion of Cost Plus, Inc.'s results would impact our previously discussed modeling as follows.
One, in our fiscal second quarter, net earnings per diluted share, including transaction and integration costs, would decrease by several cents.
Two, in our second half of fiscal 2012, net earnings per diluted share, including integration costs, would increase and be slightly accretive.
Three, for fiscal year 2012, net earnings per diluted share would remain in the range of a high single-digit to a low double-digit increase over fiscal 2011.
Four, the acquisition will not impact our plan to completion of the current share repurchase program by the end of fiscal 2012. As always, the share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal first quarter, which, as a reminder, due to the timing and status, do not include the results of Linen Holdings and Cost Plus.
Our balance sheet and cash flows remains strong. We ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $1.8 billion. Assuming the completion of the Cost Plus transaction in our fiscal second quarter, we would expect the cash used in our fiscal second quarter for both the Linen Holdings and Cost Plus acquisitions to be approximately $650 million.
As of May 26, 2012, inventories at cost were approximately $2.2 billion or $60.63 per square foot, an increase of approximately 2.4% on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's first quarter. Inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Consolidated shareholders equity at May 26, 2012, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $306 million, representing approximately 4.6 million shares repurchased during the fiscal first quarter of 2012. As of May 26, 2012, the remaining balance of the share -- of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $613 million.
As a reminder, our next conference call to review operating results for the second quarter ending on August 25, 2012, will be on Wednesday, September 19, 2012. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, June 20, to take your calls.
As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

As pre",599,"Thanks, Gene, and good afternoon. We are pleased to report our company's fiscal second quarter net earnings with a diluted share of $0.98, which after accounting for the World Market and Linen Holdings acquisition, was at the high end of our model. As previously announced, we are excited that during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of both Cost Plus, Inc. and Linen Holdings, LLC. Cost Plus, Inc, which we will refer to as World Market, is a retailer with 258 stores in 30 states at a time of the acquisition, operating under the names of World Market, Cost Plus World Market and World Market Stores that sell a wide range of home decorating items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items and specialty food and beverages.
Linen Holdings is a business-to-business distributor of a variety of textile products, amenities and other groups. And we're looking forward to the opportunities provided by these acquisitions to do more for and with our collective customers. In a few minutes, Steven and Gene will provide some additional information regarding these transactions.
In addition to these transactions, other second quarter activities include the opening of 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 3 buybuy BABY stores, 2 Harmon Face Values store and 1 Christmas Tree Shops store. We also continued to relocate and renovate stores throughout the company. At August 25, 2012, consolidated store space including the 258 World Market Stores was approximately 41.4 million square feet, an increase of approximately 16.3% over the end of last year's second quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal third quarter of 2012, we opened 3 World Market Stores, our first opening since the acquisition was completed, and 1 additional buybuy BABY store. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,453 stores, consisting of 1,000 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 261 World Market Stores; 73 Christmas Tree Shops stores; and 72 buybuy BABY stores and 47 stores under the name Harmon or Harmon Face Values. During fiscal 2012, including the 22 stores we have opened to date and including several anticipated World Market openings, we have modeled opening approximately 45 stores across all our concepts. We believe that fiscal 2012 mix of store openings by concept, excluding World Market  will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility. We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our World Market, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in selected stores as well as specialty food and beverage departments in selected Bed Bath & Beyond stores.
We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise categories.

The prospects opened by our newly added, dedicated and talented people are extremely exciting to our organization and as Warren mentioned, we look forward to the opportunities that combination of all our concepts gives us to do more for and with our collective customers. We're also excited about the completion of the relocation of our offices in Farmingdale and Garden City, New York to our corporate headquarters in union, New Jersey. As a result of this relocation, we expect to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all our concepts, activities and platforms to enhance the continuing growth of our company.

Turning to our fiscal second quarter of 2012 performance, which includes the results of World Market and Linen Holdings from the date of each acquisition, the end of the quarter, we reported earlier today that our fiscal second quarter net earnings per diluted share are $0.98, an increase of approximately 5.4% when compared to the $0.93 per diluted share that we earned in last year's second quarter. For the fiscal first half, net earnings per diluted share were $1.87, an increase of approximately 13.3% compared to the $1.65 earned last year.
Net sales for the fiscal second quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, approximately 12.1% higher than in prior year. Of this increase, approximately 57% was the result of our recently completed acquisitions, approximately 29% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 14% resulted primarily from new stores. Net sales for the fiscal first half of the year were approximately $4.8 billion, approximately 8.8% higher than in the fiscal first half of 2011. Of this increase, approximately 41% was the result of our recently completed acquisitions, approximately 37% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 22% resulted primarily from new stores.
Excluding World Market and Linen Holdings for the purpose of our comp store sales calculations, second quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 3.5% compared with an increase of approximately 5.6% last year. For the fiscal first half, comp store sales increased by approximately 3.3% compared with an increase of approximately 6.3% last year. These increases in comp store sales for the fiscal second quarter and for the fiscal first half of 2012 were attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount.
Gross profit for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 39.8% of net sales compared to approximately 41.1% of net sales for the second quarter of 2011. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in coupons due to an increase in bulk redemptions and the average coupon amount as well as a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories and the inclusion of World Markets financial results. Gross profit for the fiscal first half was approximately 39.9% compared to approximately 40.9% of net sales for the fiscal first half of 2011. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of sales is primarily attributed to an increase in coupon due to increases in the bulk of redemptions and the average coupon amount as well as a shift in the mix of the merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
As for selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter, they were approximately 25.7% of net sales as compared to approximately 25% of net sales in last year's fiscal second quarter, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. This increase can primarily be attributed to higher expenses for payroll and payroll related cost, occupancy costs and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. Each of these expense items was impacted by the inclusion of World Market's financial results and their higher percentage to these categories. In addition, professional fees were higher due to our acquisitions. Lastly, payroll and payroll related costs were also impacted by our office relocation. For the fiscal first half, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 25.8% of net sales, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points when compared to approximately 25.9% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2011.
Just as a reminder, the consolidation of World Market and Linen Holdings financial results will be slightly accretive to our earnings per diluted share for the full year but will increase certain expenses such as payroll and occupancy as a percentage of net sales. The deleverage as a result of the consolidation will continue until we anniversary the acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. With all that said, the operating profit margin for the fiscal second quarter was lower than in the same period a year ago by approximately 200 basis points.
For the fiscal first half, the operating margin decreased by approximately 80 basis points. The provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal second quarter, the provision for income taxes was approximately 38.6% compared to approximately 38% for the comparable quarter last year, an increase of approximately 60 basis points.
For the fiscal first half, the provision for income taxes was approximately 36.4% compared to approximately 37.8% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 140 basis points. The fiscal first half provisions included net after-tax benefits of $15.3 million this year and $5 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these periods.
Capital expenditures. Let's see if we could say that again, Capital expenditures for the fiscal first half of 2012 were approximately $158.1 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, Information Technology enhancements and other projects that are important to our future, including the development of an enhanced website experience, our office relocation, new e-commerce fulfillment center and new IT Data Center. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success. Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.

The following are the planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2012, which consists of 53 weeks and includes World Market and Linen Holdings from the date of each acquisition to the end of the fiscal year.
One, as Warren said, including the 22 stores opened to-date and including several anticipated World Market openings, we have modeled opening approximately 45 stores across all of our concepts.

As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility.
Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, renovating, and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012.
Three, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012, including World Market and Linen Holdings are now planned to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, which of course, remains subject to the timing and composition of projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, Information Technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square-foot e-commerce fulfillment center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey, for which the remaining construction items are expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year; and the initial phase of a new IT Data Center to support our ongoing technology initiatives. Currently, we estimate the remaining fiscal 2012 incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.06 per diluted share.
Four, we are modeling an increase of 2% to 4% in comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters.
Five, our model reflects that we are not planning to open on Thanksgiving this year. Last year, approximately 20% of our stores were opened that night.
Six, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, including our newly acquired companies, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 15% to 18% for the third quarter and by 24% to 26% in the fourth quarter.
Seven, depreciation for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $195 million to $205 million.
Eight, assuming these sound levels and modeling advertising events that are relatively consistent with last year, we are modeling operating profit margin as a percentage of net sales to deleverage for the third and fourth quarters, as well as the full year. Significantly contributing to this -- to the deleverage are the shift in mix and merchandise sold to lower margin categories, the incremental operating cost associated with the previously discussed major initiatives and the consolidation of World Market and Linen Holdings financial results, which will be slightly accretive to our earnings per diluted share for the year, but will increase certain expenses such as payroll and occupancy as a percentage of net sales. The deleverage as a result of the consolidation will continue until we anniversary the acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
Nine, the third and fourth quarter tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percent range with expected variability as distinct tax events occur. 
10, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources.
11, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by the end of the fiscal year. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.99 to $1.04 for the fiscal third quarter of 2012. For all of fiscal 2012, including the benefit of the 53rd week, the incremental operating costs from the previously discussed major initiatives, the transaction and integration costs related to the recently completed acquisitions and the results of the newly acquired companies, we continue to model net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range over fiscal 2011.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal second quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remains strong. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $991 million. This includes approximately $75.3 million of investments related to auction-rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Subsequent to the end of the second fiscal quarter, the company tendered approximately $14.3 million of its auction-rate securities at a price equal to 95% of par value. As a result, the company will incur a realized loss of approximately $700,000, which will be reflected in its fiscal third quarter results.
After this redemption, we will hold approximately $61 million of these securities. We will continue to monitor the market for these securities, which up until this tender, had redeemed our securities at par and will expense any permanent changes to the value of our remaining securities, if any as they occur going forward.
As of August 25, 2012, retail inventories at cost including World Market, were approximately $2.4 billion or $58.20 per square foot, a decrease of approximately 2.2% on a per-square-foot basis over the end of last year second quarter. This decrease is the result of the consolidation of World Market financial results. Retail inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at August 25, 2012, was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $199 million representing approximately 3.1 million shares repurchased during the fiscal second quarter of 2012.
As of August 25, 2012, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December of 2010 was approximately $414 million.
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, December 19, 2012. During this call, we will review operating results for the third quarter and 9 months ending on November 24, 2012, and will provide our initial planning assumptions for fiscal 2013. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel, and I will be in our offices this evening, September 19, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

As previ",600,"Thanks, Gene, and good afternoon. We are pleased to report our company's fiscal second quarter net earnings per diluted share of $0.98, which, after accounting for the World Market and Linen Holdings acquisition, was at the high end of our model. As previously announced, we are excited that during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of both Cost Plus, Inc. and Linen Holdings, LLC. Cost Plus, Inc., which we will refer to as World Market, is a retailer with 258 stores in 30 states at the time of the acquisition, operating under the names of World Market, Cost Plus World Market and World Market Stores that sell a wide range of home decorating items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items and specialty food and beverages.
Linen Holdings is a business-to-business distributor of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods. And we're looking forward to the opportunities provided by these acquisitions to do more for and with our collective customers. In a few minutes, Steve and Gene will provide some additional information regarding these transactions.
In addition to these transactions, other second quarter activities included the opening of 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 3 buybuy BABY stores, 2 Harmon Face Values store and 1 Christmas Tree Shops store. We also continued to relocate and renovate stores throughout the company. At August 25, 2012, consolidated store space, including the 258 World Market Stores, was approximately 41.4 million square feet, an increase of approximately 16.3% over the end of last year's second quarter.
Since the beginning of the fiscal first quarter of 2012, we opened 3 World Market Stores, our first opening since the acquisition was completed, and 1 additional buybuy BABY store. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,453 stores, consisting of 1,000 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 261 World Market Stores; 73 Christmas Tree Shops stores; and 72 buybuy BABY stores and 47 stores under the name Harmon or Harmon Face Values.
During fiscal 2012, including the 22 stores we have opened to date and including several anticipated World Market openings, we have modeled opening approximately 45 stores across all our concepts. We believe that fiscal 2012 mix of store openings by concept, excluding World Market, will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility.
We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our World Market, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in selected stores as well as specialty food and beverage departments in selected Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise categories.
Our culture and the tremendous efforts of our associates have been and remain the key to our company's long term success. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates has always been the foundation of our long term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We believe we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near and long term goals.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in this conference call. Before reviewing our fiscal second quarter results that have been reported within the last hour, I'd like to again, welcome the associates, customers and vendors of World Market and Linen Holdings to Bed Bath & Beyond's growing family. The prospects offered by our newly added, dedicated and talented people are extremely exciting to our organization and as Warren mentioned, we look forward to the opportunities that combination of all our concepts gives us to do more for and with our collective customers.
We're also excited about the completion of the relocation of our offices in Farmingdale and Garden City, New York to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey. As a result of this relocation, we expect to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all our concepts, activities and platforms to enhance the continuing growth of our company.
Offering a broad and deep assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service remains at the core of our identity. At the same time, we remain focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores and enhancing our customer experience by expanding our product offerings to both new and existing customers; expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores; growing our bridal, baby and gift registries; and continuing the development of our interactive platforms. We continue to invest in all aspects of our company to enhance our customer's overall experience in store, online and through mobile devices and social media, and remain committed to being our customer's first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably and increase market share and shareholder value over time.
We are pleased that we've been able to continue our strong performance despite the ongoing challenges that continue to affect consumers. We believe our culture and the dedication and talents of our associates and their focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the strong results we have experienced.
Turning to our fiscal second quarter of 2012 performance, which includes the results of World Market and Linen Holdings from the date of each acquisition, the end of the quarter, we reported earlier today that our fiscal second quarter net earnings per diluted share are $0.98, an increase of approximately 5.4% when compared to the $0.93 per diluted share that we earned in last year's second quarter. For the fiscal first half, net earnings per diluted share were $1.87, an increase of approximately 13.3% compared to the $1.65 earned last year.
Net sales for the fiscal second quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, approximately 12.1% higher than in prior year. Of this increase, approximately 57% was the result of our recently completed acquisitions, approximately 29% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 14% resulted primarily from new stores. Net sales for the fiscal first half of the year were approximately $4.8 billion, approximately 8.8% higher than in the fiscal first half of 2011. Of this increase, approximately 41% was the result of our recently completed acquisitions, approximately 37% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 22% resulted primarily from new stores.
Excluding World Market and Linen Holdings for the purpose of our comp store sales calculations, second quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 3.5% compared with an increase of approximately 5.6% last year. For the fiscal first half, comp store sales increased by approximately 3.3% compared with an increase of approximately 6.3% last year. These increases in comp store sales for the fiscal second quarter and for the fiscal first half of 2012 were attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount.
Gross profit for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 39.8% of net sales compared to approximately 41.1% of net sales for the second quarter of 2011. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in coupons due to an increase in both the redemptions and the average coupon amount as well as a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories and the inclusion of World Markets financial results.
Gross profit for the fiscal first half was approximately 39.9% compared to approximately 40.9% of net sales for the fiscal first half of 2011. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of sales is primarily attributed to an increase in coupons due to increases in both the redemptions and the average coupon amount as well as a shift in the merchandise -- in the mix of the merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
As for selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter, they were approximately 25.7% of net sales as compared to approximately 25% of net sales in last year's fiscal second quarter, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. This increase can primarily be attributed to higher expenses for payroll and payroll-related cost, occupancy costs and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. Each of these expense items was impacted by the inclusion of World Market's financial results and their higher percentages for these categories. In addition, professional fees were higher due to our acquisitions. Lastly, payroll and payroll-related costs were also impacted by our office relocation. For the fiscal first half, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 25.8% of net sales, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points when compared to approximately 25.9% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2011.
Just as a reminder, the consolidation of World Market and Linen Holdings' financial results will be slightly accretive to our earnings per diluted share for the full year but will increase certain expenses such as payroll and occupancy as a percentage of net sales. The deleverage as a result of the consolidation will continue until we anniversary the acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. With all that said, the operating profit margin for the fiscal second quarter was lower than in the same period a year ago by approximately 200 basis points. For the fiscal first half, the operating margin decreased by approximately 80 basis points.
The provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal second quarter, the provision for income taxes was approximately 38.6% compared to approximately 38% for the comparable quarter last year, an increase of approximately 60 basis points. For the fiscal first half, the provision for income taxes was approximately 36.4% compared to approximately 37.8% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 140 basis points. The fiscal first half provisions included net after-tax benefits of $15.3 million this year and $5 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these periods.
Capital expenditures. Let's see if we could say that again. Capital expenditures for the fiscal first half of 2012 were approximately $158.1 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, Information Technology enhancements and other projects that are important to our future, including the development of an enhanced website experience, our office relocation, new E-Commerce Fulfillment Center and new IT Data Center.
While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long term success. Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
As always, we want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, improving our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

While we're encouraged by our positive fiscal second quarter results, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the coming year. The following are the planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2012, which consists of 53 weeks and includes World Market and Linen Holdings from the date of each acquisition to the end of the fiscal year.
One, as Warren said, including the 22 stores opened to date and including several anticipated World Market openings, we have modeled opening approximately 45 stores across all of our concepts. We believe that fiscal 2012's mix of store openings by concept, excluding World Market, will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2011.

Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, renovating, and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012.
Three, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012, including World Market and Linen Holdings, are now planned to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, which, of course, remains subject to the timing and composition of projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, Information Technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: The development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square foot E-Commerce Fulfillment Center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey, for which the remaining construction items are expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year; and the initial phase of a new IT Data Center to support our ongoing technology initiatives. Currently, we estimate the remaining fiscal 2012 incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.06 per diluted share.
Four, we are modeling an increase of 2% to 4% in comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters.
Five, our model reflects that we are not planning to open on Thanksgiving this year. Last year, approximately 20% of our stores were opened that night.

Eleven, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by the end of the fiscal year. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.

Cost Plus, Inc., which we will refer to as World Market, is a retailer with 258 stores in 30 states at the time of the acquisition, operating under the names of World Market, Cost Plus World Market and World Market Stores that sell a wide range of home decorating items, furniture, gifts, holiday and other seasonal items and specialty food and beverages.
Linen Holdings is a business-to-business distributor of a variety of textile products, amenities and other goods. And we're looking forward to the opportunities provided by these acquisitions to do more for and with our collective customers. In a few minutes, Steve and Gene will provide some additional information regarding these transactions.
In addition to these transactions, other second quarter activities included the opening of 5 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, 3 buybuy BABY stores, 2 Harmon Face Values store and 1 Christmas Tree Shops store. We also continued to relocate and renovate stores throughout the company. At August 25, 2012, consolidated store space, including the 258 World Market Stores, was approximately 41.4 million square feet, an increase of approximately 16.3% over the end of last year's second quarter.
Since the beginning of the fiscal first quarter of 2012, we have opened 3 World Market Stores, our first opening since the acquisition was completed, and 1 additional buybuy BABY store. Including these stores, we currently operate 1,453 stores, consisting of 1,000 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 261 World Market Stores; 73 Christmas Tree Shops stores; and 72 buybuy BABY stores and 47 stores under the name Harmon or Harmon Face Values.
During fiscal 2012, including the 22 stores we have opened to date and including several anticipated World Market openings, we have modeled opening approximately 45 stores across all our concepts. We believe that fiscal 2012 mix of store openings by concept, excluding World Market, will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility.
We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our World Market, Christmas Tree Shops, buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in selected stores as well as specialty food and beverage departments in selected Bed Bath & Beyond stores. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all our merchandise categories.
Our culture and the tremendous efforts of our associates have been and remain the key to our company's long term success. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates has always been the foundation of our long term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We believe we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near and long term goals.
And now I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in this conference call. Before reviewing our fiscal second quarter results that have been reported within the last hour, I'd like to again welcome the associates, customers and vendors of World Market and Linen Holdings to Bed Bath & Beyond's growing family. The prospects offered by our newly added, dedicated and talented people are extremely exciting to our organization and as Warren mentioned, we look forward to the opportunities that, in combination with all our concepts, gives us to do more for and with our collective customers.
We're also excited about the completion of the relocation of our offices in Farmingdale and Garden City, New York to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey. As a result of this relocation, we expect to further improve the communication, coordination and execution across all our concepts, activities and platforms to enhance the continuing growth of our company.
Offering a broad and deep assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service remains at the core of our identity. At the same time, we remain focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores and enhancing our customer experience by expanding our product offerings to both new and existing customers; expanding, renovating and/or relocating stores; growing our bridal, baby and gift registries; and continuing the development of our interactive platforms. We continue to invest in all aspects of our company to enhance our customer's overall experience in store, online and through mobile devices and social media, and remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably and increase market share and shareholder value over time.
We are pleased that we've been able to continue our strong performance despite the ongoing challenges that continue to affect consumers. We believe our culture and the dedication and talents of our associates and their focus on improving the overall customer shopping experience, while at the same time creating a more productive and efficient company, are the keys to producing the strong results we have experienced.
Turning to our fiscal second quarter of 2012 performance, which includes the results of World Market and Linen Holdings from the date of each acquisition, the end of the quarter, we reported earlier today that our fiscal second quarter net earnings per diluted share are $0.98, an increase of approximately 5.4% when compared to the $0.93 per diluted share that we earned in last year's second quarter. For the fiscal first half, net earnings per diluted share were $1.87, an increase of approximately 13.3% compared to the $1.65 earned last year.
Net sales for the fiscal second quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, approximately 12.1% higher than in the prior year. Of this increase, approximately 57% was the result of our recently completed acquisitions, approximately 29% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 14% resulted primarily from new stores. Net sales for the fiscal first half of the year were approximately $4.8 billion, approximately 8.8% higher than in the fiscal first half of 2011. Of this increase, approximately 41% was the result of our recently completed acquisitions, approximately 37% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 22% resulted primarily from new stores.
Excluding World Market and Linen Holdings for the purpose of our comp store sales calculations, second quarter comp store sales increased by approximately 3.5% compared with an increase of approximately 5.6% last year. For the fiscal first half, comp store sales increased by approximately 3.3% compared with an increase of approximately 6.3% last year. These increases in comp store sales for the fiscal second quarter and for the fiscal first half of 2012 were attributed to increases in both the number of transactions and the average transaction amount.
Gross profit for the fiscal second quarter was approximately 39.8% of net sales compared to approximately 41.1% of net sales for the second quarter of 2011. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in coupons due to an increase in both the redemptions and the average coupon amount as well as a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories and the inclusion of World Markets financial results.
Gross profit for the fiscal first half was approximately 39.9% compared to approximately 40.9% of net sales for the fiscal first half of 2011. This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of sales is primarily attributed to an increase in coupons due to increases in both the redemptions and the average coupon amount as well as a shift in the merchandise -- in the mix of the merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
As for selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter, they were approximately 25.7% of net sales as compared to approximately 25% of net sales in last year's fiscal second quarter, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. This increase can primarily be attributed to higher expenses for payroll and payroll-related costs, occupancy costs and advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales. Each of these expense items was impacted by the inclusion of World Market's financial results and their higher percentages for these categories. In addition, professional fees were higher due to our acquisitions. Lastly, payroll and payroll-related costs were also impacted by our office relocation. For the fiscal first half, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 25.8% of net sales, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points when compared to approximately 25.9% of net sales in the fiscal first half of 2011.
Just as a reminder, the consolidation of World Market and Linen Holdings' financial results will be slightly accretive to our earnings per diluted share for the full year but will increase certain expenses such as payroll and occupancy as a percentage of net sales. The deleverage as a result of the consolidation will continue until we anniversary the acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. With all that said, the operating profit margin for the fiscal second quarter was lower than in the same period a year ago by approximately 200 basis points. For the fiscal first half, the operating margin decreased by approximately 80 basis points.
The provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal second quarter, the provision for income taxes was approximately 38.6% compared to approximately 38% for the comparable quarter last year, an increase of approximately 60 basis points. For the fiscal first half, the provision for income taxes was approximately 36.4% compared to approximately 37.8% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 140 basis points. The fiscal first half provisions included net after-tax benefits of $15.3 million this year and $5 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these periods.
Capital expenditures. Let's see if we could say that again. Capital expenditures for the fiscal first half of 2012 were approximately $158.1 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, Information Technology enhancements and other projects that are important to our future, including the development of an enhanced website experience, our office relocation, new E-Commerce Fulfillment Center and new IT Data Center.
While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long term success. Our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
As always, we want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, improving our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.
I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"

As Warren said, we are pleased with the $0.98 per diluted share that we earned during the fiscal second quarter, which, after accounting for the World Market and Linen Holdings acquisitions, was at the high end of our model. While we are encouraged by our positive fiscal second quarter results, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the coming year. The following are the planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2012, which consists of 53 weeks and includes World Market and Linen Holdings from the date of each acquisition to the end of the fiscal year.
One, as Warren said, including the 22 stores opened to date and including several anticipated World Market openings, we have modeled opening approximately 45 stores across all of our concepts. We believe that fiscal 2012's mix of store openings by concept, excluding World Market, will be relatively comparable to that of fiscal 2011. As the year progresses, the total number of stores that we will open will be updated as we gain greater visibility.
Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, renovating, and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2012.
Three, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012, including World Market and Linen Holdings, are now planned to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, which, of course, remains subject to the timing and composition of projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, Information Technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: The development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square foot E-Commerce Fulfillment Center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey, for which the remaining construction items are expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year; and the initial phase of a new IT Data Center to support our ongoing technology initiatives. Currently, we estimate the remaining fiscal 2012 incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.06 per diluted share.
Four, we are modeling an increase of 2% to 4% in comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters.
Five, our model reflects that we are not planning to open on Thanksgiving this year. Last year, approximately 20% of our stores were opened that night.
Six, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, including our newly acquired companies, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 15% to 18% for the third quarter and by 24% to 26% in the fourth quarter.
Seven, depreciation for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $195 million to $205 million.
Eight, assuming these sales levels and modeling advertising events that are relatively consistent with last year, we are modeling operating profit margin as a percentage of net sales to deleverage for the third and fourth quarters, as well as the full year. Significantly contributing to this -- to the deleverage are the shift in mix and merchandise sold to lower margin categories, the incremental operating costs associated with the previously discussed major initiatives and the consolidation of World Market and Linen Holdings financial results, which will be slightly accretive to our earnings per diluted share for the year, but will increase certain expenses such as payroll and occupancy as a percentage of net sales. The deleverage as a result of the consolidation will continue until we anniversary of the acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
Nine, the third and fourth quarter tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percent range, with expected variability as distinct tax events occur. 
Ten, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally-generated sources.
Eleven, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current $2 billion repurchase program, which we anticipate completing by the end of the fiscal year. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.99 to $1.04 for the fiscal third quarter of 2012. For all of fiscal 2012, including the benefit of the 53rd week, the incremental operating costs from the previously discussed major initiatives, the transaction and integration costs related to the recently completed acquisitions and the results of the newly acquired companies, we continue to model net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range over fiscal 2011.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal second quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of approximately $991 million. This includes approximately $75.3 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $3 million to reflect their current lack of liquidity. Subsequent to the end of the second fiscal quarter, the company tendered approximately $14.3 million of its auction rate securities at a price equal to 95% of par value. As a result, the company will incur a realized loss of approximately $700,000, which will be reflected in its fiscal third quarter results. After this redemption, we will hold approximately $61 million of these securities. We will continue to monitor the market for these securities, which, up until this tender, had redeemed our securities at par and will expense any permanent changes to the value of our remaining securities, if any, as they occur going forward.
As of August 25, 2012, retail inventories at cost, including World Market, were approximately $2.4 billion or $58.20 per square foot, a decrease of approximately 2.2% on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's second quarter. This decrease is the result of the consolidation of World Market financial results. Retail inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at August 25, 2012 was approximately $3.9 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $199 million, representing approximately 3.1 million shares repurchased during the fiscal second quarter of 2012.
As of August 25, 2012, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December of 2010 was approximately $414 million.
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, December 19, 2012. During this call, we will review operating results for the third quarter and 9 months ending on November 24, 2012, and will provide our initial planning assumptions for fiscal 2013. If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, September 19, to take your calls.
As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond."

Before we begin, on behalf of all the associates of Bed Bath & Beyond, we wish your words that could think off it and make sense of the tragedy that occurred in Connecticut last week. We are deeply troubled trying to find any. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and friends. Because we must -- we now turn to our company's call and our fiscal third quarter, which includes the effects of Hurricane Sandy and our customer's along the East Coast. 
Today we reported net earnings per diluted share of $1.03 for the fiscal third quarter, an increase of approximately 8.4% over the fiscal third quarter of 2011. The third quarter continues our consistent performance in terms of earnings per share growth, cash flow generation and our overall financial strength. With regard to Hurricane Sandy, we continue to work with local organizations and through our stores to provide assistance to those impacted in the affected areas. We understand the restoration process will take time and will be difficult. 
During this quarter, we also continued to the integration of World Market and Linens Holdings and made progress on our initiatives to enhance our website, ramp up our Pendergrass, Georgia e-commerce fulfillment operation, pursue the remaining construction and other follow-up items related to the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey and advance the development of a new IT data center. 
In addition, during the third quarter, we opened 4 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and closed 1; opened 7 buybuy BABY stores; 6 World Market Stores; and 1 Christmas Tree Shops store operating under the name andThat!. AndThat! represents an evolution of the name for the Christmas Tree Shops concept, with stores opening outside existing Christmas Tree Shops markets. 
At November 24, 2012, consolidated store space, including the 264 World Market Stores, was approximately 41.9 million square feet, an increase of approximately 16% over the end of last year's third quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012, we have opened one additional Bed Bath & Beyond store and 2 additional buybuy BABY stores. Including these openings, we currently operate 1,469 stores, consisting of 1,004 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 264 World Market Stores; 80 bye-bye BABY stores; 74 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops or andThat! and 47 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values. 
For the remainder of fiscal 2012, we now anticipate opening 2 additional buybuy BABY stores, bringing our total openings for the year to 41 stores across all our concepts, which as a reminder, includes World Market. 
We believe that throughout the United States and Canada there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our World Market, Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in selected stores, as well as specialty food and beverage departments in selected Bed Bath & Beyond stores, most recently in Schonnberg, Illinois and Virginia. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all merchandise categories. 
At this time, in conjunction with our ongoing review of our capital structure, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program. We are currently planning that the new share repurchase program will commence after the completion of the existing program. Although the boards authorization does not set a time limitation for the share repurchase, for planning purposes, the company anticipates completing the program over the next 3 years or so after it begins. It is currently anticipated that this new $2.5 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and future cash flows. This new program reflects the board's continued confidence in our future and commitment to returning value to our shareholders. Since 2004 through the third quarter of our fiscal 2012, our company has returned approximately $4.7 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases. 
The tremendous efforts of our associates and our unique decentralized culture have been and remain the keys to our company's long-term success. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market by market basis.

Turning as we must to what we need to cover in today's call, despite the effects of Hurricane Sandy, we were able to continue our consistent performance in terms of earnings per share growth, cash flow generation and our overall financial strength. For this, we thank our dedicated and talented associates and their focus on improving our customer's overall shopping experience. 
On an ongoing basis, we continue to invest in all aspects of our company to enhance our customers' experience in store, online and through mobile devices and social media, and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and over the longer term, internationally.

We are focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores and enhancing our customer experience by expanding our product offerings, relocating, renovating and/or expanding stores, continuing the development of our interactive platforms and growing our bridal, baby and gift registries.

Turning to our fiscal third quarter of 2012 performance, we reported earlier today our fiscal third quarter net earnings per diluted share of $1.03, an increase of approximately 8.4% when compared to the $0.95 per diluted share that we earned in last year's third quarter. For the fiscal 9 months, net earnings per diluted share were $2.89, an increase of approximately 11.2% compared to the $2.60 earned last year. Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, approximately 15.3% higher than in the prior year. Of this increase, approximately 79% was the result of the inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings, approximately 11% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 10% resulted primarily from new stores. 
Net sales for the fiscal 9 months of the year were approximately $7.5 billion, approximately 11% higher than in the fiscal 9 months of 2011. Of this increase, approximately 59% was the result of the inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings, approximately 25% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 16% resulted primarily from new stores. 
Third quarter comp store sales, which excludes World Market and Linen Holdings, increased by approximately 1.7% compared with an increase of approximately 4.1% last year. From our company's perspective, Hurricane Sandy occurred during our fiscal third quarter, and its impacted resulted in many of our stores being closed and many of our customers either not having the ability to shop are having much greater concerns than shopping including property damage, electrical outages and gasoline shortages, which include rationing in a number of our markets. We estimate the impact of this disruption reduced our comparable store sales by approximately 90 basis points in the fiscal third quarter. 
For the fiscal 9 months, comp store sales increased by approximately 2.7% compared with an increase of approximately 5.5% last year. The increases in comp store sales each of the fiscal third quarter and the fiscal 9 months of 2012 were attributed to an increase in the average transaction amount, partially offset by a decrease in the number of transactions in part due to store closings and other post-Hurricane Sandy impacts. 
As a reminder, unlike last year when we had an excess of 200 stores open, we also chose not to open on Thanksgiving this year with the exception of 29 stores, which but for a few exceptions, were all located in an enclosed mall when the entire center was open.
Gross profit for both the fiscal third quarter and the fiscal 9 months was approximately 39.8% of net sales compared to approximately 40.9% of net sales for the comparable periods of 2011. These decreases and the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales were primarily attributed to an increase in coupons to the increases in both the redemptions and the average coupon amount, as well as a shift in the mix of the merchandise sold to lower margin categories. The inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings did not have a material effect on our gross profit percentages. Please note though, World Market's preacquisition accounting policies included occupancy costs and gross profit, these costs are now included in selling, general and administrative expenses consistent with our historical practices. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses, for the fiscal third quarter, SG&A was approximately 26.4% of net sales as compared to approximately 25.7% of net sales in last year's fiscal third quarter, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. This increase in SG&A can primarily be attributed to higher expenses for payroll and payroll-related costs, advertising expenses and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. Each of these expense items was impacted by the inclusion of World Market's financial results and the higher percentages for these categories. The inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings increased total company selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 120 basis points in the third quarter. In addition, the costs associated with the major initiatives that Len and I previously mentioned increased SG&A by approximately 30 basis points during the third quarter. 
For the fiscal 9 months, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 26% of net sales, an increase of approximately 10 basis points when compared to approximately 25.9% of net sales in the fiscal 9 months of 2011. The inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings selling, general and administrative expenses for that period increased total company selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 70 basis points.  In addition to the inclusion of the major initiatives mentioned earlier increased SG&A for the 9 months by approximately 30 basis points. 
With all that said, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was lower than in the same period a year ago by approximately 180 basis points, for the fiscal 9 months of the operating profit margin decreased by approximately 120 basis points. The provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate as tax events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal third quarter, the provision for income taxes was approximately 35.1% compared to approximately 35.9% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 80 basis points, which is primarily the result of an increase in other income tax benefits. The provisions for the fiscal quarter included net after-tax benefits of approximately $9.1 million in both the current year and comparable period last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters. 
For the fiscal 9 months the provision for income taxes was approximately 35.9% compared to approximately 37.1% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 120 basis points. The provisions for the fiscal 9 months included net after-tax benefits of approximately $24.3 million this year and $14.1 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these periods. 
Capital expenditures for the fiscal 9 months of 2012 were approximately $238 million principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects that are important to our future, including the initiatives that Len and I mentioned earlier. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success. 
As Len said, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program. Our board took this action based upon its continued confidence for our company's long-term growth potentials, financial outlook and cash flow generation. This currently anticipated that this new $2.5 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and future cash flows. That said, our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis. In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise. 
As always we want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produce Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers and by doing so, improving our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.

As Len and Steve said, today we reported net earnings of $1.03 per diluted share for the fiscal third quarter and $2.89 per diluted share for the 9 months of fiscal 2012. We are encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and co",1330,"Thanks, Steve. As Len and Steve said, today we reported net earnings of $1.03 per diluted share for the fiscal third quarter and $2.89 per diluted share for the 9 months of fiscal 2012. We are encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2012. 
The following are the planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2012, which consists of 53 weeks and includes World Market and Linen Holdings from the date of each acquisition to the end of the fiscal year. One, as Len said, for the remainder of fiscal 2012, we now anticipate opening 2 additional buybuy BABY stores, bringing our total store openings for the year to 41 stores across all of our concepts, which, as a reminder, includes World Market. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise.  Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating stores during the fiscal fourth quarter. Three, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 including World Market and Linen Holdings, are planned to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million, which of course remains subject to the timing and composition of projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square foot E-Commerce Fulfillment Center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the costs of relocating our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey, which will continue into next year; and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support our ongoing technology initiatives. 
Currently, we estimate the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.03 per diluted share. 
Four, we are modeling an increase of 2% to 4% in comparable store sales for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Five, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, including our newly acquired companies, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 24% to 26% for the fourth quarter and by approximately 15% for the full year. Six, depreciation for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $195 million. Seven, we estimate the addition of a 53rd-week to the fourth quarter this year will add an incremental $0.04 to $0.05 in net earnings per diluted share.  This additional week will have higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales than the rest of the fourth quarter since it is a lower sales week than the average weekly sales during the rest of the fourth quarter. Eight, assuming these sales levels, we are modeling operating profit margin as a percentage of net sales to deleverage for the fourth quarter. Slightly more than half of this leverage is attributable to the consolidation of World Market and Linen Holdings financial results, the previously discussed major initiatives and the inclusion of the 53rd-week. Also contributing to the model deleverage is an increase in coupons and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories. 
Nine, interest income will include approximately $2 million in interest expense due to the inclusion of World Market capital leases, similar expansions included in the fiscal third quarter. Ten, the fourth quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid-to high 30s percent range with expected variability as distinct tax events occur. Eleven, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources. Twelve, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current authorizations. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions.
Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.60 to $1.67 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012. For all of fiscal 2012, based on these and other planning assumptions, which again include the benefit of the 53rd-week, the incremental operating costs from the previously discussed major initiatives, the transaction and integration costs related to the recently completed acquisitions and the results of the newly acquired companies, consistent with prior estimates provided and accounting for the weighted average shares outstanding for the full fiscal year, we model net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $4.48 to $4.54 or 10% to 12% over fiscal 2011.
For fiscal 2013, we are in the process of preparing our budget. Our preliminary planning assumptions for next year include the following: One, we anticipated opening approximately 50 stores across all of our concepts, including approximately 10 World Market stores. We anticipated the mix of store openings under the Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Christmas Tree Shops and Harmon Face Values concepts to be relatively consistent with fiscal 2012. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise. Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2013. Three, our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources. Four, as previously discussed, we anticipate completing the current share repurchase programs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and beginning our new $2.5 billion share repurchase program thereafter, which we are planning to take 3 years or so to complete after it begins. Five, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates. Six, the deleverage resulting from the consolidation of World Market and Linen Holdings will continue until we anniversary the acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. We plan to provide further information related to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2013 on our next quarterly conference call on April 10, 2013. 
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter: Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investments securities of approximately $859.4 million. This includes approximately $51 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2 million to reflect the current lack of liquidity. During the fiscal quarter, the company tendered approximately $24.3 million of its auction rate securities at a price of approximately 95% at par value. As a result, the company incurred a realized loss of approximately $1.1 million, which is reflected in its fiscal third quarter results. We will continue to monitor the mark of these securities and will expense any permanent changes to the value of our remaining securities if any as they occur going forward. 
As of November 24, 2012, retail inventories at costs, including World Market, were approximately $2.7 billion or $65.52 per square foot, relatively flat on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customer and are in good condition.
Consolidated shareholders equity at November 24, 2012, was approximately $4 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $191 million, representing approximately 3.1 million shares repurchased during the fiscal third quarter of 2012. As of November 24, 2012, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $223 million. 
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, April 10, 2013. During this call, we will review operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending on March 2, 2013, and we'll further discuss fiscal 2013 planning assumptions.  If you have any questions, Ken Frankel, and I will be in our offices this evening, December 19, to take your calls. As always we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond, and we wish you a happy holiday season and a happy new year."

Before we begin, on behalf of all the associates of Bed Bath & Beyond, we wish there were words that could bring comfort and make sense of the tragedy that occurred in Connecticut last week. We are deeply troubled trying to find any. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and friends.
Because we must, we now turn to our company's call and our fiscal third quarter, which includes the effects of Hurricane Sandy on our customer's along the East Coast.
Today, we reported net earnings per diluted share of $1.03 for the fiscal third quarter, an increase of approximately 8.4% over the fiscal third quarter of 2011. The third quarter continues our consistent performance in terms of earnings per share growth, cash flow generation and our overall financial strength. With regard to Hurricane Sandy, we continue to work with local organizations and through our stores to provide assistance to those impacted in the affected areas. We understand the restoration process will take time and will be difficult.
During this quarter, we also continued the integration of World Market and Linen Holdings and made progress on our initiatives to enhance our website, ramp up our Pendergrass, Georgia E-Commerce Fulfillment operation, pursue the remaining construction and other follow-up items related to the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey and advance the development of a new IT data center.
In addition, during the third quarter, we opened 4 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and closed 1; opened 7 buybuy BABY stores, 6 World Market Stores and 1 Christmas Tree Shops store operating under the name AndThat! [ph] AndThat! [ph] represents an evolution of the name for the Christmas Tree Shops concept, with stores opening outside existing Christmas Tree Shops markets.
At November 24, 2012, consolidated store space, including the 264 World Market stores, was approximately 41.9 million square feet, an increase of approximately 16% over the end of last year's third quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012, we have opened 1 additional Bed Bath & Beyond store and 2 additional buybuy BABY stores. Including these still-work openings, we currently operate 1,469 stores, consisting of 1,004 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 264 World Market Stores; 80 buybuy BABY stores; 74 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops or andThat![ph]; and 47 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values.
For the remainder of fiscal 2012, we now anticipate opening 2 additional buybuy BABY stores, bringing our total openings for the year to 41 stores across all our concept, which, as a reminder, includes World Market.
We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our World Market, Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in selected stores, as well as specialty food and beverage departments in selected Bed Bath & Beyond stores, most recently in Schoenberg, Illinois and Tysons Corner, Virginia. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all merchandise categories.
At this time, in conjunction with our ongoing review of our capital structure, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program. We are currently planning that the new share repurchase program will commence after the completion of the existing program. Although the Board's authorization does not set a time limitation for the share repurchase, for planning purposes, the company anticipates completing the program over the next 3 years or so after it begins. It is currently anticipated that this new $2.5 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and future cash flows. This new program reflects the Board's continued confidence in our future and commitment to returning value to our shareholders. Since 2004 through the third quarter of our fiscal 2012, our company has returned approximately $4.7 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases.
The tremendous efforts of our associates and our unique decentralized culture have been and remain the keys to our company's long-term success. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We believe we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near and long-term goals.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

Turning as we must to what we need to cover in today's call, despite the effects of Hurricane Sandy, we were able to continue our consistent performance in terms of earnings per share growth, cash flow generation and our overall financial strength. For this, we thank our dedicated and talented associates and their focus on improving our customers' overall shopping experience.
On an ongoing basis, we continue to invest in all aspects of our company to enhance our customers' experience in store, online and through mobile devices and social media; and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and, over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably and increase market share and shareholder value over time by offering a broad and deep assortment of merchandise at everyday-low prices with superior customer service. We are focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores and enhancing our customer experience by expanding our product offerings, relocating, renovating and/or expanding stores, continuing the development of our interactive platforms and growing our bridal, baby and gift registries.
As Len also touched upon, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of World Market and Linen Holdings and our progress on the initiatives associated with our website enhancement, our new Pendergrass, Georgia E-Commerce Fulfillment Center, the remaining construction and other follow-up items related to our corporate headquarters and our new IT data center.
Turning to our fiscal third quarter of 2012 performance, we reported earlier today our fiscal third quarter net earnings per diluted share of $1.03, an increase of approximately 8.4% when compared to the $0.95 per diluted share that we earned in last year's third quarter. For the fiscal 9 months, net earnings per diluted share were $2.89, an increase of approximately 11.2% compared to the $2.60 earned last year.
Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, approximately 15.3% higher than in the prior year. Of this increase, approximately 79% was the result of the inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings, approximately 11% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 10% resulted primarily from new stores.
Net sales for the fiscal 9 months of the year were approximately $7.5 billion, approximately 11% higher than in the fiscal 9 months of 2011. Of this increase, approximately 59% was the result of the inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings, approximately 25% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 16% resulted primarily from new stores.
Third quarter comp store sales, which excludes World Market and Linen Holdings, increased by approximately 1.7% compared with an increase of approximately 4.1% last year. From our company's perspective, Hurricane Sandy occurred during our fiscal third quarter, and its impact resulted in many of our stores being closed and many of our customers either not having the ability to shop or having much greater concerns than shopping, including property damage, electrical outages and gasoline shortages, which include rationing in a number of our markets. We estimate the impact of this disruption reduced our comparable store sales by approximately 90 basis points in the fiscal third quarter.
For the fiscal 9 months, comp store sales increased by approximately 2.7% compared with an increase of approximately 5.5% last year. These increases in comp store sales each of the fiscal third quarter and the fiscal 9 months of 2012 were attributed to an increase in the average transaction amount, partially offset by a decrease in the number of transactions, in part due to store closings and other post-Hurricane Sandy impacts.
As a reminder, unlike last year when we had an excess of 200 stores opened, we also chose not to open on Thanksgiving this year with the exception of 29 stores, which, but for a few exceptions, were all located in enclosed malls where the entire center was open.
Gross profit for both the fiscal third quarter and the fiscal 9 months was approximately 39.8% of net sales compared to approximately 40.9% of net sales for the comparable periods of 2011. These decreases in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales were primarily attributed to an increase in coupons due to increases in both the redemptions and the average coupon amount, as well as the shift in the mix of the merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
The inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings did not have a material effect on our gross profit percentages. Please note, though, World Market's pre-acquisition accounting policies, including occupancy costs and gross profit, these costs are now included in selling, general and administrative expenses, consistent with our historical practices.
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses, for the fiscal third quarter, SG&A was approximately 26.4% of net sales as compared to approximately 25.7% of net sales in last year's fiscal third quarter, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. This increase in SG&A can primarily be attributed to higher expenses for payroll and payroll-related costs, advertising expenses and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. Each of these expense items was impacted by the inclusion of World Market's financial results and the higher percentages for these categories. The inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings increased total company selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 120 basis points in the third quarter. In addition, the costs associated with the major initiatives that Len and I previously mentioned increased SG&A by approximately 30 basis points during the third quarter.
For the fiscal 9 months, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 26% of net sales, an increase of approximately 10 basis points when compared to approximately 25.9% of net sales in the fiscal 9 months of 2011. The inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings' selling, general and administrative expenses for that period increased total company selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 70 basis points. In addition, the inclusion of the major initiatives mentioned earlier increased SG&A for the 9 months by approximately 30 basis points.
With all that said, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was lower than in the same period 1 year ago by approximately 180 basis points. And for the fiscal 9 months, the operating profit margin decreased by approximately 120 basis points.
The provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate, as tax [ph] events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal third quarter, the provision for income taxes was approximately 35.1% compared to approximately 35.9% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 80 basis points, which was primarily the result of an increase in other income tax benefits. The provisions for the fiscal quarter included net after-tax benefits of approximately $9.1 million in both the current year and comparable period last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters.
For the fiscal 9 months, the provision for income taxes was approximately 35.9% compared to approximately 37.1% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 120 basis points. The provisions for the fiscal 9 months included net after-tax benefits of approximately $24.3 million this year and $14.1 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these periods.
Capital expenditures for the fiscal 9 months of 2012 were approximately $238 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects that are important to our future, including the initiatives that Len and I mentioned earlier. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.

Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating stores during the fiscal fourth quarter.
Three, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012, including World Market and Linen Holdings, are planned to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million, which, of course, remains subject to the timing and composition of projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000-square-foot E-Commerce Fulfillment Center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the cost of relocating our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey, which will continue into next year; and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support our ongoing technology initiatives.

Also contributing to the model deleverage is an increase in coupons and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Nine, interest income will include approximately $2 million in interest expense due to the inclusion of World Market capital leases, similar expansions included in the fiscal third quarter.
10, the fourth quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid- to high-30s percent range with expected variability as distinct tax events occur.
11, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally generated sources.
12, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current authorizations. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.60 to $1.67 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012.
For all of fiscal 2012, based on these and other planning assumptions, which again include the benefit of the 53rd week, the incremental operating costs from the previously discussed major initiatives, the transaction and integration costs related to the recently completed acquisitions and the results of the newly acquired companies, consistent with prior estimates provided and accounting for the weighted average shares outstanding for the full fiscal year, we model net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $4.48 to $4.54 or 10% to 12% over fiscal 2011.
For fiscal 2013, we are in the process of preparing our budget. Our preliminary planning assumptions for next year include the following: One, we anticipate opening approximately 50 stores across all of our concepts, including approximately 10 World Market stores. We anticipate the mix of store openings under the Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Christmas Tree Shops and Harmon Face Values concepts to be relatively consistent with fiscal 2012. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise.
Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2013.
Three, our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources.
Four, as previously discussed, we anticipate completing the current share repurchase programs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and beginning our new $2.5 billion share repurchase program thereafter, which we are planning to take 3 years or so to complete after it begins.
Five, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates.
Six, the deleverage resulting from the consolidation of World Market and Linen Holdings will continue until we anniversary the acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. We plan to provide further information related to fiscal -- to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2013 on our next quarterly conference call on April 10, 2013.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter: Our balance sheet and cash flows remained strong. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investments securities of approximately $859.4 million. This includes approximately $51 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2 million to reflect the current lack of liquidity.
During the fiscal quarter, the company tendered approximately $24.3 million of its auction rate securities at a price of approximately 95% at par [ph] value. As a result, the company incurred a realized loss of approximately $1.1 million, which is reflected in its fiscal third quarter results. We will continue to monitor the market for these securities and will expense any permanent changes to the value of our remaining securities, if any, as they occur going forward.
As of November 24, 2012, retail inventories add [ph] costs, including World Market, were approximately $2.7 billion or $65.52 per square foot, relatively flat on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customer and are in good condition.
Consolidated shareholders' equity at November 24, 2012 was approximately $4 billion, which is net of share repurchases, including the approximately $191 million, representing approximately 3.1 million shares repurchased during the fiscal third quarter of 2012. As of November 24, 2012, the remaining balance of the current share repurchase program authorized in December 2010 was approximately $223 million.
As a reminder, our next conference call will be on Wednesday, April 10, 2013. During this call, we will review operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ending on March 2, 2013, and we'll further discuss fiscal 2013 planning assumptions.
If you have any questions, Ken Frankel and I will be in our offices this evening, December 19, to take your calls. As always, we appreciate your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond, and we wish you a happy holiday season and a happy New Year."

Before we begin, on behalf of all the associates of Bed Bath & Beyond, we wish there were words that could bring comfort and make sense of the tragedy that occurred in Connecticut last week. We are deeply troubled trying to find any. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and friends.
Because we must, we now turn to our company's call and our fiscal third quarter, which includes the effects of Hurricane Sandy on our customers along the East Coast.
Today, we reported net earnings per diluted share of $1.03 for the fiscal third quarter, an increase of approximately 8.4% over the fiscal third quarter of 2011. The third quarter continues our consistent performance in terms of earnings per share growth, cash flow generation and our overall financial strength. With regard to Hurricane Sandy, we continue to work with local organizations and through our stores to provide assistance to those impacted in the affected areas. We understand the restoration process will take time and will be difficult.
During this quarter, we also continued the integration of World Market and Linen Holdings and made progress on our initiatives to enhance our website, ramp up our Pendergrass, Georgia E-Commerce Fulfillment operation, pursue the remaining construction and other follow-up items related to the relocation of our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey and advance the development of a new IT data center.
In addition, during the third quarter, we opened 4 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and closed 1; opened 7 buybuy BABY stores, 6 World Market Stores and 1 Christmas Tree Shops store operating under the name andThat! andThat!represents an evolution of the name for the Christmas Tree Shops concept, with stores opening outside existing Christmas Tree Shops markets.
At November 24, 2012, consolidated store space, including the 264 World Market stores, was approximately 41.9 million square feet, an increase of approximately 16% over the end of last year's third quarter. Since the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012, we have opened 1 additional Bed Bath & Beyond store and 2 additional buybuy BABY stores. Including these still-work openings, we currently operate 1,469 stores, consisting of 1,004 Bed Bath & Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada; 264 World Market Stores; 80 buybuy BABY stores; 74 stores under the names Christmas Tree Shops or andThat!; and 47 stores under the names Harmon or Harmon Face Values.
For the remainder of fiscal 2012, we now anticipate opening 2 additional buybuy BABY stores, bringing our total openings for the year to 41 stores across all our concepts, which, as a reminder, includes World Market.
We believe that throughout the United States and Canada, there is an opportunity to operate in excess of 1,300 Bed Bath & Beyond stores, as well as grow our World Market, Christmas Tree Shops and buybuy BABY concepts from coast to coast. Additionally, we will continue to open Harmon Face Values stores and place health and beauty care offerings in selected stores, as well as specialty food and beverage departments in selected Bed Bath & Beyond stores, most recently in Schaumburg, Illinois and Tysons Corner, Virginia. We remain committed to and are excited about the continued growth of all merchandise categories.
At this time, in conjunction with our ongoing review of our capital structure, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program. We are currently planning that the new share repurchase program will commence after the completion of the existing program. Although the Board's authorization does not set a time limitation for the share repurchase, for planning purposes, the company anticipates completing the program over the next 3 years or so after it begins. It is currently anticipated that this new $2.5 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and future cash flows. This new program reflects the Board's continued confidence in our future and commitment to returning value to our shareholders. Since 2004 through the third quarter of our fiscal 2012, our company has returned approximately $4.7 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases.
The tremendous efforts of our associates and our unique decentralized culture have been and remain the keys to our company's long-term success. This culture, which takes advantage of the knowledge, the independence and the customer focus of our associates, has always been the foundation of our long-term performance and allows us to respond more quickly to market demands and to changing economic conditions on a market-by-market basis. We believe we have the people, the resources and the capability to achieve our near- and long-term goals.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Steven Temares. Steve?"

As you said, we struggle to find the words to express our sorrow about what happened in Connecticut last week, but please know our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and friends.
Turning as we must to what we need to cover in today's call, despite the effects of Hurricane Sandy, we were able to continue our consistent performance in terms of earnings per share growth, cash flow generation and our overall financial strength. For this, we thank our dedicated and talented associates and their focus on improving our customers' overall shopping experience.
On an ongoing basis, we continue to invest in all aspects of our company to enhance our customers' experience in store, online and through mobile devices and social media; and we remain committed to being our customers' first choice for the merchandise categories we offer domestically, interactively and, over the longer term, internationally. We are confident that our company is well positioned to grow profitably and increase market share and shareholder value over time by offering a broad and deep assortment of merchandise at everyday low prices with superior customer service. We are focused on increasing the productivity of our existing stores and enhancing our customer experience by expanding our product offerings, relocating, renovating and/or expanding stores, continuing the development of our interactive platforms and growing our bridal, baby and gift registries.
As Len also touched upon, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of World Market and Linen Holdings and our progress on the initiatives associated with our website enhancement, our new Pendergrass, Georgia E-Commerce Fulfillment Center, the remaining construction and other follow-up items related to our corporate headquarters and our new IT data center.
Turning to our fiscal third quarter of 2012 performance, we reported earlier today our fiscal third quarter net earnings per diluted share of $1.03, an increase of approximately 8.4% when compared to the $0.95 per diluted share that we earned in last year's third quarter. For the fiscal 9 months, net earnings per diluted share were $2.89, an increase of approximately 11.2% compared to the $2.60 earned last year.
Net sales for the fiscal third quarter were approximately $2.7 billion, approximately 15.3% higher than in the prior year. Of this increase, approximately 79% was the result of the inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings, approximately 11% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 10% resulted primarily from new stores.
Net sales for the fiscal 9 months of the year were approximately $7.5 billion, approximately 11% higher than in the fiscal 9 months of 2011. Of this increase, approximately 59% was the result of the inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings, approximately 25% was attributable to the increase in comp store sales and the remaining 16% resulted primarily from new stores.
Third quarter comp store sales, which excludes World Market and Linen Holdings, increased by approximately 1.7% compared with an increase of approximately 4.1% last year. From our company's perspective, Hurricane Sandy occurred during our fiscal third quarter, and its impact resulted in many of our stores being closed and many of our customers either not having the ability to shop or having much greater concerns than shopping, including property damage, electrical outages and gasoline shortages, which include rationing in a number of our markets. We estimate the impact of this disruption reduced our comparable store sales by approximately 90 basis points in the fiscal third quarter.
For the fiscal 9 months, comp store sales increased by approximately 2.7% compared with an increase of approximately 5.5% last year. These increases in comp store sales each of the fiscal third quarter and the fiscal 9 months of 2012 were attributed to an increase in the average transaction amount, partially offset by a decrease in the number of transactions, in part due to store closings and other post-Hurricane Sandy impacts.
As a reminder, unlike last year when we had in excess of 200 stores opened, we also chose not to open on Thanksgiving this year with the exception of 29 stores, which, but for a few exceptions, were all located in enclosed malls where the entire center was open.
Gross profit for both the fiscal third quarter and the fiscal 9 months was approximately 39.8% of net sales compared to approximately 40.9% of net sales for the comparable periods of 2011. These decreases in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales were primarily attributed to an increase in coupons due to increases in both redemptions and the average coupon amount, as well as the shift in the mix of the merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
The inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings did not have a material effect on our gross profit percentages. Please note, though, World Market's pre-acquisition accounting policies included occupancy costs and gross profit. These costs are now included in selling, general and administrative expenses, consistent with our historical practices.
Turning to selling, general and administrative expenses, for the fiscal third quarter, SG&A was approximately 26.4% of net sales as compared to approximately 25.7% of net sales in last year's fiscal third quarter, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. This increase in SG&A can primarily be attributed to higher expenses for payroll and payroll-related costs, advertising expenses and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales. Each of these expense items was impacted by the inclusion of World Market's financial results and the higher percentages for these categories. The inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings increased total company selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 120 basis points in the third quarter. In addition, the costs associated with the major initiatives that Len and I previously mentioned increased SG&A by approximately 30 basis points during the third quarter.
For the fiscal 9 months, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 26% of net sales, an increase of approximately 10 basis points when compared to approximately 25.9% of net sales in the fiscal 9 months of 2011. The inclusion of World Market and Linen Holdings' selling, general and administrative expenses for that period increased total company selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately 70 basis points. In addition, the inclusion of the major initiatives mentioned earlier increased SG&A for the 9 months by approximately 30 basis points.
With all that said, the operating profit margin for the fiscal third quarter was lower than in the same period a year ago by approximately 180 basis points. And for the fiscal 9 months, the operating profit margin decreased by approximately 120 basis points.
The provision for income taxes continues to fluctuate, as taxable events occur and exposures are reevaluated. For the fiscal third quarter, the provision for income taxes was approximately 35.1% compared to approximately 35.9% for the comparable quarter last year, a decrease of approximately 80 basis points, which was primarily the result of an increase in other income tax benefits. The provisions for the fiscal quarter included net after-tax benefits of approximately $9.1 million in both the current year and comparable period last year due to distinct tax events occurring during the quarters.
For the fiscal 9 months, the provision for income taxes was approximately 35.9% compared to approximately 37.1% for the comparable period last year, a decrease of approximately 120 basis points. The provisions for the fiscal 9 months included net after-tax benefits of approximately $24.3 million this year and $14.1 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these periods.
Capital expenditures for the fiscal 9 months of 2012 were approximately $238 million, principally for new stores, existing store improvements, information technology enhancements and other projects that are important to our future, including the initiatives that Len and I mentioned earlier. While we continue to review and prioritize our capital needs, we remain committed to making the required investments in our company to help position us for our long-term success.
As Len said, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program. Our Board took this action based upon its continued confidence in our company's long-term growth potential, financial outlook and cash flow generation. It's currently anticipated that this new $2.5 billion share repurchase program will be funded from current cash and future cash flows. That said, our company's Board of Directors continues to review our capital structure on an ongoing basis.
In addition to providing value to our shareholders through share repurchase programs, our strong operations should allow us to continue to invest in our infrastructure and maintain our flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise.
As always, we want to thank our associates for their ongoing efforts, which produced Bed Bath & Beyond's long-term success. Through their efforts, we look forward to meeting the challenges that lie ahead and to seizing the opportunities to satisfy our customers, and by doing so, improving our competitive position in the merchandise categories that we offer.
I'll now turn the call back to Gene. Gene?"

As Len and Steve said, today, we reported net earnings of $1.03 per diluted share for the fiscal third quarter and $2.89 per diluted share for the 9 months of fiscal 2012. We are encouraged by our positive fiscal third quarter results and continue to be cautiously optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2012.
The following are the planning assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2012, which consists of 53 weeks and includes World Market and Linen Holdings from the date of each acquisition to the end of the fiscal year: One, as Len said, for the remainder of fiscal 2012, we now anticipate opening 2 additional buybuy BABY stores, bringing our total store openings for the year to 41 stores across all of our concepts, which, as a reminder, includes World Market. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise.
Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating stores during the fiscal fourth quarter.
Three, capital expenditures for fiscal 2012, including World Market and Linen Holdings, are planned to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million, which, of course, remains subject to the timing and composition of projects, including new stores and existing store refurbishments, information technology enhancements and other projects important to our future, including the following major initiatives: the development of an enhanced website experience for our customers; the opening of a new 800,000 square foot E-Commerce Fulfillment Center in Pendergrass, Georgia; the cost of relocating our Farmingdale and Garden City, New York offices to our corporate headquarters in Union, New Jersey, which will continue into next year; and the initial phase of a new IT data center to support our ongoing technology initiatives. Currently, we estimate the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 incremental operating costs associated with these major initiatives to be approximately $0.03 per diluted share.
Four, we are modeling an increase of 2% to 4% in comparable store sales for the fourth quarter and for the full year.
Five, taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, including our newly acquired companies, we are modeling consolidated net sales to increase by 24% to 26% for the fourth quarter and by approximately 15% for the full year.
Six, depreciation for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $195 million.
Seven, we estimate the addition of the 53rd -- of a 53rd week to the fourth quarter this year will add an incremental $0.04 to $0.05 in net earnings per diluted share. This additional week will have higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales than the rest of the fourth quarter since it is a lower sales week than the average weekly sales during the rest of the fourth quarter.
Eight, assuming these sales levels, we are modeling operating profit margin as a percentage of net sales to deleverage for the fourth quarter. Slightly more than 1/2 of this deleverage is attributable to the consolidation of World Market and Linen Holdings' financial results, the previously discussed major initiatives and the inclusion of the 53rd  week. Also contributing to the model deleverage is an increase in coupons and a shift in the mix of merchandise sold to lower margin categories.
Nine, interest income will include approximately $2 million in interest expense due to the inclusion of World Market capital leases; similar expense was included in the fiscal third quarter.
10, the fourth quarter and full year tax provisions are estimated to be in the mid to high 30s percent range with expected variability as distinct tax events occur.
11, we expect to generate positive operating cash flow and continue to fund operations entirely from internally-generated sources.
12, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our current authorizations. Our share repurchase program may be influenced by several factors, including business and market conditions. Based on these and other planning assumptions, we are now modeling net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $1.60 to $1.67 for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012.
For all of fiscal 2012, based on these and other planning assumptions, which again include the benefit of the 53rd week, the incremental operating costs from the previously discussed major initiatives, the transaction and integration costs related to the recently completed acquisitions and the results of the newly acquired companies, consistent with prior estimates provided and accounting for the weighted average shares outstanding for the full fiscal year, we model net earnings per diluted share to be approximately $4.48 to $4.54 or 10% to 12% over fiscal 2011.
For fiscal 2013, we are in the process of preparing our budget. Our preliminary planning assumptions for next year include the following: One, we anticipate opening approximately 50 stores across all of our concepts, including approximately 10 World Market stores. We anticipate the mix of store openings under the Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, Christmas Tree Shops and Harmon Face Values concepts to be relatively consistent with fiscal 2012. As always, we remain flexible to take advantage of real estate opportunities that may arise.
Two, we expect to continue our program of relocating, remodeling, renovating and expanding a number of our stores in fiscal 2013.
Three, our operations will continue to be entirely funded from internally generated sources.
Four, as previously discussed, we anticipate completing the current share repurchase programs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and beginning our new $2.5 billion share repurchase program thereafter, which we are planning to take 3 years or so to complete after it begins.
Five, we expect continuing variability in our quarterly tax rates.
Six, the deleverage resulting from the consolidation of World Market and Linen Holdings will continue until we anniversary the acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. We plan to provide further information related to fiscal -- to the fiscal first quarter and full year 2013 on our next quarterly conference call on April 10, 2013.
Before concluding this afternoon's call, a few additional comments relative to our recently concluded fiscal third quarter: Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. We ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and investments securities of approximately $859.4 million. This includes approximately $51 million of investments related to auction rate securities. These securities have an estimated temporary valuation adjustment of approximately $2 million to reflect the current lack of liquidity.
During the fiscal quarter, the company tendered approximately $24.3 million of its auction rate securities at a price of approximately 95% of par value. As a result, the company incurred a realized loss of approximately $1.1 million, which is reflected in its fiscal third quarter results. We will continue to monitor the market for these securities and will expense any permanent changes to the value of our remaining securities, if any, as they occur going forward.
As of November 24, 2012, retail inventories at cost, including World Market, were approximately $2.7 billion or $65.52 per square foot, relatively flat on a per square foot basis over the end of last year's third quarter. Retail inventories continue to be tailored by store to meet the anticipated demands of our customer and are in good condition.
