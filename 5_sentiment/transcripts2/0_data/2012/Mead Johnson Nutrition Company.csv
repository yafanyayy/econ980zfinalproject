As you read in our press release, we concluded 2011 with continued strong performance. We delivered an exceptional year of sales and earnings growth. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.52 per share on 14",1741,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As you read in our press release, we concluded 2011 with continued strong performance. We delivered an exceptional year of sales and earnings growth. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.52 per share on 14% constant dollar sales growth were in line with our expectations. As expected, higher dairy prices, greater demand generation investments and the timing of pension settlement expense and tax accruals more than offset the benefit of sales growth in the quarter. Our fourth quarter results for full year non-GAAP earnings to $2.79 per share, an increase of 15% from the prior year. 
Let me highlight some of our key achievements in 2011. First, we delivered 14% constant dollar sales growth on a full year basis, setting a new growth record for the company in recent times. This growth was led by our Asia/Latin America segment, which posted 22% growth excluding foreign exchange, now accounts for 66% of our global sales, up from 61% in 2010. 
In the markets where we compete, our sales grew at the highest rate of any of the 5 major global competitors during the year. Sales in China/Hong Kong grew over 40%, and it became our top global market in 2011 with sales of over $1 billion. North America/Europe segment grew by 3% from a combination of both volume and price. Majority of this growth came from the United States despite continued declines in birth and formula consumption. 
We delivered gross margins of 63% for the year, a drop of only 40 basis points from 2010 despite inflationary pressures on our product costs that approached 12%. Higher pricing and record productivity helped to mitigate the commodity headwinds, which were largely seen in the second half of the year. Our supply chain team exceeded their productivity goal by delivering over 4% savings on cost of goods sold. 
We continue to invest competitively in sales force expansion, advertising and promotion, marketing and research and development and have seen results and market share gains measured on a value basis across Asia/Latin America. 
We completed our global SAP implementation and shared service transition in October. This was the final step on our road to full independence from Bristol-Myers Squibb. The successful execution was the result of a tremendous effort led by dedicated employees around the world. This project is a critical cornerstone of our plans to drive global operational efficiencies and reduced general and administrative spending from 8.5% of sales in 2011 to 6.5% by 2015. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened our third Mead Johnson Pediatric Nutrition Institute in Guangzhou, China, adding to the existing institutes in Latin America and the U.S. These centers provide additional capabilities to develop nutritional science and new products and facilitate strong relationships with key scientific and regulatory stakeholders around the world. 
In December, we announced the decision to build our first Asia Spray Dryer and Technology Center, which will be located in Singapore. This is the biggest capital expenditure in our company's history and needed to support the future growth of our fast-growing Asia region. 
Finally, I announced a number of management changes at year end designed to support the company's ambitious growth plans. Kasper Jakobsen who most recently served as the Head of our Americas business and previously led our Asia region was named our Chief Operating Officer, a newly created position to oversee our global commercial operations. Additionally, I appointed Charles Urbain, previously President of Asia and Europe, to the new role of Senior Vice President, Stakeholder Relations and Chief Development Officer in recognition of the importance of business development to complement our superior organic growth. 
Let me now provide some additional commentary on our performance in our 2 operating segments in 2011 and then conclude with our latest thinking on expected growth in 2012. Starting with Asia and Latin America, I've already noted the constant dollar sales in China/Hong Kong grew in excess of 40% in 2011. The vast majority of the increase from higher volumes. These markets now account for just under 30% of our total sales. As we mentioned at our Investor Day last fall, we expect 2012 growth rates in China/Hong Kong to be below the levels seen in 2011. We estimate that about 75% of our recent volume gains came from increased market share a quarter from overall market growth. 
From a planning perspective, while we will continue to grow share, we can't anticipate that the magnitude of share gains seen last year will continue indefinitely given the competitiveness of the category. While there's no doubt that food safety concerns in China have led some parents to move toward premium brands such as Enfamil, we cannot predict that this trend will continue at the same rate. As a result, we currently anticipate that growth will return to more normal levels in 2012 while still being well above the mid-teen average expected for the Asia/Latin America segment. 
Note that by the end of 2011, we were fully resourced in 241 cities in China. New cities we entered in the last 18 months contributed about 50% of our volume growth, with the majority of growth coming from established cities. In 2012, we expect to continue our geographic expansion into an additional 50 cities through our disciplined Step Change program. 
Importantly, our Asia/Latin America growth goes well beyond China/Hong Kong. In this segment, we saw a dozen markets growing in double digits. As presented at our Investor Day, Latin America has targeted sales of $1 billion by 2015. We are well on our way to achieving that goal with the Latin America regional sales growth in the midteens and Brazil growing rapidly to become our eighth largest sales market in 2011. 
In the North America/Europe segment, annual sales was 3% favorable to the prior year on a constant dollar basis. You should note that about a point of this growth came from a liquid adult private label nutrition product we manufactured for U.S. retailers in the second half of the year. Excluding this private label sales, constant dollar growth of 2% came mainly in the U.S. from product innovation launched in 2010, along with the benefit from a competitive late 2010 product recall. 
In reflecting upon the full year, I'm pleased with the gains made in the U.S., where pricing and increased market share more than offset the continued decline in the birth rate and lower infant formula consumption. However, this segment is not without its challenges as we enter 2012. Most of you are aware of the media issue in late December concerning several infant formula brands, including Enfamil Newborn. The FDA and CDC ultimately issued a joint press release 9 days after the story first broke, which stated that there was no contamination found in sealed containers of our product, entirely consistent with results from our own exhaustive quality testing protocols. 
While it is very difficult to quantify the impact of this early date, we believe that misleading headlines and the resultant uncertainty caused some moms to switch from the Enfamil brand and others to start on an alternative formula. We responded quickly with appropriate activities, including an extensive e-mail communication, reassuring millions of mothers about the 2,300 quality and safety checks we perform to ensure the integrity of every product that we ship to market. 
We've now begun a broader mass-market campaign, including TV advertising, focusing on our quality testing and the fact that we are the #1 brand recommended by pediatricians in the U.S. While there was no noticeable impact on our fourth quarter sales given the late December timing, we expect to see lower market share potentially into the third quarter of this year as those babies who switched were started on another formula age into heavier consumption period. 
Let me also highlight 3 other factors that will drive U.S. results. First, we expect that the birth rate and infant formula consumption will continue to fall in 2012, reducing industry sales by a further 2% to 3%. Again, keep in mind that we gained market share from a late 2010 competitor's recall that favorably helped our first half 2011 revenues. That benefit dissipated as we moved through last year. Our first half comparisons in the U.S. for 2012 will suffer as a result. 
Third, there are a number of WIC contracts that are open for bidding in 2012. The biggest contract that we currently hold is in California, which accounts for more than 14% of total WIC births. California was rebid late in November, and I'm pleased that we retained this contract, which will roll over effective August 1. We have 2 other contracts that account for a total of 7% of WIC birth that have yet to be bid with a rollover date of October 3. 
While these factors in the U.S. will have the greatest impact on segment results, we do expect to see some modest growth in Europe. You'll recall that in the second quarter of 2011, we implemented SAP in this market and moved to a new distribution model where we hold more inventory centrally rather than at our distributors. The absence of this inventory correction will contribute to growth in 2012. 
Finally, let me comment upon our outlook for 2012. We look forward to a year of solid sales and earnings growth. It is very early in the year, and there is more uncertainty than usual given the present conditions in the U.S. market. Nevertheless, we currently expect constant dollar sales growth for the company to be in the range of 7% to 9% for the full year, with Asia and Latin America growth in the midteens, while North America/Europe is expected to decline in the mid-single digits for the reasons described a few moments ago. 
We are initiating 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $3 to $3.10, up 8% to 11% relative to 2011. Gross margin will be around 63% for the full year, flat with 2011, as higher pricing and productivity offset dairy and cost inflation particularly for North America. 
We expect to see total operating expenses of around 39.3% as seen in 2011. We intend to take the majority of the savings from reductions in general and administrative spending and reinvest them back into the business to sustain our strong growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights, and I will return to wrap up and take your questions."

I'll walk down our income statement, providing some additional detail on our fourth quarter results and highlight trends that we currently forecast for 2012. Starting with our top line, as Steve mentioned, cons",1452,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk down our income statement, providing some additional detail on our fourth quarter results and highlight trends that we currently forecast for 2012. 
Starting with our top line, as Steve mentioned, constant dollar sales grew by 14% in the fourth quarter, basically in line with our full year 2011 results. Growth was largely driven by our Asia/Latin America segment. We saw sales growth of 18% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, with 14% from volume and 4% from price. 
We also reported 6% growth from our North America/Europe operations in the fourth quarter, almost equally split between volume and pricing. This was driven by a number of factors. While 2/3 of the segment's higher sales originated in Europe, it started to reduce distributors' inventory during the fourth quarter of 2010 in anticipation of the SAP launch and new distribution model in 2011. That made that comparison easier this past quarter. 
In October 2011, we launched our patented Dual Prebiotics and our Plastic Tub and Value Refill Box system in Canada, increasing volumes there. And as Steve mentioned, we have some sales from the manufacturing of private label adult nutrition products for retailers. As you would expect, these sales carry a significantly lower gross margin than our core product offerings. 
Absent these factors, our U.S. business was down by 1% in the fourth quarter. The benefit of the August price increase was evident at about 4% with volumes down about 5%, reflecting a tougher comparison against the competitor's recall in the prior year. 
Looking forward, we expect 2012 sales growth for the company to run between 7% to 9% excluding foreign exchange, down from 14% in 2011. Asia/Latin America in constant dollar sales should grow in the midteens versus 22% last year. but still impressive planned growth in China/Hong Kong is the key driver. North America and Europe sales are expected to decline by the mid-single digits versus growth of 3% in 2011, reflecting lower birth and consumption as well as lower average market share, as Steve outlined earlier. 
We expect that the comparison will be toughest in the first half of the year, possibly into the third quarter who saw babies who switched from Enfamil because of the December meeting issue age out of the category. And remember, we also had captured a higher number of babies in the first half of 2011 from a competitor's recall in late 2010. 
Note that volume will remain critical to our sales growth in emerging markets in 2012. It will be partially offset by the U.S. For the company in total, pricing gains should average about 4% compared to 3% last year. 
With continued strengthening of the dollar against a number of key currencies in the fourth quarter, including the euro, Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, reducing sales by 1%. If current exchange rates continue throughout the year, 2012 full year sales would decline by the same 1%. On an earnings basis, foreign exchange is expected to reduce EPS by about $0.06 per share in 2012 versus 2011. 
The gross margin in the fourth quarter was just over 61%, down from 62.3% a year ago and the 63% full year figure. As expected, higher dairy and commodity costs were at work, particularly affecting North America. In addition, we saw unfavorable fixed cost absorption as lower U.S. production rates in the second half of the year drove through our cost of goods sold. 
Lower production volumes were driven by a partial share recovery by a competitor following their late 2010 recall. We are expecting 2012 gross margins to remain around 63% for the full year. Inflation and our cost of goods sold is expected to moderate in the mid to high single-digits, 12% inflation in 2011. Higher pricing, strong productivity initiatives and improved manufacturing performance will all contribute and help offset the impact of commodity and conversion cost inflation. 
As we have mentioned in prior calls that recent dairy price increases have been particularly significant in North America, while Asia had reported some declines since peaking in mid-2011. While we have seen some modest declines from non-fat dry milk in North America over the last 3 months, any benefit has been completely offset by higher lactose and whey prices. The gross margins in the North America/Europe segment will remain under pressure in 2012. 
If you look at our year end balance sheet, you will see that our inventories are up by $94 million compared to the end of September. During the fourth quarter, we purchased an additional 6 months of our 2012 milk requirements for Asia. That accounts for $77 million of the inventory increase. This was done to provide better price stability for 2012. We took into account expert views on future prices. With this advanced buy, we have 10 months of certainty for a significant portion of our Asian dairy cost of goods sold this year. 
As expected, operating expenses totaling $382 million in the fourth quarter were up by $33 million or $0.12 per share versus the third quarter. Recent settlement expense accounted for about $0.03 of the increase. Remember that this expense showed up in the third quarter of 2010, with the timing factors that doesn't influence our full year comparison. 
In addition, we saw a $0.04 drop in foreign exchange balance sheet remeasurement gains relative to the third quarter. Higher level investment in sales force, marketing and research and development account for the remaining $0.05. 
On an annual basis, 2011 operating expense came in at 39.3% of sales. We expect to see a similar spend level in 2012. Although we are no longer operating on the Bristol-Myers Squibb platform, we will eliminate $12 million in duplicate shared service costs. And we also should see greater leverage of our general and administrative spending or G&A, now as we start to leverage a common global IT platform. We currently intend to reinvest most of these G&A savings back into the business, with the U.S. mass media campaign being one item of particular note. As was the case in 2011, if our sales expectations move higher during the year, we will continue to look at other demand generation investment opportunities to drive further sales growth. 
Non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR for the quarter, was 31.3%, up from 27.3% a year ago. We reforecast our full tax rate each quarter to true up our year-to-date tax accruals to reflect that latest rate. This introduces additional volatility in our quarterly tax rate. When we look at the numbers on a full year basis however, much of that volatility is removed. Our non-GAAP effective rate was 28.5% in 2011, right in line with the 28.6% in 2010. We expect that the effective tax rate will center around 28% in 2012 but could vary from 27.5% to 28.5%.  
Putting all these factors together, we forecast that non-GAAP EPS will fall in the range of $3 to $3.10 per share this year. 
Classified items reduced non-GAAP earnings by $0.32 per share in 2011, reflecting the heavy investment in our new SAP technology platform. While SAP is fully functional around our global business, we need to finish the effort by installing a few related software application, much reduced cost than in 2011. Classified costs will therefore fall to $0.09 per share in 2012. On a GAAP basis, earnings should range from $2.91 to $3.01 per share this year, up 18% to 22% versus the $2.47 in GAAP EPS in 2011. 
Before turning the call back to Steve, I'd like to highlight a few items about our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow, measured as cash from operations less capital expenditures, reached an impressive $523 million last year. We ended 2011 with $840 million in cash, up $245 million from December of 2010. That's after a dividend increase of nearly 16% and the repurchase of about 1.3 million shares of our stock, which consumed $82 million of our cash. 
Bad debt fell 26% during 2011 from $938 million to $692 million. The highest priority for our cash is to grow our business, which is exemplified by capital spending, which is estimated at $220 million in 2012, about double the level from 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated to grow from $75 million to $83 million. Including in our capital expenditures is roughly $100 million for our new spray dryer and technology center in Singapore. The total capital cost for this project is $300 million, which will be completed in 2014. Upgrades and other normal capital spending should run around $120 million in 2012, equivalent to about 3% of sales. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

We increased prices in the U.S. 4% back in August so we'll get about a half year benefit of that this year. So that implies obviously that the volume decline for North America/Europe is going to be in the high single-digits, if you will. And some of that decline is coming from the fact that we expect the total market to be down another 2% to 3%. We also are comparing against higher share during the Abbott recall for the first half of last year, which is accounting for a couple of points, and then it's the residual piece that really is driven by the December issue.

And it's only going to run for a few weeks, and then we will revert to our preplanned and existing demand creation programs, which we already know to be effective and competitive. The innovations that we launched in 2010, namely the patented Dual Blend Prebiotics, Enfamil Newborn and the proprietary packaging system have been remarkably successful in the market and have contributed to our growth in 2011 as they will in 2012. We would be confidently reporting our expectation of further share gains absent that year-on-year comparison with the Similac recall were it not for the December media recall issue. While it is still early days, as Pete said, that issue is going to have a meaningful downward impact on our business in the United States.

We actually feel we maintained that or even gained against that in the fourth quarter of last year. But on a full year basis and that's what we're talking about here because we're giving full year guidance, we had somewhere between 2% to 2.5% market share gains in the first quarter or second quarter of 2010 versus the prior year.

And we would expect to see growth in the high single digits, low double digits again for the industry in 2012. So I don't think we're really anticipating much change from that. But all I would say is we would expect it to revert to something closer to maybe what we had prior to this year.

In 2011, we saw a particular boost, if you like, to that momentum coming from the various quality issues that local -- some local companies were suffering, from some of the regulatory actions that the government took in order to address food safety concerns, from the Japanese nuclear disaster which impacted the Japanese and some formula brands that are particularly strong in some areas of China and notably in Hong Kong.

I mean, and really that question, Bob, I think the reason that the gains would be seen in the fourth quarter is because the fourth quarter of 2011 was so low. We did see a very significant drop in our EPS in the fourth quarter versus the third so it's $0.52 versus, I believe, $0.78 or $0.79, excuse me. And that came from the timing of spending for advertising and promotion, to some extent, sales force adds, et cetera. It also came because of the impact of dairy costs in the fourth quarter, the North America hit rates started to come through. And it was also driven by the SAP implementation. So we said in our third quarter call that we had roughly $13 million in sales above what we normally would've seen because of the SAP launch in Asia in October of last year. And obviously, that came out of the fourth quarter. So you had a number of unusual items like that. There can be quite a bit of volatility based on the timing of campaigns for advertising, particularly in markets outside the U.S. that can drive variability quarter-to-quarter. But I do think too that when you're sitting back and reporting for this year, we would expect that some of those should moderate significantly. We would revert to a steadier profile. But I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary, if you will, that would be considered repetitive for 2012 on a quarterly basis."

As you read in our press release, we concluded 2011 with continued strong performance. We delivered an exceptional year of sales and earnings growth. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.52 per share on 14",1747,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As you read in our press release, we concluded 2011 with continued strong performance. We delivered an exceptional year of sales and earnings growth. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.52 per share on 14% constant dollar sales growth were in line with our expectations. As expected, higher dairy prices, greater demand generation investments and the timing of pension settlement expense and tax accruals more than offset the benefit of sales growth in the quarter. Our fourth quarter results for full year non-GAAP earnings to $2.79 per share, an increase of 15% from the prior year. 
Let me highlight some of our key achievements in 2011. First, we delivered 14% constant dollar sales growth on a full year basis, setting a new growth record for the company in recent times. This growth was led by our Asia/Latin America segment, which posted 22% growth excluding foreign exchange, now accounts for 66% of our global sales, up from 61% in 2010. 
In the markets where we compete, our sales grew at the highest rate of any of the 5 major global competitors during the year. Sales in China/Hong Kong grew over 40%, and it became our top global market in 2011, with sales of over $1 billion. North America/Europe segment grew by 3% from a combination of both volume and price. The majority of this growth came from the United States despite continued declines in birth and formula consumption. 
We delivered gross margins of 63% for the year, a drop of only 40 basis points from 2010 despite inflationary pressures on our product costs that approached 12%. Higher pricing and record productivity helped to mitigate the commodity headwinds, which were largely seen in the second half of the year. Our supply chain team exceeded their productivity goal by delivering over 4% savings on cost of goods sold. 
We continue to invest competitively in sales force expansion, advertising and promotion, marketing and research and development and have seen results of market share gains measured on a value basis across Asia/Latin America. 
We completed our global SAP implementation and shared service transition in October. This was the final step on our road to full independence from Bristol-Myers Squibb. The successful execution was the result of a tremendous effort led by dedicated employees around the world. This project is a critical cornerstone of our plans to drive global operational efficiencies and reduced general and administrative spending from 8.5% of sales in 2011 to 6.5% by 2015. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened our third Mead Johnson Pediatric Nutrition Institute in Guangzhou, China, adding to the existing institutes in Latin America and the U.S. These centers provide additional capabilities to develop nutritional science and new products, and facilitate strong relationships with key scientific and regulatory stakeholders around the world. 
In December, we announced the decision to build our first Asia spray dryer and technology center, which will be located in Singapore. This is the biggest capital expenditure in our company's history and needed to support the future growth of our fast-growing Asia region. 
Finally, I announced a number of management changes at year end, designed to support the company's ambitious growth plans. Kasper Jakobsen, who most recently served as the Head of our Americas business and previously led our Asia region was named our Chief Operating Officer, a newly created position to oversee our global commercial operations. Additionally, I appointed Charles Urbain, previously President of Asia and Europe, to the new role of Senior Vice President, Stakeholder Relations and Chief Development Officer in recognition of the importance of business development to complement our superior organic growth. 
Let me now provide some additional commentary on our performance in our 2 operating segments in 2011, and then conclude with our latest thinking on expected growth in 2012. Starting with Asia and Latin America, I've already noted the constant dollar sales in China/Hong Kong grew in excess of 40% in 2011, with the vast majority of the increase from higher volumes. These markets now account for just under 30% of our total sales. As we mentioned at our Investor Day last fall, we expect 2012 growth rates in China/Hong Kong to be below the levels seen in 2011. We estimate that about 75% of our recent volume gains came from increased market share in the quarter from overall market growth. 
From a planning perspective, while we will continue to grow share, we can't anticipate that the magnitude of share gains seen last year will continue indefinitely given the competitiveness of the category. While there's no doubt that food safety concerns in China have led some parents to move toward premium brands such as Enfamil, we cannot predict that this trend will continue at the same rate. As a result, we currently anticipate that growth will return to more normal levels in 2012, while still being well above the mid-teen average expected for the Asia/Latin America segment. 
Note that by the end of 2011, we were fully resourced in 241 cities in China. The new cities we entered in the last 18 months contributed about 15% of our volume growth, with the majority of growth coming from established cities. In 2012, we expect to continue our geographic expansion into an additional 50 cities through our disciplined Step Change program. 
Importantly, our Asia/Latin America growth goes well beyond China/Hong Kong. In this segment, we saw a dozen markets growing in double digits. As Kasper presented at our Investor Day, Latin America has targeted sales of $1 billion by 2015. We are well on our way to achieving that goal, with the Latin America regional sales growth in the mid-teens and Brazil growing rapidly to become our eighth largest sales market in 2011. 
In the North America/Europe segment, annual sales was 3% favorable to the prior year on a constant dollar basis. You should note that about a point of this growth came from a liquid adult private label nutrition product we manufactured for U.S. retailers in the second half of the year. Excluding this private label sales, constant dollar growth of 2% came mainly in the U.S. from product innovation launched in 2010, along with the benefit from a competitive late 2010 product recall. 
In reflecting upon the full year, I'm pleased with the gains made in the U.S., where pricing and increased market share more than offset the continued decline in the birth rate and lower infant formula consumption. However, this segment is not without its challenges as we enter 2012. Most of you are aware of the media issue in late December concerning several infant formula brands, including Enfamil Newborn. The FDA and CDC ultimately issued a joint press release 9 days after the story first broke, which stated that there was no contamination found in sealed containers of our product, entirely consistent with the results from our own exhaustive quality testing protocols. 
While it is very difficult to quantify the impact at this early date, we believe that misleading headlines and the resultant uncertainty caused some moms to switch from the Enfamil brand and others to start on an alternative formula. We responded quickly with appropriate activities, including an extensive e-mail communication, reassuring millions of mothers about the 2,300 quality and safety checks we perform to ensure the integrity of every product that we ship to market. 
We've now begun a broader mass-market campaign, including TV advertising, focusing on our quality testing and the fact that we are the #1 brand recommended by pediatricians in the U.S. While there was no noticeable impact on our fourth quarter sales given the late December timing, we expect to see lower market share potentially into the third quarter of this year, as those babies who switched were started on another formula age into heavier consumption period. 
Let me also highlight 3 other factors that will drive U.S. results. First, we expect that the birth rate and infant formula consumption will continue to fall in 2012, reducing industry sales by a further 2% to 3%. Again, keep in mind that we gained market share from a late 2010 competitor's recall that favorably helped our first half 2011 revenues. That benefit dissipated as we moved through last year. Our first half comparisons in the U.S. for 2012 will suffer as a result. 
Third, there are a number of WIC contracts that are open for bidding in 2012. The biggest contract that we currently hold is in California, which accounts for more than 14% of total WIC births. California was rebid late in November, and I am pleased that we retained this contract, which will roll over effective August 1. We have 2 other contracts that account for a total of 7% of WIC birth that have yet to be bid with a rollover date of October 3. 
While these factors in the U.S. will have the greatest impact on segment results, we do expect to see some modest growth in Europe. You'll recall that in the second quarter of 2011, we implemented SAP in this market and moved to a new distribution model, where we hold more inventory centrally rather than at our distributors. The absence of this inventory correction will contribute to growth in 2012. 
Finally, let me comment upon our outlook for 2012. We look forward to a year of solid sales and earnings growth. It's very early in the year, and there is more uncertainty than usual given the present conditions in the U.S. market. Nevertheless, we currently expect constant dollar sales growth for the company to be in the range of 7% to 9% for the full year, with Asia and Latin America growth in the mid-teens, while North America/Europe is expected to decline in the mid-single digits for the reasons described a few moments ago. 
We are initiating 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $3 to $3.10, up 8% to 11% relative to 2011. Gross margin will be around 63% for the full year, flat with 2011, as higher pricing and productivity offset dairy and cost inflation particularly for North America. 
We expect to see total operating expenses of around 39.3% as seen in 2011. We intend to take the majority of the savings from reductions in general and administrative spending and reinvest them back into the business to sustain our strong growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights, and I will return to wrap up and take your questions."

I'll walk down our income statement, providing some additional detail on our fourth quarter results and highlight trends that we currently forecast for 2012. Starting with our top line, as Steve mentioned, cons",1462,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk down our income statement, providing some additional detail on our fourth quarter results and highlight trends that we currently forecast for 2012. 
Starting with our top line, as Steve mentioned, constant dollar sales grew by 14% in the fourth quarter, basically in line with our full year 2011 results. Growth was largely driven by our Asia/Latin America segment. We saw a sales growth of 18%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, with 14% from volume and 4% from price. 
We also reported 6% growth from our North America/Europe operations in the fourth quarter, almost equally split between volume and pricing. This was driven by a number of factors. While 2/3 of the segment's higher sales originated in Europe, it started to reduce distributors' inventory during the fourth quarter of 2010 in anticipation of the SAP launch and new distribution model in 2011. That made the comparison easier this past quarter. 
In October 2011, we launched our patented Dual Prebiotics and our plastic tub and value refill box system in Canada, increasing volumes there. And as Steve mentioned, we have some sales from the manufacturing of private label adult nutrition products for retailers. As you would expect, these sales carry a significantly lower gross margin than our core product offerings. 
Absent these factors, our U.S. business was down by 1% in the fourth quarter. The benefit of the August price increase was evident at about 4%, with volumes down about 5%, reflecting a tougher comparison against the competitor's recall in the prior year. 
Looking forward, we expect 2012 sales growth for the company to run between 7% to 9% excluding foreign exchange, down from 14% in 2011. Asia/Latin America at constant dollar sales should grow in the mid-teens versus 22% last year. Lower but still impressive planned growth in China/Hong Kong is the key driver. North America and Europe sales are expected to decline by the mid-single digits versus growth of 3% in 2011, reflecting lower birth and consumption, as well as lower average market share, as Steve outlined earlier. 
We expect that the comparison will be toughest in the first half of the year, possibly into the third quarter, so babies who switched from Enfamil because of the December media issue are to age out of the category. And remember, we also had captured a higher number of babies in the first half of 2011 from a competitor's recall in late 2010. 
Note that volume will remain critical to our sales growth in emerging markets in 2012. It will be partially offset by the U.S. For the company in total, pricing gains should average about 4% compared to 3% last year. 
With continued strengthening of the dollar against a number of key currencies in the fourth quarter, including the euro, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, reducing sales by 1%. If current exchange rates continue throughout the year, 2012 full year sales would decline by the same 1%. On an earnings basis, foreign exchange is expected to reduce EPS by about $0.06 per share in 2012 versus 2011. 
The gross margin in the fourth quarter was just over 61%, down from 62.3% a year ago and the 63% full year figure. As expected, higher dairy and commodity costs were at work, particularly affecting North America. In addition, we saw unfavorable fixed cost absorption as lower U.S. production rates in the second half of the year rolled through our cost of goods sold. 
Lower production volumes were driven by a partial share recovery by a competitor following their late 2010 recall. We are expecting 2012 gross margins to remain around 63% for the full year. Inflation and our cost of goods sold is expected to moderate in the mid- to high-single digit, following a 12% inflation in 2011. Higher pricing, strong productivity initiatives and improved manufacturing performance will all contribute and help offset the impact of commodity and conversion cost inflation. 
Note that we have mentioned in prior calls, that recent dairy price increases have been particularly significant in North America, while Asia had reported some declines since peaking in mid-2011. While we have seen some modest decline for non-fat dry milk in North America over the last 3 months, any benefit has been completely offset by higher lactose and whey prices. The gross margins in the North America/Europe segment will remain under pressure in 2012. 
If you look at our year-end balance sheet, you will see that our inventories are up by $94 million compared to the end of September. During the fourth quarter, we purchased an additional 6 months of our 2012 milk requirements for Asia. That accounts for $77 million of the inventory increase. This was done to provide better price stability for 2012. We took into account expert views on future prices. With this advanced buy, we have 10 months of certainty for a significant portion of our Asian dairy cost of goods sold this year. 
As expected, operating expenses totaling $382 million in the fourth quarter were up by $33 million or $0.12 per share versus the third quarter. Pension settlement expense accounted for about $0.03 of the increase. Remember that this expense showed up in the third quarter of 2010, with the timing factor that doesn't influence our full year comparison. 
In addition, we saw a $0.04 drop in foreign exchange balance sheet remeasurement gains relative to the third quarter. Higher level of investment in sales force, marketing and research and development account for the remaining $0.05. 
On an annual basis, 2011 operating expense came in at 39.3% of sales. We expect to see a similar spend level in 2012. Now that we are no longer operating on the Bristol-Myers Squibb platform, we will eliminate $12 million in duplicate shared service costs. And we also should see greater leverage of our general and administrative spending or G&A, now as we start to leverage a common global IT platform. We currently intend to reinvest most of these G&A savings back into the business, with the U.S. mass media campaign being one item of particular note. As was the case in 2011, if our sales expectations move higher during the year, we will continue to look at other demand generation investment opportunities to drive further sales growth. 
Non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR for the quarter, was 31.3%, up from 27.3% a year ago. We reforecast our full tax rate each quarter to true up our year-to-date tax accruals to reflect that latest rate. This introduces additional volatility in our quarterly tax rate. When we look at the numbers on a full year basis however, much of that volatility is removed. Our non-GAAP effective rate was 28.5% in 2011, right in line with the 28.6% in 2010. We expect that the effective tax rate will center around 28% in 2012 but could vary from 27.5% to 28.5%.  
Putting all these factors together, we forecast that non-GAAP EPS will fall in the range of $3 to $3.10 per share this year. 
Classified items reduced non-GAAP earnings by $0.32 per share in 2011, reflecting the heavy investment in our new SAP technology platform. While SAP is fully functional around our global business, we need to finish the effort by installing a few related software application, but at much reduced cost than in 2011. Classified costs will therefore fall to $0.09 per share in 2012. On a GAAP basis, earnings should range from $2.91 to $3.01 per share this year, up 18% to 22% versus the $2.47 in GAAP EPS in 2011. 
Before turning the call back to Steve, I'd like to highlight a few items about our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow, measured as cash from operations less capital expenditures, reached an impressive $523 million last year. We ended 2011 with $840 million in cash, up $245 million from December of 2010. That's after a dividend increase of nearly 16% and the repurchase of about 1.3 million shares of our stock, which consumed $82 million in cash. 
Net debt fell 26% during 2011 from $938 million to $692 million. The highest priority for our cash is to grow our business, which is exemplified by capital spending, which is estimated at $220 million in 2012, about double the level from 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated to grow from $75 million to $83 million. 
Concluding in our capital expenditures, it is roughly $100 million for our new spray dryer and technology center in Singapore. The total capital cost for this project is $300 million, which will be completed in 2014. Upgrades and other normal capital spending should run around $120 million in 2012, equivalent to about 3% of sales. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

We increased prices in the U.S., 4% back in August, so we'll get about a half year benefit of that this year. So that implies, obviously, that the volume decline for North America/Europe is going to be in the high-single digits, if you will. And some of that decline is coming from the fact that we expect the total market to be down another 2% to 3%. We also are comparing against higher share during the Abbott recall for the first half of last year, which is accounting for a couple of points, and then it's the residual piece that really is driven by the December issue.

But I think, from an overall perspective, as it stands now, if you're doing your model building, relatively flat EPS per quarter through the year would make sense."

We intend to be in it for another 100 years, and we are going to spend whatever it takes to restore the trust in Mead Johnson and our products that we fully deserve, and make sure that they understand our unwavering commitment to quality.

And it's only going to run for a few weeks, and then we will revert to our preplanned and existing demand creation programs, which we already know to be effective and competitive. The innovations that we launched in 2010, namely the patented Dual Blend Prebiotics, Enfamil Newborn and the proprietary packaging system have been remarkably successful in the market and have contributed to our growth in 2011, as they will in 2012. We would be confidently reporting our expectation of further share gains absent that year-on-year comparison with the Similac recall, were it not for the December media issue. While it is still early days, as Pete said, that issue is going to have a meaningful downward impact on our business in the United States. You can imagine how we feel about that. But we've got to be realistic and deal with it, and we're going to deal with it with conviction now and spend what it takes to rebuild momentum as quickly as we possibly can."

We actually feel we maintained that or even gained against that in the fourth quarter of last year. But on a full year basis and that's what we're talking about here because we're giving full year guidance, we had somewhere between 2% to 2.5% market share gains in the first quarter or second quarter of 2010 versus the prior year.

We're not going to give, David, as you might imagine, specific numbers out there especially at this point in the year.

It grew at 40% last year. 30 of those points were coming from, we believe, from market share gains. And we would expect to see growth in the high-single digits, low-double digits again for the industry in 2012. So I don't think we're really anticipating much change from that. But all I would say is, we would expect it to revert to something closer to maybe what we had prior to this year. So you can sit back and do the math, we're taking Asia/Latin America segment down from 22% to the mid-teens. That could be 15%, 16%.

That's fundamentally behind our competitiveness. In 2011, we saw a particular boost, if you like, to that momentum coming from the various quality issues that local -- some local companies were suffering, from some of the regulatory actions that the government took in order to address food safety concerns, from the Japanese nuclear disaster, which impacted the Japanese and some formula brands that are particularly strong in some areas of China and notably in Hong Kong.

I mean, and really that question, Bob, I think the reason that the gains would be seen in the fourth quarter is because the fourth quarter of 2011 was so low. We did see a very significant drop in our EPS in the fourth quarter versus the third, so it's $0.52 versus, I believe, $0.78 or $0.79, excuse me. And that came from the timing of spending for advertising and promotion, to some extent, sales force adds, et cetera. It also came because of the impact of dairy costs in the fourth quarter, the North America had really started to come through. And it was also driven by the SAP implementation. So we said in our third quarter call, that we had roughly $13 million in sales above what we normally would have seen because of the SAP launch in Asia in October of last year. And obviously, that came out of the fourth quarter. So you had a number of unusual items like that. There can be quite a bit of volatility based on the timing of campaigns for advertising, particularly in markets outside the U.S. that can drive variability quarter-to-quarter. But I do think too that, when you're sitting back and reporting for this year, we would expect that some of those should moderate significantly. We would revert to a steadier profile. But I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary, if you will, that would be considered repetitive for 2012 on a quarterly basis."

1002291,145606000,211322,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2012",2012-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As you read in our press release, we concluded 2011 with continued strong performance and delivered an exceptional year of sales and earnings growth. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.52 per share on 14",1753,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As you read in our press release, we concluded 2011 with continued strong performance and delivered an exceptional year of sales and earnings growth. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.52 per share on 14% constant dollar sales growth were in line with our expectations. As expected, higher dairy prices, greater demand generation investments and the timing of pension settlement expense and tax accruals more than offset the benefit of sales growth in the quarter. Our fourth quarter results brought full year non-GAAP earnings to $2.79 per share, an increase of 15% from the prior year. 
Let me highlight some of our key achievements in 2011. First, we delivered 14% constant dollar sales growth on a full year basis, setting a new growth record for the company in recent times. This growth was led by our Asia/Latin America segment, which posted 22% growth excluding foreign exchange, and now accounts for 66% of our global sales, up from 61% in 2010. 
In the markets where we compete, our sales grew at the highest rate of any of the 5 major global competitors during the year. Sales in China/Hong Kong grew over 40%, and it became our top global market in 2011, with sales of over $1 billion. The North America/Europe segment grew by 3% from a combination of both volume and price. The majority of this growth came from the United States despite continued declines in birth and formula consumption. 
We delivered gross margins of 63% for the year, a drop of only 40 basis points from 2010 despite inflationary pressures on our product costs that approached 12%. Higher pricing and record productivity helped to mitigate the commodity headwinds, which were largely seen in the second half of the year. Our supply chain team exceeded their productivity goal by delivering over 4% savings on cost of goods sold. 
We continue to invest competitively in sales force expansion, advertising and promotion, marketing and research and development and have seen results in market share gains measured on a value basis across Asia/Latin America. 
We completed our global SAP implementation and shared service transition in October. This was the final step on our road to full independence from Bristol-Myers Squibb. The successful execution was the result of a tremendous effort led by dedicated employees around the world. This project is a critical cornerstone of our plans to drive global operational efficiencies and reduce general and administrative spending from 8.5% of sales in 2011 to 6.5% by 2015. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened our third Mead Johnson Pediatric Nutrition Institute in Guangzhou, China, adding to the existing institutes in Latin America and the U.S. These centers provide additional capabilities to develop nutritional science and new products, and facilitate strong relationships with key scientific and regulatory stakeholders around the world. 
In December, we announced the decision to build our first Asia spray dryer and technology center, which will be located in Singapore. This is the biggest capital expenditure in our company's history and is needed to support the future growth of our fast-growing Asia region. 
Finally, I announced a number of management changes at year end, designed to support the company's ambitious growth plans. Kasper Jakobsen, who most recently served as the Head of our Americas business and previously led our Asia region was named our Chief Operating Officer, a newly created position to oversee our global commercial operations. Additionally, I appointed Charles Urbain, previously President of Asia and Europe, to the new role of Senior Vice President, Stakeholder Relations and Chief Development Officer in recognition of the importance of business development to complement our superior organic growth. 
Let me now provide some additional commentary on our performance in our 2 operating segments in 2011, and then conclude with our latest thinking on expected growth in 2012. Starting with Asia and Latin America, I've already noted the constant dollar sales in China/Hong Kong grew in excess of 40% in 2011, with the vast majority of the increase from higher volumes. These markets now account for just under 30% of our total sales. As we mentioned at our Investor Day last fall, we expect 2012 growth rates in China/Hong Kong to be below the levels seen in 2011. We estimate that about 75% of our recent volume gains came from increased market share in the quarter from overall market growth. 
From a planning perspective, while we will continue to grow share, we can't anticipate that the magnitude of share gains seen last year will continue indefinitely given the competitiveness of the category. And while there's no doubt that food safety concerns in China have led some parents to move toward premium brands such as Enfamil, we cannot predict that this trend will continue at the same rate. As a result, we currently anticipate that growth will return to more normal levels in 2012, while still being well above the mid-teen average expected for the Asia/Latin America segment. 
Note that by the end of 2011, we were fully resourced in 241 cities in China. The new cities we entered in the last 18 months contributed about 15% of our volume growth, with the majority of growth coming from established cities. In 2012, we expect to continue our geographic expansion into an additional 50 cities through our disciplined Step Change program. 
Importantly, our Asia/Latin America growth goes well beyond China/Hong Kong. In this segment, we saw a dozen markets growing in double digits. As Kasper presented at our Investor Day, Latin America has targeted sales of $1 billion by 2015. We are well on our way to achieving that goal, with the Latin America regional sales growth in the mid-teens and Brazil growing rapidly to become our eighth largest sales market in 2011. 
In the North America/Europe segment, annual sales was 3% favorable to the prior year on a constant dollar basis. I should note that about a point of this growth came from a liquid adult private label nutrition product we manufactured for U.S. retailers in the second half of the year. Excluding these private label sales, constant dollar growth of 2% came mainly in the U.S. from product innovation launched in 2010, along with the benefit from a competitive late 2010 product recall. 
In reflecting upon the full year, I'm pleased with the gains made in the U.S., where pricing and increased market share more than offset the continued decline in the birth rate and lower infant formula consumption. However, this segment is not without its challenges as we enter 2012. Most of you are aware of the media issue in late December concerning several infant formula brands, including Enfamil Newborn. The FDA and CDC ultimately issued a joint press release 9 days after the story first broke, which stated that there was no contamination found in sealed containers of our product, entirely consistent with the results from our own exhaustive quality testing protocols. 
While it is very difficult to quantify the impact at this early date, we believe that misleading headlines and the resultant uncertainty caused some moms to switch from the Enfamil brand and others to start on an alternative formula. We responded quickly with appropriate activities, including an extensive e-mail communication, reassuring millions of mothers about the 2,300 quality and safety checks we perform to ensure the integrity of every product that we ship to market. 
And we've now begun a broader mass-market campaign, including TV advertising, focusing on our quality testing and the fact that we are the #1 brand recommended by pediatricians in the U.S. While there was no noticeable impact on our fourth quarter sales given the late December timing, we expect to see lower market share potentially into the third quarter of this year, as those babies who switched were started on another formula age into heavier consumption period. 
Let me also highlight 3 other factors that will drive U.S. results. First, we expect that the birth rate and infant formula consumption will continue to fall in 2012, reducing industry sales by a further 2% to 3%. Second, keep in mind that we gained market share from a late 2010 competitor's recall that favorably helped our first half 2011 revenues. That benefit dissipated as we moved through last year. Our first half comparisons in the U.S. for 2012 will suffer as a result. 
Third, there are a number of WIC contracts that are open for bidding in 2012. The biggest contract that we currently hold is in California, which accounts for more than 14% of total WIC births. California was rebid late in November, and I am pleased that we retained this contract, which will roll over effective August 1. We have 2 other contracts that account for a total of 7% of WIC births that have yet to be bid with a rollover date of October 3. 
While these factors in the U.S. will have the greatest impact on segment results, we do expect to see some modest growth in Europe. You'll recall that in the second quarter of 2011, we implemented SAP in this market and moved to a new distribution model, where we hold more inventory centrally rather than at our distributors. The absence of this inventory correction will contribute to growth in 2012. 
Finally, let me comment upon our outlook for 2012. We look forward to a year of solid sales and earnings growth. It's very early in the year, and there is more uncertainty than usual given the present conditions in the U.S. market. Nevertheless, we currently expect constant dollar sales growth for the company to be in the range of 7% to 9% for the full year, with Asia and Latin America growth in the mid-teens, while North America/Europe is expected to decline in the mid-single digits for the reasons described a few moments ago. 
We are initiating 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $3 to $3.10, up 8% to 11% relative to 2011. Gross margin will be around 63% for the full year, flat with 2011, as higher pricing and productivity offset dairy and cost inflation, particularly for North America. 
And we expect to see total operating expenses of around 39.3% as seen in 2011. We intend to take the majority of the savings from reductions in general and administrative spending and reinvest them back into the business to sustain our strong growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to Pete to provide you further highlights, and I will return to wrap up and take your questions."

I'll walk down our income statement, providing some additional detail on our fourth quarter results and highlight trends that we currently forecast for 2012. Starting with our top line, as Steve mentioned, cons",1466,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk down our income statement, providing some additional detail on our fourth quarter results and highlight trends that we currently forecast for 2012. 
Starting with our top line, as Steve mentioned, constant dollar sales grew by 14% in the fourth quarter, basically in line with our full year 2011 results. The growth was largely driven by our Asia/Latin America segment, which saw a sales growth of 18%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, with 14% from volume and 4% from price. 
We also reported 6% growth from our North America/Europe operations in the fourth quarter, almost equally split between volume and pricing. This was driven by a number of factors. About 2/3 of the segment's higher sales originated in Europe. We had started to reduce distributors' inventory during the fourth quarter of 2010 in anticipation of the SAP launch and new distribution model in 2011. That made the comparison easier this past quarter. 
In October 2011, we launched our patented Dual Prebiotics and our plastic tub and value refill box system in Canada, increasing volumes there. And as Steve mentioned, we have some sales from the manufacturing of private label adult nutrition products for retailers. As you would expect, these sales carry a significantly lower gross margin than our core product offerings. 
Absent these factors, our U.S. business was down by 1% in the fourth quarter. The benefit of the August price increase was evident at about 4%, with volumes down about 5%, reflecting a tougher comparison against a competitor's recall in the prior year. 
Looking forward, we expect 2012 sales growth for the company to run between 7% to 9% excluding foreign exchange, down from 14% in 2011. Asia/Latin America at constant dollar sales should grow in the mid-teens versus 22% last year. Lower but still impressive planned growth in China/Hong Kong is the key driver. North America and Europe sales are expected to decline by the mid-single digits versus growth of 3% in 2011, reflecting lower births and consumption, as well as lower average market share, as Steve outlined earlier. 
We expect that the comparison will be toughest in the first half of the year, possibly into the third quarter, until babies who switched from Enfamil because of the December media issue start to age out of the category. And remember, we also had captured a higher number of babies in the first half of 2011 from a competitor's recall in late 2010. 
Note that volume will remain critical to our sales growth in emerging markets in 2012. It will be partially offset by the U.S. For the company in total, pricing gains should average about 4% compared to 3% last year. 
There was continued strengthening of the dollar against a number of key currencies in the fourth quarter, including the euro, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso, reducing sales by 1%. If current exchange rates continue throughout the year, 2012 full year sales would decline by the same 1%. On an earnings basis, foreign exchange is expected to reduce EPS by about $0.06 per share in 2012 versus 2011. 
Our gross margin in the fourth quarter was just over 61%, down from 62.3% a year ago and the 63% full year figure. As expected, higher dairy and commodity costs were at work, particularly affecting North America. In addition, we saw unfavorable fixed cost absorption as lower U.S. production rates in the second half of the year rolled through our cost of goods sold. 
The lower production volumes were driven by a partial share recovery by a competitor following their late 2010 recall. We are expecting 2012 gross margins to remain around 63% for the full year. Inflation and our cost of goods sold is expected to moderate to the mid- to high-single digit, following 12% inflation in 2011. Higher pricing, strong productivity initiatives and improved manufacturing performance will all contribute and help offset the impact of commodity and conversion cost inflation. 
Note that we have mentioned in prior calls that recent dairy price increases have been particularly significant in North America, while Asia had reported some declines since peaking in mid-2011. While we have seen some modest decline for non-fat dry milk in North America over the last 3 months, any benefit has been completely offset by higher lactose and whey prices. So gross margins in the North America/Europe segment will remain under pressure in 2012. 
If you look at our year-end balance sheet, you will see that our inventories are up by $94 million compared to the end of September. During the fourth quarter, we purchased an additional 6 months of our 2012 milk requirements for Asia. That accounts for $77 million of the inventory increase. This was done to provide better price stability for 2012 and took into account expert views on future prices. With this advanced buy, we have 10 months of certainty for a significant portion of our Asian dairy cost of goods sold this year. 
As expected, operating expenses totaling $382 million in the fourth quarter were up by $33 million or $0.12 per share versus the third quarter. Pension settlement expense accounted for about $0.03 of the increase. Remember that this expense showed up in the third quarter of 2010, so it’s timing factor that doesn't influence our full year comparison. 
In addition, we saw a $0.04 drop in foreign exchange balance sheet remeasurement gains relative to the third quarter. A higher level of investment in sales force, marketing and research and development account for the remaining $0.05. 
On an annual basis, 2011 operating expense came in at 39.3% of sales. We expect to see a similar spend level in 2012. Now that we are no longer operating on the Bristol-Myers Squibb platform, we will eliminate $12 million in duplicate shared service costs. And we also should see greater leverage of our general and administrative spending or G&A, now as we start to leverage a common global IT platform. We currently intend to reinvest most of these G&A savings back into the business, with the U.S. mass media campaign being one item of particular note. As was the case in 2011, if our sales expectations move higher during the year, we will continue to look at other demand generation investment opportunities to drive further sales growth. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate or ETR for the quarter, was 31.3%, up from 27.3% a year ago. We reforecast our full tax rate each quarter and true up our year-to-date tax accruals to reflect that latest rate. This introduces additional volatility in our quarterly tax rates. When we look at the numbers on a full year basis however, much of that volatility is removed. Our non-GAAP effective rate was 28.5% in 2011, right in line with the 28.6% in 2010. We expect that the effective tax rate will center around 28% in 2012 but could vary from 27.5% to 28.5%. Pulling all these factors together, we forecast that non-GAAP EPS will fall in the range of $3 to $3.10 per share this year. 
Classified items reduced non-GAAP earnings by $0.32 per share in 2011, reflecting the heavy investment in our new SAP technology platform. While SAP is fully functional around our global business, we need to finish the effort by installing a few related software applications, but at much reduced cost than in 2011. Classified costs will therefore fall to $0.09 per share in 2012. On a GAAP basis, earnings should range from $2.91 to $3.01 per share this year, up 18% to 22% versus the $2.47 in GAAP EPS in 2011. 
Before turning the call back to Steve, I'd like to highlight a few items about our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow, measured as cash from operations less capital expenditures, reached an impressive $523 million last year. We ended 2011 with $840 million in cash, up $245 million from December of 2010. That's after a dividend increase of nearly 16% and the repurchase of about 1.3 million shares of our stock, which consumed $82 million in cash. 
Net debt fell 26% during 2011 from $938 million to $692 million. The highest priority for our cash is to grow our business. This is exemplified by capital spending, which is estimated at $220 million in 2012, about double the level from 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated to grow from $75 million to $83 million. 
Including in our capital expenditures is roughly $100 million for our new spray dryer and technology center in Singapore. The total capital cost for this project is $300 million, which will be completed in 2014. Upgrades and other normal capital spending should run around $120 million in 2012, equivalent to about 3% of sales. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

We increased prices in the U.S., 4% back in August, so we'll get about a half-year benefit of that this year. So that implies, obviously, that the volume decline for North America/Europe is going to be in the high-single digits, if you will. And some of that decline is coming from the fact that we expect the total market to be down another 2% to 3%.

And market research data would show us that the trust in Enfamil has been diminished in the eyes of some consumers, and we need to restore that quickly. We've been in this business for 106 years. We intend to be in it for another 100 years, and we are going to spend whatever it takes to restore the trust in Mead Johnson and our products that we fully deserve, and make sure that they understand our unwavering commitment to quality. And when you see the TV advertising, I think you'll see it's firmly focused on the fact that our products go through 2,300 quality checks, and that we are the #1 brand recommended by pediatricians in the U.S., and we think that's a very important message for our core U.S. business."

And it's only going to run for a few weeks, and then we will revert to our preplanned and existing demand creation programs, which we already know to be effective and competitive. The innovations that we launched in 2010, namely the patented Dual Blend Prebiotics, Enfamil Newborn and the proprietary packaging system have been remarkably successful in the market and have contributed to our growth in 2011, as they will in 2012. We would be confidently reporting our expectation of further share gains absent that year-on-year comparison with the Similac recall, were it not for the December media issue. While it is still early days, as Pete said, that issue is going to have a meaningful downward impact on our business in the United States. You can imagine how we feel about that. But we've got to be realistic and deal with it, and we're going to deal with it with conviction now and spend what it takes to rebuild momentum as quickly as we possibly can."

We actually feel we maintained that or even gained against that in the fourth quarter of last year. But on a full year basis and that's what we're talking about here because we're giving full year guidance, we had somewhere between 2% to 2.5% market share gains in the first quarter or second quarter of 2010 versus the prior year.

We're not going to give, David, as you might imagine, specific numbers out there especially at this point in the year.

It grew at 40% last year. 30 of those points were coming from, we believe, from market share gains. And we would expect to see growth in the high-single digits, low-double digits again for the industry in 2012. So I don't think we're really anticipating much change from that. But all I would say is, we would expect it to revert to something closer to maybe what we had prior to this year. So you can sit back and do the math, we're taking Asia/Latin America segment down from 22% to the mid-teens. That could be 15%, 16%.

That's fundamentally behind our competitiveness. In 2011, we saw a particular boost, if you like, to that momentum coming from the various quality issues that local -- some local companies were suffering, from some of the regulatory actions that the government took in order to address food safety concerns, from the Japanese nuclear disaster, which impacted the Japanese and some formula brands that are particularly strong in some areas of China and notably in Hong Kong.

I mean, and really that question, Rob, I think the reason that the gains would be seen in the fourth quarter is because the fourth quarter of 2011 was so low. We did see a very significant drop in our EPS in the fourth quarter versus the third, so it's $0.52 versus, I believe, $0.78 -- or $0.79, excuse me. And that came from the timing of spending for advertising and promotion, to some extent, sales force adds, et cetera. It also came because of the impact of dairy costs in the fourth quarter, the North America had really started to come through. And it was also driven by the SAP implementation. So we said in our third quarter call, that we had roughly $13 million in sales above what we normally would have seen because of the SAP launch in Asia in October of last year. And obviously, that came out of the fourth quarter. So you had a number of unusual items like that. There can be quite a bit of volatility based on the timing of campaigns for advertising, particularly in markets outside the U.S. that can drive variability quarter-to-quarter. But I do think too that, when you're sitting back and reporting for this year, we would expect that some of those should moderate significantly. We would revert to a steadier profile. But I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary, if you will, that would be considered repetitive for 2012 on a quarterly basis."

Non-GAAP earnings of $0.82 per share were up 8% from $0.76 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings increased due to sales growth of favorable foreign exchange comparison and a lower effective tax rate partially offset by lower gross margins and higher demand generation investments. 
In the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of an 80% equity interest in the SanCor Bebe infant formula and children's nutrition business. This joint venture gives us the leading market share position in Argentina, the third largest market in Latin America and a strong platform for growth throughout the Southern Cone of South America. 
As stated in the past, that after we completed SAP implementation and the actions to achieve full standalone status, we will have more resources available to consider business development growth opportunities to complement our compelling organic growth strategies. Our business development focus will be on tuck-in deals like this one that allows us to further strengthening growth with a primary focus on emerging markets. 
will share our operating segment results shortly, let me provide an update on our full-year guidance. We continue to be very positive about our outlook for the year and expect our annual constant dollar sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 11%, up from our previous guidance of 7% to 9%. About 1.5 points of this increase was driven by the acquisition in Argentina, with the remainder for modestly higher expectations to growth in our emerging markets. 
We currently estimate that the non-GAAP EBIT margin, as a percentage of sales, will be at or slightly above the 23.6% level seen in 2011, with demand generation investments accelerating for the balance of the year. 
For the full year, non-GAAP EPS is as expected to be in the range of $3.04 and $3.14, up $0.04 from our prior guidance. I will now turn the call over to Kasper who assumed the role of Chief Operating Officer for the company earlier this year. I will return at the conclusion of our prepared remarks to wrap up and address your questions."

I'll focus my comments in operating performance and expectations of our 2 segments. Starting with Asia and Latin America, first quarter sales of this segment grew 21% on a constant dollar basis versus the prior year, with just over $700 million now accounts of 71% of our global sales. 
Absent the 2-week contribution from the Argentine joint venture following the closing in mid-March, sales increased 20%. Higher volumes were the key driver of our first quarter results adding 16% to our top line, with pricing accounting for the remaining 5% of growth. We will not talk in any deals about our specific plans in Asia and Latin America, but we expect pricing will make a bigger contribution to sales growth in the near future when compared to that seen in recent quarters. 
Our pricing actions company product innovations which frequently higher costs so this does not always translates to higher margins and we will carefully watch the impact of higher pricing on sales volumes. 
Turning to some geographic detail. Sales growth in China/Hong Kong continued at rates above the segment average. But as expected, modestly but below the very high rate of growth for the prior year. Market share remains at levels above those seen in the first quarter of 2011, a sign of the strength of Mead Johnson in infant brands in the world's largest market. 
Strong double-digit growth was also seen in the majority of markets outside of China and Hong Kong, In Southeast Asia, we've seen solid results in the first quarter with stronger growth in Vietnam and Thailand. Sales in Latin America grew at a strong pace let by Brazil and the India markets. We've made good progress in building our infant formula business in Brazil over the last 2 years, although the sales base remains quite small. 
We've concentrated on the emerging premium category in pharmacies and focused our efforts on Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and. As we expand, we continue to invest in our infant formula business in Brazil over the next few years. We also excited about the potential of our new SanCor Bebe business in Argentina. There are approximately 700,000 annual birth country, about 1/3 the numbers seen in Mexico with per capital GDP of running approximately the same level it in both markets. Yet infant formula and children's nutrition product consumption is about half the level seen in Mexico. This disconnect indicates the growth potential of the Argentine market with consumption increases expected over time. 
Our joint venture owns the market leading SanCor Bebe and Bebe cross brands. The JV which is 80% owned by Mead Johnson, as Steve mentioned, will merit the product portfolio, research and development and marketing expertise of Mead Johnson with the manufacturing and distribution capabilities, local market knowledge and market-leading position of SanCor. We expect the joint venture to pursue both in Argentina and service of base a further expansion in the Southern Cone market. 
Wrapping up the discussion in Asia and Latin America, we expect annual sales growth to be in the upper the segment on a constant dollar basis compared to the midteens guidance previously provided. The SanCor Bebe acquisition will add just over 2 points to full year segment sales growth with existing markets accounting for the remainder of the improvement. 
Turning now to the North America/Europe segment. We recorded a sales decline of 11% on a constant dollar basis. Volume was down 14% driven by the U.S. market, with pricing gains of 3%. These results were largely as we expected back in January. This is the toughest quarterly comparison we were facing 2012 with 3 key factors driving the volume decline. 
Let me highlight each noting only the first quarter  impact and how we see trends moving through the remainder of the year. Firstly, about half the shortfall was due to the one-time benefit that accrued to us in 2011 from our competitors recall. That benefit was most pronounced in the first quarter of last year dropped off in the second quarter and had little impact once we have moved into the second half. As a result of this factor, we continue to impact our yield to yield comparison the coming quarter but that's somewhat reduced level. 
Secondly, about a quarter of the decline we saw market share temporarily loss due to the misleading headlines and media reports in late December concerning several infant formula brands including infant and newborn. The FDA and CDC ultimately found no fault with our products. But the uncertainty caused some parents to switch away from the Enfamil brand. We launched a mass-market campaign in the first quarter to reassure all parents of the quality and safety of our brands and to remind them that Enfamil is the #1 brand recommended by U.S. pediatricians. The campaign has been successful. And by the end of the quarter, sales of our newborn product had recovered to pre-December levels. We are confident of a share recovery as the December and babies out of the category during the third quarter. Please do keep in mind that market share is how we would likely to fall further in the near term before recovering as many of infants switched to other brands are now moving to heavier consumption periods. 
As a result, the favorable market share impact in the second quarter maybe more pronounced than in the first. Finally, there's dividends that overall category Williams continue to fall. The most recent CDC data from the first half of 2011 showed a continued 2% decline in the number of infants born in the U.S. compared to the same period in the 2010. This is supported by a more recent available participation data and is assigned the birth rate had bottomed out. Recent consumption has caused a further drop in category volume, bringing the total volume decline to high as 3%. 
In summary, the sales performance of the North America/Europe segment will improve as we move to the second half of the year. On a full-year basis, our sales guidance remains unchanged with the decline expected in the mid-single digits. As many of you probably have noticed in our press release, there was a significant drop in North America/Europe segment profits in the first quarter versus the prior year. This was largely expected. Pete will, explain this in more detail in a minute, but a number of factors reduced gross profit. Most notably, reduced our U.S. non-WIC sales volumes which carry higher gross margins. The sales volume led to reduced fixed cost absorption as we saw the impact of significantly higher dairy costs. 
Also note that the cost of the mass media campaign in the U.S. reduced earnings. Recognizing the importance of protecting EBIT margins in an environment of rising costs, we've notified our U.S. customers we are raising prices slightly more than 4% effective June 1. This is in addition to the 4% increase taken last August. We're not counting on the full benefit to flow through to earnings as retailer and consumer support may prove necessary in the near-term. But we are committed to margin recovery and our earnings guidance for the year anticipate that. 
So to wrap up, I'm very pleased with how the year has begun, with excellent growth from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America and steady progress anticipated in the developed markets of North America and Europe. 
Let me now turn the call over to Pete, who will provide you with some further financial highlights."

Details on our GAAP results are provided in the press release in our 10-Q which will filed later today. As for detail that the drivers of constant dollar sales growth and let me add a quick comment on the sales impact from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange has basically no impact on our top line during the first quarter. If current exchange rates hold, we would expect FX also have limited impact on full-year sales. I'll now concentrate my prepared remarks in profitability for the first quarter and key changes we expected see as we move through the remainder of the year. 
Our first quarter EBIT margin of 25.6% came in 100 basis points below the first quarter of 2011. This was driven by a 230 basis point drop in gross margin partially offset by 130 basis point reduction in operating expenses. Gross margins stood at 62.1% and reflected a tougher commodity cost environment compared to the first quarter of last year when we delivered 64.4%. Dairy prices included in our cost of goods sold were up 23% for the company versus the year-ago period. 
The most significant impact was seen in North America where nonfat dry milk prices were up 32%, while lactose and whey prices climbed by over 60%. We have seen some moderation in nonfat dry milk as the warmer winter the U.S. has increased milk supply, that will start to provide some earnings benefit in the year. We don't expect to see any significant release however, with whey or lactose prices. 
Importantly, gross margins were 100 basis points higher than the 61.1% seen in the fourth quarter. Asian dairy prices reflected in our cost of goods sold have moderated since peaking late last year, and the increase in consolidated gross margins on a consecutive quarter basis has all attribute to our emerging markets. 
As Kasper highlighted, reduced fixed cost absorption from lower U.S. sales and production volumes was one of the factors reducing gross margins in the first quarter. It is important to note that some of the unfavorable manufacturing performance was related to the timing of maintenance outages in our U.S. plants. We usually shutdown these facilities in the fourth quarter of each year, often during the holiday season around Thanksgiving and Christmas. We delayed our regular fourth quarter 2010 maintenance outage due to strong demand from a competitors recall. With higher demand continuing to the first half of last year. Instead, we extended the normal plan outage for the first quarter of 2011 and saw unfavorable cost absorption as a result at that point. The finished goods produced in the fourth quarter largely shift to customers in the first quarter and shows up as higher good of goods sold then. 
Gross margins for both North America/Europe and the company will improve as we move into the second quarter. And as non-WIC in the U.S. increase during the second half of the year, once the unfavorable impact for the media issue winds down, we will see even further improvement. On a full-year basis, we expect gross margin to be about 10 to 20 basis points lower than our prior guidance of 63%. This reflects lower gross margins from the Argentine joint venture. Remember SanCor will continue to manufacture products for the new company and will retain some manufacturing profit as a result. 
Absent the acquisition, gross margins will continue to center around 63%, the same level of the prior year. Higher commodity costs this year are offset by higher pricing and strong productivity initiatives. The first quarter's operating expense of 36.5% was down by 130 basis points from 2011. Let me explain a number of the key moving parts. First, we saw the elimination of shared service overlap cost now that our SAP technology platform is operational. We are only using shared service resources from IBM and no longer from Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
In addition, we recognized significant foreign exchange balance sheet remeasurement losses in the first quarter of 2011 from U.S. dollar denominated receivable held by our Dutch manufacturing plant. Although still on a loss position this year, recent favorable foreign exchange impacts did not recur in the same level. Leading to further reduction in operating expenses Michigan the percent of sales basis. These 2 benefits were partially offset by higher demand generation investments in advertising and promotion, including the U.S. media campaign that Kasper referenced along with incremental spending for our sales force and research and development. On an annual basis, we currently forecast operating expenses to be at or slightly above 39%, but well above the 36.5% for the first quarter. 
Most of the spending increase over the remainder of the year will focus on additional demand generation investments in Asia and Latin America. Also, you'll recall that we recognized $10 million in pension settlement losses in the fourth quarter of last year. Since our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is frozen, and our annual lump-sum payout the retiring employees exceed the recognized pension expense, accounting rules require us to accelerate the recognition of deferred losses from the plan. We have seen an uptick in lump-sum payouts from service employees in recent months. And we expect to the pension settlement expense will start to be recognized earlier this year, potentially starting in the second quarter. 
Turning to taxes, the first quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 27.5% down from 29.4% a year ago, primarily due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. We expect the ETR for the full year will fall in the range between 27.5% to 28%. At the end of March, we held cash and equivalents totaling $661 million down $180 million from December. The Argentine acquisition accounted for about $106 million or 60% of the drop. The total fixed price is set at ARS 851 million or about US $196 million, using the exchange rate at closing. We paid ARS 473 million or US $109 million in cash at closing. Since the joint venture held about $300 million in cash, this was recorded as a $106 million use of cash during the first quarter. The remaining ARS 378 million or about US $87 million is payable in 3 installments over to 12 months post closing, with the final payment due upon receipts of Argentine regulatory approval of the acquisition. 
The peso denominated notes share an interest rate of 14% per annum. Although the interest rate is higher than what we would see in the U.S., we chose this partial deferred payments to provide some near-term protection against the significant valuation of the Argentine peso. Further details on the financing will be included in the 10-Q filed later today. We expect interest expense to run about $64 million for the full year, including this new debt. The other significant driver of the reduction in cash during the fourth quarter came from a $197 million increase in assets and liabilities. You'll recall that we purchased an additional 6 months of key dairy inputs or $77 million for our Asian business in December to provide better price stability for 2012. We consumed cash during the first quarter as we retired the payables from this prebuy. The normal receivable deals on higher sales, additional reduction in accrued expenses and the timing of income tax payments account for the majority of the remaining increase. We will recover the majority of this cash outflow during the remainder of the year. 
During the quarter, our Board of Directors raised our quarterly cash dividend by over 15% to $0.30 per share. We also purchased 220,000 shares of our stock an average price of just over $78 per share, returning an additional $17 million in cash to shareholders. We estimate that capital spending for the year will total about $200 million versus our previous $220 million guidance. This reflects a slight shift in timing for the new Singapore spray dryer and technology center. The multi-year $300 million capital plan for the project remains unchanged. Front year depreciation and amortization expense was estimated at $83 million. 
Before turning the call back to Steve, let me summarize our latest outlook for the year. We anticipate full year sales growth of 9% to 11%, up from 7% to 9% from January, about 1.5% comes from the Argentine acquisition with higher sales in Asia and Latin America driving the residual gains. Asia and Latin America should grow in the upper teens including the SanCor Bebe acquisition benefit and North America/Europe is expected to decline by the mid single-digit. 
We expect non-GAAP EBIT margins as a percentage of sales to be at or slightly above the 23.6% reported in the prior year. The interest expense of $64 million an effective tax rate between 27.5% to 28% our non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $3.04 due $3.14 per share. This regards to Argentine acquisition, please note that we expect no EPS accretion in 2012. Lower gross margins, investments that we will make to grow the business, and the incremental of financing charges this year will result in breakeven performance from this transaction. And finally, we expect specified cost will total about $0.09 per share in 2012. GAAP earnings should therefore be $2.95 to $3.05 to per share. With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

As we mentioned, there were a number of factors that were really influencing the very low margins that we saw in North America/Europe in the first quarter. A good portion of the gross margin decline was coming from the timing impact of plant shutdown. The first quarter we saw the impact from our shutdown late last year. We didn't have a shutdown late in 2010. So I will say that we have some relatively strong confidence that gross margin will be increasing in the second quarter for that segment noticeably. And as I've mentioned I think moving into the second half of the year, you'll also see the benefit as we continue to ramp back up from the media scare in late December in terms of non-WIC market share. And keep in mind, the loss sales year-over-year really are coming from the non-WIC business which carries, as Kasper mentioned, very good solid gross margins. And addition with the price increase that we announced, it will take place in the end of the second quarter, that as well will help some margin recovery. So we're relatively confident that what you saw in the first quarter is somewhat short-term in duration."

The continued excellent performance in both",403,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As noted in our press release issued earlier today, we delivered strong first quarter results. Constant dollar sales growth of 9% was in line with our expectations. The continued excellent performance in both Asia and Latin America was partially offset by an anticipated decline in the North America/Europe segment.
Non-GAAP earnings of $0.82 per share were up 8% from $0.76 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings increased due to sales growth, a favorable foreign exchange comparison and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower gross margins and higher demand generation investments.
In the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of an 80% equity interest in the SanCor Bebé infant formula and children's nutrition business. This joint venture gives us the leading market share position in Argentina, the third largest market in Latin America, and a strong platform for growth throughout the Southern Cone of South America.
As stated in the past, that after we completed the SAP implementation and the actions to achieve full standalone status, we would have more resources available to consider business development growth opportunities to complement our compelling organic growth strategies. Our business development focus will be on tuck-in deals like this one that allows to further strengthen growth with a primary focus on emerging markets.
Since Kasper will share our operating segment results shortly, let me provide an update on our full-year guidance. We continue to be very positive about our outlook for the year and expect our annual constant dollar sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 11%, up from our previous guidance of 7% to 9%. About 1.5 points of this increase is driven by the acquisition in Argentina with the remainder from modestly higher expectations to growth in our emerging markets.
We currently estimate that the non-GAAP EBIT margin, as a percentage of sales, will be at or slightly above the 23.6% level seen in 2011 with demand generation investments accelerating for the balance of the year.
For the full year, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.04 to $3.14, up $0.04 from our prior guidance.
I will now turn the call over to Kasper, who assumed the role of chief operating officer for the company earlier this year. I will return at the conclusion of our prepared remarks to wrap up and address your questions."

I'll focus my comments on the operating performance and the expectations of our 2 segments.
Starting with Asia and Latin America, first quarter sales for this segment grew 21% on a constant dollar basis versus the prior year with just over $700 million and now accounts for 71% of our global sales. Absent the 2-week contribution from the Argentine joint venture following the closing in mid-March, sales increased 20%. Higher volumes were the key driver of our first quarter results, adding 16% to our top line with pricing accounting for the remaining 5% of growth. We will not talk in any detail about our specific plans in Asia and Latin America, but we expect pricing will make a bigger contribution to sales growth in the near future when compared to that seen in recent quarters.
Our pricing actions, ultimate company pricing -- product innovations, sorry, which frequently have higher costs so this does not always translate into higher margins. And we will carefully watch the impact of higher pricing on sales volumes.
Turning to some geographic detail, sales growth in China/Hong Kong continued at rates above the segment average. But as expected, modestly below the very high rate of growth in the prior year. Market share remains at levels above those seen in the first quarter of 2011, a sign of the strength of the Mead Johnson in infant brands in the world's largest market.
Strong double-digit growth was also seen in the majority of markets outside of China and Hong Kong, In Southeast Asia, we've seen solid results in the first quarter with stronger growth in Vietnam and Thailand. Sales in Latin America grew at a strong pace led by Brazil and the Indian markets. We've made good progress in building our infant formula business in Brazil over the last 2 years, although the sales base remains quite small.
We've concentrated on the emerging premium category in pharmacies and focused our efforts on Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and, recently, Belo Horizonte. As we expand, we'll continue to invest in our infant formula business in Brazil over the next few years. We're also excited about the potential of our new SanCor Bebé business in Argentina. There are approximately 700,000 annual birth in the country, about 1/3 of the numbers are seen in Mexico with per capita GDP of running at approximately the same level in both markets. Yet, infant formula and children's nutrition product consumption is about half the level seen in Mexico. This disconnect indicates the growth potential of the Argentine market with consumption increases expected over time.
Our joint venture owns the market-leading SanCor Bebé and Bebé cross-brands. The JV, which is 80% owned by Mead Johnson as Steve mentioned, will merit the product portfolio, research and development and marketing expertise of Mead Johnson with the manufacturing, distribution capabilities, local market knowledge and market-leading position of SanCor. We expect the joint venture to pursue growth in Argentina and serve as a base of further expansion in the Southern Cone markets.
Wrapping up the discussion on Asia and Latin America, we expect annual sales growth to be in the upper-teens for the segment on a constant dollar basis compared to the mid-teen guidance previously provided. The SanCor Bebé acquisition will add just over 2 points to full-year segment sales growth with existing markets accounting for the remainder of the improvement.
Turning now to the North America/Europe segment. We recorded a sales decline of 11% on a constant dollar basis. Volume was down 14% driven by the U.S. market with pricing gains of 3%. These results were largely as we expected back in January. This is the toughest quarterly comparison we were facing 2012 with 3 key factors driving the volume decline.
Let me highlight each, noting only the first quarter impact but how we see trends moving through the remainder of the year. Firstly, about half the shortfall was due to the one-time benefit that accrued to us in 2011 from a competitor's recall. That benefit was most pronounced in the first quarter of last year. It dropped off in the second quarter and had little impact once we had moved into the second half. As a result of this factor, we continued to impact our year-over-year comparison in the coming quarter but at a somewhat reduced level.
Secondly, about 1/4 of the decline resulted from market share temporarily lost due to the misleading headlines and media reports in late December concerning several infant formula brands including Enfamil Newborn. The FDA and CDC ultimately found no fault with our products, but the uncertainty caused some parents to switch away from the Enfamil brand. We launched a mass-market campaign in the first quarter to reassure all parents of the quality and safety of our brands and to remind them that Enfamil is the #1 brand recommended by U.S. pediatricians. The campaign has been successful. And by the end of the quarter, sales of our newborn product had recovered to pre-December levels. We are confident of a share recovery as the December and January cohort of babies aged out of the categories during the third quarter. Please do keep in mind that market share is, however, likely to fall further in the near term before recovering as many of the infants switched to other brands are now moving into heavier consumption periods.
As a result, the unfavorable market share impact in the second quarter may be more pronounced than in the first. Finally, there is evidence that all-born [ph] category volumes continue to fall. The most recent CDC data from the first half of 2011 showed a continued 2% decline in the number of infants born in the U.S. compared to the same period in 2010. This is supported by a more recent available WIC participation data and is a sign that the birth rate has still not bottomed out. Recent consumption has caused a further drop in category volume, bringing the total volume decline to as high as 3%.
In summary, the sales performance of the North America/Europe segment will improve as we move through the second half of the year. On a full-year basis, our sales guidance remains unchanged with the decline expected in the mid-single digits. As many of you probably have noticed in our press release, there was a significant drop in the North America/Europe segment profits in the first quarter versus the prior year. This was largely expected. Pete will explain this in more detail in a minute, but a number of factors reduced gross profit, most notably, reduced our U.S. non-WIC sales volumes, which carry higher gross margins. The lower sales volume led to reduced fixed cost absorption plus we saw the impact of significantly higher dairy costs.
Also note that the cost of the mass media campaign in the U.S. reduced earnings. Recognizing the importance of protecting EBIT margins in an environment of rising costs, we've notified our U.S. customers we are raising prices slightly more than 4% effective June 1. This is in addition to the 4% increase taken last August. We're not counting on the full benefit to flow through to earnings as retailer and consumer support may prove necessary in the near-term. But we are committed to margin recovery, and our earnings guidance for the year anticipate that.
So to wrap up, I'm very pleased with how the year has begun, with excellent growth from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America and steady progress anticipated in the developed markets of North America and Europe.
Let me now turn the Pete -- turn the call over to Pete, who will provide you with some further financial highlights. Pete?"
1002291,183827920,289934,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone.

Details on our GAAP results are provided in the press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Kasper detailed the key drivers of constant dollar sales growth, but let me add a quick comment on the sales impact from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange had basically no impact on our top line during the first quarter. If current exchange rates hold, we would expect the FX to also have limited impact on full-year sales. I'll now concentrate my prepared remarks in profitability for the first quarter and key changes we expect to see as we move through the remainder of the year.
Our first quarter EBIT margin of 25.6% came in 100 basis points below the first quarter of 2011. This was driven by a 230 basis point drop in gross margin, partially offset by a 130 basis point reduction in operating expenses. Gross margins stood at 62.1% and reflected a tougher commodity cost environment compared to the first quarter of last year when we delivered 64.4%. Dairy prices, included in our cost of goods sold, were up 23% for the company versus the year-ago period.
The most significant impact was seen in North America, where nonfat dry milk prices were up 32%, while lactose and whey prices climbed by over 60%. We have seen some moderation in nonfat dry milk as the warmer winter the U.S. has increased milk supply. That will start to provide some earnings benefit late in the year. We don't expect to see any significant relief, however, with whey or lactose prices.
Importantly, gross margins were 100 basis points higher than the 61.1% seen in the fourth quarter. Asian dairy prices, reflected in our cost of goods sold, have moderated since peaking late last year. And the increase in consolidated gross margins on a consecutive quarter basis is all attributed to our emerging markets.
As Kasper highlighted, reduced fixed cost absorption from lower U.S. sales and production volumes was one of the factors reducing gross margins in the first quarter. It is important to note that some of the unfavorable manufacturing performance was related to the timing of maintenance outages in our U.S. plants. We usually shutdown these facilities in the fourth quarter of each year, often during the holiday season around Thanksgiving and Christmas. We delayed our regular fourth quarter 2010 maintenance outage due to strong demand from a competitor's recall with higher demand continuing through the first half of last year. Instead, we extended the normal planned outage for the fourth quarter of 2011 and saw unfavorable cost absorption as a result at that point. The finished goods produced in the fourth quarter largely shipped to customers in the first quarter and shows off as higher cost of goods sold then.
Gross margins for both North America/Europe and the company will improve as we move into the second quarter. And as non-WIC volumes in the U.S. increase during the second half of the year, once the unfavorable impact from the media issue winds down, we will see even further improvement. On a full-year basis, we expect gross margin to be about 10 to 20 basis points lower than our prior guidance of 63%. This reflects lower gross margins from the Argentine joint venture. Remember, SanCor will continue to manufacture products for the new company and will retain some manufacturing profit as a result.
Absent the acquisition, gross margins would continue to center around 63%, the same level of the prior year. Higher commodity costs this year are offset by higher pricing and strong productivity initiatives. The first quarter's operating expense of 36.5% was down by 130 basis points from 2011.
Let me explain a number of the key moving parts. First, we saw the elimination of shared service overlap cost now that our SAP technology platform is operational. We are only using shared service resources from IBM and no longer from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
In addition, we recognized significant foreign exchange balance sheet remeasurement losses in the first quarter of 2011 from U.S. dollar denominated receivables held by our Dutch [ph] manufacturing plant. Although still on a loss position this year, these unfavorable foreign exchange impacts did not recur at the same level, leading to a further reduction in operating expenses measured on a percent of sales basis. These 2 benefits were partially offset by higher demand generation investments in advertising and promotion, including the U.S. media campaign that Kasper referenced along with incremental spending for our sales force and research and development.
On an annual basis, we currently forecast operating expenses to be at or slightly above 39%, but well above the 36.5% for the first quarter.
Most of the spending increase over the remainder of the year will focus on additional demand generation investments in Asia and Latin America. Also, you'll recall that we recognized $10 million in pension settlement losses in the fourth quarter of last year. Since our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is frozen, if our annual lump-sum payout to retiring employees exceed the recognized pension expense, accounting rules require us to accelerate the recognition of deferred losses from the plan. We have seen an uptick in lump-sum payouts from longer service employees in recent months. And we expect that the pension settlement expense will start to be recognized earlier this year, potentially starting in the second quarter.
Turning to taxes, the first quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 27.5%, down from 29.4% a year ago, primarily due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. We expect the ETR for the full year will fall in a range between 27.5% to 28%. At the end of March, we held cash and equivalents totaling $661 million, down $180 million from December. The Argentine acquisition accounted for about $106 million or 60% of the drop. The total purchase price is set at ARS 851 million, or about USD $196 million, using the exchange rate at closing. We paid ARS 473 million, or USD $109 million, in cash at closing. Since the joint venture held about $3 million in cash, this was recorded as a $106 million use of cash during the first quarter. The remaining ARS 378 million, or about USD $87 million, is payable in 3 installments over the 12 months post closing with the final payment due upon receipts of Argentine regulatory approval of the acquisition.
The peso-denominated notes carry an interest rate of 14% per annum. Although the interest rate is higher than what we would see in the U.S., we chose this partial deferred payment to provide some near-term protection against the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso. Further details on the financing will be included in the 10-Q filed later today. We expect interest expense to run about $64 million for the full year, including this new debt. The other significant driver of the reduction in cash during the fourth quarter came from a $197 million increase in assets and liabilities.
You'll recall that we purchased an additional 6 months of key dairy inputs, or $77 million, for our Asian business in December to provide better price stability for 2012. We consumed cash during the first quarter as we retired the payables from this prebuy. Normal receivable builds on higher sales, seasonal reductions in accrued expenses and the timing of income tax payments account for the majority of the remaining increase. We will recover the majority of this cash outflow during the remainder of the year.
During the quarter, our board of directors raised our quarterly cash dividend by over 15% to $0.30 per share. We also purchased 220,000 shares of our stock at an average price of just over $78 per share, returning an additional $17 million in cash to shareholders. We estimate that capital spending for the year will total about $200 million versus our previous $220 million guidance. This reflects a slight shift in timing for the new Singapore spray dryer and technology center. The multi-year $300 million capital plan for the project remains unchanged. First-year depreciation and amortization expense was estimated at $83 million.
Before turning the call back to Steve, let me summarize our latest outlook for the year. We anticipate full year sales growth of 9% to 11%, up from 7% to 9% in January, about 1.5% comes from the Argentine acquisition with higher sales in Asia and Latin America driving the residual gains. Asia and Latin America should grow sales in the upper-teens including the SanCor Bebé acquisition benefit, and North America/Europe is expected to decline by the mid-single digit.
We expect non-GAAP EBIT margins, as a percentage of sales, to be at or slightly above the 23.6% reported in the prior year. The interest expense of $64 million and an effective tax rate between 27.5% to 28%, our non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $3.04 to $3.14 per share. With regard to the Argentine acquisition, please note that we expect no EPS accretion in 2012. Lower gross margins, investments that we will make to grow the business, and the incremental financing charges this year will result in breakeven performance from this transaction. And finally, we expect specified cost will total about $0.09 per share in 2012. GAAP earnings should therefore be $2.95 to $3.05 per share.
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

As we mentioned, there were a number of factors that were really influencing the very low margins that we saw in North America/Europe in the first quarter. A good portion of the gross margin decline was coming from the timing impact of plant shutdown, the first quarter we saw the impact from our shutdown late last year. We didn't have a shutdown laid in 2010. So I will say that we have some relatively strong confidence that gross margins will be increasing in the second quarter for that segment noticeably. And as I've mentioned I think moving into the second half of the year, you'll also see the benefit as we continue to ramp back up from the media scare in late December in terms of non-WIC market share. And keep in mind, the loss sales year-over-year really are coming from the non-WIC business which carries, as Kasper mentioned, very good solid gross margins. In addition with the price increase that we announced, that will take place in the end of the second quarter, that as well will help some margin recovery. So we're relatively confident that what you saw in the first quarter is somewhat short-term in duration."

As noted in our press release issued earlier today, we delivered strong first quarter results. Constant dollar sales growth of 9% was in line with our expectations. The continued excellent performance in both",403,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As noted in our press release issued earlier today, we delivered strong first quarter results. Constant dollar sales growth of 9% was in line with our expectations. The continued excellent performance in both Asia and Latin America was partially offset by an anticipated decline in the North America/Europe segment.
Non-GAAP earnings of $0.82 per share were up 8% from $0.76 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings increased due to sales growth, a favorable foreign exchange comparison and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower gross margins and higher demand generation investments.
In the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of an 80% equity interest in the SanCor Bebé infant formula and children's nutrition business. This joint venture gives us the leading market share position in Argentina, the third largest market in Latin America, and a strong platform for growth throughout the Southern Cone of South America.
As stated in the past, that after we completed the SAP implementation and the actions to achieve full standalone status, we would have more resources available to consider business development growth opportunities to complement our compelling organic growth strategies. Our business development focus will be on tuck-in deals like this one that allows to further strengthen growth with a primary focus on emerging markets.
Since Kasper will share our operating segment results shortly, let me provide an update on our full-year guidance. We continue to be very positive about our outlook for the year and expect our annual constant dollar sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 11%, up from our previous guidance of 7% to 9%. About 1.5 points of this increase is driven by the acquisition in Argentina with the remainder from modestly higher expectations for growth in our emerging markets.
We currently estimate that the non-GAAP EBIT margin, as a percentage of sales, will be at or slightly above the 23.6% level seen in 2011 with demand generation investments accelerating for the balance of the year.
For the full year, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.04 to $3.14, up $0.04 from our prior guidance.
I will now turn the call over to Kasper, who assumed the role of chief operating officer for the company earlier this year. I will return at the conclusion of our prepared remarks to wrap up and address your questions."

I'll focus my comments on the operating performance and the expectations of our 2 segments.
Starting with Asia and Latin America, first quarter sales for this segment grew 21% on a constant dollar basis versus the prior year with just over $700 million and now accounts for 71% of our global sales. Absent the 2-week contribution from the Argentine joint venture following the closing in mid-March, sales increased 20%. Higher volumes were the key driver of our first quarter results, adding 16% to our top line with pricing accounting for the remaining 5% of growth. We will not talk in any detail about our specific plans in Asia and Latin America, but we expect pricing will make a bigger contribution to sales growth in the near future when compared to that seen in recent quarters.
Our pricing actions, often accompany pricing -- product innovations, sorry, which frequently have higher costs so this does not always translate into higher margins. And we will carefully watch the impact of higher pricing on sales volumes.
Turning to some geographic detail, sales growth in China/Hong Kong continued at rates above the segment average. But as expected, modestly below the very high rate of growth in the prior year. Market share remains at levels above those seen in the first quarter of 2011, a sign of the strength of the Mead Johnson in infant brands in the world's largest market.
Strong double-digit growth was also seen in the majority of markets outside of China and Hong Kong, In Southeast Asia, we've seen solid results in the first quarter with stronger growth in Vietnam and Thailand. Sales in Latin America grew at a strong pace led by Brazil and the Indian markets. We've made good progress in building our infant formula business in Brazil over the last 2 years, although the sales base remains quite small.
We've concentrated on the emerging premium category in pharmacies and focused our efforts on Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and, recently, Belo Horizonte. As we expand, we'll continue to invest in our infant formula business in Brazil over the next few years. We're also excited about the potential of our new SanCor Bebé business in Argentina. There are approximately 700,000 annual birth in-country, about 1/3 the numbers are seen in Mexico with per capita GDP running at approximately the same level in both markets. Yet, infant formula and children's nutrition product consumption is about half the level seen in Mexico. This disconnect indicates the growth potential of the Argentine market with consumption increases expected over time.
Our joint venture owns the market-leading SanCor Bebé and Bebé Plus [ph] brands. The JV, which is 80% owned by Mead Johnson as Steve mentioned, will marry the product portfolio, research and development and marketing expertise of Mead Johnson with the manufacturing, distribution capabilities, local market knowledge and market-leading position of SanCor. We expect the joint venture to pursue growth in Argentina and serve as a base for further expansion in the Southern Cone markets.
Wrapping up the discussion on Asia and Latin America, we expect annual sales growth to be in the upper-teens for the segment on a constant dollar basis compared to the mid-teen guidance previously provided. The SanCor Bebé acquisition will add just over 2 points to full-year segment sales growth with existing markets accounting for the remainder of the improvement.
Turning now to the North America/Europe segment. We recorded a sales decline of 11% on a constant dollar basis. Volume was down 14% driven by the U.S. market with pricing gains of 3%. These results were largely as we expected back in January. This is the toughest quarterly comparison we will face in 2012 with 3 key factors driving the volume decline.
Let me highlight each, noting only the first quarter impact but how we see trends moving through the remainder of the year. Firstly, about half the shortfall was due to the one-time benefit that accrued to us in 2011 from a competitor's recall. That benefit was most pronounced in the first quarter of last year. It dropped off in the second quarter and had little impact once we had moved into the second half. As a result of this factor, we continued to impact our year-over-year comparison in the coming quarter but at a somewhat reduced level.
Secondly, about 1/4 of the decline resulted from market share temporarily lost due to the misleading headlines and media reports in late December concerning several infant formula brands including Enfamil Newborn. The FDA and CDC ultimately found no fault with our products, but the uncertainty caused some parents to switch away from the Enfamil brand. We launched a mass-market campaign in the first quarter to reassure all parents of the quality and safety of our brands and to remind them that Enfamil is the #1 brand recommended by U.S. pediatricians. The campaign has been successful. And by the end of the quarter, sales of our newborn product had recovered to pre-December levels. We are confident of a share recovery as the December and January cohort of babies age out of the category during the third quarter. Please do keep in mind that market share is, however, likely to fall further in the near term before recovering as many of the infants switched to other brands are now moving into heavier consumption periods.
As a result, the unfavorable market share impact in the second quarter may be more pronounced than in the first. Finally, there is evidence that overall category volumes continue to fall. The most recent CDC data from the first half of 2011 showed a continued 2% decline in the number of infants born in the U.S. compared to the same period in 2010. This is supported by a more recent available WIC participation data and is a sign that the birth rate has still not bottomed out. Recent consumption has caused a further drop in category volume, bringing the total volume decline to as high as 3%.
In summary, the sales performance of the North America/Europe segment will improve as we move through the second half of the year. On a full-year basis, our sales guidance remains unchanged with a decline expected in the mid-single digits. As many of you probably have noticed in our press release, there was a significant drop in the North America/Europe segment profits in the first quarter versus the prior year. This was largely expected. Pete will explain this in more detail in a minute, but a number of factors reduced gross profit, most notably, reduced our U.S. non-WIC sales volumes, which carry higher gross margins. The lower sales volume led to reduced fixed cost absorption plus we saw the impact of significantly higher dairy costs.
Also note that the cost of the mass media campaign in the U.S. reduced earnings. Recognizing the importance of protecting EBIT margins in an environment of rising costs, we've notified our U.S. customers we are raising prices slightly more than 4% effective June 1. This is in addition to the 4% increase taken last August. We're not counting on the full benefit to flow through to earnings as retailer and consumer support may prove necessary in the near-term. But we are committed to margin recovery, and our earnings guidance for the year anticipates that.
So to wrap up, I'm very pleased with how the year has begun, with excellent growth from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America and steady progress anticipated in the developed markets of North America and Europe.
Let me now turn the Pete -- turn the call over to Pete, who will provide you with some further financial highlights. Pete?"

Details on our GAAP results are provided in the press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Kasper detailed the key drivers of constant dollar sales growth, but let me add a quick comment on the sales impact from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange had practically no impact on our top line during the first quarter. If current exchange rates hold, we would expect the FX to also have limited impact on full-year sales. I'll now concentrate my prepared remarks in profitability for the first quarter and key changes we expect to see as we move through the remainder of the year.
Our first quarter EBIT margin of 25.6% came in 100 basis points below the first quarter of 2011. This was driven by a 230 basis point drop in gross margin, partially offset by a 130 basis point reduction in operating expenses. Gross margins stood at 62.1% and reflected a tougher commodity cost environment compared to the first quarter of last year when we delivered 64.4%. Dairy prices, included in our cost of goods sold, were up 23% for the company versus the year-ago period.
The most significant impact was seen in North America, where nonfat dry milk prices were up 32%, while lactose and whey prices climbed by over 60%. We have seen some moderation in nonfat dry milk as the warmer winter the U.S. has increased milk supply. That will start to provide some earnings benefit late in the year. We don't expect to see any significant relief, however, with whey or lactose prices.
Importantly, gross margins were 100 basis points higher than the 61.1% seen in the fourth quarter. Asian dairy prices, reflected in our cost of goods sold, have moderated since peaking late last year. And the increase in consolidated gross margins on a consecutive quarter basis is all attributed to our emerging markets.
As Kasper highlighted, reduced fixed cost absorption from lower U.S. sales and production volumes was one of the factors reducing gross margins in the first quarter. It is important to note that some of the unfavorable manufacturing performance was related to the timing of maintenance outages in our U.S. plants. We usually shutdown these facilities in the fourth quarter of each year, often during the holiday season around Thanksgiving and Christmas. We delayed our regular fourth quarter 2010 maintenance outage due to strong demand from a competitor's recall with higher demand continuing through the first half of last year. Instead, we extended the normal planned outage for the fourth quarter of 2011 and saw unfavorable cost absorption as a result at that point. The finished goods produced in the fourth quarter largely shipped to customers in the first quarter and shows up as higher cost of goods sold then.
Gross margins for both North America/Europe and the company will improve as we move into the second quarter. And as non-WIC volumes in the U.S. increase during the second half of the year, once the unfavorable impact from the media issue winds down, we will see even further improvement. On a full-year basis, we expect gross margin to be about 10 to 20 basis points lower than our prior guidance of 63%. This reflects lower gross margins from the Argentine joint venture. Remember, SanCor will continue to manufacture products for the new company and will retain some manufacturing profit as a result.
Absent the acquisition, gross margins would continue to center around 63%, the same level as the prior year. Higher commodity costs this year are offset by higher pricing and strong productivity initiatives. The first quarter's operating expense of 36.5% was down by 130 basis points from 2011.
Let me explain a number of the key moving parts. First, we saw the elimination of shared service overlap cost now that our SAP technology platform is operational. We are only using shared service resources from IBM and no longer from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
In addition, we recognized significant foreign exchange balance sheet remeasurement losses in the first quarter of 2011 from U.S. dollar denominated receivables held by our Dutch manufacturing plant. Although still on a loss position this year, these unfavorable foreign exchange impacts did not recur at the same level, leading to a further reduction in operating expenses measured on a percent of sales basis. These 2 benefits were partially offset by higher demand generation investments in advertising and promotion, including the U.S. media campaign that Kasper referenced along with incremental spending for our sales force and research and development.
On an annual basis, we currently forecast operating expenses to be at or slightly above 39%, but well above the 36.5% for the first quarter.
Most of the spending increase over the remainder of the year will focus on additional demand generation investments in Asia and Latin America. Also, you'll recall that we recognized $10 million in pension settlement losses in the fourth quarter of last year. Since our U.S. defined benefit pension plan is frozen, if our annual lump-sum payout to retiring employees exceed the recognized pension expense, accounting rules require us to accelerate the recognition of deferred losses from the plan. We have seen an uptick in lump-sum payouts from longer service employees in recent months. And we expect that the pension settlement expense will start to be recognized earlier this year, potentially starting in the second quarter.
Turning to taxes, the first quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate, or ETR, was 27.5%, down from 29.4% a year ago, primarily due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. We expect the ETR for the full year will fall in a range between 27.5% to 28%. At the end of March, we held cash and equivalents totaling $661 million, down $180 million from December. The Argentine acquisition accounted for about $106 million or 60% of the drop. The total purchase price is set at ARS 851 million, or about USD $196 million, using the exchange rate at closing. We paid ARS 473 million, or USD $109 million, in cash at closing. Since the joint venture held about $3 million in cash, this was recorded as a $106 million use of cash during the first quarter. The remaining ARS 378 million, or about USD $87 million, is payable in 3 installments over the 12 months post closing with the final payment due upon receipt of Argentine regulatory approval of the acquisition.
The peso-denominated notes carry an interest rate of 14% per annum. Although the interest rate is higher than what we would see in the U.S., we chose this partial deferred payment to provide some near-term protection against the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso. Further details on the financing will be included in the 10-Q filed later today. We expect interest expense to run about $64 million for the full year, including this new debt. The other significant driver of the reduction in cash during the fourth quarter came from a $197 million increase in assets and liabilities.
You'll recall that we purchased an additional 6 months of key dairy inputs, or $77 million, for our Asian business in December to provide better price stability for 2012. We consumed cash during the first quarter as we retired the payables from this prebuy. Normal receivable builds on higher sales, seasonal reductions in accrued expenses and the timing of income tax payments account for the majority of the remaining increase. We will recover the majority of this cash outflow during the remainder of the year.
During the quarter, our board of directors raised our quarterly cash dividend by over 15% to $0.30 per share. We also purchased 220,000 shares of our stock at an average price of just over $78 per share, returning an additional $17 million in cash to shareholders. We estimate that capital spending for the year will total about $200 million versus our previous $220 million guidance. This reflects a slight shift in timing for the new Singapore spray dryer and technology center. The multi-year $300 million capital plan for the project remains unchanged. Front-year [ph] depreciation and amortization expense was estimated at $83 million.
Before turning the call back to Steve, let me summarize our latest outlook for the year. We anticipate full year sales growth of 9% to 11%, up from 7% to 9% in January, about 1.5% comes from the Argentine acquisition with higher sales in Asia and Latin America driving the residual gains. Asia and Latin America should grow sales in the upper-teens including the SanCor Bebé acquisition benefit, and North America/Europe is expected to decline by the mid-single digits.
We expect non-GAAP EBIT margins, as a percentage of sales, to be at or slightly above the 23.6% reported in the prior year. The interest expense of $64 million and an effective tax rate between 27.5% to 28%, our non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $3.04 to $3.14 per share. With regard to the Argentine acquisition, please note that we expect no EPS accretion in 2012. Lower gross margins, investments that we will make to grow the business, and the incremental financing charges this year will result in breakeven performance from this transaction. And finally, we expect specified cost will total about $0.09 per share in 2012. GAAP earnings should therefore be $2.95 to $3.05 per share.
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

We've also said that we continue to remain very confident about the long-term potential of the U.S. market, which of course, is a very large market for us and that we continue to make investments in the business consistent with that view of its long-term potential."

As you've likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered sales growth of 11% on a constant dollar basis in the second quarter. This was delivered by continued strong performance from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America, the benefit from our Argentine acquisition that was delayed in the first quarter. And the improving year comparison in our North America/Europe segment with fall flat calls versus the prior year excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Our recovery from the impact of the misleading U.S. media report of alleged product insemination last December is quite evident and we're confident that progress will continue in the second half of the year.
Non-GAAP earnings of $0.83 per share were up 15% from the $0.72 per share reported in the second quarter of 2011. Earnings increased due to strong sales growth, a favorable foreign exchange comparison, lower administrative costs and reduced tax rate.
These were partially offset by a lower gross margin due in large part to higher dairy cost in North America, increased investments in advertising and promotion and the timing of pension settlement expenses.
While we unjustifiably pleased with our past 2012 results, we expect lower growth in the second half of the year due in part of a weak global economy. With several European countries now in recession and the continued weak performance of the U.S. economy, economic growth and consumer spending in key exporting market, most notably China have slowed. Consequently, we're experiencing a reduction in the rate of category growth in China. Despite this near-term softness, we have continued high confidence and longer-term category growth in China supported by a rapidly growing middle class. Kasper will go into detail in market share trends in China but it's also clear we gave back some market share in the second quarter after exceptional gains over the last few years.
We believe this is a temporary phenomenon and are clear intent is to rebuild share growth in the second half of the year. As we stated previously, the market in China is highly competitive and we will inevitably see share fluctuations from time to time. We have operated in China for almost 20 years and have seen and overcome bumps in the road in the past. We're confident in our business model, strategies and investments and we intend to continue to deliver compelling growth in China over the medium and longer term.
We currently anticipate full year global sales growth of 8% to 9% on a constant dollar basis, down from the 9% to 11% in our guidance last call. China has close, we continue to see strong performance across markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America and an improving position in the United States. In absolute term, our projected sales growth in 2012 remains very strong. We continue to expect long term earnings in a full-year basis to range from $3.04 to $3.14 per share. There are always moving parts in Europe and 2012 is no exception. A sustainable and lower tax rate coupled with favorable foreign exchange gain is expected to offset the impact of lower sales growth.
While maintaining our guidance for strong earnings growth, we are of course mindful of greater risk in the current operating environment. Nevertheless, we will continue to increase investment behind the business given our high confidence in category growth and our proven strategies. 
I would now turn the call over to Kasper, who will provide more details on our operating performance. And I will return at the conclusion of our prepared remarks to wrap up and address your questions."

Good morning, everyone.

Excluding our joint",1462,"Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everyone. I'll review the operating results from future expectations by segments, starting now with Asia and Latin America.
Second quarter sales grew 12% on a constant dollar basis versus prior year. Excluding our joint venture with Argentina sales dropped 13% on a dollar basis. As we indicated in our last conference call, higher pricing contributed more significantly than in the recent half adding 9% to sales growth with 7% from volume. Price increases is for broad-based across both Asia and Latin America. The 13% organic growth rate was down from 20% in the first quarter, moderating growth in China was a key driver of this. We've cautioned since last July that sales growth would not keep up with the rapid pace of 2011. That is now evident.
You seen both slowing category growth in a somewhat weaker market share during the second quarter. Let me now address each market separately.
At a recent investor conference in Paris, Steve noted that industry growth are slowing in China. Retail shows that the first quarter growth rate for both the category and the premium statements in which we compete was cut in half versus the prior year. The latest data will indicate that there's been no improvement in growth rates as we move through the second quarter. While we recognize the growth in any emerging market can vary from period to period, we remain confident in China and our own long-term growth prospects. The underlying dynamic that by growth in our industry and our company remain unchanged. Let me now address the topic of China market share.
It is not uncommon for shares to fluctuate period to period depending on the timing on competitor's relative price increases, and on promotional activity. Bear in mind, that Nielsen captures about 1/3 of the Chinese retail market. It appears our value share are relatively flat than in the first quarter but decline between 1 and 1.5 points in the second quarter. We attribute this to the timing and price increases in promotional activity. 
As I mentioned, in our last call, we raised prices significantly in late April and we started to ship new product with higher expert recommended DHA levels. Our pricing action was designed to cover 2 years of cost inflation as we did not increase prices in China during 2011. My experience tells us that temporary swings in market share is not uncommon during a price transition of this magnitude. Share often soften in a period of several months but pricing is ultimately absorbed by the market. Importantly, price increases at retail lack of those to distributors and asked did not become apparent to consumers until mid-May.
As a result, we believe we may continue to see share pressure as we move through the third quarter but expects share to strengthen in the fourth quarter. A very similar effect was seen most recently in 2008 when pricing was raised and respond to significant increases in dairy costs. We do believe the impact of our price increase was exacerbated somewhat by more aggressive competitor promotions in advance of upcoming relaunches and by the generally weaker economic climate which adversely affected consumer spending. A line yesterday, last October, we detailed of low level of system inventories held by our distributors and retailers in China compared to our competition. We believe this has important in maintaining price discipline in a market that is not wholly uncommon for product to be bought and sold outside of normal channels by independent wholesalers. In light of slowing growth for the category and recent softer market share, we are determined to constrain sales for distributors as necessary to prevent any buildup of excess inventory. This will affect the growth rate of the Asia/Latin America segment and the company in total, during the third quarter in particular.
We expect to see a return to higher growth in China during the fourth quarter as our product innovation and pricing takes hold.
I'm confident the supported of similar product upgrades launched late last year in both China and Hong Kong is being shares as a consequence.
Turning to the rest of the segment, strong double-digit growth was seen across during the second quarter, across in the rest of Asia and in Latin America. In Southeast Asia, we delivered significant growth in Vietnam and in the Philippines. Those markets where we've seen disappointing sales growth over the last 3 years. Thailand, our fifth largest market have seen growth accelerate despite problem at a third party owned specifically adversely affecting supply of ready to drink children's products. This problem will slightly reduce second half sales growth but we expect to have the ready to drink fully supplied before the end of the year.
Sales in Latin America were very strong. Excluding the impact of the Argentine acquisition we posted constant dollar sales growth above the 13% organic growth rate for the segment as a whole. The Argentine acquisition is being rapidly integrated and performing in line with expectation. This further improves our growth for Latin America. Please note, there was no earnings per share contribution in the second quarter from the joint venture and interest expense offset the profit contribution from operations.
Wrapping up the discussion in Asia and Latin America, we expect 2012 annual sales growth to approach the mid-teens on a constant dollar basis. While obviously lower, than our earlier expectations for growth in the upper teens, this is still a very strong performance and in line with growth delivered prior to the record setting pace of 2011. But of course, we like to put note that this is a much higher sales base and in a challenging global economy. Although, we don't provide quarterly guidance, I do want to mention 1 additional time effect that will affect second half sales comparisons to the prior year. We went live with ASP in Asia in October of 2011. For customers, built their inventory in advance of their transition. As a result, third quarter comparisons will be tougher than those seen in the second quarter.
Turning now to the North America/Europe segment. We reported flat sales on a constant dollar basis. This is a significant improvement compared to the 11% declined seen in the first quarter. We continue to recover market share in the U.S. and pricing for the segment goes up 5%. We gain in both North America and Europe. Volumes were down by the same amount. The drop can be almost be entirely attributed to the U.S. business. The single largest factor for the comparative volume decline in the U.S. versus the temporary benefit seen in the first half of 2011 from a competitor's product recall in late 2010. Those factors are not lastly behind us and will not affect those comparison from the third and fourth quarter of 2012.
Clearly, the second half are driving lower volumes was a share decline caused by the Timbuktu 2011 media Headline. In our last call, I mentioned the sales for the newborn SKU has recovered to pre-event levels. A newborn product had been directly associated with the misleading reports and is used by infant under 3 months of age. Further progress has been made in the second quarter. Market share for 3 month old infants is now slightly above the level seen in the first quarter of last year. That's particularly good news by second half comparison because these infants will be aging into a heavier consumption period, giving us confidence in a complete recovery. On a full-year basis, we expect North America and Europe sales to be down in the low to mid single-digit, a bit better than our earlier guidance. This reflects slightly higher market share expectations in the U.S. particularly in the second half of the year.
To wrap up, I am pleased with the continued growth in the second quarter from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America and with stronger recovery in the U.S. Slower growth in China versus 2011 not only from the category but also from the share pressure in the recent quarter. Our businesses have weathered uncertainties in the past. Our strong brand equity, product innovation and our proven sales strategies give us confidence in our ability to restore share and to continue prosper in this important market. I also showed remind you of our significant presence in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Both segments are performing well and contribute together to an extent of the China Hong Kong market. We have increased demand generating investment spending throughout our global portfolio. And we are committed to continuing these investments growth for the remainder through the year. 
Let me now turn the call over to Pete who will provide you with further financial highlights. Pete?"
1002291,213565992,331637,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP results.Kasper detailed our sales trend, so I will concentrate on foreign exchange impact. During the quarter, the dollar strengthened against the euro and the Austra",1667,"Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP results.
Kasper detailed our sales trend, so I will concentrate on foreign exchange impact. During the quarter, the dollar strengthened against the euro and the Australian dollar, and also against 2 key quarter currencies in Latin America, Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. But that impact was mitigated in smaller parts as the dollar weakened slightly across Asia where we generate half of our sales. Overall, a stronger dollar reduced sales by about 2% in the second quarter. We expect full year sales to be reduced by about 1% from foreign exchange but current exchange rates are maintained.
Despite an unfavorable sales impact, there was no translation impact in our bottom line in the quarter. Remember we source products for Asia in large part from our plant in The Netherlands and also from a third-party supplier in Australia. As we have limited sales in Europe, and none in Australia, we have a short position with both currencies driving a noticeable cost benefit when the dollar strengthened. This helps unfavorable foreign exchange impact on sales. 
As I mentioned at our Investor Day last year, we also get some protection from the remeasurement of dollar denominated balance sheet account in our overseas subsidy areas when the dollar strengthens. That occurred in the second quarter, when we got remeasurements gains of about $0.04 per share. Note that if the U.S. dollar were to weaken in the second half against the euro, or Aussie dollar, these remeasurement gains could reverse in whole or in part. EBIT margins of 25.2% of sales came in 70 basis points ahead of the second quarter of 2011. Driven by 150 basis point decline in gross margins, more than offset by a 220 basis point reduction in operating expenses. If you look at segment EBIT margin, you'll see that we delivered 34.2% for Asia and Latin America. The same level as the prior year. And we reported a big improvement for North America and Europe compared to the prior quarter. EBIT margins in North America and Europe were 23.5% in the second quarter. This has doubled the 11.8% seen in the first quarter. We expect additional progress in the second half as our non-WIC market share recovers in the U.S.
Gross margins were 63.2%, down from 64.7% last year. The decline is completely attributed to the North America/Europe segment where we are facing significantly higher dairy costs in the prior year. Also, lower production volumes in the U.S. drilled unfavorable fixed cost absorption, with higher pricing and good productivity gains providing some offset. Please note that the pricing gains in our emerging markets often accompany increased product innovation and as a result, do not necessarily translate into higher gross margins.
As we have move through 2012, there's been a continued decline in stock prices for the most dairy raw material. Given that there's a 7 month lag on average between our stock pricing and our cost of goods sold, any recent trends will not have a meaningful impact this year. And the 1 exception to weaker commodity prices has been lactose which accounts for about 10% of our total dairy buy. Lactose prices are up over 60% versus last year, and have continued to rise in 2012, partially reducing the benefit from other dairy inputs.
While we expect to see some benefits from lower dairy costs as we enter 2013, it is quite premature to expect that benefit will continue and definitely next year. For example, all conditions in the U.S. are already driving enough global grain prices. This will result in higher feed costs and will also increase agricultural oil prices for us as well. Ultimately, dairy costs may arise as a consequence.
On a full year basis, we expect gross margins to come in around 62.6%, a 20 or so basis point decline from our prior guidance. Since China carries higher gross margins, we see an unfavorable mix impact with softer growth in that market. Also note, that the decline versus the 63% gross margins in 2011 is affected by the Argentine acquisition as I stated in our last call. Sancor will manufactured products for the JV and will retain some manufacturing profit as a result. Operating expenses of 38% of sales were down by 220 basis points in the second quarter when compared with 40.3% in the prior year. We will note, this was not driven by any reduction in demand generation spending. Advertising and promotion expenses increased by 50 basis points to 14.7% of sales compared to the prior year.
And if you look at sequential operating expenses, balance sheet for measurement gains and in pension settlement expenses, spending actually grew by $33 million or about 10% in the second quarter versus the first quarter.
The drop in operating expenses on a percentage of sales basis restart was largely driven by lower general and administrative cost coupled with a translation effect from a stronger dollar. G&A fell due to the elimination of sales overlap cost seen last year before we completed the SAP installation and lower incentive compensation accruals.
I already mentioned the balance sheet remeasurement gains of about $0.04 in the second quarter. This was offset in large part of the timing of pension settlement expenses which came in about $0.03 per share. Both items appear in other expenses and income on our earnings statement. Pension settlement expenses are triggered under accounting rules for our frozen defined benefit pension plan. A lump-sum payments exceed annual pension expense, forcing the immediate amortization of any deferred expenses for those retirees. Last year, the expenses were triggered in the fourth quarter. This year, if hit earlier due to the low interest rate environment which in place will consider in determining the timing of their retirement. Low interest rate obviously drive a higher lump-sum payout.
On a full-year basis, we expect operating expenses measured as a percent of sales to be at or around 38.8%, a slight reduction versus spending noted in our last quarter. Again, demand generation expenses measured in dollars, is not being reduced from current levels in light of slightly slower projected sales growth. That would cause operating expenses to increase in a percentage of sales basis. But the effect is more than offset by favorable foreign exchange impact. And we're see a slightly greater reductions in G&A expenses than we previously thought. 
Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate or ETR for the second quarter came in at 25.8%, bringing our first tax rate to 26.6%, down from 29.7% in the first 6 months of last year. On our full-year basis, we now expect an ETR between 26% and 27%. Our prior guidance assumes a tax rate between 27.5% and 28%. We expect a decline will affect the number of factors including a favorable geographic mix and higher manufacturing incentives. More importantly, we expect to sustain the lower rate in 2013 with potential for further reduction beyond. Our cash balance at the end of June was $787 million, up $127 million from March. Capital spending consumed $50 million in cash during the first half of 2012 but is expected to pick up significantly in the second half as construction is underway in Singapore for our new spray dryer. This facility will allow us to more efficiently meet long-term demand in Asia. Full-year capital spending remains unchanged at $200 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated for about $80 million for the year.
We repurchased 330,000 shares of stock in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date buyback of 550,000 shares consuming $34 million of cash. A sensible objective of our repurchase program is to offset the impacted dilution from employee equity program. Both can and will be opportunistic around the timing of any buyback. A strong cash flow allows us to address and reinvest in our business, while returning capital to shareholders through a healthy dividend payout in share repurchase program. And for those who pay attention to book equity, you'll note that we ended the second quarter with our first positive balance of $2 million. That's a $900 million improvement from the deficit seen following our IPO just over 3 years ago.
Pulling all the number together, 2012 sales are expected to grow between 8% and 9% in constant dollars, compared to the 9% to 11% in our last conference call. Constant dollars sales growth for Asia and Latin America is expected to approach the mid-teens but North America and Europe segment is expected to be down in the low to mid-single digits. Currency impact will reduce reported growth by about 1% versus the prior year. Growth rate in the third quarter for Asia and Latin America will be down notably versus the second quarter for several reasons, including the need to manage distributor's inventory tightly in light of slowing growth in China. In addition, net quarter sales comparison for this segment would be unfavorably impacted by the timing from last year's SAP launch in Asia and supply short flows for our ready to drink product in Thailand. A healthier growth profile will return as we improved share in the fourth quarter.
We estimate the decline in full year sales growth would reduce earnings about $0.10 per share using the midpoint of our guidance. While we are maintaining our full year earnings estimate in a range between $3.4 to $3.14 per share. Softer growth is offset by a number of factors. First, we saw balance sheet remeasurement gains of $0.04 per share in the second quarter. Although, there is some risk of volatile situation in Europe, some of this is reversed in the second half. A lower effective tax rate is the second factor. An ETR of 26.5% again using the midpoint of our range, will generate $0.05 and higher earnings versus our prior guidance. An additionally G&A reductions add another $0.01 or to the bottom line.

And then let me just finish up with one other thought, so you can see what are coming from. It sounds like you think that this is a consumer acceptance issue on your new pricing scheme. However, if competitor pricing activity, i.e., higher promotion, hurt you in the quarter, you may sound like the category has gotten more price-sensitive and versus many conversations that we've had in the past, it seems like it's very considerable change where past trend would definitively in China towards a premium category consumers were running away from those lower-priced products straight into your arms in the premium end. And so, all of the commentary would seemingly suggest a fundamental change to how the consumers behaving versus how they previously did. And then that would make the fourth quarter commentary that much more difficult to really get your arms around on the outside tier why its so logical that market shares should improve."

Although more than half of our business across Asia and Latin America and in China is in the discretionary children's category for children of above 1 year of age. Over 90% of the market is now at premium prices. So the pricing sensitivity and promotion sensitivity that we referred to is not trading between the low and premium priced segment is trading within the premium segment. As we took pricing coinciding it with innovation that is competitive as compared to their own relaunches and promote it back their prices, those relaunches are happening now and in the next several weeks.

As you've likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered sales growth of 11% on a constant dollar basis in the second quarter. This was delivered by continued strong performance from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America, the benefit from our Argentine acquisition completed late in the first quarter and the improving comparison in our North America/Europe segment with soft, flat sales versus the prior year excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Our recovery from the impact of the misleading U.S. media report of alleged product contamination last December is quite evident, and we're confident that progress will continue in the second half of the year.
Non-GAAP earnings of $0.83 per share were up 15% from the $0.72 per share reported in the second quarter of 2011. Earnings increased due to strong sales growth, a favorable foreign exchange comparison, lower administrative costs and a reduced tax rate.
These were partially offset by a lower gross margin due in large part to higher dairy cost in North America, increased investments in advertising and promotion and the timing of pension settlement expenses.
While we are justifiably pleased with our past 2012 results, we expect lower growth in the second half of the year, due in part to a weak global economy. With several European countries now in recession and the continued weak performance of the U.S. economy, economic growth and consumer spending in key exporting market, most notably China, have slowed. Consequently, we're experiencing a reduction in the rate of category growth in China. Despite this near-term softness, we have continued high confidence for longer-term category growth in China, supported by a rapidly growing middle class. Kasper will go into more detail on market share trends in China, but it's also clear we gave back some market share in the second quarter after exceptional gains over the last few years.
We believe this is a temporary phenomenon, and our clear intent is to rebuild share growth in the second half of the year. As we stated previously, the market in China is highly competitive and we will inevitably see share fluctuations from time to time. We have operated in China for almost 20 years and have seen and overcome bumps in the road in the past. We're confident in our business model, strategies and investments, and we intend to continue to deliver compelling growth in China over the medium and longer term.
We currently anticipate full year global sales growth of 8% to 9% on a constant dollar basis, down from the 9% to 11% guidance in our last call. While our growth in China has slowed, we continue to see strong performance across markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America and an improving position in the United States. In absolute terms, our projected sales growth in 2012 remains very strong. We continue to expect non-GAAP earnings on a full year basis to range from $3.04 to $3.14 per share. There are always a number of moving parts at work, and 2012 is no exception. A sustainable and lower tax rate coupled with favorable foreign exchange gain is expected to offset the impact of lower sales growth.
While maintaining our guidance for strong earnings growth, we are, of course, mindful of greater risks in the current operating environment. Nevertheless, we will continue to increase investment behind the business given our high confidence in category growth and our proven strategies.
I will now turn the call over to Kasper, who will provide more details on our operating performance. And I will return at the conclusion of our prepared remarks to wrap up and address your questions."

Second quarter sales grew 16% on a constant dollar basis versus prior year. Excluding our joint venture with SanCor in Argentina, sales were up 13% on a constant dollar basis. As we indicated in our last conference call, higher pricing contributed more significantly than in the recent half, adding 9% to sales growth with 7% from volume. Price increases were broad based across both Asia and Latin America. The 13% organic growth rate was down from 20% in the first quarter. Moderating growth in China was the key driver of this. We've cautioned since last July that sales growth would not keep up with the rapid pace of 2011. That is now evident.
We have seen both slowing category growth and a somewhat weaker market share during the second quarter. Let me now address each factor separately.
At a recent investor conference in Paris, Steve noted that industry growth was slowing in China. Nielsen retail data shows that the first quarter growth rate for both the category and the premium statement in which we compete was cut in half versus the prior year. The latest data would indicate that there has been no improvement in growth rates, as we move through the second quarter. While we recognize that growth in any emerging market can vary from period to period, we remain confident in China's and our own long-term growth prospects. The underlying dynamic that drive growth in our industry and our company remain unchanged.
Let me now address the topic of China market share. It is not uncommon for shares to fluctuate period to period, depending on the timing on competitor's relative price increases and on promotional activity. Bearing in mind that Nielsen captures only about 1/3 of the Chinese retail market, it appears our value share held relatively flat in the first quarter but declined between 1 and 1.5 points in the second quarter. We attribute this to the timing of price increases and promotional activity.
As I mentioned in our last call, we raised prices significantly in late April as we started to ship new product with higher expert recommended DHA levels. Our pricing action was designed to cover 2 years of cost inflation, as we did not increase prices in China during 2011. My experience tells us that temporary swings in market share are not uncommon during a price transition of this magnitude. Share often softens for a period of several months, but pricing is ultimately absorbed by the market. Importantly, price increases at retail lacked those to distributors and as did not become apparent to consumers until mid-May.
As a result, we believe we may continue to see share pressure, as we move through the third quarter but expect share to strengthen in the fourth quarter. A very similar effect was seen most recently in 2008 when pricing was raised in response to significant increases in dairy costs. We do believe the impact of our price increase was exacerbated somewhat by more aggressive competitor promotions in advance of upcoming relaunches and by the generally weaker economic climate, which has adversely affected consumer spending.
At our Investor Day last October, we detailed the low level of system inventories held by our distributors and retailers in China compared to our competition. We believe this is important in maintaining price discipline in a market that is -- where it's not wholly uncommon for product to be bought and sold outside of normal channels by independent wholesalers.
In light of slowing growth for the category and recent softer market share, we are determined to constrain sales for distributors as necessary to prevent any buildup of excess inventory. This will affect the growth rate for the Asia/Latin America segment and the company in total during the third quarter in particular.
We expect to see a return to higher growth in China during the fourth quarter, as our product innovation and pricing takes hold.  Our confidence is supported by the success of similar product upgrades launched late last year in both China and Hong Kong where we gain shares as a consequence.
Turning to the rest of the segment. Strong double-digit growth was seen across -- during the second quarter across the majority of markets in the rest of Asia and in Latin America. In Southeast Asia, we delivered significant growth in Vietnam and in the Philippines, both markets where we have seen disappointing sales growth over the last 3 years. Thailand, our fifth largest market, has seen growth accelerate despite problem at a third-party owned facility, adversely affecting supply of ready-to-drink children's products. This problem will slightly reduce second half sales growth, but we expect to have the ready-to-drink supply fully restored before the end of the year.
Sales throughout Latin America were very strong. Excluding the impact from the Argentine acquisition, we posted constant dollar sales growth above the 13% organic growth rate for the segment as a whole. The Argentine acquisition is being rapidly integrated and performing in line with expectation. This further improves our growth outlook for Latin America. Please note, there was no earnings per share contribution in the second quarter from the joint venture, and interest expense offset the profit contribution from operations.
Wrapping up the discussion in Asia and Latin America, we expect 2012 annual sales growth to approach the mid-teens on a constant dollar basis. While obviously lower than our earlier expectations for growth in the upper teens, this is still a very strong performance and in line with growth delivered prior to the record setting pace of 2011. But of course, I like to note that this is off a much higher sales base and in a challenging global economy.
Although, we don't provide quarterly guidance, I do want to mention one additional timing factor that will affect second half sales comparisons to the prior year. We went live with SAP in Asia in October of 2011. And customers built their inventories in advance through that transition. As a result, third quarter comparisons will be tougher than those seen in the second quarter.
Turning now to the North America/Europe segment. We reported flat sales on a constant dollar basis. This is a significant improvement compared to the 11% decline seen in the first quarter. We continued to recover market share in the U.S., and pricing for the segment was up 5%. We gained in both North America and Europe. Volumes were down by the same amount. That drop can be almost entirely attributed to the U.S. business. The single largest factor for the comparative volume decline in the U.S. was the temporary benefit seen in the first half of 2011 from a competitor's product recall in late 2010. That factor is now largely behind us and will not affect sales comparisons in the third and fourth quarter of 2012.
Clearly, the second factor driving lower volumes was a share decline caused by the December 2011 media headline. In our last call, I mentioned the sales for the newborn SKU has recovered to pre-event levels. A newborn product had been directly associated with the misleading report and is used by infant under 3 months of age.
Further progress has been made in the second quarter. Market share among 3-month-old infants is now slightly above the level seen in the first quarter of last year. That's particularly good news by second half comparison because these infants will be aging into a heavier consumption period, giving us confidence in a complete recovery.
On a full year basis, we expect North America and Europe sales to be down in the low- to mid-single digit, a bit better than our earlier guidance. This reflects slightly higher market share expectations in the U.S. in the second half of the year.
To wrap up, I'm pleased with the continued growth in the second quarter from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America and with a stronger recovery in the U.S. We have seen slower growth in China versus 2011 not only from the category but also from share pressure in the recent quarter. Our businesses weathered certain -- uncertainties in the past. Our strong brand equity, product innovation and our proven sales strategies give us confidence in our ability to restore share and to continue to prosper in this important market. I'll also remind you of our significant presence in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Both south regions are performing well and contribute together. Sales were an excess of the China-Hong Kong market. We have increased demand generating investment spending throughout our global portfolio, and we are committed to continuing these investments growth through the remainder of the year.
Let me now turn the call over to Pete, who will provide you with further financial highlights. Pete?"
1002291,213565992,331902,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP results.Kasper detailed our constant dollar sales trend, so I will concentrate on foreign exchange impact. During the quarter, the dollar strengthened against the eur",1653,"Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP results.
Kasper detailed our constant dollar sales trend, so I will concentrate on foreign exchange impact. During the quarter, the dollar strengthened against the euro and the Australian dollar, and also against 2 key currencies in Latin America, Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. But that impact was mitigated in small parts, as the dollar weakened slightly across Asia where we generate half of our sales. Overall, a stronger dollar reduced sales by about 2% in the second quarter. We expect full year sales to be reduced by about 1% from foreign exchange, and current exchange rates are maintained.
Despite an unfavorable sales impact, there was no translation impact in our bottom line in the quarter. Remember, we source products for Asia in large parts from our plant in The Netherland and also from a third-party supplier in Australia. As we have limited sales in Europe and none in Australia, we have a short position with both currencies, driving a noticeable cost benefit when the dollar strengthened. This helps to offset the unfavorable foreign exchange impact on sales.
As I mentioned at our Investor Day last year, we also get some protection from the remeasurement of dollar-denominated balance sheet account in our overseas subsidy areas when the dollar strengthened. That occurred in the second quarter and we start remeasurements gains of about $0.04 per share. Note that if the U.S. dollar were to weaken in the second half against the euro or Aussie dollar, these remeasurement gains could reverse in whole or in part.
EBIT margins of 25.2% of sales came in 70 basis points ahead of the second quarter of 2011. Driven by 150-basis-point decline in gross margins, more than offset by a 220-basis-point reduction in operating expenses. If you look at segment EBIT margin, you'll see that we delivered 34.2% for Asia and Latin America, the same level as the prior year. And we reported a big improvement for North America/Europe compared to the prior quarter. EBIT margins in North America/Europe were 23.5% in the second quarter, basically double the 11.8% seen in the first quarter. We expect additional progress in the second half as our non-WIC market share recovers in the U.S.
Gross margins were 63.2%, down from 64.7% last year. The decline is completely attributed to the North America/Europe segment where we are facing significantly higher dairy costs in the prior year. Also, lower production volumes in the U.S. drove unfavorable fixed cost absorption, with higher pricing and good productivity gains providing some offset. Please note that the pricing gains in our emerging markets often accompany increased product innovation and as a result, do not necessarily translate into higher gross margins.
As we have moved through 2012, there has been a continued decline in stock prices for most dairy raw materials. Given that there is a 7-month lag on average between stock pricing and our cost of goods sold, any recent trends will not have a meaningful impact this year. And the one exception to weaker commodity prices has been lactose, which accounts for about 10% of our total dairy buy. Lactose prices are up over 60% versus last year. They have continued to rise in 2012, partially reducing the benefit from other dairy inputs.
While we expect to see some benefit from lower dairy costs as we enter 2013, it is quite premature to expect that benefit would continue indefinitely next year. For example, drought conditions in the U.S. are already driving up global grain prices. This will result in higher feed costs and will also increase agricultural oil prices for us as well. Ultimately, dairy costs may rise as a consequence.
On a full year basis, we expect gross margins to come in around 62.6%, a 20 or so basis point decline from our prior guidance. Since China carries higher gross margins, we see an unfavorable mix impact with softer growth in that market. Also note that the decline versus the 63% gross margins in 2011 is affected by the Argentine acquisition as I stated in our last call. SanCor will manufacture products for the JV and will retain some manufacturing profit as a result.
Operating expenses of 38% of sales were down by 220 basis points in the second quarter when compared with 40.3% in the prior year. We will note, this was not driven by any reduction in demand generation spending. Advertising and promotion expenses increased by 50 basis points to 14.7% of sales compared to the prior year.
And if you look at sequential operating expenses, apply the balance sheet remeasurement gains and pension settlement expenses, spending actually grew by $33 million or about 10% in the second quarter versus the first quarter.
The drop in operating expenses on a percentage of sales basis was largely driven by lower general and administrative costs coupled with a translation effect from the stronger dollar. G&A fell due to the elimination of shared service overlap cost seen last year before we completed the SAP installation and lower incentive compensation accruals.
I already mentioned the balance sheet remeasurement gains of about $0.04 in the second quarter. This was offset in large part by the timing of pension settlement expenses, which came in about $0.03 per share. Both items appear in other expenses and income on our earnings statement. Pension settlement expenses are triggered under accounting rules for our frozen defined benefit pension plan, and lump-sum payments exceed annual pension expense, forcing the immediate amortization of any deferred expenses for those retirees. Last year, the expenses were triggered in the fourth quarter. This year, it hit earlier due to the low interest rate environment, which employees will consider in determining the timing of their retirement. Low interest rate, obviously, drive a higher lump-sum payout.
On a full year basis, we expect operating expenses measured as a percent of sales to center around 38.8%, a slight reduction versus spending noted in our last quarter. Again, demand generation expenses measured in dollars is not being reduced from current levels in light of slightly slower projected sales growth. That would cause operating expenses to increase on a percentage of sales basis, but the effect is more than offset by favorable foreign exchange impact. And we're see slightly greater reductions in G&A expenses than previously thought.
Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate or ETR for the second quarter came in at 25.8%, bringing our first tax rate to 26.6%, down from 29.7% in the first 6 months of last year. On our full year basis, we now expect an ETR between 26% and 27%. Our prior guidance assumes a tax rate between 27.5% and 28%. The expected decline reflects the number of factors including a favorable geographic mix and higher manufacturing incentives. More importantly, we expect to sustain the lower rate in 2013 with potential for further reduction beyond. Our cash balance at the end of June was $787 million, up $127 million from March.
Capital spending consumed $50 million in cash during the first half of 2012 but is expected to pick up significantly in the second half, as construction is now underway in Singapore for our new spray dryer. This facility will allow us to more efficiently meet growing long-term demand in Asia. Full year capital spending remains unchanged at $200 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at about $80 million for the year.
We repurchased 330,000 shares of stock in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date buyback to 550,000 shares, consuming $34 million of cash. The principal objective of our repurchase program is to offset the impact of dilution from employee equity reward. But we can and will be opportunistic around the timing of any buyback. A strong cash flow allows us to aggressively invest in our business, while returning capital to shareholders through a healthy dividend payout in share repurchase program. And for those who pay attention to book equity, you'll note that we ended the second quarter with our first positive balance of $2 million. That's a $900-million improvement from the deficit seen following our IPO just over 3 years ago.
Pulling all the numbers together, 2012 sales are expected to grow between 8% and 9% in constant dollars compared to the 9% to 11% in our last conference call. Constant dollar sales growth for Asia and Latin America is now expected to approach the mid-teens, but the North America/Europe segment is expected to be down in the low- to mid-single digits. Currency impact will reduce reported growth by about 1% versus the prior year. Growth rate in the third quarter for Asia/Latin America will be down notably versus the second quarter for several reasons, including the need to manage distributor's inventory tightly in light of slowing growth in China. In addition, net quarter sales comparisons for the segment will be unfavorably impacted by the timing from last year's SAP launch in Asia and supply shortfalls for our ready-to-drink product in Thailand. A healthier growth profile will return as we improve share in the fourth quarter.
We estimate the decline in full year sales growth would reduce earnings about $0.10 per share using the midpoint of our guidance. But we are maintaining our full year earnings estimate in a range between $3.04 to $3.14 per share. Softer growth is offset by a number of factors. First, we saw balance sheet remeasurement gains of $0.04 per share in the second quarter. Although there is some risk, the volatile situation in Europe has some of this reversed in the second half.
A lower effective tax rate is the second factor. An ETR of 26.5%, again using the midpoint of our range, will generate $0.05 and higher earnings versus our prior guidance. And additional G&A reductions add another $0.01 or so to the bottom line.
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

Can you give us a sense of what you see as a level of sustainable sales growth in China once we get beyond the macro issues and the competitive issues we're facing now?"

Thanks very much for the question. I don't think, as we look at our data, we would see enough of a difference between different tiers in different regions to try and characterize by region or by size or city the slowdown in the category. I mean, there are differences as there always are when you look at statistics and break them up, but I would be very cautious about trying to characterize that. And I do want to just mention that our business in Hong Kong continues to perform very, very strongly indeed, and so therefore, I'm a bit shy of jumping on characterizing it the way that you just did in terms of the coastal areas and the big cities. We don't give sales guidance, as you know, by country or by quote, and so I don't know that we want to get drawn into speculating about what the long-term sustainable growth rate is in any particular market we participate in. I'll let Pete comment if you'd like to add anything."

Many of you were looking at the Nielsen data, which would show a volume decline in China last year. I would point out that when you consider what the growth at is seen in the Hong Kong market and most of that growth is going across the board or into Southern China, we believe there wasn't really any meaningful volume decline and maybe a slight increase, number one. And number two, the thing I would refer you to support that thesis that we have is when you consider the consumption per infant for formula and for children's growing-up milk, China is at roughly 1/3 the level of the developed markets of North America and Europe. And we do think there should be both meaningful volume growth over time as well as price growth that we would drive from innovation."

I will add and reiterate that I fully understand why people at a macroeconomic level are concerned by the slowdown in China, but we are talking about 7.5% GDP growth, and people by and large believe that will pick up again through next year. Secondly, we've been in this market for 20 years. We've built a leadership position with the market share around 15%. We're talking about small fluctuations in the great scheme of time from that. And I think the fundamental demographics of the China market are incredibly compelling. Most that decisions believe that the middle class will almost triple in size in the next 20 years. And even if only one baby is born into each middle class family, that is significant category growth. There is also rumors, as Pete said, to drive consumption for infant. There's pricing potential, and of course, there's potential for us to grow share as we've done significantly in recent years. And we have great confidence in our science, in our quality and our business model.

And then one point that may sound like a detail, but I think it's a bigger point, is this a year-over-year comment or a sequential comment? And then let me just finish off with one other thought, so you can see where I'm coming from. So it sounds like you think that this is a consumer acceptance issue on your new pricing scheme. However, if competitor pricing activity, i.e. higher promotion, hurt you in the quarter, then it would sound like the category has gotten more price sensitive and versus many conversations that we've had in the past, it seems like a fairly considerable change where past trends were definitively in China towards the premium category. Consumers were running away from those lower-priced products straight into your arms in the premium end, and so all of the commentary would seemingly suggest a fundamental change to how the consumer's behaving versus how they previously did. And then that would make the fourth quarter commentary that much more difficult to really get your arms around on the outside tier why its so logical that market shares should improve."

I'll try to address as best as I can, and Kasper and Pete will jump in. So in the current economic climate in China, you're hearing many companies talk about lower confidence in -- among consumers and lower spending, and we are clearly not immune to that. Generally, our category's less price elastic compared to other customers in food and beverage category, and I believe that's still the case. Although more than half of our business across Asia and Latin America and in China is in the discretionary children's category for children of above 1 year of age, over 90% of the market is now at premium prices. So the pricing sensitivity and promotional sensitivity we referred to is not trading between the low and premium-priced segment. It's trading within the premium segment. As we took pricing, coinciding it with innovation, but as competitors prepared for their own relaunches and promoted back their prices, those relaunches are happening now and in the next several weeks. We have confidence in the fourth quarter. You're right that we're talking about sequential share. So we're talking about an improvement from where we are today, a market improvement. We're confident that we have a lot of experience of how long it takes for pricing to adjust. We know what our competitors' strategies are. We know how impactful the Smarties [ph] relaunch has been in Thailand and Hong Kong. We are -- we only have one business, and China is our largest business. But you can imagine how determined we are, how focused we are on addressing this bump in the road.

As you've likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered sales growth of 11% on a constant dollar basis in the second quarter. This was delivered by continued strong performance from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America, the benefit from our Argentine acquisition completed late in the first quarter and the improving comparison in our North America/Europe segment we saw flat sales versus the prior year excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Our recovery from the impact of the misleading U.S. media reports of alleged product contamination last December is quite evident, and we're confident that progress will continue in the second half of the year.
Non-GAAP earnings of $0.83 per share were up 15% from the $0.72 per share reported in the second quarter of 2011. Earnings increased due to strong sales growth, a favorable foreign exchange comparison, lower administrative costs and a reduced tax rate.
These were partially offset by a lower gross margin due in large part to higher dairy cost in North America, increased investments in advertising and promotion and the timing of pension settlement expenses.
While we are justifiably pleased with first half 2012 results, we expect lower growth in the second half of the year, due in part to a weak global economy. With several European countries now in recession and the continued weak performance of the U.S. economy, economic growth and consumer spending in key exporting markets, most notably China, have slowed. Consequently, we're experiencing a reduction in the rate of category growth in China. Despite this near-term softness, we have continued high confidence for longer-term category growth in China, supported by a rapidly growing middle class. Kasper will go into more detail on market share trends in China, but it's also clear we gave back some market share in the second quarter after exceptional gains over the last few years.
We believe this is a temporary phenomenon, and our clear intent is to rebuild share growth in the second half of the year. As we stated previously, the market in China is highly competitive and we will inevitably see share fluctuations from time to time. We have operated in China for almost 20 years and have seen and overcome bumps in the road in the past. We're confident in our business model, strategies and investments, and we intend to continue to deliver compelling growth in China over the medium and longer term.
We currently anticipate full year global sales growth of 8% to 9% on a constant dollar basis, down from the 9% to 11% guidance in our last call. While our growth in China has slowed, we continue to see strong performance across markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America and an improving position in the United States. In absolute terms, our projected sales growth in 2012 remains very strong. We continue to expect non-GAAP earnings on a full year basis to range from $3.04 to $3.14 per share. There are always a number of moving parts at work, and 2012 is no exception. A sustainable and lower tax rate coupled with favorable foreign exchange gain is expected to offset the impact of lower sales growth.
While maintaining our guidance for strong earnings growth, we are, of course, mindful of greater risks in the current operating environment. Nevertheless, we will continue to increase investment behind the business given our high confidence in category growth and our proven strategies.
I will now turn the call over to Kasper, who will provide more details on our operating performance. And I will return at the conclusion of our prepared remarks to wrap up and address your questions."

I'll review the operating results and future expectations by segment, starting now with Asia and Latin America.Second quarter sales grew 16% on a constant dollar basis versus prior year. Excluding our joint",1484,"Thank you, Steve, and Good morning, everyone. I'll review the operating results and future expectations by segment, starting now with Asia and Latin America.
Second quarter sales grew 16% on a constant dollar basis versus prior year. Excluding our joint venture with SanCor in Argentina, sales were up 13% on a constant dollar basis. As we indicated in our last conference call, higher pricing contributed more significantly than in the recent half, adding 9% to sales growth with 7% from volume. Price increases were broad based across both Asia and Latin America. The 13% organic growth rate was down from 20% in the first quarter. Moderating growth in China was the key driver of this. We've cautioned since last July that sales growth would not keep up with the rapid pace of 2011. That is now evident.
We have seen both slowing category growth and a somewhat weaker market share during the second quarter. Let me now address each factor separately.
At a recent investor conference in Paris, Steve noted that industry growth was slowing in China. Nielsen retail data shows that the first quarter growth rate for both the category and the premium segment in which we compete was cut in half versus the prior year. The latest data would indicate that there has been no improvement in growth rates, as we move through the second quarter. While we recognize that growth in any emerging market can vary from period to period, we remain confident in China's and our own long-term growth prospects. The underlying dynamic that drive growth in our industry and our company remain unchanged.
Let me now address the topic of China market share. It is not uncommon for shares to fluctuate period to period, depending on the timing on competitor's relative price increases and on promotional activity. Bearing in mind that Nielsen captures only about 1/3 of the Chinese retail market, it appears our value share held relatively flat in the first quarter but declined between 1 and 1.5 points in the second quarter. We attribute this to the timing of price increases and promotional activity.
As I mentioned in our last call, we raised prices significantly in late April as we started to ship new product with higher expert recommended DHA levels. Our pricing action was designed to cover 2 years of cost inflation, as we did not increase prices in China during 2011. My experience tells us that temporary swings in market share are not uncommon during a price transition of this magnitude. Share often softens for a period of several months, but pricing is ultimately absorbed by the market. Importantly, price increases at retail lacked those to distributors and ours did not become apparent to consumers until mid-May.
As a result, we believe we may continue to see share pressure, as we move through the third quarter but expect share to strengthen in the fourth quarter. A very similar effect was seen most recently in 2008 when pricing was raised in response to significant increases in dairy costs. We do believe the impact of our price increase was exacerbated somewhat by more aggressive competitor promotions in advance of upcoming relaunches and by the generally weaker economic climate, which has adversely affected consumer spending.
At our Investor Day last October, we detailed the low level of system inventories held by our distributors and retailers in China compared to our competition. We believe this is important in maintaining price discipline in a market that is -- where it's not wholly uncommon for product to be bought and sold outside of normal channels by independent wholesalers.
In light of slowing growth for the category and recent softer market share, we are determined to constrain sales for distributors as necessary to prevent any buildup of excess inventory. This will affect the growth rate for the Asia/Latin America segment and the company in total during the third quarter in particular.
We expect to see a return to higher growth in China during the fourth quarter, as our product innovation and pricing takes hold.  Our confidence is supported by the success of similar product upgrades launched late last year in both China and Hong Kong where we gain share as a consequence.
Turning to the rest of the segment. Strong double-digit growth was seen across -- during the second quarter across the majority of markets in the rest of Asia and in Latin America. In Southeast Asia, we delivered significant growth in Vietnam and in the Philippines, both markets where we have seen disappointing sales growth over the last 3 years. Thailand, our fifth largest market, has seen growth accelerate despite problem at a third-party owned facility, adversely affecting supply of ready-to-drink children's products. This problem will slightly reduce second half sales growth, but we expect to have the ready-to-drink supply fully restored before the end of the year.
Sales throughout Latin America were very strong. Excluding the impact from the Argentine acquisition, we posted constant dollar sales growth above the 13% organic growth rate for the segment as a whole. The Argentine acquisition is being rapidly integrated and performing in line with expectation. This further improves our growth outlook for Latin America. Please note, there was no earnings per share contribution in the second quarter from the joint venture as interest expense offset the profit contribution from operations.
Wrapping up the discussion in Asia and Latin America, we expect 2012 annual sales growth to approach the mid-teens on a constant dollar basis. While obviously lower than our earlier expectations for growth in the upper teens, this is still a very strong performance and in line with growth delivered prior to the record setting pace of 2011. But of course, I would like to note that this is off a much higher sales base and in a challenging global economy.
Although, we don't provide quarterly guidance, I do want to mention one additional timing factor that will affect second half sales comparisons to the prior year. We went live with SAP in Asia in October of 2011. And customers built their inventories in advance of that transition. As a result, third quarter comparisons will be tougher than those seen in the second quarter.
Turning now to the North America/Europe segment. We reported flat sales on a constant dollar basis. This is a significant improvement compared to the 11% decline seen in the first quarter. We continued to recover market share in the U.S., and pricing for the segment was up 5%. We gained in both North America and Europe. Volumes were down by the same amount. That drop can be almost entirely attributed to the U.S. business. The single largest factor for the comparative volume decline in the U.S. was the temporary benefit seen in the first half of 2011 from a competitor's product recall in late 2010. That factor is now largely behind us and will not affect sales comparisons in the third and fourth quarter of 2012.
Clearly, the second factor driving lower volumes was a share decline caused by the December 2011 media headline. In our last call, I mentioned the sales for the newborn SKU had recovered to pre-event levels. A newborn product had been directly associated with the misleading report and is used by infant under 3 months of age.
Further progress has been made in the second quarter. Market share among 3-month-old infants is now slightly above the level seen in the first quarter of last year. That's particularly good news by second half comparison because these infants will be aging into a heavier consumption period, giving us confidence in a complete recovery.
On a full year basis, we expect North America and Europe sales to be down in the low- to mid-single digits, a bit better than our earlier guidance. This reflects slightly higher market share expectations in the U.S. in the second half of the year.
To wrap up, I'm pleased with the continued growth in the second quarter from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America and with a stronger recovery in the U.S. We have seen slower growth in China versus 2011 not only from the category but also from share pressure in the recent quarter. Our businesses weathered certain -- uncertainties in the past. Our strong brand equity, product innovation and our proven sales strategies give us confidence in our ability to restore share and to continue to prosper in this important market. I'll also remind you of our significant presence in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Both south [ph] regions are performing well and contribute together. Sales were an excess of the China-Hong Kong market. We have increased demand generating investment spending throughout our global portfolio, and we are committed to continuing these investments growth through the remainder of the year.
Let me now turn the call over to Pete, who will provide you with further financial highlights. Pete?"

During the quarter, the dollar strengthened against the eur",1655,"Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. All my comments will focus on our non-GAAP results.
Kasper detailed our constant dollar sales trend, so I will concentrate on foreign exchange impact. During the quarter, the dollar strengthened against the euro and the Australian dollar, and also against 2 key currencies in Latin America, Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. But that impact was mitigated in small parts, as the dollar weakened slightly across Asia where we generate half of our sales. Overall, a stronger dollar reduced sales by about 2% in the second quarter. We expect full year sales to be reduced by about 1% from foreign exchange if current exchange rates are maintained.
Despite an unfavorable sales impact, there was no translation impact in our bottom line in the quarter. Remember, we source products for Asia in large parts from our plant in The Netherland and also from a third-party supplier in Australia. As we have limited sales in Europe and none in Australia, we have a short position with both currencies, driving a noticeable cost benefit when the dollar strengthened. This helps to offset the unfavorable foreign exchange impact on sales.
As I mentioned at our Investor Day last year, we also get some protection from the remeasurement of dollar-denominated balance sheet account in our overseas subsidy areas when the dollar strengthened. That occurred in the second quarter when we saw remeasurements gains of about $0.04 per share. Note that if the U.S. dollar were to weaken in the second half against the euro or Aussie dollar, these remeasurement gains could reverse in whole or in part.
EBIT margins of 25.2% of sales came in 70 basis points ahead of the second quarter of 2011. Driven by a 150-basis-point decline in gross margins, more than offset by a 220-basis-point reduction in operating expenses. If you look at segment EBIT margin, you'll see that we delivered 34.2% for Asia and Latin America, the same level as the prior year. And we reported a big improvement for North America/Europe compared to the prior quarter. EBIT margins in North America/Europe were 23.5% in the second quarter, basically double the 11.8% seen in the first quarter. We expect additional progress in the second half as our non-WIC market share recovers in the U.S.
Gross margins were 63.2%, down from 64.7% last year. The decline is completely attributed to the North America/Europe segment where we are facing significantly higher dairy costs in the prior year. Also, lower production volumes in the U.S. drove unfavorable fixed cost absorption, with higher pricing and good productivity gains providing some offset. Please note that the pricing gains in our emerging markets often accompany increased product innovation and as a result, do not necessarily translate into higher gross margins.
As we have moved through 2012, there has been a continued decline in stock prices for most dairy raw materials. Given that there is a 7-month lag on average between stock pricing and our cost of goods sold, any recent trends will not have a meaningful impact this year. And the one exception to weaker commodity prices has been lactose, which accounts for about 10% of our total dairy buy. Lactose prices are up over 60% versus last year. They have continued to rise in 2012, partially reducing the benefit from other dairy inputs.
While we expect to see some benefit from lower dairy costs as we enter 2013, it is quite premature to expect that benefit would continue indefinitely next year. For example, drought conditions in the U.S. are already driving up global grain prices. This will result in higher feed costs and will also increase agricultural oil prices for us as well. Ultimately, dairy costs may rise as a consequence.
On a full year basis, we expect gross margins to come in around 62.6%, a 20 or so basis point decline from our prior guidance. Since China carries higher gross margins, we see an unfavorable mix impact with softer growth in that market. Also note that the decline versus the 63% gross margins in 2011 is affected by the Argentine acquisition as I stated in our last call. SanCor will manufacture products for the JV and will retain some manufacturing profit as a result.
Operating expenses of 38% of sales were down by 220 basis points in the second quarter when compared with 40.3% in the prior year. We will note, this was not driven by any reduction in demand generation spending. Advertising and promotion expenses increased by 50 basis points to 14.7% of sales compared to the prior year.
And if you look at sequential operating expenses, apply the balance sheet remeasurement gains and pension settlement expenses, spending actually grew by $33 million or about 10% in the second quarter versus the first quarter.
The drop in operating expenses on a percentage of sales basis was largely driven by lower general and administrative costs coupled with a translation effect from the stronger dollar. G&A fell due to the elimination of shared service overlap cost seen last year before we completed the SAP installation and lower incentive compensation accruals.
I already mentioned the balance sheet remeasurement gains of about $0.04 in the second quarter. This was offset in large part by the timing of pension settlement expenses, which came in about $0.03 per share. Both items appear in other expenses and income on our earnings statement. Pension settlement expenses are triggered under accounting rules for our frozen defined benefit pension plan, when lump-sum payments exceed annual pension expense, forcing the immediate amortization of any deferred expenses for those retirees. Last year, the expenses were triggered in the fourth quarter. This year, it hit earlier due to the low interest rate environment, which employees will consider in determining the timing of their retirement. Low interest rate, obviously, drive a higher lump-sum payout.
On a full year basis, we expect operating expenses measured as a percent of sales to center around 38.8%, a slight reduction versus spending noted in our last call. Again, demand generation expenses measured in dollars is not being reduced from current levels in light of slightly slower projected sales growth. That would cause operating expenses to increase on a percentage of sales basis, but the effect is more than offset by favorable foreign exchange impact. And we're seeing slightly greater reductions in G&A expenses than previously thought.
Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate or ETR for the second quarter came in at 25.8%, bringing our first half rate to 26.6%, down from 29.7% in the first 6 months of last year. On our full year basis, we now expect an ETR between 26% and 27%. Our prior guidance assumed a tax rate between 27.5% and 28%. The expected decline reflects a number of factors including a favorable geographic mix and higher manufacturing incentives. More importantly, we expect to sustain the lower rate in 2013 with potential for further reductions beyond. Our cash balance at the end of June was $787 million, up $127 million from March.
Capital spending consumed $50 million in cash during the first half of 2012 but is expected to pick up significantly in the second half, as construction is now underway in Singapore for our new spray dryer. This facility will allow us to more efficiently meet growing long-term demand in Asia. Full year capital spending remains unchanged at $200 million. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at about $80 million for the year.
We repurchased 330,000 shares of stock in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date buyback to 550,000 shares, consuming $44 million of cash. The principal objective of our repurchase program is to offset the impact of dilution from employee equity reward. But we can and will be opportunistic around the timing of any buybacks. Our strong cash flow allows us to aggressively invest in our business, while returning capital to shareholders through a healthy dividend payout and share repurchase program. And for those who pay attention to book equity, you'll note that we ended the second quarter with our first positive balance of $2 million. That's a $900-million improvement from the deficit seen following our IPO just over 3 years ago.
Pulling all the numbers together, 2012 sales are expected to grow between 8% and 9% in constant dollars compared to the 9% to 11% in our last conference call. Constant dollar sales growth for Asia and Latin America is now expected to approach the mid-teens, but the North America/Europe segment is expected to be down in the low- to mid-single digits. Currency impact will reduce reported growth by about 1% versus the prior year. Growth rates in the third quarter for Asia/Latin America will be down notably versus the second quarter for several reasons, including the need to manage distributor's inventory tightly in light of slowing growth in China. In addition, net quarter sales comparisons for the segment will be unfavorably impacted by the timing from last year's SAP launch in Asia and supply shortfalls for our ready-to-drink product in Thailand. A healthier growth profile will return as we improve share in the fourth quarter.
We estimate the decline in full year sales growth would reduce earnings about $0.10 per share using the midpoint of our guidance. But we are maintaining our full year earnings estimate in a range between $3.04 to $3.14 per share. Softer growth is offset by a number of factors. First, we saw balance sheet remeasurement gains of $0.04 per share in the second quarter. Although there is some risk, the volatile situation in Europe has seen some of this reversed in the second half.
A lower effective tax rate is the second factor. An ETR of 26.5%, again using the midpoint of our range, will generate $0.05 and higher earnings versus our prior guidance. And additional G&A reductions add another $0.01 or so to the bottom line.
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

The other factor you compared to it right now, and we held off last year from the price increase as Kasper mentioned.

And then one point that may sound like a detail, but I think it's a bigger point, is this a year-over-year comment or a sequential comment? And then let me just finish off with one other thought, so you can see where I'm coming from. So it sounds like you think that this is a consumer acceptance issue on your new pricing scheme. However, if competitor pricing activity, i.e. higher promotion, hurt you in the quarter, then it would sound like the category has gotten more price sensitive and versus many conversations that we've had in the past, this seems like a fairly considerable change where past trends were definitively in China towards the premium category. Consumers were running away from those lower-priced products straight into your arms in the premium end, and so all of the commentary would seemingly suggest a fundamental change to how the consumer's behaving versus how they previously did. And then that would make the fourth quarter commentary that much more difficult to really get your arms around on the outside gear why its so logical that market shares should improve."

I'll try to address them as best as I can, and Kasper and Pete will jump in. So in the current economic climate in China, you're hearing many companies talk about lower confidence in -- among consumers and lower spending, and we are clearly not immune to that. Generally, our category's less price elastic compared to other companies in food and beverage category, and I believe that's still the case. Although more than half of our business across Asia and Latin America and in China is in the discretionary children's category for children of above 1 year of age, over 90% of the market is now at premium prices. So the pricing sensitivity and promotional sensitivity we referred to is not trading between the low and premium-priced segment. It's trading within the premium segment. As we took pricing, coinciding it with innovation, but as competitors prepared for their own relaunches and promoted back their prices, those relaunches are happening now and in the next several weeks. We have confidence in the fourth quarter. You're right that we're talking about sequential share. So we're talking about an improvement from where we are today, a market improvement. We're confident because we have a lot of experience of how long it takes for pricing to adjust. We know what our competitors' strategies are. We know how impactful the Smarties [ph] relaunch has been in Thailand and Hong Kong. We are -- we only have one business, and China is our largest business.

As you've likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered sales growth of 1% on a constant-dollar basis in the third quarter. As described in our last conference call, we expected a low rate of growth in the qu",949,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning. As you've likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered sales growth of 1% on a constant-dollar basis in the third quarter. As described in our last conference call, we expected a low rate of growth in the quarter. There were 3 key factors that we said would impact our results. First, we described the loss of market share in China and the actions that we would take as a result. Second, we reminded you of higher sales in the third quarter of 2011, attributed to retailer purchases and advance of our Asia SAP implementation. And third, we stated that there would be lower sales in the second half of 2012 of our ready-to-drink children's product in Thailand, resulting from a temporary supply disruption. 
China is the most significant of these 3 factors, let me offer a few brief comments on that important market. We attribute a significant part of the China market share loss to a double-digit price increase, that accompanied the second quarter launch of a product upgrade, raising VHA to expert recommended levels in our children's product. 
Our pricing action was designed to cover 2 years of cost inflation, as we did not increase prices in China during 2011. Typically, with the price increase of this magnitude, we will see a temporary drop in market share of the impact was exacerbated by more aggressive price promotions by competitors. 
As a result of lower than anticipated share and slower category growth in the food and baby channels are distribute inventory have grown. Consequently, we work with these distributors and constrain sales to levels below retail demand in the third quarter. 
While lower market share and distributor inventory reductions this China obviously impacted our sales growth, we're very pleased with the progress on both fronts, with further improvements expected in the fourth quarter. will provide a more deep detailed update shortly. 
Going back to our financial results, the reported 1% growth in constant-dollar sales did not provide a full understanding of our underlying performance. When you exclude the impact from distributor inventory reductions in China, eliminate last year's benefit from higher shipments to customers and advance of our Asia SAP launch, as well as the impact from the Thai supplier disruption, sales growth for the company in the third quarter would have approached 6.5%. 
Beyond China, we once again, delivered strong double-digit sales growth in the emerging markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. One particular highlight was the exceptional organic growth in Latin America, complemented by the strong performance of our recently acquired business in Argentina. 
Sales in the developed markets of North America, Europe saw a 4% decline, with tougher comparisons in Europe following our distribution model change in 2011. Our U.S. market share continues to improve, but category sales year-over-year have been influenced by decline in infant formula consumption and slightly lower births. 
Non-GAAP earnings of $0.71 per share were down 9% from the $0.78 per share reported in the third quarter of 2011. Earnings were lower from an unfavorable foreign exchange comparison, heavier investments in advertising and promotion, along with the timing of pension settlement expense. These were partially offset by lower general and administrative costs and a lower effective tax rate, reflecting in part a sustainable rate reduction compared to 2011, as well as a non-recurring benefit arising from factors associated with prior year's earnings. 
When we entered 2012, we indicated that we would make larger demand generation investments and have done so. A&P spending was 15.1% of sales in the third quarter, and stands at 14.2% of sales on a year-to-date basis, up from 13.5% in 2011. We plan to continue to increase our investments in demand creation, given our strong belief in the sustainable growth of the business despite short-term challenges and lower growth in the second half of this year. 
Turning to our full year outlook. We will have another challenging comparison in the fourth quarter. Despite the expected further recovery in China market share, and the resulting improvements in sales growth rates for the Asia/Latin America segment and the company, compared to the third quarter, we will continue to work with our Chinese distributors to further reduce their inventory. We remained committed to entering 2013 with the China inventories at a reduced and appropriate level well below the industry average to support the business moving forward. 
We now anticipate reporting full-year global sales growth in the range from 6% to 7% on a constant-dollar basis. When compared to our prior guidance, the decline in sales growth is largely attributed to China. Since we have delivered 7% global sales growth on a year-to-date basis, the midpoint of our full year sales guidance implies that the growth rate in the fourth quarter was full below the full-year average due to the actions I have described to further reduce distributor inventories in China. 
Nevertheless, we project improving end market sales in the fourth quarter and growth will be higher than the third quarter as we continue to make progress recovering market share in China. We expect non-GAAP earnings on a full year basis to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.07% per share. We will go into more detail shortly, that reduced sales growth is the biggest contributor to the change in our estimates. 
It should be noted that the midpoint of this range is consistent with our original guidance in January with volatility in China accountable for changes issued. I'll now turn the call over to Kasper, who will provide more details on our operating performance. After Pete reviews the financials, I will return to close our prepared remarks and address your questions."

I will review the operating results and expectations by segment, starting firstly, with Asia and Latin America.

I will review the operating results and expectations by segment, starting firstly, with Asia and Latin America. Third quarter sales for Asia/Latin America grew 3% on a constant-dollar basis versus the prior year, with price contributing 8% to growth, while volume declined by 5%. 
The key drivers of the volume decline came from a, our determination to reduce distributor inventories in China to match consumer demand, b, the 2011 SAP related pre-buys in Asia; and c, the temporary supply disruption to our ready-to-drink products in Thailand. 
These 3 factors combined reduced sales growth for the segment by 8 percentage points. While the loss of market share in China was a further contributor to the volume decline, it was more than offset by solid gains in the rest of the Asia/Latin American segment and by contributions from the acquisition in Argentina. 
Turning now to a bit more detail on China. The market share now available, shows that we lost close to 3.5 points of market share from the beginning of the year to a low in the middle of this year. I shall return to this topic and improvement seen since shortly. 
Before I do, let me remind you that during our last conference call, we highlighted the need to help our distributors reduce the inventory levels, given the drop in our market share and somewhat slower category sales growth seen in the first half of the current year. 
Our distributors paid cash in advance and we tried ourselves on keeping inventories at industry-leading low levels. We believe this is important from maintaining price, discipline in the marketplace where it's not common for product to be bought and resold outside of normal channels by independent wholesalers. 
We are also committed to the continued profitable growth of our distributors. To this end, we've identified additional opportunities to manage inventories more efficiently going forward. 
Consistent with these commitments, I'm happy to report our distributors made excellent progress on reducing inventories within the third quarter. And our distributors ended the quarter with inventories at or below the China industry average. 
Despite this, further inventory reduction is anticipated for the fourth quarter to ensure that we enter 2013 in the strongest possible position. 
I would now like to talk more specifically about current competitiveness, And the evolution of underlying Chinese consumer demand for our products. As Steve mentioned, a double-digit price increase in the second quarter in the midst of heavier promotional activity by competitors distorted our relative pricing and caused us to lose share. We continue to see a higher than normal level of discounting activity in the marketplace. And given competitive dynamics, it's likely that we continue in the near future. 
During our last earnings call, we spoke of the remedial strategies we recruiting in place to recover share in China, including increased promotional pricing activity and heightened focus on trade execution. I'm very satisfied to report that these strategies appear to be working as anticipated. And by third quarter end, we have recovered 2 full share points from our midyear lows. We're very pleased with that improvement, and we expect to deliver further gains as we close out 2012. 
I would like to add that despite some temporary promotional activity, we have sustained the price increase in the mid- to high-single digits in China. 
The exact pace of further share recovery is naturally difficult to predict. Share will fluctuate from months to months depending on competitive dynamics. And we will obviously, want to see share gains sustained over some months before declaring success. But we are satisfied with our most recent progress. 
Despite improvements during the quarter, our average market share in China remained flat between the second and third quarters. But with the improvements we've made during the third quarter, we are confident that our average share will be higher in the fourth quarter. We also remain optimistic about our business in China. And increasing number of babies are still being born in the middle class families and market dynamics will return to normal, and we believe that long-term market share growth will ultimately be driven by product innovation and strong brand equity rather than temporary price activity. 
To conclude my comments on China, based on the appeal of our recently launched product upgrade, and improving market share, we expect the fourth quarter to see better sales growth than the quarter just completed. 
Turning now to the rest of the Asia/Latin America segment. Outside of China/Hong Kong, we delivered double-digit constant dollar sales growth during the third quarter, with strong performance across Southeast Asia, including the key markets of the Philippines and Vietnam. 
Organic growth in Latin America was above levels seen over the last 5 years and the highest in the segment. Our March 2012 acquisition in Argentina had a further fuel drive expansion in the region. 
Other highlights from our Latin American business include strong share gains in Mexico since the beginning of the year based on recent innovation, continued market share growth in infant formula in Brazil and further strengthening of our market share in Columbia. 
Wrapping up the discussion on Asia/Latin America, we expect 2012 annual sales growth of the segment to run in the low double-digits on a constant dollar sales basis. 
Turning now to the North America/Europe segment. We reported a sales decline of 4% on a constant-dollar basis. Volumes were down by 7%, but offset by price improvements of 3%. Europe was a significant contributor to the volume decline. 
In the third quarter of 2011, we saw some inventory reloading as we began to operate a new distribution model. Compounding this effect, challenging economic conditions across Europe have caused some governments to tighten reimbursement parameters for our specialty products, forcing the category to shrink in select markets. 
You'll recall that the majority of our sales in Europe are from widely reimbursed Nutramigen brand. Over the past few years, our European business has been challenged for both growth and profitability. 
June 2012, we are taking steps to refocus our Western European business around our competitive superior, market-leading, elective franchise Nutramigen. is on the rise globally and in Europe. And once we shape, we believe we can grow our European business profitably in this segment. 
As a result, we are in the process of reorganizing our European operations and incur specified items charge in the third quarter. This expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
The U.S. accounted for the balance of the volume decline, driven by the residual impact from the unfounded media scare in December of 2011. We estimate that the impact peaked around July when the affected cohorts of babies reached the age of maximum consumption. 
Recent share data indicate the impact is tailing off as expected as we move into the fourth quarter. Our U.S. market share recovery remains on track. 
In our last call, we noted that our share amongst newborns and 3-month olds had already recovered from the media event. Market share reported by Nielsen is now beginning to reflect these improving trends. 
Our share recovery reaffirms the inherent strengths of our U.S. organization and our executional ability. It has helped by the introduction earlier this year of a strengthened lineup of liquid product offerings spending the is a range from to maturity to top level. 
When introduced, we are seeing incremental share improvements in the liquid segment, where we have historically been relatively weak. As previously discussed, the U.S. market remains under pressure from declining birth and lower consumption. We, however, retained the view that the market is set to rebound as the economy improves over time. 
On a full year basis, we expect North America/Europe segment sales to be down in the mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis. In summary, we made good progress in improving our share position in the U.S. and China during the third quarter, while continuing to deliver rapid growth in our other emerging markets. 
While we are targeting further reductions in China distributor inventories in the fourth quarter, we will continue to invest in demand generation across geographies to drive longer-term growth for our business. 
With that, let me now turn over to Pete, who will provide you with further financial highlights. Pete?"
1002291,222533592,369865,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Kasper highlighted constant dollar sales trends, but let me begin by discussing the impact of foreign exchange on sales. The dollar was stronger an average again",1270,"Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Kasper highlighted constant dollar sales trends, but let me begin by discussing the impact of foreign exchange on sales. 
The dollar was stronger an average against many Latin American and Asian currencies in the third quarter of 2012 versus 2011, and therefore, reduced sales by about 2%. 
For the full year, currency will reduce sales by 1%, if current exchange rates are maintained. As Steve highlighted, EPS of $0.71 per share was below the $0.78 we reported in the third quarter of 2011. The single biggest driver of lower earnings returning to the full $0.07 decline was related to the impact of foreign exchange on dollar denominated balances and our manufacturing operations outside of the U.S. 
Most notably, our plant in The Netherlands. In the third quarter, currency movements generated $0.02 per share in balance sheet remeasurement losses. Note that this impact was not specifically included in our prior guidance. 
In contrast, we saw $0.05 of balance sheet remeasurement gains in the third quarter of last year. As always, there were a number of other puts and takes that affected the third quarter EPS comparison to 2011 including the following. Third quarter gross margin was down on a reported basis from 61.6% last year to 61.2%. 
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, this caused us about $0.02 in lower earnings. The decline is completely attributed to the North America/Europe segment, where we faced higher dairy costs in the prior year. Also, lower production volumes in the U.S. continued to drive unfavorable fixed cost absorption. 
I have more to say in gross margins in a minute. Constant dollar advertising and promotional spending increased by 9%, reducing earnings by $0.04 per share, in support of new product launches, not only China, but also in a number of other important markets. 
We delivered a $0.02 reduction in general and administrative spending from lower incentive compensation accruals and productivity initiatives. We have been more aggressive in driving G&A productivity, in light of slower sales growth. 
Offsetting this benefit, however, is an additional $0.02 increase in pension settlement expenses in the third quarter. These are triggered when cumulative lump sum payments exceed annual pension expense. The trigger was seen in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the fourth quarter in 2011, due in part to the low interest-rate environment, which obviously drives higher lump-sum payouts. 
Finally, we realized a $0.06 per share benefit, arising from 2 prior year tax items. First, we reduced our 2011 tax provision to reflect the September filing of our final U.S. federal income tax return. Second, we made significant progress on our cash repatriation planning and as concluded that more of our historical earnings can be kept offshore. 
Note that the $0.06 from these 2 items is completely attributed to prior year's results and therefore, will not recur in the future. Also, they have not been included in our July earnings guidance. 
Absent the 2011 tax impacts, we continue to expect our full-year tax rate will run between 26% and 27%, consistent with our guidance in our last conference call and our year-to-date effective tax rate of 26.2%. That's down significantly from 28.5% in 2011. And note that we believe a rate between 26% and 27% will be sustained in 2013. 
Turning to our latest full-year guidance. We now expect constant dollar sales to grow between 6% and 7%, compared to 8% to 9% in our last conference call. Asia/Latin America is now expected to see constant dollar sales growth in the low double digits, with North America/Europe segment expected to be down in the mid-single digits. 
As I mentioned earlier, currency impacts will reduce reported growth by about 1% versus the prior year. Please note that the 2012 trend in China's quarterly sales will impact our 2013 comparisons. Our market share was highest in the first quarter of 2012, down in the second and third quarters on average, and we expect to see solid fourth quarter improvement, with much of the recovery already delivered. 
In addition, the reduced share led to an increased in distributor inventories during the first half of 2012. And conversely, a correction through lower sales in the second half of the year. 
As a result, we expect our first half comparisons in 2013 will be more difficult than the second half. We expect gross margins for the current year to average about 62%, that's down about 50 basis points from our last call, and reflects the impact of both lower sales in China, which carry relatively high margin and the initial impact from unfavorable fixed cost absorption from lower production in plants serving China. 
Note that the fixed cost absorption issue will continue into 2013 since will be manufacturing product throughout the fourth quarter that carries a higher overhead burden from lower production rates. This product will be carried in inventory through year end and it will not be sold until early next year. 
Our long-term target of gross margin remains at 63% for the company. As we move through the distributor inventory reductions and see further share gains in China, sales will stabilize at a higher level and production rates will increase correspondingly. And remember, that we also temporarily reduced production rates in the U.S. this year, as we carried higher internal inventories, due to the temporary share loss from the December media issue. 
Productivity remains an important lever for us to meet our gross margin target. And we have the pricing power to offset inflationary trends in emerging markets. 
In both the third quarter and year-to-date, we achieved a global price increase of 6%. On a full year basis, operating expenses, measured as a percentage of sales, remains around 38.8%. Our earnings guidance of $3.02 to $3.07 per share for 2012 heightens and lowers the range from the $3.04 to $3.14 that we detailed last quarter. The lower sales growth for the year is obviously the key factor at work, along with a lower gross margin, partially offset by lower expenses, predominantly for general and administrative spending. 
Also, the $0.04 benefit from reduction in prior year's tax accruals, net of the third quarter balance sheet remeasurement loss, was not included in our prior guidance. 
Our cash balance at the end of September was $958 million, up $171 million from June. The increase was attributed to a $155 million temporary drawdown on a revolving credit facility, due to cash needs and park related of the ultimate repayment of debt associated with our Argentine acquisition and our investment in the new Asia spray dryer. 
The incremental borrowing will be paid off over the next several quarters. Capital spending year-to-date is $73 million, those expected to reach about $175 million for the full year, lower than our prior guidance of $200 million. 
As fourth quarter spending wraps up on the Asia spray dryer. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at about $75 million for the year. 
During our prior earnings call, I mentioned that we might be opportunistic around the timing of our share buybacks. In our 10-Q, that will be issued today, you'll see that we repurchased 676,000 shares of stock in the third quarter, consuming $49 million in cash. That's more than we repurchased in total during the prior 2 quarters, and it's evidence of our belief is into longer-term opportunities for Mead Johnson. 
Our strong cash flow allows us to invest heavily in our business, while returning capital to shareholders through both dividends in the share repurchase program. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

And on",498,"Let me take that last question first, and we don't want to give you specific number here. The majority of our reduction in our sales growth for the year is attributed to distributor inventory reductions that we intend to take in the fourth quarter. And once we get beyond that, you're not going to see it. But I think it was mentioned during the comments by Steve and Kasper, we did see a slightly higher share decline in the second quarter than what we had estimated. You may recall, in our last conference call, we said we estimated it became 1% and 1.5% that came in a little bit higher than the top end of that range. And while it's not very big in terms of kind of a share differential, when you look at the market the size of China, it has some impact on sales overall. But if you say that we're slightly over 1.5%, that represents roughly 10% of the total share points that we had in China proper, and for a $1 billion plus business, that's $25 million. So that is a big component of what the distributor numbers for the full year. Later on top of that, as we discussed for the food and even baby store channels, we have seen lower growth. I mentioned in our last call that it was running in the mid-20s last year, it's been cut roughly in half, and that results could result in an extra week or 2 weeks of inventory sitting in retailers that ultimately will be reflected in distributor shipments. So that's kind of a second point there. And then I think as Kasper said, as we went through a very thorough review in light of what was going on, we identified some additional opportunities for inventory on the part of our distributors to improve their efficiencies. So it's the combination of all those, but it's meaningful dollars. In terms of your first question that about when you sit back and look at the increase in distributor inventory, you're right in pointing out 2 things, that's driven by first of all, the actual higher level of dollars that are there, and then there's the impact of the fact that you also will have a change in a reduction as we saw in the second quarter and some improvement in the third quarter for higher sales per day at retail. Remember distributor inventory has 2 factors. what we sell in and then what is sold out but ultimately the consumers and both affected. But when we look at the increase that we had, 70% of the increase came from the higher dollar value of the inventory that was out there, 30% or even a little bit less was related to the daily sales rates. So the vast majority of what we see is really coming from that factor, not an improvement in the retail sales, if you will at the end of the third quarter."

And also a lot of questions about I thought in distributor inventory levels were kept at a minimum anyway. I mean understanding was that they were 5, 10, 15 days of inventory in the channel at any given time. So can you talk about sort of how far out of walk you haven't before you made a determination that you needed to do something about curtailing the level of inventory within the channel?"

Let me firstly, talk about the price increase that the announced into that trade in China in April. So you will recognize that having announced the price increase in April, this was prior to the sort of increased promotional activity hottening up in the category in China. I think we are very humble about the fact that we clearly got that price increase or the magnitude of it wrong. We missed time at the very least. And I'm not going to try and defend that I think we recognized that. We've taken actions to realign our pricing to make sure we stay with what we call our strategic pricing relativities in the market. And I just mentioned, we're happy with the progress that we've seen since we've done that, with us regaining well over half of the share we lost between the beginning of the year and midyear. So that's may be addressing your point on price. Let me talk a little bit about inventories. You're quite right that we pride ourselves on our commitment to maintaining inventories at appropriate levels at all times. And when and if we discover that inventory levels have gotten out of whack with that philosophy, we are absolutely determined to take prompt action to bring them back in-line, and that sometimes includes giving unpopular messages, I guess. But inventory, as you correctly say, is always relative to what your demand is, your retailer demand. So it was less about what we've seen was less about us increasing inventory than it was about the fact that when our demand dropped through the second quarter towards midyear, a fixed amount of inventory that was sitting in our system effectively came to represent a higher than appropriate amount of forward cover for our distributors. That obviously affects them and it affects their profitability and it just affects the general efficiency of the entire supply chain. And therefore, we are taking the necessary steps to address that promptly. and I hope you feel some kind of clarity on the issue."

There are number of practice. Firstly, as I mentioned and Kasper detailed, the timing of our double-digit price increase and the timing of promotional activity, particularly from 2 of our largest international competitors, resulted in an unprecedented pricing gap between our product end market and there's. Kasper was feasibly humble I think about the execution of that price increase, because I mentioned, it was intended to cover 2 years of cost inflation, given that we haven't taken an increase in 2011. I wouldn't name our competitors, but one of them is involved in a strategic transaction that made it attractive to them to be price promoting aggressively and driving revenues. And another was planning their own product upgrade and price increase and we're looking to move inventories through the retail channel at the same time. So I think there were a number of factors. And then, of course, as you know, better than me, there is some slowdown in the Chinese economy and some result impact on confidence, which there's no clear science here that there's greater elasticity in the children's category in particular. The Europe environment is weak. The North American environment is weak. China has been the biggest price for a long time that has never more true than it is now. But I do think, as Kasper said, that normality will return in the near future. And then ultimately, will have our science, our quality and our brand equity that will win out and then I understand that disappointment in our short-term results, but we're very pleased with the share momentum that we're seeing now and we will exit this year with industry-leading, low level of inventory right across the system.

As you've likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered sales growth of 1% on a constant-dollar basis in the third quarter. As described in our last conference call, we expected a low rate of growth in the qu",952,"Thank you, Kathy, and good morning. As you've likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered sales growth of 1% on a constant-dollar basis in the third quarter. As described in our last conference call, we expected a low rate of growth in the quarter. There were 3 key factors that we said would impact our results. First, we described the loss of market share in China and the actions that we would take as a result. Second, we reminded you of higher sales in the third quarter of 2011 attributed to retailer purchases and advance of our Asia SAP implementation. And third, we stated that there would be lower sales in the second half of 2012 of our ready-to-drink children's product in Thailand, resulting from a temporary supply disruption. 
Since China is the most significant of these 3 factors, let me offer a few brief comments on that important market. We attribute a significant part of the China market share loss to a double-digit price increase that accompanied the second quarter launch of a product upgrade, raising DHA to expert-recommended levels in our children's products. 
Our pricing action was designed to cover 2 years of cost inflation as we did not increase prices in China during 2011. Typically, with a price increase of this magnitude, we will see a temporary drop in market share, but the impact was exacerbated by more aggressive price promotions by competitors. 
As a result of lower-than-anticipated share and slower category growth in the food and baby store channels, our distributor inventory have grown. Consequently, we worked with these distributors and constrained sales to levels below retail demand in the third quarter. 
While lower market share and distributor inventory reductions in China obviously impacted our sales growth, we are very pleased with the progress on both fronts, with further improvements expected in the fourth quarter. Kasper will provide a more detailed update shortly. 
Turning back to our financial results, the reported 1% growth in constant-dollar sales does not provide a full understanding of our underlying performance. When you exclude the impact from distributor inventory reductions in China, eliminate last year's benefit from higher shipments to customers and advance of our Asia SAP launch, as well as the impact from the Thai supply disruption, sales growth for the company in the third quarter would have approached 6.5%. 
Beyond China, we once again delivered strong double-digit sales growth in the emerging markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. One particular highlight was the exceptional organic growth in Latin America, complemented by the strong performance of our recently acquired business in Argentina. 
Sales in the developed markets of North America and Europe saw a 4% decline, with tougher comparisons in Europe following our distribution model change in 2011. Our U.S. market share continues to improve, but category sales year-over-year have been influenced by a decline in infant formula consumption and slightly lower births. 
Non-GAAP earnings of $0.71 per share were down 9% from the $0.78 per share reported in the third quarter of 2011. Earnings were lower from an unfavorable foreign exchange comparison, heavier investments in advertising and promotion, along with the timing of pension settlement expense. These were partially offset by lower general and administrative costs and a lower effective tax rate, reflecting in part a sustainable rate reduction compared to 2011, as well as a nonrecurring benefit arising from factors associated with prior year's earnings. 
When we entered 2012, we indicated that we would make larger demand-generation investments and have done so. A&P spending was 15.1% of sales in the third quarter and stands at 14.2% of sales on a year-to-date basis, up from 13.5% in 2011. We plan to continue to increase our investments in demand creation given our strong belief in the sustainable growth of the business despite short-term challenges and lower growth in the second half of this year. 
Turning to our full year outlook, we will have another challenging comparison in the fourth quarter. Despite the expected further recovery in China market share and the resulting improvements in sales growth rates for the Asia/Latin America segment and the company, compared to the third quarter, we will continue to work with our Chinese distributors to further reduce their inventory. We remain committed to entering 2013 with the China inventories at a reduced and appropriate level, well below the industry average, to support the business moving forward. 
We now anticipate reporting full year global sales growth in a range from 6% to 7% on a constant-dollar basis. When compared to our prior guidance, the decline in sales growth is largely attributed to China. Since we have delivered 7% global sales growth on a year-to-date basis, the midpoint of our full year sales guidance implies that the growth rate in the fourth quarter was still below the full year average due to the actions I have described to further reduce distributor inventories in China. 
Nevertheless, we project improving end market sales in the fourth quarter and growth will be higher than the third quarter as we continue to make progress recovering market share in China. 
We expect non-GAAP earnings, on a full year basis, to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.07 per share. Pete will go into more detail shortly, but reduced sales growth is the biggest contributor to the change in our estimates. 
It should be noted that the midpoint of this range is consistent with our original guidance in January, with volatility in China accountable for changes issued. 
I'll now turn the call over to Kasper, who will provide more details on our operating performance. After Pete reviews the financials, I will return to close our prepared remarks and address your questions."

I will review the operating results and expectations by segment, starting firstly with Asia and Latin America. Third quarter sales for Asia/Latin America grew 3% on a constant-dollar basis versus the prior year, with price contributing 8% to growth, while volume declined by 5%. 
The key drivers of the volume decline came from a, our determination to reduce distributor inventories in China to match consumer demand; b, the 2011 SAP-related pre-buys in Asia; and c, the temporary supply disruption to our ready-to-drink products in Thailand. 
These 3 factors combined reduced sales growth for the segment by 8 percentage points. While the loss of market share in China was a further contributor to the volume decline, it was more than offset by solid gains in the rest of the Asia/Latin American segment and by contributions from the acquisition in Argentina. 
Turning now to a bit more detail on China. Final market share data, now available, shows that we lost close to 3.5 points of market share from the beginning of the year to our low in the middle of this year. I shall return to this topic and improvement seen since shortly. 
Before I do, let me remind you that during our last conference call, we highlighted the need to help our distributors reduce their inventory levels given the drop in our market share and somewhat slower category sales growth seen in the first half of the current year. 
Our distributors paid cash in advance, and we pride ourselves on keeping inventories at industry-leading low levels. We believe this is important for maintaining price discipline in a market where it's not uncommon for a product to be bought and resold outside of normal channels by independent wholesalers. 
We are also committed to the continued profitable growth of our distributors. To this end, we've identified additional opportunities to manage inventories more efficiently going forward.  Consistent with these commitments, I'm happy to report our distributors made excellent progress on reducing inventories within the third quarter, and our distributors ended the quarter with inventories at or below the China industry average. Despite this, further inventory reduction is anticipated for the fourth quarter to ensure that we enter 2013 in the strongest possible position. 
I would now like to talk more specifically about current competitiveness and the evolution of underlying Chinese consumer demand for our products. As Steve mentioned, a double-digit price increase in the second quarter in the midst of heavier promotional activity by competitors distorted our relative pricing and caused us to lose share. We continue to see a higher-than-normal level of discounting activity in the marketplace, and given competitive dynamics, it's likely that we continue in the near future. 
During our last earnings call, we spoke of the remedial strategies we were putting in place to recover share in China, including increased promotional pricing activity and heightened focus on trade execution. I'm very satisfied to report that these strategies appear to be working as anticipated. And by third quarter end, we had recovered 2 full share points from our midyear lows. We are very pleased with that improvement, and we expect to deliver further gains as we close out 2012. I would like to add that despite some temporary promotional activity, we have sustained the price increase in the mid- to high single digits in China. 
The exact pace of further share recovery is naturally difficult to predict. Share will fluctuate from months to months, depending on competitive dynamics. And we will obviously want to see share gains sustained over some months before declaring success, but we are satisfied with our most recent progress. 
Despite improvements during the quarter, our average market share in China remained flat between the second and third quarters. But with the improvements we've made during the third quarter, we are confident that our average share will be higher in the fourth quarter. We also remain optimistic about our business in China. An increasing number of babies are still being born into middle class families, and market dynamics will return to normal. And we believe that long-term market share growth will ultimately be driven by product innovation and strong brand equity rather than temporary price activity. 
To conclude my comments on China, based on the appeal of our recently launched product upgrade and improving market share, we expect the fourth quarter to see better sales growth than the quarter just completed. 
Turning now to the rest of the Asia/Latin America segment. Outside of China/Hong Kong, we delivered double-digit constant-dollar sales growth during the third quarter, with strong performance across Southeast Asia, including the key markets of the Philippines and Vietnam. 
Organic growth in Latin America was above levels seen over the last 5 years and the highest in the segment. Our March 2012 acquisition in Argentina added further fuel to our expansion in the region.  Other highlights from our Latin American business include strong share gains in Mexico since the beginning of the year based on recent innovation, continued market share growth in infant formula in Brazil and further strengthening of our market share in Colombia. 
Wrapping up the discussion on Asia/Latin America, we expect 2012 annual sales growth of the segment to run in the low double digits on a constant-dollar sales basis. 
Turning now to the North America/Europe segment, we reported a sales decline of 4% on a constant-dollar basis. Volumes were down by 7% but offset by price improvements of 3%. Europe was a significant contributor to the volume decline. 
In the third quarter of 2011, we saw some inventory reloading as we began to operate a new distribution model. Compounding this effect, challenging economic conditions across Europe have caused some governments to tighten reimbursement parameters for our specialty products, forcing the category to shrink in select markets. 
You will recall that the majority of our sales in Europe are from widely-reimbursed Nutramigen brand. Over the past few years, our European business has been challenged for both growth and profitability.  Through 2012, we are taking steps to refocus our Western European business around our competitively superior, market-leading allergy franchise, Nutramigen. Cow's milk allergy is on the rise globally and in Europe, and once reshaped, we believe we can grow our European business profitably in this segment. As a result, we are in the process of reorganizing our European operations and incurred a specified item charge in the third quarter. This expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
The U.S. accounted for the balance of the volume decline, driven by the residual impact from the unfounded media scare in December of 2011. We estimate that the impact peaked around July, when the affected cohorts of babies reached the age of maximum consumption. Recent share data indicate the impact is tailing off as expected as we move into the fourth quarter. Our U.S. market share recovery remains on track. In our last call, we noted that our share amongst newborns and 3-month olds had already recovered from the media event. Market share reported by Nielsen is now beginning to reflect these improving trends. 
Our share recovery reaffirms the inherent strength of our U.S. organization and our executional ability. It has been helped by the introduction earlier this year of a strengthened lineup of liquid product offerings spanning the age range from prematurity to toddlerhood. Where introduced, we are seeing incremental share improvements in the liquid segment, where we have historically been relatively weak. 
As previously discussed, the U.S. market remains under pressure from declining birth and lower consumption. We, however, retained the view that the market is set to rebound as the economy improves over time. 
On a full year basis, we expect North America/Europe segment sales to be down in the mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis. In summary, we made good progress in improving our share position in the U.S. and China during the third quarter while continuing to deliver rapid growth in our other emerging markets. 
While we are targeting further reductions in China distributor inventories in the fourth quarter, we will continue to invest in demand generation across geographies to drive longer-term growth for our business. 
With that, let me now turn over to Pete, who will provide you with further financial highlights. Pete?"
1002291,222533592,370097,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Kasper highlighted constant-dollar sales trends, but let me begin by discussing the impact of foreign exchange on sales. The dollar was stronger on average again",1270,"Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Kasper highlighted constant-dollar sales trends, but let me begin by discussing the impact of foreign exchange on sales. 
The dollar was stronger on average against many Latin American and Asian currencies in the third quarter of 2012 versus 2011 and, therefore, reduced sales by about 2%. For the full year, currency will reduce sales by 1% if current exchange rates are maintained. As Steve highlighted, EPS of $0.71 per share was below the $0.78 we reported in the third quarter of 2011. The single biggest driver of lower earnings accounting for the full $0.07 decline was related to the impact of foreign exchange on dollar-denominated balances in our manufacturing operations outside of the U.S., most notably our plant in The Netherlands. In the third quarter, currency movements generated $0.02 per share in balance sheet remeasurement losses. Note that this impact was not specifically included in our prior guidance. In contrast, we saw $0.05 of balance sheet remeasurement gains in the third quarter of last year. 
As always, there were a number of other puts and takes that affected the third quarter EPS comparison to 2011, including the following. Third quarter gross margin was down on a reported basis from 61.6% last year to 61.2%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, this cost us about $0.02 in lower earnings. The decline is completely attributed to the North America/Europe segment, where we faced higher dairy costs in the prior year. Also, lower production volumes in the U.S. continued to drive unfavorable fixed cost absorption. I have more to say in gross margins in a minute. 
Constant-dollar advertising and promotion spending increased by 9%, reducing earnings by $0.04 per share, in support of new product launches not only in China but also in a number of other important markets. 
We delivered a $0.02 reduction in general and administrative spending from lower incentive compensation accruals and productivity initiatives. We have been more aggressive in driving G&A productivity in light of slower sales growth.  Offsetting this benefit, however, was an additional $0.02 increase in pension settlement expenses in the third quarter. These are triggered when cumulative lump sum payments exceed annual pension expense. The trigger was seen in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter in 2011 due in part to the low interest rate environment, which obviously drives higher lump sum payouts. 
Finally, we realized a $0.06 per share benefit arising from 2 prior year tax items. First, we reduced our 2011 tax provision to reflect the September filing of our final U.S. federal income tax return. Second, we made significant progress in our cash repatriation planning, and if concluded, more of our historical earnings can be kept offshore. Note that the $0.06 from these 2 items is completely attributed to prior year's results and, therefore, will not recur in the future. Also, they had not been included in our July earnings guidance. 
Absent the 2011 tax impacts, we continue to expect our full year tax rate will run between 26% and 27%, consistent with our guidance in our last conference call and our year-to-date effective tax rate of 26.2%. That's down significantly from 28.5% in 2011. And note that we believe a rate between 26% and 27% will be sustained in 2013. 
Turning to our latest full year guidance, we now expect constant-dollar sales to grow between 6% and 7% compared to 8% to 9% in our last conference call. Asia/Latin America is now expected to see constant-dollar sales growth in the low double digits, with the North America/Europe segment expected to be down in the mid-single digits. 
As I mentioned earlier, currency impacts will reduce reported growth by about 1% versus the prior year. Please note that the 2012 trend in China's quarterly sales will impact our 2013 comparisons. Our market share was highest in the first quarter of 2012, down in the second and third quarters on average, and we expect to see solid fourth quarter improvement, with much of the recovery already delivered. 
In addition, the reduced share led to an increased in distributors' inventories during the first half of 2012 and conversely, a correction through lower sales in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect our first half comparisons in 2013 will be more difficult than the second half. 
We expect gross margins for the current year to average about 62%. That's down about 50 basis points from our last call and reflects the impact of both lower sales in China, which carry relatively high margin, and the initial impact from unfavorable fixed cost absorption from lower production in plants serving China. 
Note that the fixed cost absorption issue will continue into 2013 since we'll be manufacturing products throughout the fourth quarter that carries a higher overhead burden from lower production rates. These products will be carried in inventory through year end and will not be sold until early next year. 
Our long-term target of gross margin remains at 63% for the company. As we move through the distributor inventory reductions and see further share gains in China, sales will stabilize at a higher level and production rates will increase correspondingly. And remember that we also temporarily reduced production rates in the U.S. this year as we carried higher internal inventories due to the temporary share loss from the December media issue. 
Productivity remains an important lever for us to meet our gross margin target, and we have the pricing power to offset inflationary trends in emerging markets. In both the third quarter and year-to-date, we achieved a global price increase of 6%. On a full year basis, operating expenses, measured as a percentage of sales, remains around 38.8%. Our earnings guidance of $3.02 to $3.07 per share for 2012 tightens and lowers the range from $3.04 to $3.14 that we detailed last quarter. The lower sales growth for the year is obviously the key factor at work along with a lower gross margin, partially offset by lower expenses predominantly for general and administrative spending. Also, the $0.04 benefit from reduction in prior year's tax accruals, net of the third quarter balance sheet remeasurement loss, was not included in our prior guidance. 
Our cash balance at the end of September was $958 million, up $171 million from June. The increase was attributed to a $155 million temporary drawdown on a revolving credit facility due to cash needs in part related to the ultimate retirement of debt associated with our Argentine acquisition and our investment in the new Asia spray dryer. The incremental borrowing will be paid off over the next several quarters. 
Capital spending year-to-date is $73 million but is expected to reach about $175 million for the full year, lower than our prior guidance of $200 million as fourth quarter spending ramps up on the Asia spray dryer. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at about $75 million for the year. 
During our prior earnings call, I mentioned that we might be opportunistic around the timing of our share buybacks. In our 10-Q that will be issued today, you'll see that we repurchased 676,000 shares of stock in the third quarter, consuming $49 million in cash. That's more than we repurchased in total during the prior 2 quarters, and it's evidence of our belief in the longer-term growth opportunities for Mead Johnson. Our strong cash flow allows us to invest heavily in our business while returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and the share repurchase program. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

And we don't want to give you a specific number here. The majority of our reduction in our sales growth for the year is attributed to distributor inventory reductions that we intend to take in the fourth quarter. And once we get beyond that, you're not going to see it. But I think it was mentioned during the comments by Steve and Kasper. We did see a slightly higher share decline in the second quarter than what we had estimated. You may recall in our last conference call, we said we estimated it between 1% and 1.5%. That came in a little bit higher than the top end of that range. And while it's not very big in terms of kind of a share differential, when you look at a market the size of China, it has some impact on sales overall. But if you say that we're slightly over 1.5%, that represents roughly 10% of the total share points that we had in China proper, and for a $1 billion-plus business, that's $25 million. So that is a big component of what -- of the distributor numbers for the full year. Layered on top of that, as we've discussed, for the food and even baby store channels, we have seen lower growth. I mentioned in our last call that it was running in the mid-20s last year. It's been cut roughly in half, and that results -- it could result in an extra week or 2 weeks of inventory sitting in retailers that ultimately will be reflected in distributor shipments. So that's kind of a second point there. And then I think, as Kasper said, as we went through a very thorough review in light of what was going on, we identified some additional opportunities for inventory reductions on the part of our distributors to improve their efficiencies. So it's the combination of all those, but it's meaningful dollars. In terms of your first question, when you sit back and look at the increase in distributor inventory, you're right in pointing out 2 things. That's driven by, first of all, the actual higher level of dollars that are there, and then there's the impact of the fact that you also will have a change in -- a reduction, as we saw in the second quarter, and some improvement in the third quarter for higher sales per day at retail. Remember, distributor inventory has 2 factors: what we sell in and then what is sold out ultimately by consumers. And both affect it. But when we look at the increase that we had, 70% of that increase came from the higher dollar value of the inventory that was out there. 30% or even a little bit less was related to the daily sales rates. So the vast majority of what we see is really coming from that factor, not in improvement in the retail sales, if you will, at the end of the third quarter."

And there's been a lot of questions about why would you institute a double-digit price increase back in May, June when it looked like the category was getting promotional and it looked like inventories were a little bit higher than what they should have been. And also a lot of questions about -- I thought distributor inventory levels were kept at a minimum anyway. I mean, my understanding was that they were 5, 10, 15 days of inventory in the channel at any given time. So can you talk about sort of how far out of whack they had gotten before you made the determination that you needed to do something about curtailing the level of inventory within the channel?"

Let me firstly talk about the price increase that we announced into the trade in China in April. So you will recognize that having announced the price increase in April, this was prior to the sort of increased promotional activity hardening up in the category in China. I think we are very humble about the fact that we clearly got that price increase or the magnitude of it wrong. We mistimed, at the very least. And I'm not going to try and defend that. I think we recognized that. We've taken actions to realign our pricing to make sure we stay with what we call our strategic pricing relativities in the market. And as I just mentioned, we are happy with the progress that we've seen since we've done that, with us regaining well over half of the share we lost between the beginning of the year and midyear. So that's maybe addressing your point on price. Let me talk a little bit about inventories. You're quite right that we pride ourselves on our commitment to maintaining inventories at appropriate levels at all times. And when and if we discover that inventory levels have gotten out of whack with that philosophy, we are absolutely determined to take prompt action to bring them back in line, and that sometimes includes giving unpopular messages, I guess. But inventory, as you correctly say, is always relative to what your demand is, your retailer demand. So it was less about -- what we've seen was less about us increasing inventory than it was about the fact that when our demand dropped through the second quarter towards midyear, a fixed amount of inventory that was sitting in our system effectively came to represent a higher-than-appropriate amount of forward cover for our distributors. That obviously affects them and it affects their profitability and it just affects the general efficiency of the entire supply chain. And therefore, we are taking the necessary steps to address that promptly. So I hope you feel that gives you some kind of clarity on the issue."

In relation to the category growth, we've spoken to you about that before. We remain very excited about the growth prospects in China. We think the growth prospects are very healthy, but there's little doubt that the Chinese economy has slowed somewhat, even though, I guess, the latest economic data out of China is, perhaps, somewhat more encouraging.

There are a number of factors. Firstly, as I mentioned and Kasper detailed, the timing of our double-digit price increase and the timing of promotional activity, particularly from 2 of our largest international competitors, resulted in an unprecedented pricing gap between our product and market and theirs. Kasper was suitably humble, I think, about the execution of that price increase, but, as I mentioned, it was intended to cover 2 years of cost inflation given that we haven't taken an increase in 2011. I wouldn't name our competitors, but one of them is involved in a strategic transaction that made it attractive to them to be price-promoting aggressively and driving revenues. And another was planning their own product upgrade and price increase, and we're looking to move inventories through the retail channel at the same time. So I think there were a number of factors. And then, of course, as you know better than me, there is some slowdown in the Chinese economy and some resultant impact on confidence, which -- there's no pure science here, but there's greater elasticity in the children's category, in particular. The Europe environment is weak. The North American environment is weak. China has been the biggest prize for a long time. That is never more true than it is now. But I do think, as Kasper said, that normality will return in the near future. And then ultimately, it will be our science, our quality and our brand equity that will win out. And then I understand the disappointment in our short-term results, but we're very pleased with the share momentum that we're seeing now, and we will exit this year with industry-leading low levels of inventory right across the system. The business will exit this year in terrific health."

As you've likely read in our press release, Mead Johnson delivered sales growth of 1% on a constant-dollar basis in the third quarter. As described in our last conference call, we expected a low rate of growth in the quarter. There were 3 key factors that we said would impact our results. First, we described the loss of market share in China and the actions that we would take as a result. Second, we reminded you of higher sales in the third quarter of 2011, attributed to retailer purchases in advance of our Asia SAP implementation. And third, we stated that there would be lower sales in the second half of 2012 of our ready-to-drink children's product in Thailand, resulting from a temporary supply disruption. 
Since China is the most significant of these 3 factors, let me offer a few brief comments on that important market. We attribute a significant part of the China market share loss to a double-digit price increase that accompanied the second quarter launch of a product upgrade, raising DHA to expert-recommended levels in our children's products. 
Our pricing action was designed to cover 2 years of cost inflation as we did not increase prices in China during 2011. Typically, with a price increase of this magnitude, we will see a temporary drop in market share, but the impact was exacerbated by more aggressive price promotions by competitors. 
As a result of lower-than-anticipated share and slower category growth in the food and baby store channels, our distributor inventory have grown. Consequently, we worked with these distributors and constrained sales to levels below retail demand in the third quarter. 
While lower market share and distributor inventory reductions in China obviously impacted our sales growth, we are very pleased with the progress on both fronts, with further improvements expected in the fourth quarter. Kasper will provide a more detailed update shortly. 
Turning back to our financial results, the reported 1% growth in constant-dollar sales does not provide a full understanding of our underlying performance. When you exclude the impact from distributor inventory reductions in China, eliminate last year's benefit from higher shipments to customers in advance of our Asia SAP launch, as well as the impact from the Thai supply disruption, sales growth for the company in the third quarter would have approached 6.5%. 
Beyond China, we once again delivered strong double-digit sales growth in the emerging markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. One particular highlight was the exceptional organic growth in Latin America, complemented by the strong performance of our recently acquired business in Argentina. 
Sales in the developed markets of North America and Europe saw a 4% decline, with tougher comparisons in Europe following our distribution model change in 2011. Our U.S. market share continues to improve, but category sales year-over-year have been influenced by a decline in infant formula consumption and slightly lower births. 
Non-GAAP earnings of $0.71 per share were down 9% from the $0.78 per share reported in the third quarter of 2011. Earnings were lower from an unfavorable foreign exchange comparison, heavier investments in advertising and promotion, along with the timing of pension settlement expense. These were partially offset by lower general and administrative costs and a lower effective tax rate, reflecting in part a sustainable rate reduction compared to 2011, as well as a nonrecurring benefit arising from factors associated with prior year's earnings. 
When we entered 2012, we indicated that we would make larger demand-generation investments and have done so. A&P spending was 15.1% of sales in the third quarter and stands at 14.2% of sales on a year-to-date basis, up from 13.5% in 2011. We plan to continue to increase our investments in demand creation given our strong belief in the sustainable growth of the business despite short-term challenges and lower growth in the second half of this year. 
Turning to our full year outlook, we will have another challenging comparison in the fourth quarter. Despite the expected further recovery in China market share and the resulting improvements in sales growth rates for the Asia/Latin America segment and the company, compared to the third quarter, we will continue to work with our Chinese distributors to further reduce their inventory. We remain committed to entering 2013 with the China inventories at a reduced and appropriate level, well below the industry average, to support the business moving forward. 
We now anticipate reporting full year global sales growth in a range from 6% to 7% on a constant-dollar basis. When compared to our prior guidance, the decline in sales growth is largely attributed to China. Since we have delivered 7% global sales growth on a year-to-date basis, the midpoint of our full year sales guidance implies that the growth rate in the fourth quarter was still below the full year average due to the actions I have described to further reduce distributor inventories in China. 
Nevertheless, we project improving end market sales in the fourth quarter and growth will be higher than the third quarter as we continue to make progress recovering market share in China. 
We expect non-GAAP earnings, on a full year basis, to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.07 per share. Pete will go into more detail shortly, but reduced sales growth is the biggest contributor to the change in our estimates. 
It should be noted that the midpoint of this range is consistent with our original guidance in January, with volatility in China accountable for changes issued. 
I'll now turn the call over to Kasper, who will provide more details on our operating performance. After Pete reviews the financials, I will return to close our prepared remarks and address your questions."

I will review the operating results and expectations by segment, starting firstly with Asia and Latin America. Third quarter sales for Asia/Latin America grew 3% on a constant-dollar basis versus the prior yea",1378,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will review the operating results and expectations by segment, starting firstly with Asia and Latin America. Third quarter sales for Asia/Latin America grew 3% on a constant-dollar basis versus the prior year, with price contributing 8% to growth, while volume declined by 5%. 
The key drivers of the volume decline came from a, our determination to reduce distributor inventories in China to match consumer demand; b, the 2011 SAP-related pre-buys in Asia; and c, the temporary supply disruption to our ready-to-drink products in Thailand. 
These 3 factors combined reduced sales growth for the segment by 8 percentage points. While the loss of market share in China was a further contributor to the volume decline, it was more than offset by solid gains in the rest of the Asia/Latin American segment and by contributions from the acquisition in Argentina. 
Turning now to a bit more detail on China. Final market share data, now available, shows that we lost close to 3.5 points of market share from the beginning of the year to our low in the middle of this year. I shall return to this topic and improvement seen since shortly. 
Before I do, let me remind you that during our last conference call, we highlighted the need to help our distributors reduce their inventory levels given the drop in our market share and somewhat slower category sales growth seen in the first half of the current year. 
Our distributors paid cash in advance, and we pride ourselves on keeping inventories at industry-leading low levels. We believe this is important for maintaining price discipline in a market where it's not uncommon for a product to be bought and resold outside of normal channels by independent wholesalers. 
We are also committed to the continued profitable growth of our distributors. To this end, we've identified additional opportunities to manage inventories more efficiently going forward.  Consistent with these commitments, I'm happy to report our distributors made excellent progress on reducing inventories within the third quarter, and our distributors ended the quarter with inventories at or below the China industry average. Despite this, further inventory reduction is anticipated for the fourth quarter to ensure that we enter 2013 in the strongest possible position. 
I would now like to talk more specifically about current competitiveness and the evolution of underlying Chinese consumer demand for our products. As Steve mentioned, a double-digit price increase in the second quarter in the midst of heavier promotional activity by competitors distorted our relative pricing and caused us to lose share. We continue to see a higher-than-normal level of discounting activity in the marketplace, and given competitive dynamics, it's likely that we continue in the near future. 
During our last earnings call, we spoke of the remedial strategies we were putting in place to recover share in China, including increased promotional pricing activity and heightened focus on trade execution. I'm very satisfied to report that these strategies appear to be working as anticipated. And by third quarter end, we had recovered 2 full share points from our midyear lows. We are very pleased with that improvement, and we expect to deliver further gains as we close out 2012. I would like to add that despite some temporary promotional activity, we have sustained the price increase in the mid- to high single digits in China. 
The exact pace of further share recovery is naturally difficult to predict. Share will fluctuate from months to months, depending on competitive dynamics. And we will obviously want to see share gains sustained over some months before declaring success, but we are satisfied with our most recent progress. 
Despite improvements during the quarter, our average market share in China remained flat between the second and third quarters. But with the improvements we've made during the third quarter, we are confident that our average share will be higher in the fourth quarter. We also remain optimistic about our business in China. An increasing number of babies are still being born into middle class families, and market dynamics will return to normal. And we believe that long-term market share growth will ultimately be driven by product innovation and strong brand equity rather than temporary price activity. 
To conclude my comments on China, based on the appeal of our recently launched product upgrade and improving market share, we expect the fourth quarter to see better sales growth than the quarter just completed. 
Turning now to the rest of the Asia/Latin America segment. Outside of China/Hong Kong, we delivered double-digit constant-dollar sales growth during the third quarter, with strong performance across Southeast Asia, including the key markets of the Philippines and Vietnam. 
Organic growth in Latin America was above levels seen over the last 5 years and the highest in the segment. Our March 2012 acquisition in Argentina added further fuel to our expansion in the region.  Other highlights from our Latin American business include strong share gains in Mexico since the beginning of the year based on recent innovation, continued market share growth in infant formula in Brazil and further strengthening of our market share in Colombia. 
Wrapping up the discussion on Asia/Latin America, we expect 2012 annual sales growth of the segment to run in the low double digits on a constant-dollar sales basis. 
Turning now to the North America/Europe segment, we reported a sales decline of 4% on a constant-dollar basis. Volumes were down by 7% but offset by price improvements of 3%. Europe was a significant contributor to the volume decline. 
In the third quarter of 2011, we saw some inventory reloading as we began to operate a new distribution model. Compounding this effect, challenging economic conditions across Europe have caused some governments to tighten reimbursement parameters for our specialty products, forcing the category to shrink in select markets. 
You will recall that the majority of our sales in Europe are from widely-reimbursed Nutramigen brand. Over the past few years, our European business has been challenged for both growth and profitability.  Through 2012, we are taking steps to refocus our Western European business around our competitively superior, market-leading allergy franchise, Nutramigen. Cow's milk allergy is on the rise globally and in Europe, and once reshaped, we believe we can grow our European business profitably in this segment. As a result, we are in the process of reorganizing our European operations and incurred a specified item charge in the third quarter. This expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
The U.S. accounted for the balance of the volume decline, driven by the residual impact from the unfounded media scare in December of 2011. We estimate that the impact peaked around July, when the affected cohorts of babies reached the age of maximum consumption. Recent share data indicate the impact is tailing off as expected as we move into the fourth quarter. Our U.S. market share recovery remains on track. In our last call, we noted that our share amongst newborns and 3-month olds had already recovered from the media event. Market share reported by Nielsen is now beginning to reflect these improving trends. 
Our share recovery reaffirms the inherent strength of our U.S. organization and our executional ability. It has been helped by the introduction earlier this year of a strengthened lineup of liquid product offerings spanning the age range from prematurity to toddlerhood. Where introduced, we are seeing incremental share improvements in the liquid segment, where we have historically been relatively weak. 
As previously discussed, the U.S. market remains under pressure from declining birth and lower consumption. We, however, retained the view that the market is set to rebound as the economy improves over time. 
On a full year basis, we expect North America/Europe segment sales to be down in the mid-single digits on a constant-dollar basis. In summary, we made good progress in improving our share position in the U.S. and China during the third quarter, while continuing to deliver rapid growth in our other emerging markets. 
While we are targeting further reductions in China distributor inventories in the fourth quarter, we will continue to invest in demand generation across geographies to drive longer-term growth for our business. 
With that, let me now turn over to Pete, who will provide you with further financial highlights. Pete?"
1002291,222533592,370230,"Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Mead Johnson Nutrition Company","Executives","Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Kasper highlighted constant-dollar sales trends, but let me begin by discussing the impact of foreign exchange on sales. The dollar was stronger on average again",1271,"Thanks, Kasper, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Kasper highlighted constant-dollar sales trends, but let me begin by discussing the impact of foreign exchange on sales. 
The dollar was stronger on average against many Latin American and Asian currencies in the third quarter of 2012 versus 2011 and, therefore, reduced sales by about 2%. For the full year, currency will reduce sales by 1% if current exchange rates are maintained. As Steve highlighted, EPS of $0.71 per share was below the $0.78 we reported in the third quarter of 2011. The single biggest driver of lower earnings accounting for the full $0.07 decline was related to the impact of foreign exchange on dollar-denominated balances in our manufacturing operations outside of the U.S., most notably our plant in The Netherlands. In the third quarter, currency movements generated $0.02 per share in balance sheet remeasurement losses. Note that this impact was not specifically included in our prior guidance. In contrast, we saw $0.05 of balance sheet remeasurement gains in the third quarter of last year. 
As always, there were a number of other puts and takes that affected the third quarter EPS comparison to 2011, including the following. Third quarter gross margin was down on a reported basis from 61.6% last year to 61.2%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, this cost us about $0.02 in lower earnings. The decline is completely attributed to the North America/Europe segment, where we faced higher dairy costs in the prior year. Also, lower production volumes in the U.S. continued to drive unfavorable fixed cost absorption. I'll have more to say in gross margins in a minute. 
Constant-dollar advertising and promotion spending increased by 9%, reducing earnings by $0.04 per share, in support of new product launches not only in China but also in a number of other important markets. 
We delivered a $0.02 reduction in general and administrative spending from lower incentive compensation accruals and productivity initiatives. We have been more aggressive in driving G&A productivity in light of slower sales growth.  Offsetting this benefit, however, was an additional $0.02 increase in pension settlement expenses in the third quarter. These are triggered when cumulative lump sum payments exceed annual pension expense. The trigger was seen in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter in 2011, due in part to the low interest rate environment, which obviously drives higher lump sum payouts. 
Finally, we realized a $0.06 per share benefit arising from 2 prior year tax items. First, we reduced our 2011 tax provision to reflect the September filing of our final U.S. federal income tax return. Second, we made significant progress in our cash repatriation planning, and have concluded that more of our historical earnings can be kept offshore. Note that the $0.06 from these 2 items is completely attributed to prior year's results and, therefore, will not recur in the future. Also, they had not been included in our July earnings guidance. 
Absent the 2011 tax impacts, we continue to expect our full year tax rate will run between 26% and 27%, consistent with our guidance in our last conference call and our year-to-date effective tax rate of 26.2%. That's down significantly from 28.5% in 2011. And note that we believe a rate between 26% and 27% will be sustained in 2013. 
Turning to our latest full year guidance, we now expect constant-dollar sales to grow between 6% and 7% compared to 8% to 9% in our last conference call. Asia/Latin America is now expected to see constant-dollar sales growth in the low double digits, with the North America/Europe segment expected to be down in the mid-single digits. 
As I mentioned earlier, currency impacts will reduce reported growth by about 1% versus the prior year. Please note that the 2012 trend in China's quarterly sales will impact our 2013 comparisons. Our market share was highest in the first quarter of 2012, down in the second and third quarters on average, and we expect to see solid fourth quarter improvement, with much of the recovery already delivered. 
In addition, the reduced share led to an increased in distributors' inventories during the first half of 2012 and conversely, a correction through lower sales in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect our first half comparisons in 2013 will be more difficult than the second half. 
We expect gross margins for the current year to average about 62%. That's down about 50 basis points from our last call and reflects the impact of both lower sales in China, which carry relatively high margin, and the initial impact from unfavorable fixed cost absorption from lower production in plants serving China. 
Note that the fixed cost absorption issue will continue into 2013 since we'll be manufacturing products throughout the fourth quarter that carries a higher overhead burden from lower production rates. These products will be carried in inventory through year end and will not be sold until early next year. 
Our long-term target of gross margin remains at 63% for the company. As we move through the distributor inventory reductions and see further share gains in China, sales will stabilize at a higher level and production rates will increase correspondingly. And remember that we also temporarily reduced production rates in the U.S. this year as we carried higher internal inventories due to the temporary share loss from the December media issue. 
Productivity remains an important lever for us to meet our gross margin target, and we have the pricing power to offset inflationary trends in emerging markets. In both the third quarter and year-to-date, we achieved a global price increase of 6%. On a full year basis, operating expenses, measured as a percentage of sales, remains around 38.8%. Our earnings guidance of $3.02 to $3.07 per share for 2012 tightens and lowers the range from $3.04 to $3.14 that we detailed last quarter. The lower sales growth for the year is obviously the key factor at work along with a lower gross margin, partially offset by lower expenses, predominantly for general and administrative spending. Also, the $0.04 benefit from reduction in prior year's tax accruals, net of the third quarter balance sheet remeasurement loss, was not included in our prior guidance. 
Our cash balance at the end of September was $958 million, up $171 million from June. The increase was attributed to a $155 million temporary drawdown on a revolving credit facility due to cash needs in part related to the ultimate retirement of debt associated with our Argentine acquisition and our investment in the new Asia spray dryer. The incremental borrowing will be paid off over the next several quarters. 
Capital spending year-to-date is $73 million but is expected to reach about $175 million for the full year, lower than our prior guidance of $200 million as fourth quarter spending ramps up on the Asia spray dryer. Depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at about $75 million for the year. 
During our prior earnings call, I mentioned that we might be opportunistic around the timing of our share buybacks. In our 10-Q that will be issued today, you'll see that we repurchased 676,000 shares of stock in the third quarter, consuming $49 million in cash. That's more than we repurchased in total during the prior 2 quarters, and it's evidence of our belief in the longer-term growth opportunities for Mead Johnson. Our strong cash flow allows us to invest heavily in our business while returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and the share repurchase program. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Steve."

And we don't want to give you a specific number here. The majority of our reduction in our sales growth for the year is attributed to distributor inventory reductions that we intend to take in the fourth quarter. And once we get beyond that, you're not going to see it. But I think it was mentioned during the comments by Steve and Kasper. We did see a slightly higher share decline in the second quarter than what we had estimated. You may recall in our last conference call, we said we estimated it between 1% and 1.5%. That came in a little bit higher than the top end of that range. And while it's not very big in terms of kind of a share differential, when you look at a market the size of China, it has some impact on sales overall. But if you say that we're slightly over 1.5%, that represents roughly 10% of the total share points that we have in China proper, and for a $1 billion-plus business, that's $25 million. So that is a big component of what -- of the distributor numbers for the full year. Layered on top of that, as we've discussed, for the food and even baby store channels, we have seen lower growth. I mentioned in our last call that it was running in the mid-20s last year. It's been cut roughly in half, and that results -- it could result in an extra week or 2 weeks of inventory sitting in retailers that ultimately will be reflected in distributor shipments. So that's kind of a second point there. And then I think, as Kasper said, as we went through a very thorough review in light of what was going on, we identified some additional opportunities for inventory reductions on the part of our distributors to improve their efficiencies. So it's the combination of all those, but it's meaningful dollars. In terms of your first question, when you sit back and look at the increase in distributor inventory, you're right in pointing out 2 things. That's driven by, first of all, the actual higher level of dollars that are there, and then there's the impact of the fact that you also will have a change in -- a reduction, as we saw in the second quarter, and some improvement in the third quarter for higher sales per day at retail. Remember, distributor inventory has 2 factors: what we sell in and then what is sold out ultimately by consumers. And both affect it. But when we look at the increase that we had, 70% of that increase came from the higher dollar value of the inventory that was out there. 30% or even a little bit less was related to the daily sales rates. So the vast majority of what we see is really coming from that factor, not in improvement in the retail sales, if you will, at the end of the third quarter."

I've had a lot of discussions with clients over the last few weeks, particularly with regard to all the messaging that was done during September about inventory levels, et cetera, and just the feedback I've gotten is sort of everybody expected Mead Johnson to have sort of like the best intelligence on infant formula in China. And there's been a lot of questions about why would you institute a double-digit price increase back in May, June, when it looked like the category was getting promotional and it looked like inventories were a little bit higher than what they should have been. And also a lot of questions about -- I thought distributor inventory levels were kept at a minimum anyway. I mean, my understanding was that they were 5, 10, 15 days of inventory in the channel at any given time. So can you talk about sort of how far out of whack they had gotten before you made the determination that you needed to do something about curtailing the level of inventory within the channel?"

Let me firstly talk about the price increase that we announced into the trade in China in April. So you will recognize that having announced the price increase in April, this was prior to the sort of increased promotional activity hardening up in the category in China. I think we are very humble about the fact that we clearly got that price increase or the magnitude of it wrong. We mistimed, at the very least. And I'm not going to try and defend that. I think we recognized that. We've taken actions to realign our pricing to make sure we stay with what we call our strategic pricing relativities in the market. And, as I just mentioned, we are happy with the progress that we've seen since we've done that, with us regaining well over half of the share we lost between the beginning of the year and midyear. So that's maybe addressing your point on price. Let me talk a little bit about inventories. You're quite right that we pride ourselves on our commitment to maintaining inventories at appropriate levels at all times. And when and if we discover that inventory levels have gotten out of whack with that philosophy, we are absolutely determined to take prompt action to bring them back in line, and that sometimes includes giving unpopular messages, I guess. But inventory, as you correctly say, is always relative to what your demand is, your retailer demand. So it was less about -- what we've seen was less about us increasing inventory than it was about the fact that when our demand dropped through the second quarter towards midyear, a fixed amount of inventory that was sitting in our system effectively came to represent a higher-than-appropriate amount of forward cover for our distributors. That obviously affects them and it affects their profitability and it just affects the general efficiency of the entire supply chain. And therefore, we are taking the necessary steps to address that promptly. So I hope you feel that gives you some kind of clarity on the issue."

The first one is, Steve, over the years -- Kasper, over the years, I've never heard you guys talk this much about China and the promotional environment. I'm very used to, over the years, understanding that the Chinese consumer was really focused on the product itself, and they were very much willing to pay almost any price that you would ask. And we've seen in the data, I think, very consistent numbers. This year, it feels like there's a change. It feels like the promotional activity from some of the competitors really got a response from the consumer. And I suppose, very directly, the question is, are we hitting such high levels on the price point to the consumer such that we've gotten to some kind of maximum? Do you have any thoughts on that?"

There are a number of factors. Firstly, as I mentioned and Kasper detailed, the timing of our double-digit price increase and the timing of promotional activity, particularly from 2 of our largest international competitors, resulted in an unprecedented pricing gap between our product and market and theirs. Kasper was suitably humble, I think, about the execution of that price increase, but, as I mentioned, it was intended to cover 2 years of cost inflation given that we haven't taken an increase in 2011. I wouldn't name our competitors, but one of them is involved in a strategic transaction that made it attractive to them to be price-promoting aggressively and driving revenues. And another was planning their own product upgrade and price increase, and we're looking to move inventories through the retail channel at the same time. So I think there were a number of factors. And then, of course, as you know better than me, there is some slowdown in the Chinese economy and some resultant impact on confidence, which -- there's no pure science here, but there's greater elasticity in the children's category, in particular. The Europe environment is weak. The North American environment is weak. China has been the biggest prize for a long time. That is never more true than it is now. But I do think, as Kasper said, that normality will return in the near future. And then ultimately, it will be our science, our quality and our brand equity that will win out. And then I understand the disappointment in our short-term results, but we're very pleased with the share momentum that we're seeing now, and we will exit this year with industry-leading low levels of inventory right across the system. The business will exit this year in terrific health."
