We had taken a significant -- and we've talked about this in past calls, significant rating action in Florida. Now I point out one thing, and you might say well, just one state. Florida represents a significant chunk of our business, and therefore, it does matter. When those rate changes take place, which are unfortunately very necessary, they have a delayed effect on future renewals. And a large piece of the retrenchment on PLE, which we are certainly not happy with, is a result of our rate changes -- our necessary rate changes in Florida. We have sort of beaten ourselves up quite approximately to see if there was anything we were doing internally. And frankly, there were a few things that we were doing internally that also were destructive to our PLE. A couple of those were more specific the direct than they were to agency. So the results are as we report them, but I don't sense any systemic issue or major change between direct or agency. And as long as our rate levels remain adequate for certainly our large states, I would expect to see those stats to reverse themselves and come back to the levels that they were at. That's not anything other than my expectation. But the reason for the decline primarily, a price shock, a little bit more accentuated indirect, where we also have some things that we needed to fix with regard to build plans and some what we call on-boarding activities, where we bring the customers on board, some things that we could do considerably better. All of those are either remediated or very close to remediation."

Obviously, people in Florida have to choose to do whatever they do. We do not tend to get particularly involved in legislative for fears. We offer our opinion, and our experience in data, whereas the Senate build does not do nearly as much as the House Bill. And Florida has, since the third and fourth District Court ruling, changed a level of understanding of reimbursement for PIP that we thought was well expressed by the legislature in 2008. They are now what is called ruling something other than that, which is causing some degree of disruption. And frankly, we have made some moves to incorporate some language in our policy contract that we think puts us in a relatively better position than many.

Let me try to answer your question, but give you several different points that are valuable. I think it's a little dangerous to jump to most recently reported results, and use open explanation for the deltas. I mean I see the industry results as well as you do. Let me tell you one of the most important things that is happening with Snapshot. First of all, units that we're shipping in Snapshot continued to increase. We have not seen a plateauing of that. So this is not, in some cases, we've come off and others come up with ideas. They seem good, but they don't really comp. Clearly, Snapshot is something that is definitely commercial grade. There's no question about that in terms of the units that we're shipping, the customers showing interest and the percent of new customers that this is affecting, specifically indirect and with the slight decline now in agency. And I mentioned some of that in my letter. The most important thing to me is that the loss results matched with the pricing. Your assessment that frankly, we are giving relatively large discounts is an important assessment. It is extremely dangerous to give large discounts unless you have a very high certainty that you're matching the true loss costs. So now that we've developed a reasonable track record, and there has been some tuning, but I would say tuning not sort of mega-refinement to our discount structure, we are becoming very comparable that we are matching our loss results with the pure premium. Or the pure premium is being matched up, and things look good there. So we will continue, as you will see, in some of our other statistics, it is possible that average premiums will decline for a little bit. The issue is we're matching the loss costs with our price. Answers so far, and so far is a reasonably good measure, yes. Are we seeing other things that we hope to get from that? The customers that are coming to us disproportionately relative to other non-UBI, I quote UBI here as Snapshot, U.S.-based insurance, they typically have primarily insurance. We are seeing a group of customers who typically get higher levels of discounts tend to be -- or tend to have a higher propensity to come from carriers that are, let's just say, the three that are larger than us, we are getting a higher percentage of those customers in a higher discount peers than we might in a lower discount peers or in non-usage space. We have now credible data that those who come to us through Snapshot and get a discount are experiencing a meaningful increase in retention. We're not going to give out those specific numbers, but when I see meaningful, it's not 10 basis points. We're finding that our advertising that we had, actually I'll say we've been struggled a little bit in our earliest versions of advertising to try to get people understand what the Snapshot concept was and the relative ease with which they could install the unit, we've probably had a couple that was not as effective. Two of our more recent commercials have helped with that a great deal. And a lot of the mystery and sort of concern seems to have gone away. A couple other things that I can throw in since Snapshot really is on people's minds is that the algorithms, and I tried to reference some of this in our shareholders letter, the algorithm will continue to be a working problem progress for us. Obviously we don't change it over time, but we're doing R&D to figure out new things. And it is very clear to us that more data, a better ability to analyze it, different uses of the components that we can now measure. We mentioned some of those at the last IR meeting, are actually going to tribute to a revised algorithm in the future. And I suspect that, that will continue for quite some time, as we get to use this data in more and more intelligent ways. We've also referenced in the shareholder letter that the intellectual property that we have has been reviewed and upheld at the patent office including the issuance of a further patent, which is very, very directly describing what we're doing in the marketplace. So we're very thrilled with that. So Snapshot in general is working very well. I'd say it's commercial grade, and lots results that matched with the pricing, and that gives us great deal of confidence to keep pushing on this."

But can you give us a sense -- this is really following up on the letter where you talked about kind of the agency distribution having kind of embraced this at a lesser rate than direct customers.

I'm just trying to think about if that customer is more likely to be a direct customer, does that mean they're more likely to be somebody who would be attracted to Progressive anyway? I'm just trying to think about that dynamic as we think about the penetration of the product over time."

I think that calls for some speculation, which in this case, I'll give you mine, and that's what it is. So I don't think the customer per se is necessarily someone who has a propensity for one distribution or another. Most people want to be rated in their insurance verses who they are and how they're driving behaviors reflect or could affect in the premium. So I really don't sense that there's a structural reason why somebody would feel differently if they went to an agent versus direct as to their personal comfort with having their insurance rate reflect their driving behavior. I think that's pretty much uniform. Why the reason I made a comment I made, and having had a lot of years with agent, is recognizing that as small-business people, changes come to them, some stick, some don't stick. I think agency in general, and actually sort of probably will put myself in the category if we are one of them. I want to see something get a little bit more of a permanency and a maturity to it before I put that on my customers, knowing that I'm the one that has to go back later and say oh no, it didn't work. The company changed their minds and I have to rewrite or do whatever. So I think there is a period where agents want to just get a greater confidence that this is something that they can rely on, and that they can offer to their customers with some degree of certainty that is going to be in place for a period in time. Our ability to do that and use our direct channel as a leading indicator to test that and prove that proposition is actually terrific, because then we can go back to agents and sort of say here's our data. I think you can start to feel a little more confident. And we're already starting to see, it's still small, but as I predicted and I'm happy to give you meaningful updates without necessarily specific percentages as the year develops. But I'll be surprised if we don't see the agency adoption of this somewhat come up to parallel, the direct adoption, simply because it's really a consumer benefit and doesn't have specifics to distributions."

From the standpoint -- and I don't if this works to your benefit or detriment or maybe it doesn't matter. But obviously, homeowners is now, from an industry perspective, is seeing a ton of pricing pressure. And it doesn't look like this is likely to be a one-year phenomenon as a lot of folks in the industry feel like the product is structurally underpriced and the cat experience of last year and late 2010 have probably weighed on that a bit. So I guess my question is your providers, do you get -- do you feel like what they are likely to do on the rate side is going to be in line with the industry or more or less aggressive? And how do you see their relative rate need or actions affecting the take-up rate for that product for the preferred customer, multiproduct customer?"

However, to a degree I think that they were probably on the lesser side of that, which is nice for them. And they will need to react. That's clearly their decision to make, but they will need to react. And in fact, if we go back to the very first question that was asked about direct and a little bit of policy life expectancy, there's probably a touch in there where we're seeing some rate increases for our PHA that has changed the relationship in order. So this is not something that is not intertwined, but all of our carriers are on top of it. We get nothing from them that suggests that they are any more concerned than any other reasonable homeowners company. And while they're taking some rate need, it looks like in all cases, we have open and viable markets. And the good here relative to being able to offer that is far greater than the concern around rate. In fact, I want them to take rate, because they're no use to me if they're not viable and profitable in meeting their own standards. And what's probably more important is that frankly, you're going to see a lot of customers experience changes in their homeowners rates, which is potentially another shock that forces people into the marketplace in general to shop. So while there is some negative on the balance sheet here, there's actually a fair amount of positive from our perspective that we have multiple carriers. They're all open for business. In fact, we've added a couple of carriers and we'll talk about that later. And our PHA strategy continues to us to be a very viable strategy. It continues to open up more of that preferred customer coming in through direct and there we can offer through agents. Brian already mentioned they're coming through the agency channel as well, and our retention continues to be great. So long winded way of saying, yes, they're affected, yes, they'll take rate, clearly there's a negative to that. It's important that they do that. They do it in a way that is meaningful for them and keeps them in business. My suspicion is we'll pick up something on the other side as the balance sheet there, as other companies need to take rate and perhaps people reevaluate both their auto and homeowner's package."

I can't give you a quantification of it, but I would not say Snapshot was the driver of the independent agency channel growth, which we saw nicely in the fourth quarter. I would suggest to you there that, that is probably more a result of other people's rate actions. And as agents are in the position to sort of see those work are on a daily basis where they have, they can change their placement or possibly even renewals. I think that's a bigger driver that, as you know, that is a comparative rating environment. So when there are rate changes, that sort of comes through very quickly and agents can arbitrage to whichever carrier they think is appropriate as they're representing them. I'm sure they'll feel good about them. So if you have a rate that's beneficial, you'll likelihood to get the business. I think we're benefiting more from that. With regard to direct, I don't think there's any question that, as I said earlier, when I try to put a few data points out there about Snapshot, our advertising for Snapshot in what we call sort of rivals and work on Flo where Flo is actually sort of transposed into individual cars as a metaphor for the Snapshot device, that seems to have worked along with a little bit of reality built into our advertising where we see someone plug the device in and say that was pretty easy. Surprisingly, that would seem easier there in retrospect than they do when we're planning. But those clearly suggested to people that the Snapshot is something that they should try. How much new business we get from Snapshot versus other advertising is very difficult. And while I could sort of ramble on, I'm not going to say I can measure that specifically. I would say the likelihood of someone coming to Progressive and then showing interest in Snapshot, remember they get a quote and then decide to take the device. That seems to have been, as I said, the unit shipment on that continues to go up. We haven't seen the plateau on that. So the level of consumer acceptance is very high. And as we showed in our fourth quarter results, our new prospects seemed to be starting to gain some momentum. But I think that's more of a combination of both product, advertising and possibly even rate from other companies or perhaps people getting renewals with an increase."

This has to be able to generate more customers, potentially, and as I indicated earlier, the mix seems to be suggesting more than potential, a set of customers that we might not otherwise have gotten. I believe fully that this is so profound in terms of rating that is offering a level of segmentation that hereto for hasn't really been seen, perhaps credit was the last thing that came close to that. And as this gets traction, and I'm just not talking about just a few people, it will build on itself by reputation. And my suspicion is that the volume, as long as we're priced at our target, we have not changed our targets in any way shape or form, we'll accommodate Snapshot or will just say they will subsidize for a while or any sort of things. So I wouldn't be looking for change in margin, based simply on Snapshot. As I said earlier, you might be looking and use some caution in interpreting average -- little average written premium. So we may have new business coming on at an average written premium long lower than we previously did. That doesn't worry me nearly as much as it would be if we weren't matching lost costs with a premium."

There's also the long-term benefit of keeping them longer, which we clearly have seen even in our initial data that those who receive a discount participate get -- stay with us longer. So there is this long-term premium gains. And the pricing segmentation is very important, and we are always trying to price towards actual lost cost. And I think as we get closer and closer to those in terms of how we moves be reflective of what we believe lost cost will be. And if we can out segment our competition and have greater pricing urgency I think in the long term, we'll win on that front. It's just continuing our emphasis on price segmentation, pricing skills, having a low-cost strategy. And if we do both, we think our prices in the marketplace will be very competitive going forward."

You ask a very, very, very important question, and one that I am going to answer as best I can for you, and it maybe that this is one that requires a little bit more graphical support. So our next meeting might be even a better opportunity to do it. First of all, our existing customers are written under a contract that goes on, so we're not going to all our existing customers and changing their rates that we don't have the data to do that. We don't have a driving school. So when you implement anything, as much as we might like it to be different, when you implement something, you have to draw a line and say people going forward will be of this contract and get advantage at this price. We have no idea of the driving school of our installed base of customers, and they're not showing any great propensity to reevaluate or come back or whatever. They're free to do that. We do have some enforcement behavior when someone says, I see it on television and say I'd like that. And of course, we'll never withhold that for many customer. But that really is not a big issue. But if you extrapolated that and to a discount across the entire book, then we know what the outcome of that will be. With regards to new customers, we'll keep relatively simple and I said in my letter that we're no longer going to get the specific numbers. But let's say x customers come to us and tries Snapshot and we offer no discount. X is considerably smaller than y here, y would be the customers that come to us try Snapshot and get some level of discount. Those customers we're obviously very happy with us. The x customers, if 0 was the right answer, then we're in different. We would have sold them the policy in that anyway.
There's a good chance that it was in 0. It would've our estimation plus z. We understand plus z. We understand that we have the price this in total to balance out both with the current book and the level of discount we give new customers. So we want to be able to give as much as possible, but we recognize we have a factor that we're not pricing forward. And over time, that will balance out. I would tell you that the way I'd describe it and I don't know if it's worked particular well, but I describe it as it is important, but it is raining in the ocean. And we can make that up on a relatively small adjustment to the pricing we give across the book or in the discount structure. Hopefully that helps. If not, we will try in a more elaborate way in June."

Matt puts it together and sort of growth and profitability, and obviously you're all familiar with those kinds of grid and being on the top right in this case is a place where you're growing and have great profitability. I want to anocdate that grid, because it depends on time frames. And it's amazing how few stay in that sector and how many go in and out of that sector. So the one thing I'd say to you is the growth and profitability clearly are audited, it's not always clear the timeframe in which they are audit. So we believe we have rates that are properly set for the most of the year. We did see some favorable development that probably was more than expected. Nonetheless, we had the discipline to stay with those rates in the early part of the year. We think their shopping behavior was down, and we may not have had quite the conversion rate that we could have had, but the discipline seemed to pay off as we went closer into the fourth quarter. And trends, which we think we had price for were being realized by others. Across the board, it seems that there is more propensity for rate increases than decreases.

We'll actually give you that 17% discount for the remaining term of your policy. We write 6-month policy, and as of this stage, you've had a 30-day measurement period and probably a few days in the mail and stuff that maybe with 35 or 40 days into the policy. So we would then give you that discount for the remaining part of your policy. We would continue to observe your driving behavior through the chip that you've installed, and we would require that you keep it installed. And at the end of that policy period are actually the required number of days that we offer you a renewal price of the expiration of your policy, we would then tell you, ""Hey, that 17% -- okay, that 17% looks good or we go it wasn't as good as we thought. It's really 15%, or maybe it's a little better than we thought, 21%."" Now I'm not being convenient in suggesting that. The fact is it doesn't change very much, so we want people to know that it's not like we're going to give you 17% and then say 6 months so it's really 3%. We would do that if that's what it says, but that does not seem to be a behavior that the observed.

We took pretty significant corrective actions in all of those states where we effectively raised amounts that contributed to lower new application production in early parts of 2011. We then became much more comfortable with our rate level in these large states including Florida and New York and New Jersey. The one state where we still have some fairly significant concerns in terms of profitability, the state I would mention would be Michigan, where we still have not been able to achieve an underwriting profit. We're still -- we've taken significant corrective actions, but we assumed have ways to go there. But certainly, in the area, we've taken lots of great data and new business production has fallen off as a result. The other state that had been of mentioned previously was Massachusetts. we are pleased to report that, that is getting, in 2011, was very close to being profitable on a calendar year basis for the year, and we feel good about our rate level there. And look to be able to see that state growing again. Having said all that, I would say we always need to stay vigilant in some of these highly volatile states, Florida being one of them New York being another. Michigan will always be in our watch and monitoring list. The loss trends and the environments tend to be very volatile, and we've seen this not only over the last 3 years, but if you go back 10 years or 15 years, these tend to be very volatile markets where combined ratios for us in the industry have come up and down corrective actions. And so we need to sort of remain vigilant there. As Glenn talked about earlier in his conversation, it's one thing to be growing. It's another thing to be profitable, but how do we compare both profitable growth, it's yet to -- we're dealing diligently on that. So we feel good about our aggregate rate level. In last year, our rate changes has been relatively modest across the marketplace. Rate change in the last 12 months is something like plus 1% and in aggregate, but I'm certain there will be individual states where we'll have to take more corrective actions, but that's part of our discipline and what we're trying to do each and everyday."

I mentioned earlier that physical damage, severity trends are now a little faster than we've seen for sometime, which is okay. We priced to those a we're not so ridiculous that don't necessarily cost consumers to have major problems, but we're starting to see all of pickup in new car sales. And all of that could be good for our perspective. The bodily injury, that's the physical damage as you well know is not a big driver of reserves, so I'm not too worried about that. We just need to make sure that we need to get into pricing at a price level. Bodily injury, which could be easily big driver of reserves and pricing seems to be manageable. The one that Brian hit with almost all states to be mentioned, one that really is always going to be something on top of mind for all carriers and auto is PIP. PIP sometimes and severities that we can sit and talk about and then the real question is why is this happening? And unfortunately, that answer gets a little trickier. In Florida, there is some very real issues in terms of why that is happening right now because of some changes in quote decisions that have promoted a large number of claims that we believe reconcile our sold and paid to be reconsidered. And that is something that the whole industry is facing. That's not a trend that you typically can anticipate or put into your pricing. So I hope you don't see a lot of that. This year, gas prices might affect a little bit the monitor or the mileage driven. One of the comments that we made in our investor meeting is for us, this is actually trying to be alert to those frequency changes, possibly driven by exogenous events such as gas prices. We now have a very large sample of automobiles running around the United States that we can actually determine, if, in fact, there are instantaneous changes in miles driven based on certain events or at least to try to relate those as quickly as possible. So we feel great that we're in a position to have that early monitoring device such as the Snapshot devices that we have out there. We still see a fair amount of advertising in the industry. I don't expect that to falloff, but it's my belief, it becomes harder and harder for those without a great deal of brand recognition to break into the significant consideration sets, so we're delighted that where there. And we're going to price, as true in the chart of industry wide premium growth and combined ratio. And you will remember when the industry was running at low 90s and hitting 80s on a regular basis, those days of long since changed. And now that when I recognize everybody has their own goal, I suspect most companies are a lot closer to their acceptable level of combined ratio, and some possibly over it. The game gets a lot harder now. The tight road is really there, and a few points one way or another is not absorbed by the slack in the combined ratio. And that's likely to be overall a driver of premium growth, and most of this conversation to date has been us talking a little bit about what I think will be a meaningful offset to that overall premium growth driver for our customers and in their ability to at least -- or our new customers to offset that with the driving behavior discounts."

We had taken a significant -- and we talked about this in past calls -- significant rating action in Florida. Now I point out one state, and then you might say, well, just one state. Florida represents a significant chunk of our business, and therefore, it does matter. When those rate changes take place, which are very -- unfortunately, very necessary, they have a delayed effect on future renewals. And a large piece of the retrenchment on PLE, which we are certainly not happy with, is a result of our rate changes -- our necessary rate changes in Florida. We have sort of beaten ourselves up quite appropriately to see if there was anything that we were doing internally. And frankly, there were a few things that we were doing internally that also were destructive to our PLE. A couple of those were more specific to direct than they were to agency. So the results are as we report them, but I don't sense any systemic issue or major change between direct or agency. And as long as our rate levels remain adequate for, certainly, our large states, I would expect to see those stats to reverse themselves and come back to the levels that they were at. That's not a -- anything other than my expectation, but the reason for the decline, primarily, a price shock, a little bit more accentuated indirect, where we also had some things that we needed to fix with regard to build plans and some what we call on-boarding activities, where we bring new customers on board, some things that we could do considerably better.

They're now at this ruling something other than that, which is causing some degree of disruption.

Let me try to answer your question, but give you several different points that are valuable. I think it's a little dangerous to jump to most recently reported results and use one explanation for their -- the deltas. I mean, I see the industry results as well as you do. Let me tell you one of the most important things that is happening with Snapshot. First of all, our units that we're shipping in Snapshot continue to increase. We have not seen a plateauing of that. So this is not, as in some cases, we come up and others come up with ideas that seem good, but they don't really hunt. Clearly, Snapshot is something that is definitely commercial grade. There's no question about that in terms of the units that we're shipping, the customers showing interest and the percent of new customers that this is affecting, specifically indirect, and with the slight climb now in agency, and I mentioned some of that in my letter. The most important thing to me is that the loss results matched with the pricing. Your assessment that, frankly, we are giving relatively large discounts is an important assessment. It is extremely dangerous to give large discounts unless you have a very high certainty that you're matching the true loss costs. So now that we've developed a reasonable track record, and there has been some tuning, but I will say tuning not sort of mega-refinement, to our discount structure, we are becoming very comparable that we are matching our loss results with the pure -- or the pure premium is being matched, and things look good there. So we will continue -- as you will see in some of our other statistics, it is possible that average premiums will decline for a little bit. The issue is are we matching the loss costs with our price. Answers so far, and so far is a reasonably good measure, yes. Are we seeing other things that we hope to get from that? The customers that are coming to us are disproportionately relative to other non-UBI, and I called UBI here as Snapshot usage-based insurance, they typically have prior insurance. We are seeing a grouping of customers who typically get higher levels of discounts tend to be -- or tend to have a higher propensity to come from carriers that are, let's just say, the 3 that are larger than us, we will get a higher percentage of those customers in the higher-discount tiers than we might in the lower-discount tiers or in non-usage-based. We have now credible data that those who come to us through Snapshot and get a discount are experiencing a meaningful increase in retention. We're not going to give out those specific numbers, but when I see meaningful, it's not 10 basis points. We're finding that our advertising that we had -- actually, I'll say we even struggled a little bit in our earliest versions of advertising to try to get people to understand what the Snapshot concept was and the relative ease with which they could install the unit, we've probably had a couple that were not as effective. Two of our more recent commercials have helped with that a great deal, and a lot of the mystery and sort of concern seems to have gone away. A couple other things that I can throw in as -- since Snapshot silly [ph] is on people's mind is that the algorithms -- and I tried to reference some of this in my shareholders letter, the algorithm will continually be a work in progress for us. Obviously, we don't change it all the time, but we're always doing R&D to figure out new things. And it is very clear to us that more data, a better ability to analyze it, different uses of the components that we can now measure, we mentioned some of those at the last IR meeting, are actually going to contribute to a revised algorithm in the future. And I suspect that, that will continue for quite some time, as we get to use this data in more and more intelligent ways. We've also referenced in the shareholder letter that the intellectual property that we have has been reviewed and upheld at the patent office, including the issuance of a further patent, which is very, very directly describing what we're doing in the marketplace so we're very thrilled with that. So Snapshot, in general, is working very well, and I'd say it's commercial grade, and loss results have matched with the pricing, and that gives us great deal of confidence to keep pushing on this."

I'm just trying to think about if that customer is more likely to be a direct customer. Is -- does that mean they're more likely to be somebody who would be attracted to Progressive anyways?

I think that calls for some speculation, which in this case, I'll give you mine, and that's what it is. So I don't think the customer per se is necessarily someone who has a proclivity for one distribution or another. Most people want to be rated in their insurance for sort of who they are and how they're driving behaviors reflect or could reflect in the premium, so I really don't sense that there's a structural reason why somebody would feel differently if they went to an agent versus direct as to their personal comfort with having their insurance rate reflect their driving behavior. I think that's pretty much uniform. Why the reason I made the comment I made in having had a lot of years with agents is recognizing that as small business people, changes come to them. Some stick, some don't stick. I think agents in general, and actually sort of probably will put myself in this category, if I were one of them, I want to see something get a little bit more of a permanency and a maturity to it before I put that on my customers, knowing that I'm the one that has to go back later and say ""Oh no, it didn't work. The company changed their minds and I have to rewrite or do whatever."" So I think there is a period where agents want to just get greater confidence that this is something that they can rely on, and that they can offer to their customers with some degree of certainty that it's going to be in place for a period of time. Our ability to do that and use our direct channel as a leading indicator to test that and prove that proposition is actually terrific because then we can go back to agents and sort of say ""Hey, look, here's our data. I think you can start to feel a little more confident."" And we're already starting to see, it's still small, but as I predicted, and I'm happy to give you meaningful updates without necessarily specific percentages as the year develops, but I'll be surprised if we don't see the agency adoption of this somewhat come up to parallel the direct adoption simply because it's really a consumer benefit and doesn't have specifics to distributions."

From the standpoint -- and I don't if this works to your benefit or detriment or maybe it doesn't matter, but obviously, homeowners is now, from an industry perspective, is seeing a ton of pricing pressure. And it doesn't look like this is likely to be a one-year phenomenon, as a lot of folks in the industry feel like the product is structurally underpriced and the cat experience of last year and late 2010 have probably weighed on that a bit, so I guess my question is, we -- your providers, do you get -- do you feel like what they're likely to do on the rate side is going to be in line with the industry or more or less aggressive? And how do you see their relative rate need or actions affecting the take-up rate for that product for the preferred customer, multiproduct customer?"

However, to a degree I think that they were probably on the lesser side of that, which is nice for them. And they will need to react. That's clearly their decision to make, but they will need to react. And in fact, if we go back to the very first question that was asked about direct and a little bit of policy life expectancy, there's probably a touch in there where we've seen some rate increases for our PHA that has changed their relationship in auto. So this is not something that is not intertwined, but all of our carriers are on top of it. We get nothing from them that suggests that they are any more concerned than any other reasonable homeowners company. And while they're taking some rate need, it looks like in all cases, we have open and viable markets. And the good here relative to being able to offer that is far greater than the concern around rates. In fact, I want them to take rate because they're no use to me if they're not viable and profitable in meeting their own standards. And what's probably more important is that, frankly, you're going to see a lot of customers experience changes in their homeowners' rates, which is potentially another shock that forces people into the marketplace in general to shop. So while there is some negative on the balance sheet here, there's actually a fair amount of positive from our perspective that we have multiple carriers. They're all open for business. In fact, we've added a couple of carriers, and we'll talk about that later. And our PHA strategy continues for us to be a very viable strategy. It continues to open up more of that preferred customer coming in through direct and where we can offer through agents, Brian already mentioned, they're coming in through the agency channel as well, and our retention continues to be great. So a long-winded way of saying, yes, they're affected, yes, they'll take rates. Clearly there's a negative to that. It's important that they do that. They do it in a way that is meaningful for them and keeps them in business. My suspicion is we'll pick up something on the other side of the balance sheet there as other companies need to take rate and perhaps people reevaluate both their auto and homeowner's package."

I can't give you a quantification of it, but I would not say Snapshot was the driver of the independent agency channel growth, which we saw are nicely in the fourth quarter. I would suggest to you there that, that is probably more a result of other people's rate actions. And as agents are in the position to sort of see those almost on a daily basis when they hit, that they can change their placement or possibly even renewals. I think that's a bigger driver that -- as you know, that is a comparative rating environment. So when there are rate changes, that sort of comes through very quickly, and agents can arbitrage to whichever carrier they think is appropriate as they're representing them. I'm sure they feel good about them, so if you have a rate that's beneficial, you're likely to get some business. I think we're benefiting more from that. With regard to direct, I don't know if there's any question that, as I said earlier, when I try to put a few data points out there about Snapshot, our advertising for Snapshot in what we call sort of rivals in work on Flo, where Flo is actually sort of transposed into individual cars as a metaphor for the Snapshot device, that seems to have worked, along with a little bit of reality built into our advertising, where we see someone plug the device in and say ""That was pretty easy."" Surprisingly, that would seem easier in retrospect than they do when we're planning, but those clearly suggested to people that Snapshot is something that they should try. How much new business we get from Snapshot versus other advertising is very difficult. And while I could sort of ramble on, I'm not going to sort of say I can measure that specifically. I would say the likelihood of someone coming to Progressive and then showing interest in Snapshot, just remember, they get a quote and then decide to take the device. That seems to have been -- as I said, the unit shipment on that continues to go up. We haven't seen the plateau on that, so the level of consumer acceptance is very high. And as we showed in our fourth quarter results, our new prospects seemed to be starting to gain some momentum. But I think that's more of a combination of both product, advertising and possibly even rate from other companies or perhaps people getting renewals with an increase."

It's accretive in number of customers. And not being disrespectful in that answer, I think what I really need to focus on, Progressive needs to focus on is more and more customers all the time and at the right premium. So when we offer these discounts, we would not clearly take a book of business and say ""Gee, let's just offer a big discount to it."" That would be bullish. This has to be able to generate more customers potentially, and as I indicated earlier, the mix seems to be suggesting more than potential, a set of customers that we might not otherwise have gotten. I believe fully that this is so profound in terms of rating that is offering a level of segmentation that hereto for hasn't really been seen. Perhaps credit was the last thing that even came close to that. And as this gets traction, and we're not talking about just a few people, it will build on itself by reputation. And my suspicion is that the volume, as long as we're priced at our targets, we have not changed our targets in any way shape or form, we'll accommodate Snapshot or we'll just say ""Hey, we'll subsidize for a while"" or any of those sort of things, so I wouldn't be looking for change in margin based simply on Snapshot. As I said earlier, you might be looking and use some caution in interpreting average -- low average written premium. So we may have a new business coming on at an average written premium lower than we previously did. That doesn't worry me nearly as much as it would be if we weren't matching loss costs with the premium."

And I think as we get closer and closer to those in terms of having those will be reflective of what we believe loss costs will be.

You ask a very, very, very important question and one that I am going to answer as best I can for you, and it may be that this is one that requires a little bit more graphical support, so our next meeting might be even a better opportunity to do it. First of all, our existing customers are written under a contract that goes on, so we're not going to all our existing customers and changing their rate, that we simply don't have the data to do that. We don't have the driving scores. So when you implement anything, as much as we might like it to be different, when you implement something, you have to draw a line in the sand and say people going forward will be in this contract and get advantage at this price. We have no idea of the driving score of our installed base of customers, and they're not showing any great propensity to reevaluate or come back or whatever. They are free to do that. We do have some endorsement behavior, where someone says ""I see it on television"" and say ""I like that."" And of course, we'll never withhold that from any customer. But that really is not a big issue. But if you extrapolated that and took a discount across the entire book, then we know what the outcome of that would be. With regard to new customers, we'll keep it relatively simple, and I said in my letter that I was no longer going to give the specific numbers, but let's say x customers come to us and tries Snapshot and we offer no discount. Well, x is considerably smaller than y here. Y would be customers that come to us, try Snapshot and get some level of discount. Those customers, we're obviously very happy with. The x customers, if 0 was the right answer, then we're indifferent. We would have sold them the policy at that anyway. But there is a good chance it wasn't 0, it would've been in our estimation plus z. We understand plus z. We understand that we have to price this in total to balance out both with the current book and the level of discount we give new customers. So we want to be able to give as much as possible, but we recognize we have a factor that we're not pricing full. And over time, that will balance out. I would tell you that a way I've described it, and I don't know that it's worked particular well, but I've described it as D [ph] is important, but it is raining in the ocean, and we can make that up on a relatively small adjustment to the pricing we give across the book or in the discount structure.

You would then get asked ""Would you like to try to improve your rate through the use of Snapshot?"" You would say ""yes"" in this case, and we would give you a device, i.e. we would give it to you in the mail. You would follow up within a few days, and you would install it in your vehicle. We would know the moment you install it. And in return, you get to be able to see exactly what data is relevant to you use on a website. And after 30 days of usage, we would say, ""Michael, based on your driving behavior that we've observed and the things that are important to us, we think that you could be due a 17% discount. And here's the deal we're going to make with you. We'll actually give you that 17% discount for the remaining term of your policy."" We write 6-month policies, and at this stage, you've had a 30-day measurement period and probably a few days of some mail and stuff, so that may be worth 35 or 40 days into the policy. So we would then give you that discount for the remaining part of your policy. We would continue to observe your driving behavior through the chip that you've installed, and we would require that you keep it installed. And at the end of that policy period or actually, the required number of days that we offer you a renewal price at the expiration of your policy, we would then tell you, ""Hey, that 17%"" -- is that what I said? okay. ""That 17% looks good,"" or we go ""It wasn't as good as we thought. It's really 15%,"" or ""Maybe it's a little better than we thought, 21%."" Now I'm not being convenient in suggesting that. The fact is it doesn't change very much, so we want people to know that it's not like we're going to give you 17% and then say 6 months, so it's really 3. We would do that if that's what it said, but that does not seem to be the behavior that we observe, so you would then get a renewal quote that would reflect the longer period of observation that we've made. At that point, we would say that unit, by the way, has some value to us. You're obligated to return it to us, and that would become inventory for us to recycle to the next person at Goldman Sachs."

That's a shock generally to consumers, and we did that. Would had to do that. Others are doing it, and perhaps they're doing it a little bit even as we speak. I don't expect but can't eliminate the possibility that we have other changes that we need to make. And as we start to measure our PLE for customers that are now renewing or renewing into the new rate revisions that they've come in through, we should expect to see that policy life expectancy grow. And obviously, in the state of Florida, our average premiums will grow because we've taken rate. We also see overall a little bit of an increase in severities across the board. I don't think that's new. Most companies are probably seeing much the same thing relatively tolerable in bodily injury and a little faster than we've seen for sometime in the physical damage and collision coverages.

Those are critically important to a direct business, and I can't stress how important they are. And surprisingly, we're finding things in Australia that we found in 1992 when we started direct in United States, and they take a long time to be able to go from a standing start to something meaningful. But the premium in Australia is really less than $10 million, so -- and likely not to exceed that in great proportion this year.

We took pretty significant corrective actions in all of those states, where we effectively raised rates to a fair amount, that contributed to lower new application production in early parts of 2011. We then became much more comfortable with our rate level in these large states, including Florida and New York and New Jersey. The one state where we still have some fairly significant concerns in terms of profitability, the state I would mention would be Michigan, where we still have not been able to achieve an underwriting profit. We're still -- we've taken significant corrective actions, but we assumed they have ways to go there. But certainly, in the area, we've taken lots of rate there and new business production has fallen off as a result. The other state that had been of mention previously was Massachusetts, and we're pleased to report that, that is getting -- in 2011, it was very close to being profitable on a calendar year basis for the year, and we feel good about our rate level there and look to be able to see that state growing again. Having said all of that, I would say we always need to stay vigilant in some of these pretty high volatile states: Florida being one of them; New York being another; Michigan will always be in our watch and monitoring lists. The loss trends and the environments tend to be very volatile, and we've seen this not only over the last 3 years, but if you go back 10 years or 15 years, these tend to be very volatile markets, where combined ratios for us in the industry have come up and down, corrective actions, and so we need to sort of remain vigilant there. As Glenn talked about earlier in his conversation, it's one thing to be growing. It's another thing to be profitable, but having the ordered pair of both profitable growth, it's yet to -- we're diligently on that. So we feel good about our aggregate rate level. In the last year, our rate change has been relatively modest across the marketplace. Rate change in the last 12 months is something like plus 1% and in aggregate, but I'm certain there will be individual states where we'll have to take more corrective actions, but that's part of our discipline and what we try to do each and every day."

We priced to those. They're not sort of so ridiculous that don't necessarily cost consumers to their major problems, but we're starting to see a little pickup in new car sales. And all of that could be good from our perspective. The bodily injury -- that the physical damage, as you well know, is not a big driver of reserves, so I'm not too worried about that. We just need to make sure that we need get it into pricing at the right level. Bodily injury, which is a big driver of reserves and pricing seems to be manageable. The one that Brian hit with almost all the states that he mentioned, one that really is always going to be something on top of mind for all carriers and auto is PIP. PIP sometimes has severities that we can sit and we can talk about, and then the real question is ""Why is this happening?"" And unfortunately, that answer gets a little trickier. In Florida, there is some very real issues in terms of why that is happening right now because of some changes in quote decisions that have promoted a large number of claims that -- where we believe reconcile our sold and paid to be reconsidered, and that is something that the whole industry is facing. That's not a trend that you typically can anticipate or put into your pricing, so I hope we don't see a lot of that. This year, gas prices might affect a little bit the monitor or the mileage driven. One of the comments that we made in our investor meeting is for us, this is actually trying to be alert to those frequency changes possibly driven by exogenous events, such as gas prices. We now have a very large sample of automobiles running around the United States that we can actually determine if, in fact, there are instantaneous changes in miles driven based on certain events or at least try to relate those as quickly as possible. So we feel great that we're in a position to have that early monitoring device, such as the Snapshot devices that we have out there. We still see a fair amount of advertising in the industry. I don't expect that to fall off, but it's, in my belief, becomes harder and harder for those without a great deal of brand recognition to break into the significant consideration sets that we're delighted that were there. And we're going to price as true in the chart of industry-wide premium growth and combined ratio. And you will remember when the industry was running at low 90s and hitting 80s on a regular basis, those days have long since changed. And now that while I recognize everybody has their own goal, I suspect most companies are a lot closer to their acceptable level of combined ratio and some possibly over it. The game gets a lot harder now. The tight road is really there, and a few points, one way or another, is not absorbed by the slack in the combined ratio, and that's likely to be overall a driver of premium growth. And most of this conversation to date has been us talking a little bit about what I think will be a meaningful offset to that overall premium growth driver for our customers and in their ability to at least -- or our new customers to offset that with the driving behavior discounts."

Florida represents a significant chunk of our business, and therefore, it does matter. When those rate changes take place, which are very -- unfortunately, very necessary, they have a delayed effect on future renewals. And a large piece of the retrenchment on PLE, which we are certainly not happy with, is a result of our rate changes -- our necessary rate changes in Florida. We have sort of beaten ourselves up quite appropriately to see if there was anything that we were doing internally. And frankly, there were a few things that we were doing internally that also were destructive to our PLE. A couple of those were more specific to Direct than they were to Agency. So the results are as we report them, but I don't sense any systemic issue or major change between Direct or Agency. And as long as our rate levels remain adequate for, certainly our large states, I would expect to see those stats to reverse themselves and come back to the levels that they were at. That's not a -- anything other than my expectation, but the reason for the decline, primarily, a price shock. A little bit more accentuated in Direct, where we also had some things that we needed to fix with regard to build plans and some what we call onboarding activities, where we bring new customers onboard. Some things that we could do considerably better. All of those are either remediated or very close to remediation."

We offer our opinion and our experience and data where asked. The Senate bill does not do nearly as much as the House bill. And Florida has, since the Third and Fourth District Court ruling, changed a level of understanding of reimbursement for PIP that we thought was well expressed by the legislature in 2008, though now with these court rulings, something other than that, which is causing some degree of disruption. And frankly, we had made some moves to incorporate some language in our policy contract that we think puts us in a relatively better position than many.

Let me try to answer your question, but give you several different points that are valuable. I think it's a little dangerous to jump to most recently reported results and use one explanation for their -- the deltas. I mean, I see the industry results as well as you do. Let me tell you one of the most important things that is happening with Snapshot. First of all, our units that we're shipping in Snapshot continue to increase. We have not seen a plateauing of that. So this is not, as in some cases, we come up and others come up with ideas that seem good, but they don't really hunt. Clearly, Snapshot is something that is definitely commercial grade. There's no question about that in terms of the units that we're shipping, the customers showing interest and the percent of new customers that this is affecting, specifically in Direct, and with the slight climb now in Agency. And I mentioned some of that in my letter. The most important thing to me is that the loss results match with the pricing. Your assessment that, frankly, we are giving relatively large discounts is an important assessment. It is extremely dangerous to give large discounts unless you have a very high certainty that you're matching the true loss costs. So now that we've developed a reasonable track record, and there has been some tuning -- but I would say tuning, not sort of mega-refinement -- to our discount structure, we are becoming very comfortable that we are matching our loss results with the pure -- or the pure premium is being matched, and things look good there. So we will continue. As you will see in some of our other statistics, it is possible that average premiums will decline for a little bit. The issue is are we matching the loss costs with our price. Answer so far, and so far is a reasonably good measure, yes. Are we seeing other things that we hope to get from that? The customers that are coming to us are disproportionately relative to other non-UBI -- and I called UBI here as Snapshot, usage-based insurance. They typically have prior insurance. We are seeing a grouping of customers who typically get higher levels of discounts tend to be -- or tend to have a higher propensity to come from carriers that are, let's just say, the 3 that are larger than us. We will get a higher percentage of those customers in the higher-discount tiers than we might in the lower-discount tiers or in non-usage space. We have now credible data that those who come to us through Snapshot and get a discount are experiencing a meaningful increase in retention. We're not going to give out those specific numbers, but when I say meaningful, it's not 10 basis points. 
We're finding that our advertising that we had -- actually, I'll say we even struggled a little bit in our earliest versions of advertising to try to get people to understand what the Snapshot concept was and the relative ease with which they could install the unit. We've probably had a couple that were not as effective. Two of our more recent commercials have helped with that a great deal, and a lot of the mystery and sort of concern seems to have gone away. A couple other things that I can throw in as -- since Snapshot surely is on people's mind is that the algorithm -- and I tried to reference some of this in my shareholders letter, the algorithm will continually be a work in progress for us. Obviously, we don't change it all the time, but we're always doing R&D to figure out new things. And it is very clear to us that more data, a better ability to analyze it, different uses of the components that we can now measure -- we mentioned some of those at the last IR meeting -- are actually going to contribute to a revised algorithm in the future. And I suspect that, that will continue for quite some time, as we get to use this data in more and more intelligent ways. We've also referenced in the shareholder letter that the intellectual property that we have has been reviewed and upheld at the patent office, including the issuance of a further patent, which is very, very directly describing what we're doing in the marketplace. So we're very thrilled with that. So Snapshot, in general, is working very well, and I'd say it's commercial grade. And loss results have matched with the pricing, and that gives us a great deal of confidence to keep pushing on this."

I'm just trying to think about if that customer is more likely to be a Direct customer, is -- does that mean they're more likely to be somebody who would be attractive to Progressive anyways? I'm just trying to think about that dynamic as we think about the penetration of the product over time."

I think that calls for some speculation, which in this case I'll give you mine, and that's what it is, so... I don't think the customer per se is necessarily someone who has a proclivity for one distribution or another. Most people want to be rated in their insurance for sort of who they are and how their driving behaviors reflect or could reflect in the premium. So I really don't sense that there's a structural reason why somebody would feel differently if they went to an agent versus direct as to their personal comfort with having their insurance rate reflect their driving behavior. I think that's pretty much uniform. Why -- the reason I made the comment I made, and having had a lot of years with agents is recognizing that as small business people, changes come to them. Some stick, some don't stick. I think agents in general -- and actually sort of probably would put myself in this category if I were one of them -- I want to see something get a little bit more of a permanency and a maturity to it before I put that on my customers, knowing that I'm the one that has to go back later and say ""Oh no, it didn't work. The company changed their minds,"" and I have to rewrite or do whatever."" So I think there is a period where agents want to just get a greater confidence that this is something that they can rely on, and that they can offer to their customers with some degree of certainty that it's going to be in place for a period of time. Our ability to do that and use our Direct channel as a leading indicator to test that and prove that proposition is actually terrific, because then we can go back to agents and sort of say ""Hey, look, here's our data. I think you can start to feel a little more confident."" And we're already starting to see -- it's still small, but as I predicted, and I'm happy to give you meaningful updates without necessarily specific percentages as the year develops, but I'll be surprised if we don't see the Agency adoption of this somewhat come up to parallel the Direct adoption simply because it's really a consumer benefit and doesn't have specifics to distributions."

But obviously, Homeowners is now -- from an industry perspective is seeing a ton of pricing pressure. And it doesn't look like this is likely to be a one-year phenomenon, as a lot of folks in the industry feel like the product is structurally underpriced and the CAT experience of last year and late 2010 have probably weighed on that a bit. So I guess my question is, we -- your providers, do you get -- do you feel like what they're likely to do on the rate side is going to be in line with the industry or more or less aggressive? And how do you see their relative rate need or actions affecting the take-up rate for that product for the preferred customer, multiproduct customer?"

However, to a degree I think that they were probably on the lesser side of that, which is nice for them. And they will need to react. That's clearly their decision to make, but they will need to react. And in fact, if we go back to the very first question that was asked about Direct and a little bit of policy life expectancy, there's probably a touch in there where we've seen some rate increases for our PHA that has changed their relationship in auto. So this is not something that is -- not intertwined, but all of our carriers are on top of it. We get nothing from them that suggests that they are any more concerned than any other reasonable homeowners company. And while they're taking some rate need, it looks like in all cases we have open and viable markets. And the good here relative to being able to offer that is far greater than the concern around rate. In fact, I want them to take rate because they're no use to me if they're not viable and profitable in meeting their own standards. And what's probably more important is that, frankly, you're going to see a lot of customers experience changes in their homeowners rates, which is potentially another shock that forces people into the marketplace in general to shop. So while there is some negative on the balance sheet here, there's actually a fair amount of positive from our perspective that we have multiple carriers. They're all open for business. In fact, we've added a couple of carriers, and we'll talk about that later. And our PHA strategy continues for us to be a very viable strategy. It continues to open up more of that preferred customer coming in through Direct and where we can offer it, through agents. Brian already mentioned, they're coming in through the Agency channel as well. And our retention continues to be great. So a long-winded way of saying, yes, they're affected. Yes, they'll take rates. Clearly there's a negative to that. It is important that they do that. They do it in a way that is meaningful for them and keeps them in business. My suspicion is we'll pick up something on the other side of the balance sheet there as other companies need to take rate and perhaps people reevaluate both their auto and homeowners package."

I can't give you a quantification of it, but I would not say Snapshot was the driver of the independent Agency channel growth, which we saw nicely in the fourth quarter. I would suggest to you there that, that is probably more a result of other people's rate actions. And as agents are in the position to sort of see those almost on a daily basis when they hit, that they can change their placement or possibly even renewals. All right? [ph] That's a bigger driver that -- as you know, that is a comparative rating environment. So when there are rate changes, that sort of comes through very quickly, and agents can arbitrage to whichever carrier they think is appropriate as they're representing them. I'm sure they feel good about them, so if you have a rate that's beneficial, you're likely to get some business. I think we're benefiting more from that. With regard to Direct, I don't know think there's any question that -- as I said earlier, when I try to put a few data points out there about Snapshot, our advertising for Snapshot in what we call sort of rivals in work on [ph] Flo, where Flo is actually sort of transposed into individual cars as a metaphor for the Snapshot device, that seems to have worked. Along with a little bit of reality built into our advertising, where we see someone plug the device in and say ""That was pretty easy."" Surprisingly, that would seem easier in retrospect than they do when we're planning, but those clearly suggested to people that Snapshot is something that they should try. How much new business we get from Snapshot versus other advertising is very difficult. And while I could sort of ramble on, I'm not going to sort of say I can measure that specifically. I would say the likelihood of someone coming to Progressive and then showing interest in Snapshot -- just remember, they get a quote and then decide to take the device -- that seems to have been -- as I said, the unit shipment on that continues to go up. We haven't seen the plateau on that, so the level of consumer acceptance is very high. And as we showed in our fourth quarter results, our new prospects seem to be starting to gain some momentum. But I think that's more of a combination of both product, advertising and possibly even rate from other companies or perhaps people getting renewals with an increase."

It's accretive in number of customers. And I'm not being disrespectful in that answer.

So when we offer these discounts, we would not clearly take a book of business and say ""Gee, let's just offer a big discount to it."" That would be bullish. This has to be able to generate more customers, potentially -- and as I indicated earlier, the mix seems to be suggesting more than potential, a set of customers that we might not otherwise have gotten. I believe fully that this is so profound in terms of rating that is offering a level of segmentation that heretofore hasn't really been seen. Perhaps credit was the last thing that even came close to that. And as this gets traction, and we're not talking about just a few people, it will build on itself by reputation. And my suspicion is that the volume, as long as we're priced at our targets -- we have not changed our targets in any way shape or form. We'll accommodate Snapshot or we'll just say ""Hey, we'll subsidize for a while,"" or any of those sort of things. So I wouldn't be looking for change in margin based simply on Snapshot. As I said earlier, you might be looking and use some caution in interpreting average low -- average written premium. So we may have a new business coming on at an average written premium lower than we previously did. That doesn't worry me nearly as much as it would be if we weren't matching loss costs with the premium."

So there is the long-term premium gains. And the pricing segmentation is very important, and we are always trying to price towards actual loss costs. And I think as we get closer and closer to those in terms of having those be reflective of what we believe loss costs will be, and if we can out-segment our competition and have greater pricing accuracy, I think in the long term, we win on that front. The -- and it's just continuing our emphasis on price segmentation, pricing skills, having a low cost strategy.

You ask a very, very, very important question, and one that I am going to answer as best I can for you. And it may be that this is one that requires a little bit more graphical support, so our next meeting might be even a better opportunity to do it. First of all, our existing customers are written under a contract that goes on, so we're not going to all our existing customers and changing their rate. That -- we simply don't have the data to do that. We don't have the driving scores. So when you implement anything, as much as we might like it to be different, when you implement something, you have to draw a line in the sand and say people going forward will be in this contract and get advantage at this price. We have no idea of the driving score of our installed base of customers, and they're not showing any great propensity to reevaluate or come back or whatever. They are free to do that. We do have some endorsement behavior, where someone says -- they see it on television and say, ""I like that."" And of course, we will never withhold that from any customer. But that really is not a big issue. But if you extrapolated that and took a discount across the entire book, then we know what the outcome of that would be. With regard to new customers, we'll keep it relatively simple. And I said in my letter that I was no longer going to give the specific numbers, but let's say x customers come to us and try Snapshot and we offer no discount. X is considerably smaller than y here. Y would be customers that come to us, try Snapshot and get some level of discount. Those customers, we're obviously very happy with. The x customers, if 0 was the right answer, then we're indifferent. We would have sold them the policy at that anyway. But there is a good chance it wasn't 0, it would've been in our estimation plus-z. We understand plus-z. We understand that we have to price this in total to balance out both with the current book and the level of discount we give new customers. So we want to be able to give as much as possible, but we recognize we have a factor that we're not pricing for [ph], and over time, that will balance out. I would tell you that -- a way I've described it, and I don't know that it's worked particular well, but I've described it as D [ph] is important, but it is raining in the ocean, and we can make that up on a relatively small adjustment to the pricing we give across the book or in the discount structure. Hopefully that helps. If not, we will try in a more elaborate way in June."

And obviously, you're all familiar with those kinds of grid and being in the top right, or in this case, is the place where you're growing and have great profitability. I once animated that grid because obviously everything depends on time frames, and it's amazing how few stay in that sector and how many go in and out of that sector. So the one thing I'd say to you is that growth and profitability clearly are an ordered pair. It's not always clear the time frame in which they're ordered. So we believe that we had rates that were appropriately set for most of the year. We did see some favorable development that probably was more than we expected. Nonetheless, we had the discipline to stay with those rates. In the early part of the year, we think shopping behavior was down, and we may not have had quite the conversion rate that we could have had, but that discipline seemed to pay off as we went closer into the fourth quarter and trends, which we think we had priced for, were being realized by others. Across the board, it seems that there is more propensity for rate increases than decreases. And as I mentioned before, it's possibly one of the reasons we're seeing an increase in volume in the fourth quarter. Did I get most of your question?"

Relatively tolerable in bodily injury and a little faster than we've seen for some time in the physical damage and collision coverages. Frequency still tends to be a little bit on the downside. Personally, I get nervous about frequency. That can change quickly. Severity tends to be pretty reasonable and real when you see it. Gas prices might change a few things in the next month or 2. Who knows."

So whether that is reflective of our rates relative to other rates in the marketplace, I suspect so. I don't know all the rate changes that other folks have taken, but as you've seen in the industry, combined ratios have gone up for many carriers. So I suspect it's a combination of our rates relative to others in the marketplace has improved our conversion rate a fair amount, particularly in Direct. And some of the growth in both channels, whereas some of it is a reflection of either rate changes we've taken or competitors' rate changes. Because it's not necessarily every individual state is at these elevated levels. There are some states and subset states that are growing quite nicely."

Those are critically important to a direct business, and I can't stress how important they are. And surprisingly, we're finding things in Australia that we found in 1992 when we started Direct in United States, and they take a long time to be able to go from a standing start to something meaningful. But the premium in Australia is really less than $10 million, so -- and likely not to exceed that in great proportion this year. So we won't really be spending a lot of time talking about something that is not much more than a valuable R&D investment for us at this point in time."

And we took corrective actions, and many of those, which we mentioned in the past, were states that have the personal injury protection coverage, where we saw loss trends accelerating. We took pretty significant corrective actions in all of those states where we effectively raised rates a fair amount and that contributed to lower new application production in early parts of 2011. We then became much more comfortable with our rate level in these large states, including Florida and New York and New Jersey. The one state where we still have some fairly significant concerns in terms of profitability, the state I would mention would be Michigan, where we still have not been able to achieve an underwriting profit. We're still -- we've taken significant corrective actions, but we still may have a ways to go there. But certainly in the interim we have taken lots of rate there and new business production has fallen off as a result. The other state that had been of mention previously was Massachusetts, and we're pleased to report that that is getting -- in 2011, it was very close to being profitable on a calendar year basis for the year, and we feel good about our rate level there and look to be able to see that state growing again. Having said all of that, I would say we always need to stay vigilant in some of these pretty high volatile states. Florida being one of them. New York being another. Michigan will always be on our watch and monitoring lists. The loss trends and the environments tend to be very volatile, and we've seen this not only over the last 3 years, but if you go back 10 years or 15 years, these tend to be very volatile markets, where combined ratios for us in the industry have come up and down. Corrective actions, and so we need to sort of remain vigilant there. As Glenn talked about earlier in the conversation, it's one thing to be growing. It's another thing to be profitable, but having the ordered pair of both profitable growth, it's -- you have work diligently on that. So we feel good about our aggregate rate level. In the last year, our rate change has been relatively modest across the marketplace. Rate change in our last 12 months is something like plus-1% on -- in aggregate. But I'm certain there will be individual states where we'll have to take more corrective actions, but that's part of our discipline and what we try to do each and every day."

I mentioned earlier that physical damage, severity trends are now a little faster than we'd seen for some time, which is okay. We priced to those. They're not sort of so ridiculous that they'll necessarily cause consumers to have major problems, but we're starting to see a little pickup in new car sales and all of that could be good from our perspective. The bodily injury -- the physical damage, as you well know, is not a big driver of reserves, so I'm not too worried about that. We just need to make sure that we get it into pricing at the right level. Bodily injury, which clearly is a big driver of reserves and pricing, seems to be manageable. The one -- and Brian hit it with almost all the states that he mentioned, one that really is always going to be something on top of mind for all carriers and auto is PIP. PIP sometimes has severities that we can sit and we can talk about, and then the real question is ""Well why is this happening?"" And unfortunately, that answer gets a little trickier. In Florida, there is some very real issues in terms of why that's happening right now because of some changes in quote decisions that have promoted a large number of claims that were, we believed, reconcile or sold and paid to be reconsidered, and that is something that the whole industry is facing. That's not a trend that you typically can anticipate or put into your pricing, so I hope we don't see a lot of that.
This year, gas prices might affect a little bit the monitor or the mileage driven. One of the comments that we made in our investor meeting is for us, this is actually trying to be alert to those frequency changes, possibly driven by exogenous events such as gas prices. We now have a very large sample of automobiles running around the United States that we can actually determine if, in fact, there are instantaneous changes in miles driven based on certain events. Or at least try to relate those as quickly as possible. So we feel great that we're in a position to have that early monitoring device, such as the Snapshot devices that we have out there. We still see a fair amount of advertising in the industry. I don't expect that to fall off, but it, in my belief, becomes harder and harder for those without a great deal of brand recognition to break into the significant consideration set. So we're delighted that we're there. And we're going to price as -- I threw in a chart of industry-wide premium growth and combined ratio, and you well remember when the industry was running at low 90s and hitting 80s on a regular basis. Those days have long since changed. And now that -- while I recognize everybody has their own goal, I suspect most companies are a lot closer to their acceptable level of combined ratio, and some possibly over it. The game gets a lot harder now. The tight road is really there, and a few points one way or another is not absorbed by the slack in the combined ratio, and that's likely to be overall a driver of premium growth. And most of this conversation to date has been us talking a little bit about what I think will be a meaningful offset to that overall premium growth driver for our customers, in that their ability to at least -- or our new customers to offset that with driving behavior discounts."

We had taken a significant -- and we talked about this in past calls -- significant rating action in Florida. Now I point out one state, and that -- you might say, ""Well, just one state."" Florida represents a significant chunk of our business, and therefore, it does matter. When those rate changes take place, which are very -- unfortunately, very necessary, they have a delayed effect on future renewals. And a large piece of the retrenchment on PLE, which we are certainly not happy with, is a result of our rate changes -- our necessary rate changes in Florida. We have sort of beaten ourselves up quite appropriately to see if there was anything that we were doing internally. And frankly, there were a few things that we were doing internally that also were destructive to our PLE. A couple of those were more specific to Direct than they were to Agency. So the results are as we report them, but I don't sense any systemic issue or major change between Direct or Agency. And as long as our rate levels remain adequate for, certainly our large states, I would expect to see those stats to reverse themselves and come back to the levels that they were at. That's not a -- anything other than my expectation, but the reason for the decline, primarily, a price shock. A little bit more accentuated in Direct, where we also had some things that we needed to fix with regard to build plans and some what we call onboarding activities, where we bring new customers onboard. Some things that we could do considerably better. All of those are either remediated or very close to remediation."

And Florida has, since the Third and Fourth District Court ruling, changed a level of understanding of reimbursement for PIP that we thought was well expressed by the legislature in 2008, though now with these court rulings, something other than that, which is causing some degree of disruption. And frankly, we had made some moves to incorporate some language in our policy contract that we think puts us in a relatively better position than many.

Let me try to answer your question, but give you several different points that are valuable. I think it's a little dangerous to jump to most recently reported results and use one explanation for their -- the deltas. I mean, I see the industry results as well as you do. Let me tell you one of the most important things that is happening with Snapshot. First of all, our units that we're shipping in Snapshot continue to increase. We have not seen a plateauing of that. So this is not, as in some cases, we come up and others come up with ideas that seem good, but they don't really hunt. Clearly, Snapshot is something that is definitely commercial grade. There's no question about that in terms of the units that we're shipping, the customers showing interest and the percent of new customers that this is affecting, specifically in Direct, and with the slight climb now in Agency. And I mentioned some of that in my letter. The most important thing to me is that the loss results match with the pricing. Your assessment that, frankly, we are giving relatively large discounts is an important assessment. It is extremely dangerous to give large discounts unless you have a very high certainty that you're matching the true loss costs. So now that we've developed a reasonable track record, and there has been some tuning -- but I would say tuning, not sort of mega-refinement -- to our discount structure, we are becoming very comfortable that we are matching our loss results with the pure -- or the pure premium is being matched, and things look good there. So we will continue. As you will see in some of our other statistics, it is possible that average premiums will decline for a little bit. The issue is are we matching the loss costs with our price. Answer so far, and so far is a reasonably good measure, yes. Are we seeing other things that we hope to get from that? The customers that are coming to us are disproportionately relative to other non-UBI -- and I called UBI here as Snapshot, usage-based insurance. They typically have prior insurance. We are seeing a grouping of customers who typically get higher levels of discounts tend to be -- or tend to have a higher propensity to come from carriers that are, let's just say, the 3 that are larger than us. We will get a higher percentage of those customers in the higher-discount tiers than we might in the lower-discount tiers or in non-usage space. We have now credible data that those who come to us through Snapshot and get a discount are experiencing a meaningful increase in retention. We're not going to give out those specific numbers, but when I say meaningful, it's not 10 basis points. 
We're finding that our advertising that we had -- actually, I'll say we even struggled a little bit in our earliest versions of advertising to try to get people to understand what the Snapshot concept was and the relative ease with which they could install the unit. We've probably had a couple that were not as effective. Two of our more recent commercials have helped with that a great deal, and a lot of the mystery and sort of concern seems to have gone away. A couple other things that I can throw in as -- since Snapshot surely is on people's mind is that the algorithm -- and I tried to reference some of this in my shareholders letter, the algorithm will continually be a work in progress for us. Obviously, we don't change it all the time, but we're always doing R&D to figure out new things. And it is very clear to us that more data, a better ability to analyze it, different uses of the components that we can now measure -- we mentioned some of those at the last IR meeting -- are actually going to contribute to a revised algorithm in the future. And I suspect that, that will continue for quite some time, as we get to use this data in more and more intelligent ways. We've also referenced in the shareholder letter that the intellectual property that we have has been reviewed and upheld at the patent office, including the issuance of a further patent, which is very, very directly describing what we're doing in the marketplace. So we're very thrilled with that. So Snapshot, in general, is working very well, and I'd say it's commercial grade. And loss results have matched with the pricing, and that gives us a great deal of confidence to keep pushing on this."

I think that calls for some speculation, which in this case I'll give you mine, and that's what it is, so... I don't think the customer per se is necessarily someone who has a proclivity for one distribution or another. Most people want to be rated in their insurance for sort of who they are and how their driving behaviors reflect or could reflect in the premium. So I really don't sense that there's a structural reason why somebody would feel differently if they went to an agent versus direct as to their personal comfort with having their insurance rate reflect their driving behavior. I think that's pretty much uniform. Why -- the reason I made the comment I made, and having had a lot of years with agents is recognizing that as small business people, changes come to them. Some stick, some don't stick. I think agents in general -- and actually sort of probably would put myself in this category if I were one of them -- I want to see something get a little bit more of a permanency and a maturity to it before I put that on my customers, knowing that I'm the one that has to go back later and say ""Oh no, it didn't work. The company changed their minds,"" and I have to rewrite or do whatever."" So I think there is a period where agents want to just get a greater confidence that this is something that they can rely on, and that they can offer to their customers with some degree of certainty that it's going to be in place for a period of time. Our ability to do that and use our Direct channel as a leading indicator to test that and prove that proposition is actually terrific, because then we can go back to agents and sort of say ""Hey, look, here's our data. I think you can start to feel a little more confident."" And we're already starting to see -- it's still small, but as I predicted, and I'm happy to give you meaningful updates without necessarily specific percentages as the year develops, but I'll be surprised if we don't see the Agency adoption of this somewhat come up to parallel the Direct adoption simply because it's really a consumer benefit and doesn't have specifics to distributions."

But obviously, Homeowners is now -- from an industry perspective is seeing a ton of pricing pressure. And it doesn't look like this is likely to be a one-year phenomenon, as a lot of folks in the industry feel like the product is structurally underpriced and the CAT experience of last year and late 2010 have probably weighed on that a bit. So I guess my question is, we -- your providers, do you get -- do you feel like what they're likely to do on the rate side is going to be in line with the industry or more or less aggressive? And how do you see their relative rate need or actions affecting the take-up rate for that product for the preferred customer, multiproduct customer?"

However, to a degree I think that they were probably on the lesser side of that, which is nice for them. And they will need to react. That's clearly their decision to make, but they will need to react. And in fact, if we go back to the very first question that was asked about Direct and a little bit of policy life expectancy, there's probably a touch in there where we've seen some rate increases for our PHA that has changed their relationship in auto. So this is not something that is -- not intertwined, but all of our carriers are on top of it. We get nothing from them that suggests that they are any more concerned than any other reasonable homeowners company. And while they're taking some rate need, it looks like in all cases we have open and viable markets. And the good here relative to being able to offer that is far greater than the concern around rate. In fact, I want them to take rate because they're no use to me if they're not viable and profitable in meeting their own standards. And what's probably more important is that, frankly, you're going to see a lot of customers experience changes in their homeowners rates, which is potentially another shock that forces people into the marketplace in general to shop. So while there is some negative on the balance sheet here, there's actually a fair amount of positive from our perspective that we have multiple carriers. They're all open for business. In fact, we've added a couple of carriers, and we'll talk about that later. And our PHA strategy continues for us to be a very viable strategy. It continues to open up more of that preferred customer coming in through Direct and where we can offer it, through agents. Brian already mentioned, they're coming in through the Agency channel as well. And our retention continues to be great. So a long-winded way of saying, yes, they're affected. Yes, they'll take rates. Clearly there's a negative to that. It is important that they do that. They do it in a way that is meaningful for them and keeps them in business. My suspicion is we'll pick up something on the other side of the balance sheet there as other companies need to take rate and perhaps people reevaluate both their auto and homeowners package."

I can't give you a quantification of it, but I would not say Snapshot was the driver of the independent Agency channel growth, which we saw nicely in the fourth quarter. I would suggest to you there that, that is probably more a result of other people's rate actions. And as agents are in the position to sort of see those almost on a daily basis when they hit, that they can change their placement or possibly even renewals. All right? [ph] That's a bigger driver that -- as you know, that is a comparative rating environment. So when there are rate changes, that sort of comes through very quickly, and agents can arbitrage to whichever carrier they think is appropriate as they're representing them. I'm sure they feel good about them, so if you have a rate that's beneficial, you're likely to get some business. I think we're benefiting more from that. With regard to Direct, I don't think there's any question that -- as I said earlier, when I try to put a few data points out there about Snapshot, our advertising for Snapshot in what we call sort of rivals in work on [ph] Flo, where Flo is actually sort of transposed into individual cars as a metaphor for the Snapshot device, that seems to have worked. Along with a little bit of reality built into our advertising, where we see someone plug the device in and say ""That was pretty easy."" Surprisingly, that would seem easier in retrospect than they do when we're planning, but those clearly suggested to people that Snapshot is something that they should try. How much new business we get from Snapshot versus other advertising is very difficult. And while I could sort of ramble on, I'm not going to sort of say I can measure that specifically. I would say the likelihood of someone coming to Progressive and then showing interest in Snapshot -- just remember, they get a quote and then decide to take the device -- that seems to have been -- as I said, the unit shipment on that continues to go up. We haven't seen the plateau on that, so the level of consumer acceptance is very high. And as we showed in our fourth quarter results, our new prospects seem to be starting to gain some momentum. But I think that's more of a combination of both product, advertising and possibly even rate from other companies or perhaps people getting renewals with an increase."

So when we offer these discounts, we would not clearly take a book of business and say ""Gee, let's just offer a big discount to it."" That would be bullish. This has to be able to generate more customers, potentially -- and as I indicated earlier, the mix seems to be suggesting more than potential, a set of customers that we might not otherwise have gotten. I believe fully that this is so profound in terms of rating that is offering a level of segmentation that heretofore hasn't really been seen. Perhaps credit was the last thing that even came close to that. And as this gets traction, and we're not talking about just a few people, it will build on itself by reputation. And my suspicion is that the volume, as long as we're priced at our targets -- we have not changed our targets in any way shape or form. We'll accommodate Snapshot or we'll just say ""Hey, we'll subsidize for a while,"" or any of those sort of things. So I wouldn't be looking for change in margin based simply on Snapshot.

So we may have a new business coming on at an average written premium lower than we previously did.

You ask a very, very, very important question, and one that I am going to answer as best I can for you. And it may be that this is one that requires a little bit more graphical support, so our next meeting might be even a better opportunity to do it. First of all, our existing customers are written under a contract that goes on, so we're not going to all our existing customers and changing their rate. That -- we simply don't have the data to do that. We don't have the driving scores. So when you implement anything, as much as we might like it to be different, when you implement something, you have to draw a line in the sand and say people going forward will be in this contract and get advantage at this price. We have no idea of the driving score of our installed base of customers, and they're not showing any great propensity to reevaluate or come back or whatever. They are free to do that. We do have some endorsement behavior, where someone says -- they see it on television and say, ""I like that."" And of course, we will never withhold that from any customer. But that really is not a big issue. But if you extrapolated that and took a discount across the entire book, then we know what the outcome of that would be. With regard to new customers, we'll keep it relatively simple. And I said in my letter that I was no longer going to give the specific numbers, but let's say x customers come to us and try Snapshot and we offer no discount. X is considerably smaller than y here. Y would be customers that come to us, try Snapshot and get some level of discount. Those customers, we're obviously very happy with. The x customers, if 0 was the right answer, then we're indifferent. We would have sold them the policy at that anyway. But there is a good chance it wasn't 0, it would've been in our estimation plus-z. We understand plus-z. We understand that we have to price this in total to balance out both with the current book and the level of discount we give new customers. So we want to be able to give as much as possible, but we recognize we have a factor that we're not pricing for [ph], and over time, that will balance out. I would tell you that -- a way I've described it, and I don't know that it's worked particular well, but I've described it as D [ph] is important, but it is raining in the ocean, and we can make that up on a relatively small adjustment to the pricing we give across the book or in the discount structure. Hopefully that helps. If not, we will try in a more elaborate way in June."

I have a little grid that is put together here -- I see Matt puts it together -- that is sort of growth and profitability. And obviously, you're all familiar with those kinds of grid and being in the top right, or in this case, is the place where you're growing and have great profitability. I once animated that grid because obviously everything depends on time frames, and it's amazing how few stay in that sector and how many go in and out of that sector. So the one thing I'd say to you is that growth and profitability clearly are an ordered pair. It's not always clear the time frame in which they're ordered. So we believe that we had rates that were appropriately set for most of the year. We did see some favorable development that probably was more than we expected. Nonetheless, we had the discipline to stay with those rates. In the early part of the year, we think shopping behavior was down, and we may not have had quite the conversion rate that we could have had, but that discipline seemed to pay off as we went closer into the fourth quarter and trends, which we think we had priced for, were being realized by others. Across the board, it seems that there is more propensity for rate increases than decreases. And as I mentioned before, it's possibly one of the reasons we're seeing an increase in volume in the fourth quarter. Did I get most of your question?"

You would say yes in this case, and we would give you a device i.e. we would give it to you in the mail, and you would follow up within a few days, and you would install it in your vehicle. We would know the moment you install it. And in return, you get to be able to see exactly what data is relevant to you on a website.

And here's the deal we're going to make with you. We'll actually give you that 17% discount for the remaining term of your policy."" We write 6-month policies, and at this stage, you've had a 30-day measurement period and probably a few days of some mail and stuff, so that maybe we're 35 or 40 days into the policy. So we would then give you that discount for the remaining part of your policy. We would continue to observe your driving behavior through the chip that you've installed, and we would require that you keep it installed. And at the end of that policy period, or actually, the required number of days that we offer you a renewal price at the expiration of your policy, we would then tell you, ""Hey, that 17%,"" -- is that what I said? Okay. ""That 17% looks good,"" or we go, ""It wasn't as good as we thought. It's really 15%,"" or maybe, ""It's a little better than we thought. 21%."" Now I'm not being convenient in suggesting that. The fact is it doesn't change very much, so we want people to know that it's not like we're going to give you 17% and then say, ""6 months, so it's really 3%."" We would do that if that's what it said, but that does not seem to be the behavior that we observe, so you would then get a renewal quote that would reflect the longer period of observation that we've made.

One of the things that I'd like --- I'd love to be able to avoid at all cost is shocking our customers, our base of customers with a rate change that is, let's say, greater than 5%. That's a shock generally to consumers, and we did that. Would had to do that. Others are doing it, and perhaps they're doing it a little bit even as we speak. I don't expect but can't eliminate the possibility that we have other changes that we need to make. And as we start to measure our PLE for customers that are now renewing or renewing into the new rate revisions that they've come in through, we should expect to see that policy life expectancy grow. And obviously, in the state of Florida, our average premiums will grow because we've taken rate. We also see overall a little bit of an increase in severities across the board. I don't think that's new. Most companies are probably seeing much the same thing. Relatively tolerable in bodily injury and a little faster than we've seen for some time in the physical damage and collision coverages. Frequency still tends to be a little bit on the downside.

I don't know all the rate changes that other folks have taken, but as you've seen in the industry, combined ratios have gone up for many carriers. So I suspect it's a combination of our rates relative to others in the marketplace has improved our conversion rate a fair amount, particularly in Direct. And some of the growth in both channels, whereas some of it is a reflection of either rate changes we've taken or competitors' rate changes. Because it's not necessarily every individual state is at these elevated levels. There are some states and subset states that are growing quite nicely."

And we took corrective actions, and many of those, which we mentioned in the past, were states that have the personal injury protection coverage, where we saw loss trends accelerating. We took pretty significant corrective actions in all of those states where we effectively raised rates a fair amount and that contributed to lower new application production in early parts of 2011. We then became much more comfortable with our rate level in these large states, including Florida and New York and New Jersey. The one state where we still have some fairly significant concerns in terms of profitability, the state I would mention would be Michigan, where we still have not been able to achieve an underwriting profit. We're still -- we've taken significant corrective actions, but we still may have a ways to go there. But certainly in the interim we have taken lots of rate there and new business production has fallen off as a result. The other state that had been of mention previously was Massachusetts, and we're pleased to report that that is getting -- in 2011, it was very close to being profitable on a calendar year basis for the year, and we feel good about our rate level there and look to be able to see that state growing again. Having said all of that, I would say we always need to stay vigilant in some of these pretty high volatile states. Florida being one of them. New York being another. Michigan will always be on our watch and monitoring lists. The loss trends and the environments tend to be very volatile, and we've seen this not only over the last 3 years, but if you go back 10 years or 15 years, these tend to be very volatile markets, where combined ratios for us in the industry have come up and down. Corrective actions, and so we need to sort of remain vigilant there. As Glenn talked about earlier in the conversation, it's one thing to be growing. It's another thing to be profitable, but having the ordered pair of both profitable growth, it's -- you have work diligently on that. So we feel good about our aggregate rate level. In the last year, our rate change has been relatively modest across the marketplace. Rate change in our last 12 months is something like plus-1% on -- in aggregate. But I'm certain there will be individual states where we'll have to take more corrective actions, but that's part of our discipline and what we try to do each and every day."

I mentioned earlier that physical damage, severity trends are now a little faster than we'd seen for some time, which is okay. We priced to those. They're not sort of so ridiculous that they'll necessarily cause consumers to have major problems, but we're starting to see a little pickup in new car sales and all of that could be good from our perspective. The bodily injury -- the physical damage, as you well know, is not a big driver of reserves, so I'm not too worried about that. We just need to make sure that we get it into pricing at the right level. Bodily injury, which clearly is a big driver of reserves and pricing, seems to be manageable. The one -- and Brian hit it with almost all the states that he mentioned, one that really is always going to be something on top of mind for all carriers and auto is PIP. PIP sometimes has severities that we can sit and we can talk about, and then the real question is ""Well why is this happening?"" And unfortunately, that answer gets a little trickier. In Florida, there is some very real issues in terms of why that's happening right now because of some changes in quote decisions that have promoted a large number of claims that were, we believed, reconcile or sold and paid to be reconsidered, and that is something that the whole industry is facing. That's not a trend that you typically can anticipate or put into your pricing, so I hope we don't see a lot of that.
This year, gas prices might affect a little bit the monitor or the mileage driven. One of the comments that we made in our investor meeting is for us, this is actually trying to be alert to those frequency changes, possibly driven by exogenous events such as gas prices. We now have a very large sample of automobiles running around the United States that we can actually determine if, in fact, there are instantaneous changes in miles driven based on certain events. Or at least try to relate those as quickly as possible. So we feel great that we're in a position to have that early monitoring device, such as the Snapshot devices that we have out there. We still see a fair amount of advertising in the industry. I don't expect that to fall off, but it, in my belief, becomes harder and harder for those without a great deal of brand recognition to break into the significant consideration set. So we're delighted that we're there. And we're going to price as -- I threw in a chart of industry-wide premium growth and combined ratio, and you well remember when the industry was running at low 90s and hitting 80s on a regular basis. Those days have long since changed. And now that -- while I recognize everybody has their own goal, I suspect most companies are a lot closer to their acceptable level of combined ratio, and some possibly over it. The game gets a lot harder now. The tight road is really there, and a few points one way or another is not absorbed by the slack in the combined ratio, and that's likely to be overall a driver of premium growth. And most of this conversation to date has been us talking a little bit about what I think will be a meaningful offset to that overall premium growth driver for our customers, in that their ability to at least -- or our new customers to offset that with driving behavior discounts."

And frankly, I just think out and look at the numbers and do the taking and I don't need to side step in any way, shape or form. The fact is the if rates come up, conversions likely comes down to some degree. Retention gets some pressure on it. I think the key thing to remember, however, when we discuss rates -- and hopefully I've discuss that in a fairly open and the right way, is rate increases, always depends from when you're coming. So we have a very competitive position in the marketplace. Even our rate increase may not necessarily take out of effect the competitive position in certain circumstances. And we have other tools that allow people to actually manage their rate even at renewal of the . So it's a really tough thing to sort of speculate on. Clearly, we work so hard, as you will know, on retention and we don't want to lose that. But if you have to put down a bit, when you take rates up, generally you're going to be fighting against conversion and retention. We hope rate, even though as I've expressed disappointment and that's the way I am and we have a target and we don't hit it, we call it that. we call rate change from what I would call sort of lower single digits severity changes to mid-single-digit reasonably quickly, reasonably quickly, not as quickly as I would have liked. And hopefully, those lead changes are not the kind of rate changes that force consumers to say, What really is going on here? And while this may not be able to jog consumers' memories for a long time, it actually has some in that rate levels for quite some time now. So maybe 2%, 3%, 4% changes, whatever they might see, something that want to follow and recognize the cost of doing business."

Now I say, that's enough across the board right now. Six-month policies for almost of all of our order of business  12 months for special lines, 12 months for commercial. So answer has have changed a little bit based on what we're talking about. Your assessments of rate need and rate changes is fairly accurate. We've got in the last month, about 18 rate changes put through just in July. We had another several in June even since we spoke to you. But everyday matters and everyday, you get that opportunity to renew new customers into that rate level. But you can take the expected value of 3 months from the level of the day of rate change to get to the half of your renewal book at the new level. In 6 months, we get it fully at that level. We are obviously pricing to a feature trend date, so we want to get on the trajectory where our rates and our cost of business are in sync. What you should probably look for rather than significant explanations, one advantage we have here, we should get to see the monthly results. So while we have hit the last couple of months points that none of the us are happy with, those actions that we've taken as I said, these are not ones that would cause great distress. I don't like it, but I know -- we know how to fix it as a company, and start looking to see that decline. When we talk on these calls, it's always at a very aggregate level. Frankly, it's all state-by-state issue, but the aggregate probably is a fair representation of the overall state. So I would say start looking for as months come through and monthly reporting should be able to give you some indication of that. And hopefully, we get back to a point where our rate level and future increases are in direct line with our cost as best as we can do it. Brian, you have any points that I must have missed their?"

So when we're doing what's called an indication, we have our target loss ratio and we'll always take rate both at the time. And while I'm not going into it, we have other ways of continue to take rate. So my preference is to continue to take small bites. And very seldom do you ever read get rate perfectly correct on one adjustment. What is in my mind a strength of Progressive is our ability to continue to take small adjustments. So I don't want anyone to think that this is just a onetime, we're taking rate. We have been taking rate for a long time. We now realize we just need to take more rate, and we've made that adjustment and we're making a good number of adjustments at one time. But this will not be making adjustments, and so that we'll continue to monitor. We'll continue to track every we have. And while we can't always explain why severity isn't going up or changing, we certainly observe it. And you have an update it to observe it in a way that we believe is credible. Some things that we clearly watch, I mean I get the question a lot of, What's driving the severities? I would tell you that at least we observed increasing utilization of emergency room facilities, we see increased utilization of procedures, we actually see increasing unit cost and the.

We come into the first quarter of 2012, we had a significant dip down in physical damage frequency. We probably really should be closer to a trend line that reflects more 2010 frequency. So here, we have a little bit of a depressed frequency environment. It's real, but it may not be sort of a good indicator of the future.

Or whether we ought to be using the paid severity measures or what the implied severity change was for accident year 2011 that you guys have effectively disclosed? And in line with that, I think the question that is, what is that as you sort of a go-forward view severity that's reasonable and not distorted by reserve changes, what is that -- what on a pure premium basis does this look like that you guys actually need in terms of rate?

I would try to at least take pieces. And Glenn, feel free or Al, feel free to chime in. The best measure for severity, I believe over time, is your own assessment of accident year severity change year-over-year. Unfortunately at any given point in time, you don't know what that is because they developed over time. So that's why we record both incurred. And I want to let people know that the paid is slightly lower. Now paid can be influenced by a lot of things, your closure rate, how you're closing more simple claims earlier or later versus previous years. So there are pitfalls and all of those. The other thing, suffice it to say, that we believe severity have increased versus what we had seen particularly in the previous couple of years where our severities for bodily injury coverage and so the other coverages had been fairly modest, low-single digits, low-single digits. And in fact, last year, we would have said 2011 end of last year, we thought bodily injuries severities were relatively flat. And we found out that as things have developed that we are little bit short in that, end that's how we unfavorable reserve development. So we increase our severity estimates for 2011 accident year about 2% from where we thought at the end of the year. As we project future severities, that's a select. If we had a crystal ball to our future severities are, we -- it would be great. We have increased our select for future severities. I would not go all the way up to the 6% incurred severity that we are recording right now. The other thing I would just say relative to frequency, for certain, we have started to increase frequency. In bodily injury, we've seen it for the past couple of quarters. Property damage and PIP us more second quarter related. was 1% in the second quarter. Frequencies now in 2012 are comparable to what they were in 2010 or 2 years ago. Last year, we have negative decreases in frequency. So it's not as if frequency is way out of control. They are now closer to what they were 2 years ago. And some of the things last year that may have affected frequency were gas prices and the like. The reality of it is for us and industry in the first quarter, collision frequency was down significantly. Actually, i was down like 10% in the first quarter. I think something like 5% for the industry. And that clearly, I believe, is attributable to very mild weather in Northeast Midwest and sort of onetime event, but nothing that will be expected long term. So on frequency front, I would say our frequencies are comparable to a couple of years ago, so not overly concerned about that. One that we will continue to watch more as BI frequency going up a little bit faster. And then on the severity front, we've increased future selects but to project and say, Hey, we think the number is 6, I think that will be on the high end. They will be less than that."

And all of the matrices have a pretty penalty function for being over targets, and the function gets greater as a get further and further over targets. So it's slightly over target, there is a function. But as you get further and further away from target, the function is pretty severe. So I think those in particular who have the responsibility of setting prices and ensuring rate adequacy are cognizant of that. And it's one of the drivers of what you saw in June the numbers come down fairly significantly from, I believe it is 1 4 2 at the end of May and moved down to 1.29 at the end of June, and that combined ratio of 101 won't -- doesn't sit well in any matrics.

And frankly, I think we just have to let the numbers do the talking. And I don't mean to sidestep it in any way, shape or form. The fact is if you take rates come up, conversion likely comes down to some degree. Retention gets some pressure on it. I think the key thing to remember, however, when we discuss rates -- and hopefully, I've discussed that in a fairly open and forthright way, is rate increases -- it always depends from when you're coming. So we have a very competitive position in the marketplace. Even a rate increase may not necessarily take us out of that competitive position in certain circumstances. And we have other tools that allow people to actually manage their rate, even at renewal, if they choose to. So it's a really a tough thing to sort of speculate on. Clearly, we've worked so hard, as you all know, on retention, and we don't want to lose that. But if you had to put down a bet when you take rates up, generally, you're going to be fighting against conversion and retention. We hope rate, even though I've expressed disappointment -- and that's the way I am. I'm just -- we have a target, and we don't hit it, we call it that. We have caught rate change from what I would call sort of lower single-digit severity changes to mid single-digit reasonably quickly, reasonably quickly, not as quickly as I would have liked. And hopefully, those rate changes are not the kind of rate changes that force consumers to say, ""What really is going on here?"" And while this may not be able to jog consumers' memories for a long time, it actually had some rate levels for quite some time now. So maybe 2%, 3%, 4% changes, whatever they might see, are something that they are perfectly wanting to tolerate and recognize that's cost of doing business."

As I tried to point out in the accompanying  letter, we have 6-month policies. And I'd say that's enough to get it across the board right now, six-month policies for almost all of our order business, 12-month for special lines, 12-month for commercial. So the answer has changed a little bit based on what we're talking about. Your assessments of rate need and rate changes is fairly accurate. We've got, in the last month, about 18 rate changes put through just in July. We had another several in June even since we spoke to you. But every day matters, and every day, you get that opportunity to renew new customers into that rate level. But you can take an expected value of 3 months from the level of the day of rate change to get sort of half of your renewal book at the new level. In 6 months, we get it fully at that level. We obviously are pricing to a future trend date, so we want to get on a trajectory where our rates and our cost of business are in sync. What you should probably look for rather than significant explanations, one advantage we have here, we should get to see the monthly results. So while we have hit a -- last couple of months, points that none of us are happy with, those actions that we have taken, as I've said, these are not ones that are causing a great distress. I don't like it, but I know how -- we know how to fix it as a company and start looking to see that decline. When we talk on these calls, it's always in a very aggregate level. Frankly, it's all a state-by-state issue, but the aggregate probably is a fair representation of the overall state. So I would say start looking for it as the months come through, and monthly reporting should be able to give you some indication of that. And hopefully, we get back to a point where our rate level and future increases are in direct line with our cost as best as we can do it. Brian, do you have any points that I must have missed there?"

And some of our historical loss cost, particularly severity, were higher than what we had anticipated, so we're playing a little catch-up there, and then some of it will be a function of whether our future loss is constant.

And while I'm not going to go into it, we have other ways of continuing to take rate. So my preference is to continue to take small bites, and very seldom do you ever get rate perfectly correct on one adjustment.

And we're making a good number of adjustments at one time, but this will not be making adjustment and sit back. We'll continue to monitor. We'll continue to track every cost that we have. And while we can't always explain why severities are going up or changing, we certainly observe it. And we have enough data to observe it in a way that we believe is credible. Some things that we clearly watch -- I mean, I get the question a lot of what's driving the severities. I would tell you that at least, we observe increasing utilization of emergency room facilities. We see increased utilization of radiological procedures. We actually see increasing unit costing of both of those. Always hard to say exactly how much they contribute, and almost every area of partial contribution is -- probably has some weight. I think you know the story on the used car marketplace, the used car market prices relative to the physical damage side of the business. But we expect to stay ahead of trend and get our margins back to exactly where you've always said, 96 or better."

Let me try to get to that but also give you a sense of -- I'm talking frequency for a second, and I'll get to your severity issue. 2011 was probably a lower frequency run rate than what we believe is sustainable. We come into the first quarter of 2012, we had a significant dip down in physical damage frequency. We probably really should be closer to a trend line that reflects more 2010 frequency. So here we have a little bit of a depressed frequency environment. It's real, but it may not be sort of a good indicator of the future. We're also starting to observe severities, as I put it in the first quarter letter, certainly going up, not quite what we're seeing now. So there was no need right at that time to overreact. And overreactions, obviously, we lose some momentum in the marketplace. So the key is to try to time without ever sort of going over.

And in line with that, I think the question then is what does -- if you add sort of a go-forward view of severity that's reasonable and not distorted by reserve changes, what does that -- what, on a sort of pure premium basis, does this look like that you guys actually need in terms of rate? And is it -- because if you simplistically do this, you'd add up 6% times the larger numbers for positive frequency changes.

I will try to at least take pieces, and Glenn, feel free -- or Al, feel free to chime in. The best measure for severity, I believe, over time, is your own assessment of the accident year severity change over change -- year-over-year. Unfortunately, at any given point in time, you don't know what that is, because they develop over time. So that's why we record both incurred, and I want to let people know that the paid is slightly lower. Now paid can be influenced by a lot of things, your closure rate, how you're closing more simple claims earlier or later versus previous years. So there are pitfalls in all of those. The other thing, suffice it to say, is that we believe severities have increased versus what we had seen, particularly in the previous couple of years, where our severities for bodily injury coverage and some of the other coverages had been fairly modest low-single digits, low-single digits. And in fact, last year, we have said 2011, at the end of last year, we thought bodily injuries severities are relatively flat. And we found out and as things have developed that we were a little bit short in that, and that's on the unfavorable reserve development. So we've increased our severity estimate for 2011 accident year about 2% from where we thought at the end of the year. As we project future severities, that's a select. If we had a crystal ball as to what future severities are, we -- it would be great. We have increased our select for future severities. I would not go all the way up to the 6% incurred severity that we are recording right now. The other thing I would just say relative to frequency, for certain, we have started to see an increase in frequency. In bodily injury, we've seen it for the past couple of quarters. Property damage and PIP is more second quarter related. Collision was 1% in the second quarter. Frequencies now in 2012 are comparable to what they were in 2010 or 2 years ago. Last year, we had negative decreases in frequency. So it's not as if frequency is way out of control. They are now closer to what they were 2 years ago, and some of the things last year that may have affected frequency were gas prices and the like. The reality of it is for us and the industry, in the first quarter, collision frequency was down significantly. Ours was down like 10% in the first quarter. I think NAI data would say something like 5% for the industry. And that clearly, I believe, is attributable to very mild weather in Northeast Midwest and sort of a onetime event but nothing that would be expected long term. So on the frequency front, I would say our frequencies are comparable to a couple of years ago, so not overly concerned about that. One that we will continue to watch more is that BI frequency seems to be going up a little bit faster. And then on the severity front, we've increased future selects. But to project and say, ""Hey, we think the number is 6%,"" I think that would be on the high end. It'll be less than that."

That's not -- they're not all there, but think of them as more in that range. So at it relates to what percentage of the country have we covered to get to this 2% or 3% that we've taken in the last couple of months, most of the rate changes are most mid-single digits, and that is much more our preferred approach. We don't want to get into positions where we have to take plus 10s, because that will definitely adversely affect retention rates and the like. So our preferred approach is to take consistent amount of rate changes when we need to. So think of the average rate changes in the mid-single digits for most states where we've taken rate changes. And in terms of the monthly rate factor, it is not a significant amount of the rate change taken. But it is an increasing portion, because I think some of the experience has proven that that is a good methodology of continued take rate over time. So we've implemented it in a few more states and then in some states, increased that percentage. But in terms of the overall rate change, I would not say that is a big portion of the 5% rate change through current period or 7% at the end of the year."

As it relates to that first question about how does it react to combined ratios over target. And keep in mind, and I've mentioned this before, the gain share, Florida, as you see, is actually in aggregate of 5 component pieces. So there's 2 for direct auto and 1 for each of the agency auto, specialized and commercial auto. And as they're constructed -- they are constructed relative to growth and profit tradeoffs. And all of the matrices have a pretty penalty function for being over target, and the penalty function gets greater as you get further and further over target. So being slightly over target, there is a penalty function that's not as steep. But as you get further and further away from target, the penalty function is pretty severe. So I think those in particular who have the responsibility of setting prices and ensuring rate adequacy are very cognizant of that. And it is one of the drivers of what you saw in June. The number had come down fairly significantly from I believe it was 1.42 at the end of May and moved down to 1.29 at the end of June, and that combined ratio of 101 won't -- doesn't sit well in any matrix. So that was the primary driver of it going down. And yes, there are penalty functions of being over target, and they're pretty severe, particularly as you go further and further over target. We do try to reward and incent growth too, because we want to grow, but we only want to grow at or better than target."

So while we've been very attractive, we're going to take our rates up. It's even hard for me to answer the question. I just have to wait and see what that means. In an individual situation, every agency has different levels of carriers, different numbers of carriers, different combinations of carriers. I would expect our competitiveness to go down just because that's sort of a pretty clear statement. You take rates up, your competitive goes down. What I can't really know is how to calibrate that even in a constant situation, if no one takes rate changes and secondarily, if I will just take rate changes.

So -- but I don't want to suggest that we won't see any more unfavorable development. There may be. But you see it each month in the last 2 months, it's been much more modest than what we sort of saw the first 4 months. The actuarial changes, actually, from a reserve actuarial perspective, which we look at by segment by segment, state by state and we have a schedule for that, where almost all the large segments are reviewed at least quarterly, we have at least about -- last month, in June, took a more significant increase than we have recently.

And frankly, I think we just have to let the numbers do the talking. And I don't mean to sidestep it in any way, shape or form. The fact is if you take rates come up, conversion likely comes down to some degree. Retention gets some pressure on it. I think the key thing to remember, however, when we discuss rates -- and hopefully, I've discussed that in a fairly open and forthright way, is rate increases -- it always depends from when you're coming. So we have a very competitive position in the marketplace. Even a rate increase may not necessarily take us out of that competitive position in certain circumstances. And we have other tools that allow people to actually manage their rate, even at renewal, if they choose to. So it's a really a tough thing to sort of speculate on. Clearly, we've worked so hard, as you all know, on retention, and we don't want to lose that. But if you had to put down a bet when you take rates up, generally, you're going to be fighting against conversion and retention. We hope rate, even though I've expressed disappointment -- and that's the way I am. I'm just -- we have a target, and we don't hit it, we call it that. We have caught rate change from what I would call sort of lower single-digit severity changes to mid single-digit reasonably quickly, reasonably quickly, not as quickly as I would have liked. And hopefully, those rate changes are not the kind of rate changes that force consumers to say, ""What really is going on here?"" And while this may not be able to jog consumers' memories for a long time, it actually had some really inert rate levels for quite some time now. So maybe 2%, 3%, 4% changes, whatever they might see, are something that they are perfectly wanting to tolerate and recognize that's cost of doing business."

As I tried to point out in the accompanying  letter, we have 6-month policies. And I'd say that's enough to get it across the board right now, six-month policies for almost all of our order business, 12-month for special lines, 12-month for commercial. So the answer has changed a little bit based on what we're talking about. Your assessments of rate need and rate changes is fairly accurate. We've got, in the last month, about 18 rate changes put through just in July. We had another several in June even since we spoke to you. But every day matters, and every day, you get that opportunity to renew new customers into that rate level. But you can take an expected value of 3 months from the level of the day of rate change to get sort of half of your renewal book at the new level. In 6 months, we get it fully at that level. We obviously are pricing to a future trend date, so we want to get on a trajectory where our rates and our cost of business are in sync. What you should probably look for rather than significant explanations, one advantage we have here, we should get to see the monthly results. So while we have hit a -- last couple of months, points that none of us are happy with, those actions that we have taken, as I've said, these are not ones that are causing a great distress. I don't like it, but I know how -- we know how to fix it as a company and start looking to see that decline. When we talk on these calls, it's always in a very aggregate level. Frankly, it's all a state-by-state issue, but the aggregate probably is a fair representation of the overall state. So I would say start looking for it as the months come through, and monthly reporting should be able to give you some indication of that. And hopefully, we get back to a point where our rate level and future increases are in direct line with our cost as best as we can do it. Brian, do you have any points that I must have missed there?"

No, clearly, we price to include our margins. So when we're doing what's called an indication, we have our target loss ratio, and we'll always take rate both at the time. And while I'm not going to go into it, we have other ways of continuing to take rate. So my preference is to continue to take small bites, and very seldom do you ever get rate perfectly correct on one adjustment. What is, in my mind, a strength of Progressive is our ability to continue to take small adjustments. So I don't want anyone to think that this is just a onetime we're taking rate. We have been taking rate for a long time. We now realize we just need to take more rate, and we've made that adjustment. And we're making a good number of adjustments at one time, but this will not be making adjustment and sit back. We'll continue to monitor. We'll continue to track every cost that we have. And while we can't always explain why severities are going up or changing, we certainly observe it. And we have enough data to observe it in a way that we believe is credible. Some things that we clearly watch -- I mean, I get the question a lot of what's driving the severities. I would tell you that at least, we observe increasing utilization of emergency room facilities. We see increased utilization of radiological procedures. We actually see increasing unit costing of both of those. Always hard to say exactly how much they contribute, and almost every area of partial contribution is -- probably has some weight. I think you know the story on the used car marketplace, the used car market prices relative to the physical damage side of the business. But we expect to stay ahead of trend and get our margins back to exactly where you've always said, 96 or better."

Let me try to get to that but also give you a sense of -- I'm talking frequency for a second, and I'll get to your severity issue. 2011 was probably a lower frequency run rate than what we believe is sustainable. We come into the first quarter of 2012, we had a significant dip down in physical damage frequency. We probably really should be closer to a trend line that reflects more 2010 frequency. So here we have a little bit of a depressed frequency environment. It's real, but it may not be sort of a good indicator of the future. We're also starting to observe severities, as I put it in the first quarter letter, certainly going up, not quite what we're seeing now. So there was no need right at that time to overreact. And overreactions, obviously, we lose some momentum in the marketplace. So the key is to try to time without ever sort of going over.

It's claims that we believe were closed and settled appropriately are now coming back to us and in some cases, getting additional payment on those claims, driving an increase in severity."

And I -- maybe we'd just sort of start with clarifying something. I think, Brian, you raised this this morning, I think, and it sort of helps illustrate something that I know investors are sort of confused around, which is with the headline 6% severity number, whether that's a reasonable proxy for projecting future severity or whether we ought to be using the paid severity measures or what the implied severity change was say for accident year 2011 that you guys have effectively disclosed. And in line with that, I think the question then is what does -- if you add sort of a go-forward view of severity that's reasonable and not distorted by reserve changes, what does that -- what, on a sort of pure premium basis, does this look like that you guys actually need in terms of rate? And is it -- because if you simplistically do this, you'd add up 6% times the larger numbers for positive frequency changes. And you'd say that your guys' rate changes are well below the rate need that actually -- this sort of simplistic loss trend that you'd be seeing."

I will try to at least take pieces, and Glenn, feel free -- or Al, feel free to chime in. The best measure for severity, I believe, over time, is your own assessment of the accident year severity change over change -- year-over-year. Unfortunately, at any given point in time, you don't know what that is, because they develop over time. So that's why we record both incurred, and I want to let people know that the paid is slightly lower. Now paid can be influenced by a lot of things, your closure rate, how you're closing more simple claims earlier or later versus previous years. So there are pitfalls in all of those. The other thing, suffice it to say, is that we believe severities have increased versus what we had seen, particularly in the previous couple of years, where our severities for bodily injury coverage and some of the other coverages had been fairly modest low-single digits, low-single digits. And in fact, last year, we have said 2011, at the end of last year, we thought bodily injuries severities are relatively flat. And we found out and as things have developed that we were a little bit short in that, and that's on the unfavorable reserve development. So we've increased our severity estimate for 2011 accident year about 2% from where we thought at the end of the year. As we project future severities, that's a select. If we had a crystal ball as to what future severities are, we -- it would be great. We have increased our select for future severities. I would not go all the way up to the 6% incurred severity that we are recording right now. The other thing I would just say relative to frequency, for certain, we have started to see an increase in frequency. In bodily injury, we've seen it for the past couple of quarters. Property damage and PIP is more second quarter related. Collision was 1% in the second quarter. Frequencies now in 2012 are comparable to what they were in 2010 or 2 years ago. Last year, we had negative decreases in frequency. So it's not as if frequency is way out of control. They are now closer to what they were 2 years ago, and some of the things last year that may have affected frequency were gas prices and the like. The reality of it is for us and the industry, in the first quarter, collision frequency was down significantly. Ours was down like 10% in the first quarter. I think NAI data would say something like 5% for the industry. And that clearly, I believe, is attributable to very mild weather in Northeast Midwest and sort of a onetime event but nothing that would be expected long term. So on the frequency front, I would say our frequencies are comparable to a couple of years ago, so not overly concerned about that. One that we will continue to watch more is that BI frequency seems to be going up a little bit faster. And then on the severity front, we've increased future selects. But to project and say, ""Hey, we think the number is 6%,"" I think that would be on the high end. It'll be less than that."

That's not -- they're not all there, but think of them as more in that range.

We don't want to get into positions where we have to take plus 10s, because that will definitely adversely affect retention rates and the like. So our preferred approach is to take consistent amount of rate changes when we need to. So think of the average rate changes in the mid-single digits for most states where we've taken rate changes. And in terms of the monthly rate factor, it is not a significant amount of the rate change taken. But it is an increasing portion, because I think some of the experience has proven that that is a good methodology of continued take rate over time. So we've implemented it in a few more states and then in some states, increased that percentage. But in terms of the overall rate change, I would not say that is a big portion of the 5% rate change through current period or 7% at the end of the year."

As it relates to that first question about how does it react to combined ratios over target.

So there's 2 for direct auto and 1 for each of the agency auto, specialized and commercial auto. And as they're constructed -- they are constructed relative to growth and profit tradeoffs. And all of the matrices have a pretty big penalty function for being over target, and the penalty function gets greater as you get further and further over target. So being slightly over target, there is a penalty function that's not as steep. But as you get further and further away from target, the penalty function is pretty severe. So I think those in particular who have the responsibility of setting prices and ensuring rate accuracy are very cognizant of that. And it is one of the drivers of what you saw in June. The number had come down fairly significantly from I believe it was 1.42 at the end of May and moved down to 1.29 at the end of June, and that combined ratio of 101 won't -- doesn't sit well in any matrix. So that was the primary driver of it going down. And yes, there are penalty functions of being over target, and they're pretty severe, particularly as you go further and further over target. We do try to reward and incent growth too, because we want to grow, but we only want to grow at or better than target."

In an individual situation, every agency has different levels of carriers, different numbers of carriers, different combinations of carriers. I would expect our competitiveness to go down just because that's sort of a pretty clear statement. You take rates up, your competitive goes down.

And frankly, I think we just have to let the numbers do the talking. And I don't mean to sidestep it in any way, shape or form. The fact is if you take rates come up, conversion likely comes down to some degree. Retention gets some pressure on it. I think the key thing to remember, however, when we discuss rates -- and hopefully, I've discussed that in a fairly open and forthright way, is rate increases -- it always depends from when you're coming. So we have a very competitive position in the marketplace. Even a rate increase may not necessarily take us out of that competitive position in certain circumstances. And we have other tools that allow people to actually manage their rate, even at renewal, if they choose to. So it's a really a tough thing to sort of speculate on. Clearly, we've worked so hard, as you all know, on retention, and we don't want to lose that. But if you had to put down a bet when you take rates up, generally, you're going to be fighting against conversion and retention. We hope rate, even though I've expressed disappointment -- and that's the way I am. I'm just -- we have a target, and we don't hit it, we call it that. We have caught rate change from what I would call sort of lower single-digit severity changes to mid single-digit reasonably quickly, reasonably quickly, not as quickly as I would have liked. And hopefully, those rate changes are not the kind of rate changes that force consumers to say, ""What really is going on here?"" And while this may not be able to jog consumers' memories for a long time, it actually had some really inert rate levels for quite some time now. So maybe 2%, 3%, 4% changes, whatever they might see, are something that they are perfectly wanting to tolerate and recognize that's cost of doing business."

As I tried to point out in the accompanying  letter, we have 6-month policies. And I'd say that's enough to get it across the board right now, six-month policies for almost all of our order business, 12-month for special lines, 12-month for commercial. So the answer has changed a little bit based on what we're talking about. Your assessments of rate need and rate changes is fairly accurate. We've got, in the last month, about 18 rate changes put through just in July. We had another several in June even since we spoke to you. But every day matters, and every day, you get that opportunity to renew new customers into that rate level. But you can take an expected value of 3 months from the level of the day of rate change to get sort of half of your renewal book at the new level. In 6 months, we get it fully at that level. We obviously are pricing to a future trend date, so we want to get on a trajectory where our rates and our cost of business are in sync. What you should probably look for rather than significant explanations, one advantage we have here, we should get to see the monthly results. So while we have hit a -- last couple of months, points that none of us are happy with, those actions that we have taken, as I've said, these are not ones that are causing a great distress. I don't like it, but I know how -- we know how to fix it as a company and start looking to see that decline. When we talk on these calls, it's always in a very aggregate level. Frankly, it's all a state-by-state issue, but the aggregate probably is a fair representation of the overall state. So I would say start looking for it as the months come through, and monthly reporting should be able to give you some indication of that. And hopefully, we get back to a point where our rate level and future increases are in direct line with our cost as best as we can do it. Brian, do you have any points that I must have missed there?"

No, clearly, we price to include our margins. So when we're doing what's called an indication, we have our target loss ratio, and we'll always take rate both at the time. And while I'm not going to go into it, we have other ways of continuing to take rate. So my preference is to continue to take small bites, and very seldom do you ever get rate perfectly correct on one adjustment. What is, in my mind, a strength of Progressive is our ability to continue to take small adjustments. So I don't want anyone to think that this is just a onetime we're taking rate. We have been taking rate for a long time. We now realize we just need to take more rate, and we've made that adjustment. And we're making a good number of adjustments at one time, but this will not be making adjustment and sit back. We'll continue to monitor. We'll continue to track every cost that we have. And while we can't always explain why severities are going up or changing, we certainly observe it. And we have enough data to observe it in a way that we believe is credible. Some things that we clearly watch -- I mean, I get the question a lot of what's driving the severities. I would tell you that at least, we observe increasing utilization of emergency room facilities. We see increased utilization of radiological procedures. We actually see increasing unit costing of both of those. Always hard to say exactly how much they contribute, and almost every area of partial contribution is -- probably has some weight. I think you know the story on the used car marketplace, the used car market prices relative to the physical damage side of the business. But we expect to stay ahead of trend and get our margins back to exactly where you've always said, 96 or better."

We come into the first quarter of 2012, we had a significant dip down in physical damage frequency. We probably really should be closer to a trend line that reflects more 2010 frequency. So here we have a little bit of a depressed frequency environment. It's real, but it may not be sort of a good indicator of the future. We're also starting to observe severities, as I put it in the first quarter letter, certainly going up, not quite what we're seeing now. So there was no need right at that time to overreact. And overreactions, obviously, we lose some momentum in the marketplace. So the key is to try to time without ever sort of going over.

Now we believe we did, and we believe we paid relative to our contract. And it's an issue in terms of the courts, in terms of actual contract wording, which is more specifically what the issue is about. So as a result of that, we have had to reopen some claims from previous accident years, and that's causing the unfavorable development.

And I -- maybe we'd just sort of start with clarifying something. I think, Brian, you raised this this morning, I think, and it sort of helps illustrate something that I know investors are sort of confused around, which is with the headline 6% severity number, whether that's a reasonable proxy for projecting future severity or whether we ought to be using the paid severity measures or what the implied severity change was say for accident year 2011 that you guys have effectively disclosed. And in line with that, I think the question then is what does -- if you add sort of a go-forward view of severity that's reasonable and not distorted by reserve changes, what does that -- what, on a sort of pure premium basis, does this look like that you guys actually need in terms of rate? And is it -- because if you simplistically do this, you'd add up 6% times the larger numbers for positive frequency changes.

I will try to at least take pieces, and Glenn, feel free -- or Al, feel free to chime in. The best measure for severity, I believe, over time, is your own assessment of the accident year severity change over change -- year-over-",552,"There's a lot there, Josh. I will try to at least take pieces, and Glenn, feel free -- or Al, feel free to chime in. The best measure for severity, I believe, over time, is your own assessment of the accident year severity change over change -- year-over-year. Unfortunately, at any given point in time, you don't know what that is, because they develop over time. So that's why we record both incurred, and I want to let people know that the paid is slightly lower. Now paid can be influenced by a lot of things, your closure rate, how you're closing more simple claims earlier or later versus previous years. So there are pitfalls in all of those. The other thing, suffice it to say, is that we believe severities have increased versus what we had seen, particularly in the previous couple of years, where our severities for bodily injury coverage and some of the other coverages had been fairly modest low-single digits, low-single digits. And in fact, last year, we have said 2011, at the end of last year, we thought bodily injuries severities are relatively flat. And we found out and as things have developed that we were a little bit short in that, and that's on the unfavorable reserve development. So we've increased our severity estimate for 2011 accident year about 2% from where we thought at the end of the year. As we project future severities, that's a select. If we had a crystal ball as to what future severities are, we -- it would be great. We have increased our select for future severities. I would not go all the way up to the 6% incurred severity that we are recording right now. The other thing I would just say relative to frequency, for certain, we have started to see an increase in frequency. In bodily injury, we've seen it for the past couple of quarters. Property damage and PIP is more second quarter related. Collision was 1% in the second quarter. Frequencies now in 2012 are comparable to what they were in 2010 or 2 years ago. Last year, we had negative decreases in frequency. So it's not as if frequency is way out of control. They are now closer to what they were 2 years ago, and some of the things last year that may have affected frequency were gas prices and the like. The reality of it is for us and the industry, in the first quarter, collision frequency was down significantly. Ours was down like 10% in the first quarter. I think NAI data would say something like 5% for the industry. And that clearly, I believe, is attributable to very mild weather in Northeast Midwest and sort of a onetime event but nothing that would be expected long term. So on the frequency front, I would say our frequencies are comparable to a couple of years ago, so not overly concerned about that. One that we will continue to watch more is that BI frequency seems to be going up a little bit faster. And then on the severity front, we've increased future selects. But to project and say, ""Hey, we think the number is 6%,"" I think that would be on the high end. It'll be less than that."

That's not -- they're not all there, but think of them as more in that range.

We don't want to get into positions where we have to take plus 10s, because that will definitely adversely affect retention rates and the like. So our preferred approach is to take consistent amount of rate changes when we need to. So think of the average rate changes in the mid-single digits for most states where we've taken rate changes. And in terms of the monthly rate factor, it is not a significant amount of the rate change taken. But it is an increasing portion, because I think some of the experience has proven that that is a good methodology of continued take rate over time. So we've implemented it in a few more states and then in some states, increased that percentage. But in terms of the overall rate change, I would not say that is a big portion of the 5% rate change through current period or 7% at the end of the year."

As it relates to that first question about how does it react to combined ratios over target.

So there's 2 for direct auto and 1 for each of the agency auto, specialized and commercial auto. And as they're constructed -- they are constructed relative to growth and profit tradeoffs. And all of the matrices have a pretty big penalty function for being over target, and the penalty function gets greater as you get further and further over target. So being slightly over target, there is a penalty function that's not as steep. But as you get further and further away from target, the penalty function is pretty severe. So I think those in particular who have the responsibility of setting prices and ensuring rate accuracy are very cognizant of that. And it is one of the drivers of what you saw in June. The number had come down fairly significantly from I believe it was 1.42 at the end of May and moved down to 1.29 at the end of June, and that combined ratio of 101 won't -- doesn't sit well in any matrix. So that was the primary driver of it going down. And yes, there are penalty functions of being over target, and they're pretty severe, particularly as you go further and further over target. We do try to reward and incent growth too, because we want to grow, but we only want to grow at or better than target."

That work continues. There are some favorable results from that. We want them to be even more favorable. And the reason I bring it up is it's a very interesting way to be able to also accommodate a customer's desire for lower rates. In a rate-rising environment, it may actually give people a little bit more incentive to say, ""Yes, maybe I'll try this, because this gives me an opportunity to tell you I'm a good driver and get a lower rate."" So hopefully, Snapshot is a nice time to have -- or it's a nice time to have Snapshot into a rate-rising environment."

Brian also mentioned indirectly in California, in agency, which is not the only place we would do this, but bill plans. So we can certainly control sometimes the flow of new business just by the attractiveness of bill plans. It matters in different classes of business a little more than others. It's something we will do. And within Snapshot, clearly, we have a discount structure that we're very comfortable with. But if that proved -- it proved to be a little more aggressive, we have an opportunity to adjust the discount structure there. And we're not just talking 1 point, 0.5 point, not move away, in any way, shape or form, from our excitement around Snapshot. Snapshot is something that we think actually offers consumers a way to really manage their price, and this is a good time to do that. So no, we're not planning on pulling back on Snapshot at all. But at $1 billion, which is a number that we put out in the Investor Relations meeting, we expect Snapshot to perform. And when we say perform -- sorry for the long explanation here -- it does mean that we understand new business can still meet our target but numerically be above 96.

And as I said of my letter, I think we will that's matching that now. We will continue, that's not a one-time issue, so we will continue to take trend and do our normal rate revision processes. So rate revision processes are completely dynamic, happen all the time. What really happened in the second and third quarter, which is a little bit of a catch-up for, perhaps, some trend that we may have gotten just little behind on but our targets remain at 96. And as I said in the latter, we are thankful for the inflationary premium growth, which is certainly apparent. Would've to get unit growth and that's what we seek.

A big component piece is in the third quarter, we consciously decided reduce a little bit of our advertising spend relatively to certainly what we had coming into the year and actually under the lower rate than last year at this time. So some of that is contributing to the lower expense ratio and you could see that more obviously in the Direct channel expense ratio versus the Agency. And then the other component piece is just with the earned premium growth with higher levels that we've experience for number of years we are getting some leverage on the higher earned premium related to some salary cost and other fixed expenses in the organization. But it's a combination of the lower advertising spend less higher earned premium growth rate that's really driving it."

Here's what I would tell you would be the drivers. When we talked about this a fair amount in terms of our ad spend, [indiscernible] overall profit targets we would base it upon what we get in terms of our acquisition costs, cost for so good the targeted comfortable with that, we'll keep spending. If we go above it, by a lots, we would've been revisited dose spend levels. And so when we do that on a regular basis. It could be roughly quarter and it to read that we're that. So that would be 1 component piece. And so it's pretty dynamic. We believe as we are much more comfortable with our aggregate rate accuracy that we will actually go back to higher levels of ad spend. So will see how that plays out. But that is the thought at least right now, that although third quarter was down and fourth quarter is likely to be a little bit lower, we will return to higher ad level spend as we get more comfortable with our rate accuracy. The second component piece is what I mentioned in terms of gaining some leverage on fixed cost and other, call it, employee compensation cost, et cetera. We've got, over time, we definitely aspire to grow earned premium growth in the faster levels from those cost. So that should have a long-term decrease in terms of our cost structure, both in LAE and expense ratio. And then the final thing, which is very, very important in of the direct channel is the new mix because remember, we have a very targets for new business versus real new business and we allocate all of our advertising costs in the business. If we don't get as much a new business, yes, we would reduce or adjust our advertising spend. If we are getting the growth, that referred to earlier, we will continue to spend as long as we're meeting that new business target on renewal business so I'd say it's a combination of great accuracy we did spend more other expenses, long-term we actually hope to gain some leverage on. So what will the run rate expense ratio be for Direct going forward, I think it's a combination of those effects. But that so. . ."

So think of us not so much is trying to build in a safety margin but trying to be as aggressive in the marketplace as possible but put a very high premium on attending our 96% or better. Snapshot really doesn't change that. We're pricing Snapshot product or the discounted that we embed from Snapshot so that we hit exactly the same type of targets. Giving discounts is a very, very tricky thing. You're clearly reducing the margin on that particular or price on that particular customer, but we expect to make the same margin. So I would encourage you don't think about sort of a 92%, 93% as some act of a built-in safety margin I think of as for what we see we are going to try to grow as fast as possible it's a 96 and everything we do whether it's Snapshot or new price or anything else, we design to meet the same targets."

With not -- we don't give you specific by different classes of business. But we've given some indication that at least for our Agency book of business, life expectancy is actually increasing and for our Direct book, which had actually been experiencing some negative, it is now much more of a flat PLE.

And about 50% of our business in the are our own customers maturing into greater insurance needs and is being able to accommodate them it. So frankly, very happy with it PHA on the Direct side. Second point would be on the Agency said that, we're -- we're very clearly said, we did not get out of the box, a good solution for agents, the company was fined, it just wasn't suited for agents. As you know announced in June of that we've entered into a relationship, significant relationship, with ASI relatively small company. But the very much in tune with culturally with where we are and the sort of things we want to achieve for our agents. We've been taking over the last several months the notion of Progressive and ASI as a little bit -- a lot more of an integrated offering for agents, clearly, not the same as it came from 1 company. But in this case, 2 companies that are very, very good at what they do, coming together, providing some, not only technology integrate the product but actually some product features and that is being very well received by agents are you presently being out talking to agency done conference calls with agents, I think this is something new to the marketplace in a sense that 2 very well-respected companies coming together putting their offerings together in that's actually are designed for agents and we are actually too early to sort of give you a lot of the metrics of what's happening there. We do have agency selection there where, not necessarily giving that are too all agents and we are looking for agents who have a very preferred book of business to be able to give us from a new business perspective and we are seeing early signs that agents, certain agents, not all, are appealing that this is a very viable solution for them, and we're very, very optimistic about the future of that hideous of Progressive relationship. That is going to be strong for some time recognize this it is of the preferred customers who are looking for home and auto is about 43% of the marketplace. Actually, I could even make that a little higher the way we defined things. But it's a big chunk of the marketplace that we have extraordinary low penetration in. And agents have a very large part of that marketplace. So for us to be able to be on the verge of taking something to agents, really that's give them the opportunity to have a coordinated bundle of home and auto is actually very exciting I think that excitement is spilling over from agents. So that question will be a good question. We'll have more data on exactly how Progressive a year from now. But I would say that's a very optimistic part of our outlook for next year."

I think we all want to know sort of where Sandy settles out and I'm sure every insurance company right now is giving best what they can. Let me tell you what I know and then try to avoid saying anything that we simply don't know. Overnight reporting, is that this probably bumped us up to about 6,000 claims so we've got the 6,000 claims that's a little higher than the number I would add last night but I suspect that's well on its way to that number. I think of that is 2/3 flood, 1/3 wind, about just sort of 80% of it is New York, New Jersey the rest would be another 10% Pennsylvania, or Connecticut and then obviously all the states that you all know were affected. That's sort of what we know right now. Spud claims for us probably going to be more often than not total losses. So order is not good for cars. So we have some estimates. We don't know exactly where and we have great models. But all models are exactly that. We don't know whether reporting will end. If we advantage for you and for us. We will release results in about 12 days or whatever that is 12 or 15 days from something like that for October. And literally, every hour goes by, the development of claim reporting is helping us. So we actually have a pretty good estimate of our exposure by the time we produce results in 12 or 13 days. So far, 6,000 claims, I don't want to even speculate as though we're that is. If I give you sort of a ballpark thing, you take the take it wrong way but it suspect seeing half of the things we're getting or in that neighborhood. So but there are people clearly as we all know with all power and so and so forth. So things might be a little bit different than we experienced as you would expect from Progressive and hopefully all other insurance companies at this point. The job #1 is getting everybody back to the conditions that they can move on with their lives. So we have deployed and we are active as you would expect in the marketplace with resources and doing a great job for the people that have reported their claims and hopefully we can get as many as unreported claims in within the next few days we can get on those as quickly as possible. Hopefully for any of you listening that were affected by the storms, hopefully you're able to get your lives back to situation that's comfortable for you or your family to whatever. So that's events insurance companies I think in general are stepping up and Enola Progressive. Up really well."

The easy answer for you for our outlook right now on bodily injury, which is one of our clearly important trend estimates both the pricing and for reserving us, 4 to 6, 3 to 6, don't want to be vague there. But that's sort of a range that feels about right to us. And so frankly, if I go back in my career sort of 3 to 5 is a being a fairly good estimate of bodily injury trend, which is reflective of the medical costs us one of the underlying drivers of it. So that's our assumptions going forward. So what we talk about and I discussed in the letter sort of a taken a shot at rates we've gotten back to margins at with anchor about right to recognize trend is always ongoing through going to have to price that didn't and our current estimate of the trend going forward is sort of that the 3 to 5, 4 to 6 kind of range on bodily injury. So far, frequency if I have to some of frequency, it's mostly noise, plus or minus 1% on almost coverages and so not a lot of frequency can be big driver of things of that can get that's a good driver so a severity issue and I would say if you're using your models or you're estimation our you're thinking about how Progressive my we are thinking around the 3 to 5 in bodily injury turn."

Well, probably expect, to be honest, our volume of people actually taking the test drive has underperformed our internal estimates as we permitted estimates and everything even if we haven't done that before. And frankly I would say this volume was is under our submissions. So just call it the way it is. Certainly we've got an awful lot of interest or clicks but not sure that's, not necessarily is the operative measure. Of those ultimately take the trial, the final that we have expected this a loss of the estimates that are fanning out. So actually, we are taking people all the way through the final and the good news is that of those that are self-funded and the identifying and taking the large number of them are actually getting the opportunity to get a discount off of what our rates otherwise would have been. Who's taking the test? That actually and is positive for us if I just focus on the 3 companies, 3 auto companies that buy market share larger than us, we have more than 50% of the faithful who are taking the test drive are actually distributed amongst those 3 companies. So it is actually very encouraging for us that while the test drug is not likely nor was it ever decide to try to get was going to be shopping in the next day, next week, next month. This was to try and get people to sort of think about shopping who would not otherwise have shopped. I would expect to get market share from companies that, perhaps, maybe had more entrenched customers. And that seems to be happening. Some I'm very happy with the mix of customers that are taking us up. That the mix is flowing through to the sales and again, don't want to overstate the numbers, not sort of dramatic enough the but to really move the needle. So everything we had hoped for in the strength is coming through, except the volume is a less than we would've hoped. So what are we doing about that? We are clearly very encouraged that our understanding, public understanding, of Snapshot's test drive but a little bit is about 56% awareness. So the awareness of this concept, which if you think about is still relatively new to the industry is actually not quite high amongst the consuming public. The attribution to Progressive is about 84%. So people actually know about what it is and the attributed it to us. I would tell you on this is a little looser that while there is a general understanding. There's still a fair amount of ambiguity as exactly what to do about it and what it will do for me. As a result, we have been doing consumer research and we have a new campaign targeted that will be quite different than we've done before. So a new campaign to try and us inspire people to better understand what Snapshot test drive and the do and will do for them get so sure that, really happy with some of the mix issue that are coming through really happy with the fact that people are getting discounts and clearly those discounts, but a way, translate into higher satisfaction scores, which translate into higher retention scores the kind of flow-through the funnel positive flow-through we just needed to have a more volume through the funnel and to that end, we've got some what I consider to be quite interesting marketing ideas and they will manifest themselves in the first quarter next year."

There you clearly seeing a very fast reaction to increases in spend and be the process and ranking and people quoting with you.

But if we can just quickly recap through the year, let's just focus on auto, we've taken about 6 points of rate, give or take. A little bit differently, agency and direct, but that's reasonably close. Second quarter, I think we explained very carefully that we got a little bit behind on timing so we've taken some additional rate during the second and third quarter. And as I said on my letter, I think we've got a nice matching now. We will continue, that doesn't -- that's not a onetime issue, so we'll continue to take trend and do our normal rate revision processes. So rate revision processes are completely dynamic, happen all the time. What really happened in the second and third quarter was just a little bit of a catch-up for, perhaps, some trend that we may have gotten just little behind on, but our targets remain at 96. And as I said in the letter, while we're thankful for the inflationary premium growth, which is certainly apparent, we'd love to get unit growth and that's what we seek. We seek the combination of growing and good margins.

A big component piece is in the third quarter, we consciously decided to reduce a little bit of our advertising spend relative -- certainly,  to what we had. But coming into the year and actually, or spending on a little lower rate than last year at this time. So some of that is contributing to the lower expense ratio and you could see that more obviously in the direct channel expense ratio versus the agency. And then the other component piece is just with the earned premium growth being at higher levels than we've experience for a number of years. We're gaining some leverage on the higher earned premium relative to salary costs and other fixed expenses in the organization. But it's the combination of the lower advertising spend plus higher earned premium growth rate that's really driving it."

Here's what I'll tell you would be the drivers. When we talked about this, a fair amount in terms of our ad spend,  assuming we are meeting our overall profit targets, we would base it upon the yield that we get in terms of our acquisition costs, cost for sale versus what we call our targeted acquisition cost. And while we're comfortable with that, we'll keep spending. If we go above it by a lot, we would then revisit those spend levels. And so -- and we do that on a regular basis. It can be monthly, quarterly or et cetera that we're evaluating that. So that would be one component piece, and so it's pretty dynamic. We believe, as we are much more comfortable with our aggregate rate accuracy, that we will actually go back to higher levels of ad spend. So we'll see how that plays out. But that is the thought at least right now, that although third quarter was down and fourth quarter is likely to be a little bit lower, we will return to a higher ad level spend as we get more and more comfortable with our rate accuracy.  A second component piece is, what I mentioned in terms of gaining some leverage on fixed cost and other, call it, employee compensation cost, et cetera. We've got, over time, we definitely aspire to grow earned premium growth at faster levels than those costs, so that should have a long-term decrease in terms of our cost structure, both in LAE and expense ratio. Then the final thing, which is very, very important in a direct channel is the new renewal mix because remember, we have very different targets for new business versus renewal business and we allocate all of our advertising costs in new business. If we don't get the yield as much in new business, yes, we would reduce or adjust our advertising spend. If we are getting the growth, that Glenn so referred to earlier, we will continue to spend as long as we're meeting that new business target and renewal business target. So I'd say it's a combination of rate accuracy, we'd spend more other expenses, long-term, we actually hope to gain some leverage on. So what will the run rate for the expense ratio be for direct going forward, I think it's a combination of those effects. But, that's ..."

I think what I've been saying for quite some time now is the market conditions are much more in the mode of we will be closer to our 96 to be able to continue to grow. So think of us not so much as trying to build in a safety margin, but trying to be as aggressive in the marketplace as possible, but put a very high premium on attaining our 96 or better. Snapshot really doesn't change that. We're pricing Snapshot product or the discounts that we embed from Snapshot so that we hit exactly the same type of targets. Giving discounts is a very, very tricky thing. You're clearly reducing the margin on that particular, or the price on that particular customer, but we expect to make the same margin. So don't -- I would just encourage you, don't think about sort of a 92, 93 as some act of built-in safety margin.

Clearly, the rate pressure, I mean, pretty simple physics here. It took rates up, we see the effect in new apps. The 4% that we've put there, not going to forecast it, but until we see some competitive actions that are even stronger than the ones we've seen, and clearly, we are seeing competitive actions that are, in the vast majority of cases, positive, but I expect that we will see, for some time, pressure on new applications. I'm not going to give an estimate of what that will be, but that's not going to turn around any time soon. That will take a little bit of market for us. But given that we're going to continue to focus on our target margins, we are very comfortable with that trade-off. Renewal apps, yes, you see. You know there's sort of a reason that will be. We obviously put on new business, it's coming through as renewals. We've not -- we don't give specific PLEs by different classes of business. But we've given some indication that, at least for our Agency book of business, policy life expectancy is actually increasing. And for our Direct book, which had actually been experiencing some negative, it's now much more of a flat PLE. So while there will be a delayed effect on that as well, and I'm not going to forecast exactly what they will be, as of right now, we're very comfortable with our retention statistics for the customers that have actually experienced rate increases as well. New business probably more concerning and I expect that, that will turn around at some point, but I'm not going to forecast that point."

And I don't want to sort of necessarily recount any statements that might have been made, but actually, were quite comfortable with what's happening on, certainly, on the Direct side. Recognize that one of the key objectives there, we'd like to bring in new business to PHA, but one of the things we've always set out to do is make sure we don't lose current business that we have when there is a life exchange that requires someone to get a home policy. And about 50% of our business in PHA are our own customers maturing into greater insurance needs and us being able to accommodate them. So frankly, very actually very happy with PHA on the Direct side. Second point would be on the Agency side where we very clearly said, we did not get out of the box, a good solution for agents. The company was fine, it just wasn't suited for agents. As you know and announced in June that we've entered into a relationship, a significant relationship, with ASI, a relatively small company, but very much in tune with, culturally, where we are and the sorts of things we want to achieve for our agents. We have been taking, over the last several months, the notion of Progressive and ASI as a little bit -- a lot more of an integrated offering for agents. Clearly, not the same as if it came from one company. But in this case, 2 companies that are very, very good at what they do, coming together, providing some, not only technology that integrates the product, but actually some product features. And that is being very well received by agents. I have personally been out and talking to agents, done some conference calls with agents. They think this is something new to the marketplace in the sense that 2 very well-respected companies coming together, putting their offerings together in ways that actually are designed for agents, and we're actually  too early to sort of give you a lot of metrics as to what's happening there. We do have agency selection there. We're not necessarily giving that to all agents. And we're looking for agents who have a very preferred book of business to be able to give us from a new business perspective. And we are seeing early signs that agents, certain agents, not all, are feeling that this is a very viable solution for them. And we're very, very optimistic about the future of the ASI Progressive relationship. It is going to be small for some time. Recognize this zone of preferred customers who are looking for home and auto is about 43% of the marketplace. Actually, I can even make that a little higher the way we define things, but it's a big chunk of the marketplace. It is a big chuck of the marketplace that we have extraordinary low penetration in. And agents have a very large part of that marketplace. So for us to be able to be on the verge of taking something to agents, that really does give them the opportunity to have a coordinated bundle of home and auto, is actually very exciting, and I think that excitement is spilling over from agents. So that question will be a good question. We'll have more data on exactly our progress a year from now. But I would say that's a very optimistic part of our outlook for next year."

I think we all want to know sort of where Sandy settles out and I'm sure every insurance company right now is giving the best to give what they can. Let me tell you what I know and then try to avoid saying things that we simply don't know. Overnight reporting, I expect just probably bumped us up to about a 6,000 claims. So we've got about 6,000 claims, that's a little higher than the number I had last night, but I suspect that, that's well on its way to that number. Think of that as 2/3 flood, 1/3 wind. About just short of 80% of it is New York, New Jersey, the rest would be another 10% Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and then obviously, all the states that you all know were affected. That's sort of what we know right now. Spud claims for us probably going to be, more often than not, total losses. So order is not good for cars. So we have some estimates. We don't know exactly where and we have great models, but all models are exactly that. Don't know where the reporting will end. It's the advantage for you and for us. We will release results in about 12 days or whatever that is, 12 to 15 days, something like that, for October. And literally, as every hour goes by, the development of claim reporting is helping us. So we'll actually have a pretty good estimate of our exposure by the time we will produce results in about 12 or 13 days. So far, 6,000 claims. I don't want to even speculate as to where that is. If I gave you sort of a ballpark-ish thing, you would sort of maybe take it the wrong way, but I suspect we're seeing half of the claims we're getting or in that neighborhood. So, but there are people, clearly, as we all know, without power and so and so forth. So things [ph] reporting pattern [ph] might be just a little bit different than we experienced as you would expect from Progressive and hopefully, all other insurance companies at this point. The job #1 is getting everybody back to the conditions that they can move on with their lives. So we have deployed and we are active, as you would expect, in the marketplace with the resources and doing a great job for the people that have reported their claims. And hopefully, we can get as many of the unreported claims in within the next few days so we can get on those as quickly as possible. Hopefully, for any of you listening that were affected by the storms, hopefully, you're able to get your lives back to a situation that's comfortable for you or your families or whatever. So that event, insurance companies, I think in general, are stepping up and I know that Progressive will step up really well."

Don't want to be vague there, but that's sort of a range that feels about right to us. So and frankly, if I go back in my career, sort of 3 to 5 is a being a fairly good estimate of bodily injury trend which is largely reflective of medical costs as one of the underlying drivers of it. So that's our assumptions going forward. So what we've talked about, and I discussed in the letter, they would have sort of taken that shot at rates, we've gotten back to margins that we think are about right, recognize trend is always ongoing, so we're going to have to price that in. And our current estimate of trend going forward is sort of that the 3 to 5, 4 to 6 kind of range on bodily injury. So far, frequency, if I had to sum up frequency, it's mostly noise, plus or minus 1% on most coverages. So not a lot of frequency as the big driver of things. That can get awkward if that's the driver. So it's mostly a severity issue, and I would say if you're using your models or your estimation or you're thinking about how Progressive might act, we're thinking around 3 to 5 in bodily injury trend."

And frankly, I would say this, volume-wise, is",615,"Yes. Probably may expect, to be honest, our volume of people actually taking the Test Drive has underperformed our internal estimates as we formulate estimates on everything even if we haven't done on before. And frankly, I would say this, volume-wise, is under our estimations. So just call it the way it is. Certainly, we got an awful lot of interest or clicks, but I'm not sure that, that necessarily is the operative measure. Of those that ultimately take the trial, the funnel that we had expected is a lot of the estimates we had made that are panning out. So actually, we are taking people all the way through the funnel, and the good news is that of those that are self-identifying and taking the test, a very large number of them are actually getting the opportunity to get a discount off of what our rates otherwise would have been. Who's taking the test? That actually is quite a nice positive for us. If I just focus on the 3 companies, the 3 auto companies that are, by market share, larger than us, we have more than 50% of the people who are taking the Test Drive are actually distributed amongst those 3 companies. So it is actually very encouraging for us that while Test Drive is not likely, nor was it ever designed, to try to get at the shopper who was going to be shopping in the next day, next week, next month. This was to try and get people to sort of think about shopping who would not otherwise have shopped, I would expect to get market share from companies that, perhaps, maybe had more entrenched customers. And that seems to be happening. So I'm very happy with the mix of customers that are taking us up. That mix is flowing through to the sales. And again, I don't want to overstate, the numbers are not sort of dramatic enough to really move the needle. So everything we had hoped for in Test Drive is coming through, except the volume is less than we would've hoped. So what are we doing about that? We are clearly very encouraged that our understanding, the public understanding of Snapshot/Test Drive, and I'll blend it too here a little bit, is about 56% awareness. So the awareness of this concept, which if you think about it, is still relatively new to the industry, is actually now quite high amongst the consuming public. The attribution to Progressive is about 84%. So people actually know about what it is and they attribute it to us. I would tell you, and this is a little looser, that while there is a general understanding, there is still a fair amount of ambiguity as to exactly what to do about it and what it will do for me. As a result, we have been doing consumer research and we have a new campaign targeted that will be quite different than we've done before. So a new campaign to try and inspire people to better understand what Snapshot/Test Drive can do and will do for them. So in short, really happy with some of the mix issues that are coming through. Really happy with the fact that people are getting discounts, and then clearly, those discounts, by the way, translate into higher satisfaction scores, which translate into higher retention scores. So the kind of flow-through to the funnel is absolutely a positive flow-through, we just need to have a more volume through the funnel and to that end, we've got some, what I consider to be, quite interesting marketing ideas and they will manifest themselves in the first quarter next year."

If you choose to take advertising up, what -- how should we think about the normal, kind of lag, between when you spend and when you actually see the growth show up in terms of policy counts and then ultimately, in earnings? And I guess, the reason I'm asking is because the data that I've seen, which is actually a little bit more focused on life insurance than PNC, is that it's, for Direct response that it's often -- it often 6 to 8 months to actually get scale in the response rate.

And when prospects, being people who quote with us and likewise when we increase it, we see a return, but I would also say it probably does differ a little bit based upon media type. What I mean by that, for example, if we were to spend more or less on paid search for people who are looking for car insurance, you know there are shoppers in the marketplace, there, you clearly see a very fast reaction to increases in spend and bid prices and ranking and people quoting with you. TV, radio and other media types might be a little bit of a different immediate response versus lag function. But when we -- generally speaking, when we change our ad spend, we will see a corresponding activity in terms of the number of people quoting with us fairly fast."

It sounds like it's either margin neutral if not expansive. The question is, is around getting customers to pick up the phone. And it sounds like we've worked through a few different iterations. You've got something on deck. But you've got 2015, 2016, there's sort of the patent cliff as it were around sort of the window of time that you guys have to take advantage of this. And I'm just sort of wondering, is there something that you think they're working that will ultimately be make this killer app?"

The fact is, we'll keep working at this with the kind of diligence that we work with everything else. Every time we get, we've got now more than 1 million customers have taken Snapshot. So it's not some sort of small data set. We learn things every time. We are learning things about the underwriting, the discount, the measurement period. So expect to see this be very dynamic in change and reflect.  You mentioned this sort of cliff, that's a self-imposed cliff. We have said very clearly that we had a lot of intellectual property. In fact, our sixth patent, we've been told that our sixth patent will be awarded here very shortly. We've been very clear to the marketplace that we're willing to license this starting the second quarter of 2015. And between that time, we'll be very clear that we don't think people should be infringing on the things that have been a significant amount of energy and work for us and have that patent protection. So we'll protect ourselves during that period of time, but we invite them to show interest in licensing if they so wish. By that time, we'll just continue to push, push, push. But this is clearly something that is very exciting. There is no question. There can be no question. This is an underwriting variable that gives us insight to driving behavior and segmentation that no other variable has given us to date, at least in the same way. How we get that through the people and how we market it is something that we're going to keep pushing at. And wish I could give you an answer and say, ""Yes, we have got sort of a killer app in our back pocket. "" It's not likely to be that way. The more people try it, as I did note the awareness level of it, that's a pretty -- maybe I'm kidding myself, but I think that's a pretty cool thing to have more than 50% of the consuming public aware of something like this. Now, we just need to turn that awareness into action. We're going to keep plugging away at it."

We will continue, that doesn't -- that's not a onetime issue, so we'll continue to take trend and do our normal rate revision processes. So rate revision processes are completely dynamic, happen all the time. What really happened in the second and third quarter was just a little bit of a catch-up for, perhaps, some trend that we may have gotten just little behind on, but our targets remain at 96.

A big component piece is in the third quarter, we consciously decided to reduce a little bit of our advertising spend relative -- certainly to what we had [indiscernible] coming into the year and actually, or spending on a little lower rate than last year at this time. So some of that is contributing to the lower expense ratio and you could see that more obviously in the direct channel expense ratio versus the agency. And then the other component piece is just with the earned premium growth being at higher levels than we've experienced for a number of years, we're gaining some leverage on the higher earned premium relative to salary costs and other fixed expenses in the organization. But it's the combination of the lower advertising spend plus higher earned premium growth rate that's really driving it."

Here's what I'll tell you would be the drivers. When we talk about this, a fair amount in terms of our ad spend, assuming we are meeting our overall profit targets, we would base it upon the yield that we get in terms of our acquisition costs, cost for sale versus what we call our targeted acquisition cost. And while we're comfortable with that, we'll keep spending. If we go above it by a lot, we would then revisit those spend levels. And so -- and we do that on a regular basis. It can be monthly, quarterly or et cetera that we're evaluating that. So that would be one component piece, and so it's pretty dynamic. We believe, as we are much more comfortable with our aggregate rate accuracy, that we will actually go back to higher levels of ad spend. But we'll see how that plays out. But that is the thought at least right now, that although third quarter was down and fourth quarter is likely to be a little bit lower, we will return to a higher ad level spend as we get more and more comfortable with our rate accuracy. A second component piece is, what I mentioned in terms of gaining some leverage on fixed costs and other, call it, employee compensation cost, et cetera. We've got, over time, we definitely aspire to grow earned premium growth at faster levels than those costs, so that should have a long-term decrease in terms of our cost structure, both in LAE and expense ratio. Then the final thing, which is very, very important in a direct channel is the new renewal mix because remember, we have very different targets for new business versus renewal business and we allocate all of our advertising costs in new business. If we don't get the yield as much in new business, yes, we would reduce or adjust our advertising spend. If we are getting the growth, that Glenn so referred to earlier, we will continue to spend as long as we're meeting that new business target and renewal business target. So I'd say it's a combination of rate accuracy, we'd spend more. Other expenses, long-term, we actually hope to gain some leverage on. So what will the run rate for the expense ratio be for direct going forward, I think it's a combination of those effects. But, that's ..."

I think what I've been saying for quite some time now is the market conditions are much more in the mode of we will be closer to our 96 to be able to continue to grow. So think of us not so much as trying to build in a safety margin, but trying to be as aggressive in the marketplace as possible, but put a very high premium on attaining our 96 or better. Snapshot really doesn't change that. We're pricing Snapshot product or the discounts that we embed from Snapshot so that we hit exactly the same type of targets. Giving discounts is a very, very tricky thing. You're clearly reducing the margin on that particular, or the price on that particular customer, but we expect to make the same margin. So don't -- I would just encourage you, don't think about sort of a 92, 93 as some act of built-in safety margin.

But we've given some indication that, at least for our Agency book of business, policy life expectancy is actually increasing.

And I don't want to sort of necessarily recount any statements that might have been made, but actually, we're quite comfortable with what's happening on, certainly, on the Direct side. Recognize that one of the key objectives there, we'd like to bring in new business to PHA, but one of the things we've always set out to do is make sure we don't lose current business that we have when there is a life change that requires someone to get a home policy. And about 50% of our business in PHA are our own customers maturing into greater insurance needs and us being able to accommodate them. So frankly, we're actually very happy with PHA on the Direct side. Second point would be on the Agency side where we very clearly said, we did not get out of the box, a good solution for agents. The company was fine, it just wasn't suited for agents. As you know and announced in June that we've entered into a relationship, a significant relationship, with ASI, a relatively small company, but very much in tune with, culturally, where we are and the sorts of things we want to achieve for our agents. We have been taking, over the last several months, the notion of Progressive and ASI as a little bit -- a lot more of an integrated offering for agents. Clearly, not the same as if it came from one company. But in this case, 2 companies that are very, very good at what they do, coming together, providing some, not only technology that integrates the product, but actually some product features. And that is being very well received by agents. I have personally been out and talking to agents, done some conference calls with agents. Think this is something new to the marketplace in the sense that 2 very well-respected companies coming together, putting their offerings together in ways that actually are designed for agents, and we're actually -- too early to sort of give you a lot of metrics as to what's happening there. We do have agency selection there. We're not necessarily giving that to all agents. And we're looking for agents who have a very preferred book of business to be able to give us from a new business perspective. And we are seeing early signs that agents, certain agents, not all, are feeling that this is a very viable solution for them. And we're very, very optimistic about the future of the ASI Progressive relationship. It is going to be small for some time. Recognize this zone of preferred customers who are looking for home and auto is about 43% of the marketplace. Actually, I can even make that a little higher the way we define things, but it's a big chunk of the marketplace. It is a big chuck of the marketplace that we have extraordinary low penetration in. And agents have a very large part of that marketplace. So for us to be able to be on the verge of taking something to agents, that really does give them the opportunity to have a coordinated bundle of home and auto, is actually very exciting, and I think that excitement is spilling over from agents. So that question will be a good question. We'll have more data on exactly our progress a year from now. But I would say that's a very optimistic part of our outlook for next year."

I think we all want to know sort of where Sandy settles out and I'm sure every insurance company right now is doing the best to give what they can. Let me tell you what I know and then try to avoid saying things that we simply don't know. Overnight reporting, I expect has probably bumped us up to about a 6,000 claims. So we've got about 6,000 claims, that's a little higher than the number I had last night, but I suspect that, that's well on its way to that number. Think of that as 2/3 flood, 1/3 wind. About just short of 80% of it is New York, New Jersey, the rest would be another 10% Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and then obviously, other states that you all know are affected. That's sort of what we know right now. Spud [ph] claims for us are probably going to be, more often than not, total losses. So order is not good for cars. So we have some estimates. We don't know exactly where and we have great models, but all models are exactly that. Don't know where the reporting will end. It's the advantage for you and for us. We will release results in about 12 days or whatever that is, 12 to 15 days, something like that, for October. And literally, as every hour goes by, the development of claim reporting is helping us. So we'll actually have a pretty good estimate of our exposure by the time we will produce results in about 12 or 13 days. So far, 6,000 claims. I don't want to even speculate as to where that is. If I gave you sort of a ballpark-ish thing, you would sort of maybe take it the wrong way, but I suspect we're seeing half of the claims we're getting or in that neighborhood. So, but there are people, clearly, as we all know, without power and so on and so forth. So these reporting patterns might be just a little bit different than the experience. As you would expect from Progressive and hopefully, all other insurance companies at this point, the job #1 is getting everybody back to the conditions that they can move on with their lives. So we have deployed and we are active, as you would expect, in the marketplace with resources and doing a great job for the people that have reported their claims. And hopefully, we can get as many of the unreported claims in within the next few days so we can get on those as quickly as possible. Hopefully, for any of you listening that were affected by the storm, hopefully, you're able to get your lives back to a situation that's comfortable for you or your families or whatever. So that event, insurance companies, I think in general, are stepping up and I know that Progressive will step up really well."

So and frankly, if I go back in my career, sort of 3 to 5 is being a fairly good estimate of bodily injury trend which is largely reflective of medical costs as one of the underlying drivers of it. So that's our assumptions going forward. So what we've talked about, and I discussed in the letter, they would sort of taken a shot at rates, we've gotten back to margins that we think are about right, recognize trend is always ongoing, so we're going to have to price that in. And our current estimate of trend going forward is sort of that the 3 to 5, 4 to 6 kind of range on bodily injury. So far, frequency, if I had to sum up frequency, it's mostly noise, plus or minus 1% on most coverages. So not a lot of frequency as the big driver of things.

Probably mixed bag, to be honest, our volume of people actually taking the Test Drive has underperformed our internal estimates as we formulate estimates on everything even if we haven't done them before. And frankly, I would say this, volume-wise, i",614,"Yes. Probably mixed bag, to be honest, our volume of people actually taking the Test Drive has underperformed our internal estimates as we formulate estimates on everything even if we haven't done them before. And frankly, I would say this, volume-wise, is under our estimations. So just call it the way it is. Certainly, we got an awful lot of interest or clicks, but I'm not sure that, that necessarily is the operative measure. Of those that ultimately take the trial, the funnel that we had expected is a lot of the estimates we had made that are panning out. So actually, we are taking people all the way through the funnel, and the good news is that of those that are self-identifying and taking the test, a very large number of them are actually getting the opportunity to get a discount off of what our rates otherwise would have been. Who's taking the test? That actually is quite a nice positive for us. If I just focus on the 3 companies, the 3 auto companies that are, by market share, larger than us, we have more than 50% of the people who are taking the Test Drive are actually distributed amongst those 3 companies. So it is actually very encouraging for us that while Test Drive is not likely, nor was it ever designed, to try to get at the shopper who was going to be shopping in the next day, next week, next month. This was to try and get people to sort of think about shopping who would not otherwise have shopped, I would expect to get market share from companies that, perhaps, maybe had more entrenched customers. And that seems to be happening. So I'm very happy with the mix of customers that are taking us up. That mix is flowing through to the sales. And again, I don't want to overstate, the numbers are not sort of dramatic enough to really move the needle. So everything we had hoped for in Test Drive is coming through, except the volume is less than we would've hoped. So what are we doing about that? We are clearly very encouraged that our understanding, the public understanding of Snapshot/Test Drive, and I'll blend the 2 here a little bit, is about 56% awareness. So the awareness of this concept, which if you think about it, is still relatively new to the industry, is actually now quite high amongst the consuming public. The attribution to Progressive is about 84%. So people actually know about what it is and they attribute it to us. I would tell you, and this is a little looser, that while there is a general understanding, there is still a fair amount of ambiguity as to exactly what to do about it and what it will do for me. As a result, we have been doing consumer research and we have a new campaign targeted that will be quite different than we've done before. So a new campaign to try and inspire people to better understand what Snapshot/Test Drive can do and will do for them. So in short, really happy with some of the mix issues that are coming through. Really happy with the fact that people are getting discounts, and then clearly, those discounts, by the way, translate into higher satisfaction scores, which translate into higher retention scores. So the kind of flow-through to the funnel is absolutely a positive flow-through, we just need to have more volume through the funnel and to that end, we've got some, what I consider to be, quite interesting marketing ideas and they will manifest themselves in the first quarter next year."

If you all chose, depending on the effectiveness of the rate increases and where margins settle out on a state-by-state basis. If you choose to take advertising up, what -- how should we think about the normal, kind of lag, between when you spend and when you actually see the growth show up in terms of policy counts and then ultimately, in earnings? And I guess, the reason I'm asking is because the data that I've seen, which is actually a little bit more focused on life insurance than PNC, is that it's, for Direct response that it's often -- it often takes 6 to 8 months to actually get scale in the response rate. So just trying to figure out that dynamic."

I wouldn't say it's a 6- or an 8-month lag that life might have. And it's not like one-for-one. But when we reduce our spend, we generally see a decline in prospects. And when prospects -- prospects being people who quote with us  --and likewise when we increase it, we see a return, but I would also say it probably does differ a little bit based upon media type. What I mean by that, for example, if we were to spend more or less on paid search, where people who are looking for car insurance, you know there are shoppers in the marketplace, there, you clearly see a very fast reaction to increases in spend and bid prices and ranking and people quoting with you. TV, radio and other media types might be a little bit of a different immediate response versus lag function. But when we -- generally speaking, when we change our ad spend, we will see a corresponding activity in terms of the number of people quoting with us fairly fast."

To the extent that we all know that certainly, if you live in Ohio, political advertising is a big part of what's going on, and that will come to an end here reasonably soon. Not a major factor for us. That's much more of a local buy. A good chunk of at least our television is national buys. So much more driven by our own view of do we have the rate?

So it's not some sort of small data set. We learn things every time. We are learning things about the underwriting, the discount, the measurement period. So expect to see this be very dynamic in change and reflect. You mentioned this sort of cliff, that's a self-imposed cliff. We have said very clearly that we had a lot of intellectual property. In fact, our sixth patent, we've been told that our sixth patent will be awarded here very shortly. And we've been very clear to the marketplace that we're willing to license this starting the second quarter of 2015. And between that time, we'll be very clear that we don't think people should be infringing on the things that have been a significant amount of energy and work for us and have that patent protection. So we'll protect ourselves during that period of time, but we invite them to show interest in licensing if they so wish. By that time, we'll just continue to push, push, push. But this is clearly something that is very exciting. There is no question. There can be no question. This is an underwriting variable that gives us insight to driving behavior and segmentation that no other variable has given us to date, at least in the same way. How we get that through to people and how we market it is something that we're going to keep pushing at. And I wish I could get you an answer and say, ""Yes, we have got sort of the killer app in our back pocket. "" It's not likely to be that way. The more people try it, as I did note the awareness level of it, that's a pretty -- maybe I'm kidding myself, but I think that's a pretty cool thing to have more than 50% of the consuming public aware of something like this.

But if we can just quickly recap through the year, let's just focus on auto, we've taken about 6 points of rate, give or take. A little bit differently, agency and direct, but that's reasonably close. Second quarter, I think we explained very carefully that we got a little bit behind on timing so we've taken some additional rate during the second and third quarter. And as I said on my letter, I think we've got a nice matching now. We will continue, that doesn't -- that's not a onetime issue, so we'll continue to take trend and do our normal rate revision processes. So rate revision processes are completely dynamic, happen all the time. What really happened in the second and third quarter was just a little bit of a catch-up for, perhaps, some trend that we may have gotten just little behind on, but our targets remain at 96. And as I said in the letter, while we're thankful for the inflationary premium growth, which is certainly apparent, we'd love to get unit growth and that's what we seek. We seek the combination of growing and good margins.

A big component piece is in the third quarter, we consciously decided to reduce a little bit of our advertising spend relative -- certainly to what we had [indiscernible] coming into the year and actually, or spending on a little lower rate than last year at this time. So some of that is contributing to the lower expense ratio and you could see that more obviously in the direct channel expense ratio versus the agency. And then the other component piece is just with the earned premium growth being at higher levels than we've experienced for a number of years, we're gaining some leverage on the higher earned premium relative to salary costs and other fixed expenses in the organization. But it's the combination of the lower advertising spend plus higher earned premium growth rate that's really driving it."

Here's what I'll tell you would be the drivers. When we talk about this, a fair amount in terms of our ad spend, assuming we are meeting our overall profit targets, we would base it upon the yield that we get in terms of our acquisition costs, cost for sale versus what we call our targeted acquisition cost. And while we're comfortable with that, we'll keep spending. If we go above it by a lot, we would then revisit those spend levels. And so -- and we do that on a regular basis. It can be monthly, quarterly or et cetera that we're evaluating that. So that would be one component piece, and so it's pretty dynamic. We believe, as we are much more comfortable with our aggregate rate accuracy, that we will actually go back to higher levels of ad spend. But we'll see how that plays out. But that is the thought at least right now, that although third quarter was down and fourth quarter is likely to be a little bit lower, we will return to a higher ad level spend as we get more and more comfortable with our rate accuracy. A second component piece is, what I mentioned in terms of gaining some leverage on fixed costs and other, call it, employee compensation cost, et cetera. We've got, over time, we definitely aspire to grow earned premium growth at faster levels than those costs, so that should have a long-term decrease in terms of our cost structure, both in LAE and expense ratio. Then the final thing, which is very, very important in a direct channel is the new renewal mix because remember, we have very different targets for new business versus renewal business and we allocate all of our advertising costs in new business. If we don't get the yield as much in new business, yes, we would reduce or adjust our advertising spend. If we are getting the growth, that Glenn so referred to earlier, we will continue to spend as long as we're meeting that new business target and renewal business target. So I'd say it's a combination of rate accuracy, we'd spend more. Other expenses, long-term, we actually hope to gain some leverage on. So what will the run rate for the expense ratio be for direct going forward, I think it's a combination of those effects. But, that's ..."

I think what I've been saying for quite some time now is the market conditions are much more in the mode of we will be closer to our 96 to be able to continue to grow. So think of us not so much as trying to build in a safety margin, but trying to be as aggressive in the marketplace as possible, but put a very high premium on attaining our 96 or better. Snapshot really doesn't change that. We're pricing Snapshot product or the discounts that we embed from Snapshot so that we hit exactly the same type of targets. Giving discounts is a very, very tricky thing. You're clearly reducing the margin on that particular, or the price on that particular customer, but we expect to make the same margin. So don't -- I would just encourage you, don't think about sort of a 92, 93 as some act of built-in safety margin.

I'm not going to give an estimate of what that will be, but that's not going to turn around any time soon. That will take a little bit of market force. But given that we're going to continue to focus on our target margins, we are very comfortable with that trade-off. Renewal apps, yes, you see. You know there's sort of a reason that will be. We obviously put on new business, it's coming through as renewals. We've not -- we don't give specific PLEs by different classes of business. But we've given some indication that, at least for our Agency book of business, policy life expectancy is actually increasing. And for our Direct book, which had actually been experiencing some negative, it's now much more of a flat PLE. So while there will be a delayed effect on that as well, and I'm not going to forecast exactly what they will be, as of right now, we're very comfortable with our retention statistics for the customers that have actually experienced rate increases as well.

And I don't want to sort of necessarily recount any statements that might have been made, but actually, we're quite comfortable with what's happening on, certainly, on the Direct side. R",588,"Let's break it into 2 pieces, our Direct piece and our Agency piece. And I don't want to sort of necessarily recount any statements that might have been made, but actually, we're quite comfortable with what's happening on, certainly, on the Direct side. Recognize that one of the key objectives there, we'd like to bring in new business to PHA, but one of the things we've always set out to do is make sure we don't lose current business that we have when there is a life change that requires someone to get a home policy. And about 50% of our business in PHA are our own customers maturing into greater insurance needs and us being able to accommodate them. So frankly, we're actually very happy with PHA on the Direct side. Second point would be on the Agency side where we very clearly said, we did not get out of the box, a good solution for agents. The company was fine, it just wasn't suited for agents. As you know and announced in June that we've entered into a relationship, a significant relationship, with ASI, a relatively small company, but very much in tune with, culturally, where we are and the sorts of things we want to achieve for our agents. We have been taking, over the last several months, the notion of Progressive and ASI as a little bit -- a lot more of an integrated offering for agents. Clearly, not the same as if it came from one company. But in this case, 2 companies that are very, very good at what they do, coming together, providing some, not only technology that integrates the product, but actually some product features. And that is being very well received by agents. I have personally been out and talking to agents, done some conference calls with agents. Think this is something new to the marketplace in the sense that 2 very well-respected companies coming together, putting their offerings together in ways that actually are designed for agents, and we're actually -- too early to sort of give you a lot of metrics as to what's happening there. We do have agency selection there. We're not necessarily giving that to all agents. And we're looking for agents who have a very preferred book of business to be able to give us from a new business perspective. And we are seeing early signs that agents, certain agents, not all, are feeling that this is a very viable solution for them. And we're very, very optimistic about the future of the ASI Progressive relationship. It is going to be small for some time. Recognize this zone of preferred customers who are looking for home and auto is about 43% of the marketplace. Actually, I can even make that a little higher the way we define things, but it's a big chunk of the marketplace. It is a big chuck of the marketplace that we have extraordinary low penetration in. And agents have a very large part of that marketplace. So for us to be able to be on the verge of taking something to agents, that really does give them the opportunity to have a coordinated bundle of home and auto, is actually very exciting, and I think that excitement is spilling over from agents. So that question will be a good question. We'll have more data on exactly our progress a year from now. But I would say that's a very optimistic part of our outlook for next year."

I think we all want to know sort of where Sandy settles out and I'm sure every insurance company right now is doing the best to give what they can. Let me tell you what I know and then try to avoid saying things that we simply don't know. Overnight reporting, I expect has probably bumped us up to about a 6,000 claims. So we've got about 6,000 claims, that's a little higher than the number I had last night, but I suspect that, that's well on its way to that number. Think of that as 2/3 flood, 1/3 wind. About just short of 80% of it is New York, New Jersey, the rest would be another 10% Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and then obviously, other states that you all know are affected. That's sort of what we know right now. Spud [ph] claims for us are probably going to be, more often than not, total losses. So order is not good for cars. So we have some estimates. We don't know exactly where and we have great models, but all models are exactly that. Don't know where the reporting will end. It's the advantage for you and for us. We will release results in about 12 days or whatever that is, 12 to 15 days, something like that, for October. And literally, as every hour goes by, the development of claim reporting is helping us. So we'll actually have a pretty good estimate of our exposure by the time we will produce results in about 12 or 13 days. So far, 6,000 claims. I don't want to even speculate as to where that is. If I gave you sort of a ballpark-ish thing, you would sort of maybe take it the wrong way, but I suspect we're seeing half of the claims we're getting or in that neighborhood. So, but there are people, clearly, as we all know, without power and so on and so forth. So these reporting patterns might be just a little bit different than the experience. As you would expect from Progressive and hopefully, all other insurance companies at this point, the job #1 is getting everybody back to the conditions that they can move on with their lives. So we have deployed and we are active, as you would expect, in the marketplace with resources and doing a great job for the people that have reported their claims. And hopefully, we can get as many of the unreported claims in within the next few days so we can get on those as quickly as possible. Hopefully, for any of you listening that were affected by the storm, hopefully, you're able to get your lives back to a situation that's comfortable for you or your families or whatever. So that event, insurance companies, I think in general, are stepping up and I know that Progressive will step up really well."

The easy answer for you for our outlook right now on bodily injury, which is one of our clearly most important trend estimates, both for pricing and for reserving, 4 to 6, 3 to 6. Don't want to be vague there, but that's sort of a range that feels about right to us. So and frankly, if I go back in my career, sort of 3 to 5 is being a fairly good estimate of bodily injury trend which is largely reflective of medical costs as one of the underlying drivers of it. So that's our assumptions going forward. So what we've talked about, and I discussed in the letter, they would sort of taken a shot at rates, we've gotten back to margins that we think are about right, recognize trend is always ongoing, so we're going to have to price that in. And our current estimate of trend going forward is sort of that the 3 to 5, 4 to 6 kind of range on bodily injury. So far, frequency, if I had to sum up frequency, it's mostly noise, plus or minus 1% on most coverages. So not a lot of frequency as the big driver of things. That can get awkward if that's the driver. So it's mostly a severity issue, and I would say if you're using your models or your estimation or you're thinking about how Progressive might act, we're thinking around 3 to 5 in bodily injury trend."

And frankly, I would say this, volume-wise, i",614,"Yes. Probably mixed bag, to be honest, our volume of people actually taking the Test Drive has underperformed our internal estimates as we formulate estimates on everything even if we haven't done them before. And frankly, I would say this, volume-wise, is under our estimations. So just call it the way it is. Certainly, we got an awful lot of interest or clicks, but I'm not sure that, that necessarily is the operative measure. Of those that ultimately take the trial, the funnel that we had expected is a lot of the estimates we had made that are panning out. So actually, we are taking people all the way through the funnel, and the good news is that of those that are self-identifying and taking the test, a very large number of them are actually getting the opportunity to get a discount off of what our rates otherwise would have been. Who's taking the test? That actually is quite a nice positive for us. If I just focus on the 3 companies, the 3 auto companies that are, by market share, larger than us, we have more than 50% of the people who are taking the Test Drive are actually distributed amongst those 3 companies. So it is actually very encouraging for us that while Test Drive is not likely, nor was it ever designed, to try to get at the shopper who was going to be shopping in the next day, next week, next month. This was to try and get people to sort of think about shopping who would not otherwise have shopped, I would expect to get market share from companies that, perhaps, maybe had more entrenched customers. And that seems to be happening. So I'm very happy with the mix of customers that are taking us up. That mix is flowing through to the sales. And again, I don't want to overstate, the numbers are not sort of dramatic enough to really move the needle. So everything we had hoped for in Test Drive is coming through, except the volume is less than we would've hoped. So what are we doing about that? We are clearly very encouraged that our understanding, the public understanding of Snapshot/Test Drive, and I'll blend the 2 here a little bit, is about 56% awareness. So the awareness of this concept, which if you think about it, is still relatively new to the industry, is actually now quite high amongst the consuming public. The attribution to Progressive is about 84%. So people actually know about what it is and they attribute it to us. I would tell you, and this is a little looser, that while there is a general understanding, there is still a fair amount of ambiguity as to exactly what to do about it and what it will do for me. As a result, we have been doing consumer research and we have a new campaign targeted that will be quite different than we've done before. So a new campaign to try and inspire people to better understand what Snapshot/Test Drive can do and will do for them. So in short, really happy with some of the mix issues that are coming through. Really happy with the fact that people are getting discounts, and then clearly, those discounts, by the way, translate into higher satisfaction scores, which translate into higher retention scores. So the kind of flow-through to the funnel is absolutely a positive flow-through, we just need to have more volume through the funnel and to that end, we've got some, what I consider to be, quite interesting marketing ideas and they will manifest themselves in the first quarter next year."

If you choose to take advertising up, what -- how should we think about the normal, kind of lag, between when you spend and when you actually see the growth show up in terms of policy counts and then ultimately, in earnings? And I guess, the reason I'm asking is because the data that I've seen, which is actually a little bit more focused on life insurance than PNC, is that it's, for Direct response that it's often -- it often takes 6 to 8 months to actually get scale in the response rate.

And when prospects -- prospects being people who quote with us  --and likewise when we increase it, we see a return, but I would also say it probably does differ a little bit based upon media type. What I mean by that, for example, if we were to spend more or less on paid search, where people who are looking for car insurance, you know there are shoppers in the marketplace, there, you clearly see a very fast reaction to increases in spend and bid prices and ranking and people quoting with you. TV, radio and other media types might be a little bit of a different immediate response versus lag function. But when we -- generally speaking, when we change our ad spend, we will see a corresponding activity in terms of the number of people quoting with us fairly fast."

So expect to see this be very dynamic in change and reflect. You mentioned this sort of cliff, that's a self-imposed cliff. We have said very clearly that we had a lot of intellectual property. In fact, our sixth patent, we've been told that our sixth patent will be awarded here very shortly. And we've been very clear to the marketplace that we're willing to license this starting the second quarter of 2015. And between that time, we'll be very clear that we don't think people should be infringing on the things that have been a significant amount of energy and work for us and have that patent protection. So we'll protect ourselves during that period of time, but we invite them to show interest in licensing if they so wish. By that time, we'll just continue to push, push, push. But this is clearly something that is very exciting. There is no question. There can be no question. This is an underwriting variable that gives us insight to driving behavior and segmentation that no other variable has given us to date, at least in the same way. How we get that through to people and how we market it is something that we're going to keep pushing at. And I wish I could get you an answer and say, ""Yes, we have got sort of the killer app in our back pocket. "" It's not likely to be that way. The more people try it, as I did note the awareness level of it, that's a pretty -- maybe I'm kidding myself, but I think that's a pretty cool thing to have more than 50% of the consuming public aware of something like this.

That seems to be -- and I'm just going to say, that's more under control now. So, and we're getting a better handle on what those true costs will be. So that's less concerning. Secondarily in Florida, there have been a requirement for state -- for carriers to file a PIP adjusted rate effective -- what was it? November 1 -- or October 1. October 1, even though the rules and regulations that actually it applies to don't start until January 1. So we've taken those rate adjustments and we feel reasonably comfortable with it. But in general, we're seeing much more controlled severity in Florida PIP, but if you know anything about PIP, you don't want to make too many assessments that are too long term. So far, it seems to be a little bit quieter in the last 60 days."
