I'll cover a few key highlights for the year, and then turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our CFO, to review our results in more detail. 
As you know by now, net income for the full year 2011 was $2.63 per share, as compared to $3.07 in the prior year. While net income was down year-over-year, it has positive developments in several of our key subsidiaries. But before I discuss our individual businesses, let's take a moment to focus on the strategic management of Loews. 
As I said before, we focus on 3 basic strategic principles, all of the goals of building long-term shareholder value. First, we constantly focus on making opportune investments and acquisitions that position us for future growth. This past year, Loews did not make acquisitions at a holding company level. However, we did facilitate significant investments at 2 of our subsidiaries, Boardwalk and HighMount, that should serve to greatly enhance long-term value of those companies and ultimately, Loews.
Our second basic principle is to create long-term value -- our second basic principle to create long-term value is to effectively manage and allocate Loews' capital. In that regard, in 2011, we spent $718 million buying back 18.2 million shares of Loews' common stock, an investment which we think enhances value for all those shareholders.
And third, we constantly work to enhance our subsidiaries operating performance and capital structure. In 2011 Loews and our subsidiaries continue to weather the economic storm while positioning ourselves for the future. Our subsidiaries made great progress in meeting this strategic imperative they set to make their business and operations stronger and better able to compete in any economic climate. I'm very pleased with the progress that each of our subsidiaries is making.
With respect to our subsidiaries, let's first take a look at CNA. The company continues to work towards its main strategic goals of improving the market position and profitability of the core CNA situation. CNA is focusing on underwriting and pricing discipline, seeking growth while continuing to build its balance sheet. Let me share 4 points that underscores CNA's success. First, CNA's positive rate increases, solid business retention and strong new business have all resulted in premium growth across the P&C businesses. 
Second, 2011 was the fifth consecutive year of favorable prior year P&C loss development to CNA. 
Third, CNA's book value per common share increased to $42.90 at year-end 2011, which reflects continued improvement in CNA's capital position. 
And lastly, CNA continued its efforts to simplify, strengthen and focus its organization. In that regard, CNA sold its 50% ownership interest in First Insurance Company of Hawaii in August and acquired in June the minority shares of CNA Surety that it did not previously own.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond continues to improve the capabilities of its fleet while maintaining its focus on prudent capital allocation. Diamond recently announced its plans to construct a deepwater semisubmersible rig, mainly ocean, that is scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter of 2013. Diamond anticipates that there is significant demand from operators from new deepwater units and this rig should be ideally suited to meet that demand. Diamond will construct the ocean on its utilizing an existing home of a cold stack unit, which will allow the rig to be built and placed into service in approximately half the time and half the cost of current new build. Longtime Diamond watchers maybe saying that they've seen this movie before. I'd say I like the ending. 
The new rig, along with the 3 ultra-deepwater drillships under construction in Korea, will be another step in accomplishing Diamond goal in reviewing and upgrading its fleet. Over the last 5 years, Diamond has ordered, built or purchased 8 units capable of operating in the war ultra-deepwater.
Shifting our focus the Boardwalk. The company is in full growth mode. It is pursuing its strategy to look for projects that leverage board books for asset and diversify its services and geographic footprint. In the past few months, the Boardwalk management team has made significant progress on this front. 
Just today, the company announced an outstanding news, and major project in liquids-rich Eagle Ford shale. Boardwalk will be building 55 miles of the gathering pipeline and the natural gas liquids processing plant. Long-term fee-based agreement are already in place with anchor tenant oil and talisman for half of the processing plant's capacity. Boardwalk is in discussions with other producers for the remaining capacity.
As Stan Horton reviewed on the Boardwalk call earlier today, our Boardwalk has approximately $875 million of growth in acquisition opportunities, which includes the Eagle Ford shale project, the Marcellus gas gathering project and the recent acquisition of the panel and Hattiesburg storage and pipeline assets now called HP storage. As you may recall, HP storage was acquired through a joint venture with an affiliate of the Loews owned general partner. Boardwalk owns % of the joint venture and may acquire the remaining 80% from Loews.
Let's now shift to HighMount and the natural gas market. We remain optimistic about natural gas prices over the long term. But for the past 6 months, HighMount has taken steps to diversify its business. HighMount has acquired acreage believed to be rich in oil and natural gas liquids, which currently offers better economics for drilling and natural gas. 
Consistent with this strategy, in the third quarter, HighMount purchased a working interest in approximately 70,000 net acres of land in Oklahoma, that we believe to contain oil-rich liquids. HighMount plans to begin drilling this month. In addition, HighMount is pursuing drilling programs in the North field directed at geologic zones that the company anticipates will produce a higher mix of oils and liquids.
Finally, let's turn to Loews Hotels. I'd like to welcome Paul Wessel who recently joined us as the new President and CEO of Loews Hotels. With more than 35 years experience in the hotel industry, Paul's understanding of the hospitality business is a great asset to Loews Hotels. In 1987, he founded the Capstone Hotel Company, which became with the industry's largest hotel owners with over 110 hotels and $3 billion in assets. Most recently, he served as a member of the Board of Directors of Hotels, providing strategic guidance for its operations and property-acquisition activity. Paul will look to grow Loews Hotels in an asset-like manner while building on our successful formula of operating unique properties with exceptional service.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Pete Keegan."

Loews today reported net income of $268 million or $0.67 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to $466 million or $1.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Loews today reported net income of $268 million or $0.67 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to $466 million or $1.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower investment income from limited partnership results of CNA and the increase to insurance reserves for CNA's payout annuity business. The fourth quarter also reflects lower earnings the Diamond Offshore.
Loews' net income for the full year was $1.1 billion worth $2.63 per share compared to $1.3 billion or $3.07 per share in 2010. Book value per share for Loews increased to $47.49 at December 31, 2011, as compared to $44.51 at December 31, 2010, approximately a 7% increase.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the fourth quarter was $192 million as compared to $297 million in 2010 and $569 million for the full year of 2011 compared to $609 million for the prior year. The decrease was due to lower investment income from limited partnership results of $57 million and $104 million increase to insurance reserves through its payout annuity business. 
As discussed in the CNA call, the underlying core P&C business continues to show improvement in underwriting profitably and growth. CNA also continues its discipline reserve and practices. In the fourth quarter, the P&C business benefited from $250 million of pretax favorable prior year loss development. CNA has had 20 consecutive quarters of favorable prior year result development.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $88 million compared to $113 million in the prior year quarter and $451 million for the full year 2011 as compared to $446 million from the year before. Results for the fourth quarter were impacted by a higher number of planned downtime days for scheduled maintenance survey, mobilization upgrades, while the full year results benefited from historically low unanticipated downtime.
Boardwalk Pipeline's net income for the fourth quarter in decreased to $21 million from $34 million in the prior year quarter and $77 million for the full year in 2011 compared to $114 million from the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to one-time items in both 2011 and 2010. Absent those items, the quarter was basically flat year-over-year. Boardwalk recently raised $217 million in an equity offering.
HighMount's net income for the fourth quarter decreased to $12 million from $21 million in the prior year quarter and $62 million for the full year in 2011 compared to $77 million from the prior year. Results are primarily due to decreased sales volumes stemming from a reduction in HighMount's drilling activity and declines in natural gas prices. 
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the fourth quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was $10.7 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.71 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 656,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.36 per barrel; and oil production was 72,000 barrels at an average price of $88.74 per barrel. 
HighMount has hedges in place for about 52% of its total production for 2012 at an average price of $5.79, and has hedges in place for about 16% of its total production for 2013 at an average price of $5.44. During the fourth quarter, HighMount refinanced its outstanding debt, which included a $400 million capital contribution from Loews.
Loews Hotels had improved results for the quarter and year. Net income increased to $5 million for the fourth quarter in 2011 from breakeven in the prior year. For the full year in 2011, net income rose to $13 million as compared to $1 million for 2010. The improved results were due to the improvement of business in leisure travel with particularly strong results for Loews at the Miami Beach and Orlando Hotels. 
Holding company cash and investments as of December 31, 2011, totaled $3.3 billion as compared to $4 billion at September 30, 2011. In the fourth quarter, we made capital contributions of $400 million to HighMount for the refinancing of its term loans and $106 million to fund the acquisition of working interest in oil and gas properties. 
In addition, we invested $285 million for an 80% equity ownership and the joint venture with Boardwalk Pipeline. We received $159 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the fourth quarter 2011. We also repurchased 800,000 shares of our common stock for $28 million.
As of December 31, 2011, there were 396.6 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding and that. And that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Mary."

Price going up is really appreciated by us. But in order for demand to increase, price needs to be down. Spot gas price is now are about $2.50 per Mcf. That's the equivalent to about $15 per barrel of oil. Oil is currently [indiscernible] trading at $97 a barrel and Brent crude, which has really become the international marker is $115 a barrel. So gas is very, very cheap. And what we've seen is we've had a number of years now where gas has traded under 30% of the price of oil, and what I what that is doing, I believe, is it getting people to think about changing from oil to natural gas. I spoke to somebody this weekend and told me that he we spend a few thousand dollars in his commercial building in New York City switching from heating oil to natural gas. So all manner of projects to put natural gas either compressed or LNG and service station so that trucks and vehicles and private passenger automobiles can consume natural gas. We're going to have closure of a relatively number of coal-fired power plants that will then be replaced by natural gas. So there's no doubt in my mind that natural gas consumption will increase rather significantly over the next 4 or 5 years. Combined with that, there will also be in the next several years from LNG export facilities that will be able to -- each facility will be able to about 1.5% of daily natural gas production. And that will be read by the market as additional demand for natural gas. So in my mind, there's a lot of things that will increase natural gas demand. So all of these things require capital expenditures. It will take some time for that to be able to be realized. But my belief is it will come online and in the past several years, we've seen natural gas consumption grow dramatically faster than oil consumption in the United States and I think that's going to continue."

And now, spot gas prices at $2.50 and with hedges running off for ENP companies, I think, in some boardrooms, there's concern that's moving to fear that's going to move to panic. And I think, the decline in rigs is just one symptom of that. Now we'll have to see how this all plays out over the next 6 months to a year, but it looks like we are going to end the heating season with record amounts of natural gas that's going to put some pressure on natural gas prices. We're also seeing the time spreads increasing because people think that natural gas will go up in the future, which is to some extent, benefiting Boardwalk Pipeline. I think though that it's going to take some time for the measured in a number of quarters for natural gas to really hit bottom and start to move up.

And in the first year, it went just about doubled to about $15 per Mcf. And now, gas prices have declined, I guess, 80% or so to under $3 an Mcf. Nobody is making money at these levels. And my guess is that even though HighMount is in public, obviously the value of our investment is lower today than it was when we made the investment. We did not anticipate the tremendous impact that frac-ing would have on the supply of natural gas. And likewise, I don't think that nobody really fully understood what that impact would be. Having said that, what's happened since then is that the cost of looking for natural gas just as the price of rigs and other services has come down. But nonetheless, at $2.50 or $3 an Mcf, virtually nobody can look for natural gas or dry gas and be profitable doing it. So my fearless forecast is that natural gas prices will go up over the coming quarters and years, and reach a equilibrium price that will still probably be lower than when we originally got into HighMount. Having said that,I am optimistic about HighMount's future. I'm am optimistic about the investment opportunities that we have there, and believe that we will be able to earn good rates of return on our investment in it."

I'll cover a few key highlights for the year, and then turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our CFO, to review our results in more detail. 
As you know by now, net income for the full year 2011 was $2.63 per share, as compared to $3.07 in the prior year. While net income was down year-over-year, it left positive developments of several of our key subsidiaries. But before I discuss our individual businesses, let's take a moment to focus on the strategic management of Loews. 
As I said before, we focus on 3 basic strategic principles, all with the goals of building long-term shareholder value. First, we constantly focus on making opportune investments and acquisitions that position us for future growth. This past year, Loews did not make any acquisitions at the holding company level. However, we did facilitate significant investments with at 2 of our subsidiaries, Boardwalk and HighMount, that should serve to greatly enhance long-term value of those companies and ultimately, Loews.
Our second basic principle is to create long-term value -- our second basic principle to create long-term value is to effectively manage and allocate Loews' capital. In that regard, in 2011, we spent $718 million buying back 18.2 million shares of Loews' common stock, an investment which we think significantly enhances value for all Loews' shareholders.
And third, we constantly work to enhance our subsidiaries' operating performance and capital structure. In 2011, Loews and our subsidiaries continue to weather the economic storm, while positioning ourselves for the future. Our subsidiaries made great progress in meeting the strategic imperative they set to make their business and operations stronger and better able to compete in any economic climate. I'm very pleased with the progress that each of our subsidiaries is making.
With respect to our subsidiaries, let's first take a look at CNA. The company continues to work towards its main strategic goals of improving the market position and profitability of the core team sea operation. CNA is focusing on underwriting and pricing discipline, seeking growth while continuing to build its balance sheet. Let me share 4 points that underscore CNA's success. 
First, CNA's positive rate increases, solid business retention and strong new business have all resulted in premium growth across the P&C businesses. Second, 2011 was the fifth consecutive year of favorable prior year P&C loss development to CNA. 
Third, CNA's book value per common share increased to $42.92 at year-end 2011, which reflects continued improvement in CNA's capital position. And lastly, CNA continued its efforts to simplify, strengthen and focus its organization. In that regard, CNA sold its 50% ownership interest in First Insurance Company of Hawaii in August and acquired in June the minority shares of CNA Surety that it did not previously own.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond continues to improve the capabilities of its fleet while maintaining its focus on prudent capital allocation. Diamond recently announced its plans to construct a deepwater semi-submersible rig, mainly Ocean Onyx, that is scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter of 2013. Diamond anticipates that there is significant demand from operators for new deepwater units and this rig should be ideally suited to meet that demand. 
Diamond will construct the Ocean Onyx, utilizing an existing hull of a cold stacked unit, which should allow the rig to be built and placed into service in approximately half the time and then half the cost of current new build. Longtime Diamond watchers may be saying that they've seen this movie before. I'd say I like the ending. 
The new rig, along with the 3 ultra-deepwater drillships under construction in Korea, will be another step in accomplishing Diamond's goals of reviewing and upgrading its fleet. Over the last 5 years, Diamond has ordered, built or purchased 8 units capable of operating in deep- or ultra-deepwater.
Shifting our focus to Boardwalk. The company is in full-growth mode. It is pursuing its strategy to look for projects that leverage Boardwalk's core asset and diversifies its services and geographic footprint. In the past few months, the Boardwalk management team has made significant progress on this front. 
Just today, the company announced an outstanding news and major projects in the liquids-rich Eagle Ford shale. Boardwalk will be building 55 miles of the gathering pipeline and the natural gas liquids processing plant. Long-term fee-based agreements are already in place with anchored tenants, Statoil and Talisman, for half of the processing plant's capacity. Boardwalk is in discussions with other producers for the remaining capacity.
As Stan Horton reviewed on the Boardwalk call earlier today, our Boardwalk has approximately $875 million of growth in acquisition opportunities, which include the Eagle Ford Shale project, the Marcellus gas gathering project and the recent acquisition of the Petal and Hattiesburg storage and pipeline assets, now called HP Storage. As you may recall, HP storage was acquired through a joint venture with an affiliate of the Loews-owned general partner. Boardwalk owns 20% of the joint venture and may acquire the remaining 80% from Loews.
Let's now shift to HighMount and the Natural Gas market. We remain optimistic about natural gas prices over the long term. But for the past 6 months, HighMount has taken steps to diversify its business. HighMount has acquired acreage believed to be rich in oil and natural gas liquids, which currently offers dramatically better economics for drilling and natural gas. 
Consistent with this strategy, in the third quarter, HighMount purchased a working interest in approximately 70,000 net acres of land in the Oklahoma, that we believe to contain oil-rich liquids. HighMount plans to begin drilling this month. In addition, HighMount is pursuing drilling programs in the North field directed at geologic zones, that the company anticipates will produce a higher mix of oil and liquid.
Finally, let's turn to Loews Hotels. I'd like to welcome Paul Whetsell, who has recently joined us as the new President and CEO of Loews Hotels. With more than 35 years of experience in the Hotel industry, Paul's understanding of the hospitality business is a great asset to Loews Hotels. In 1987, he founded the CapStar Hotel Company, which became one of the industry's largest hotel owners, with over 110 hotels and $3 billion in assets. Most recently, he served as a member of the Board of Directors of Virgin Hotels, providing strategic guidance for its operations and property-acquisition activity. Paul will look to grow Loews Hotels in an asset-like manner, while building on our successful formula of operating unique properties with exceptional service.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Pete Keegan."

The decrease in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower investment income from limited partnership results of CNA and the increase to insurance reserves for CNA's payout annuity business. The fourth quarter also reflects lower earnings of Diamond Offshore.
Loews' net income for the full year was $1.1 billion or $2.63 per share compared to $1.3 billion or $3.07 per share in 2010. Book value per share for Loews increased to $47.49 at December 31, 2011, as compared to $44.51 at December 31, 2010, approximately a 7% increase.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the fourth quarter was $192 million as compared to $297 million in 2010 and $569 million for the full year of 2011 compared to $609 million for the prior year. The decrease was due to lower investment income from limited partnership results of $57 million and $104 million increase in insurance reserves through its payout annuity business. 
As discussed in the CNA call, the underlying core P&C business continued to show improvement in underwriting profitably and growth. CNA also continues its discipline reserving and practices. In the fourth quarter, the P&C business benefited from $250 million of pre-tax favorable prior year loss development. CNA has had 20 consecutive quarters of favorable prior year reserve development.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $88 million compared to $113 million in the prior year quarter and $451 million for the full year 2011 as compared to $446 million from the year before. Results for the fourth quarter were impacted by a higher number of planned downtime days for scheduled maintenance, survey, mobilization and upgrades, while the full year results benefited from historically low unanticipated equipment downtime.
Boardwalk Pipeline's net income for the fourth quarter decreased to $21 million from $34 million in the prior-year quarter and $77 million for the full year in 2011 compared to $114 million from the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to one-time items in both 2011 and 2010. Absent those items, the quarter was basically flat year-over-year. Boardwalk recently raised $217 million in an equity offering.
HighMount's net income for the fourth quarter decreased to $12 million from $21 million in the prior year quarter and $62 million for the full year in 2011 compared to $77 million from the prior year. Results are primarily due to decreased sales volumes stemming from a reduction in HighMount's drilling activity and declines in natural gas prices. 
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the fourth quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was $10.7 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.71 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 656,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.36 per barrel; and oil production was 72,000 barrels at an average price of $88.74 per barrel. 
HighMount has hedges in place for about 52% of its total production for 2012 at an average price of $5.79, and has hedges in place for about 16% of its total production for 2013 at an average price of $5.44. During the fourth quarter, HighMount refinanced its outstanding debt, which included a $400 million capital contribution from Loews. 
Loews Hotels had improved results for the quarter and year. Net income increased to $5 million for the fourth quarter in 2011 from breakeven in the prior year. For the full year in 2011, net income rose to $13 million as compared to $1 million for 2010. The improved results were due to the improvement of business in leisure travel with particularly strong results for Loews at the Miami Beach and Orlando Hotels. 
Holding company cash and investments as of December 31, 2011, totaled $3.3 billion as compared to $4 billion at September 30, 2011. In the fourth quarter, we made capital contributions of $400 million to HighMount for the refinancing of its term loans and $106 million to fund the acquisition of working interest in oil and gas properties. 
In addition, we invested $285 million for an 80% equity ownership in the joint venture with Boardwalk Pipeline. We received $159 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2011. We also repurchased 800,000 shares of our common stock for $28 million.
As of December 31, 2011, there were 396.6 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. 
And that concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the call back over to Mary."

The thing is going to move demand up as price is going down, our price is going up. Price going up is really appreciated by us. But in order for demand to increase, price needs to be down.

Price going up is really appreciated by us. But in order for demand to increase, price needs to be down. Gas price -- spot gas price is now about $2.50 in Mcf. That's the equivalent to about $15 per barrel of oil. Oil is currently trading -- West Texas Intermediate is trading at $97 a barrel and Brent Crude, which has really become the international marker, is at $115 a barrel. So gas is very, very cheap. And what we've seen is that we've had a number of years now where gas has traded under 30% of the price of oil. And what I what that is doing, I believe, is that it is getting people to think about changing from oil to natural gas. I spoke to somebody just this weekend, who told me that he spent a few hundred thousand dollars in his commercial building in New York City, switching from heating oil to natural gas. So all manner of projects to put natural gas, either compressed or LNG, into service stations so that trucks and delivery vehicles and private passenger automobiles can consume natural gas. We're going to have closure of a relatively large number of coal-fired power plants that will then be replaced by natural gas. So there's no doubt in my mind that natural gas consumption will increase rather significantly over the next 4 or 5 years. Combined with that, there will also be, in the next several years, as LNG export facilities that will be able to -- each facility will be able to handle about 1.5% of daily natural gas production. So -- and that will be read by the market as additional demand for natural gas. So in my mind, there's a lot of things that will increase natural gas demand. The only problem is that since virtually all of these things require significant capital expenditures, it will take some time in order for that to be realized. But my belief is it will come online and in the past several years, we've seen natural gas consumption grow dramatically faster than oil consumption in the United States, and I think that's going to continue."

Now we'll have to see how this all plays out over the next 6 months to a year, but it looks like we are going to end the heating season with record amounts of natural gas that's going to put some pressure on natural gas prices. We're also seeing the time spreads increasing because people think that natural gas will go up in the future, which is, to some extent, benefiting Boardwalk Pipeline.

And in the first year, it went through -- it just about doubled to about $15 per Mcf. And now gas prices have declined, I guess, 80% or so to under $3 an Mcf. Nobody is making money at these levels. And my guess is that even though HighMount isn't public, that obviously, the value of our investment is lower today than it was when we made the investment. We did not anticipate the tremendous impact that frac-ing would have on the supply of natural gas. And likewise, I don't think that anybody really fully understood what that impact would be. Having said that, what's happened since then is that the cost of looking for natural gas, just as the price of rigs and other services has come down, but nonetheless, at $2.50 or $3 an Mcf, virtually, nobody can look for natural gas or dry gas and be profitable doing it. So my fearless forecast is that natural gas prices will go up over the coming quarters and years, and reach a equilibrium price that will still probably be lower than when we originally got into HighMount. Having said that, I am optimistic about HighMount's future. I'm optimistic about the investment opportunities that we have there, and believe that we will be able to earn good rates of return on our investment in it."

I'll cover a few key highlights for the year, and then turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our CFO, to review our results in more detail. 
As you know by now, net income for the full year 2011 was $2.63 per share, as compared to $3.07 in the prior year. While net income was down year-over-year, it left positive developments of several of our key subsidiaries. But before I discuss our individual businesses, let's take a moment to focus on the strategic management of Loews. 
As I said before, we focus on 3 basic strategic principles, all with the goal of building long-term shareholder value. First, we constantly focus on making opportune investments and acquisitions that position us for future growth. This past year, Loews did not make any acquisitions at the holding company level. However, we did facilitate significant investments with at 2 of our subsidiaries, Boardwalk and HighMount, that should serve to greatly enhance long-term value of those companies and ultimately, Loews.
Our second basic principle is to create long-term value -- our second basic principle to create long-term value is to effectively manage and allocate Loews' capital. In that regard, in 2011, we spent $718 million buying back 18.2 million shares of Loews' common stock, an investment which we think significantly enhances value for all Loews' shareholders.
And third, we constantly work to enhance our subsidiaries' operating performance and capital structure. In 2011, Loews and our subsidiaries continue to weather the economic storm, while positioning ourselves for the future. Our subsidiaries made great progress in meeting the strategic imperative they set to make their business and operations stronger and better able to compete in any economic climate. I'm very pleased with the progress that each of our subsidiaries is making.
With respect to our subsidiaries, let's first take a look at CNA. The company continues to work towards its main strategic goals of improving the market position and profitability of the core team sea [ph] operation. CNA is focusing on underwriting and pricing discipline, seeking growth while continuing to build its balance sheet. Let me share 4 points that underscore CNA's success. 
First, CNA's positive rate increases, solid business retention and strong new business have all resulted in premium growth across the P&C businesses. Second, 2011 was the fifth consecutive year of favorable prior year P&C loss development to CNA. 
Third, CNA's book value per common share increased to $42.92 at year-end 2011, which reflects continued improvement in CNA's capital position. And lastly, CNA continued its efforts to simplify, strengthen and focus its organization. In that regard, CNA sold its 50% ownership interest in First Insurance Company of Hawaii in August and acquired in June the minority shares of CNA Surety that it did not previously own.
Turning to Diamond Offshore. Diamond continues to improve the capabilities of its fleet while maintaining its focus on prudent capital allocation. Diamond recently announced its plans to construct a deepwater semi-submersible rig, mainly Ocean Onyx, that is scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter of 2013. Diamond anticipates that there is significant demand from operators for new deepwater units and this rig should be ideally suited to meet that demand. 
Diamond will construct the Ocean Onyx, utilizing an existing hull of a cold stacked unit, which should allow the rig to be built and placed into service in approximately half the time and at half the cost of current new build. Longtime Diamond watchers may be saying that they've seen this movie before. I'd say I like the ending. 
The new rig, along with the 3 ultra-deepwater drill ships under construction in Korea, will be another step in accomplishing Diamond's goals of renewing and upgrading its fleet. Over the last 5 years, Diamond has ordered, built or purchased 8 units capable of operating in deep- or ultra-deepwater.
Shifting our focus to Boardwalk. The company is in full-growth mode. It is pursuing its strategy to look for projects that leverage Boardwalk's core asset and diversifies its services and geographic footprint. In the past few months, the Boardwalk management team has made significant progress on these fronts. 
Just today, the company announced an outstanding news and major projects in the liquids-rich Eagle Ford shale. Boardwalk will be building 55 miles of the gathering pipeline and the natural gas liquids processing plant. Long-term fee-based agreements are already in place with anchored tenants, Statoil and Talisman, for half of the processing plant's capacity. Boardwalk is in discussions with other producers for the remaining capacity.
As Stan Horton reviewed on the Boardwalk call earlier today, our Boardwalk has approximately $875 million of growth in acquisition opportunities, which include the Eagle Ford Shale project, the Marcellus gas gathering project and the recent acquisition of the Petal and Hattiesburg storage and pipeline assets, now called HP Storage. As you may recall, HP storage was acquired through a joint venture with an affiliate of the Loews-owned general partner. Boardwalk owns 20% of the joint venture and may acquire the remaining 80% from Loews.
Let's now shift to HighMount and the Natural Gas market. We remain optimistic about natural gas prices over the long term. But for the past 6 months, HighMount has taken steps to diversify its business. HighMount has acquired acreage believed to be rich in oil and natural gas liquids, which currently offers dramatically better economics for drilling and natural gas. 
Consistent with this strategy, in the third quarter, HighMount purchased a working interest in approximately 70,000 net acres of land in the Oklahoma, that we believe to contain oil-rich liquids. HighMount plans to begin drilling this month. In addition, HighMount is pursuing drilling programs in the Sonora field directed at geologic zones that the company anticipates will produce a higher mix of oil and liquid.
Finally, let's turn to Loews Hotels. I'd like to welcome Paul Whetsell, who has recently joined us as the new President and CEO of Loews Hotels. With more than 35 years of experience in the Hotel industry, Paul's understanding of the hospitality business is a great asset to Loews Hotels. In 1987, he founded the CapStar Hotel Company, which became one of the industry's largest hotel owners, with over 110 hotels and $3 billion in assets. Most recently, he served as a member of the Board of Directors of Virgin Hotels, providing strategic guidance for its operations and property-acquisition activity. Paul will look to grow Loews Hotels in an asset-like manner, while building on our successful formula of operating unique properties with exceptional service.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Pete Keegan."

Loews today reported net income of $268 million or $0.67 per share for the fourth quarter 2011 as compared to $466 million or $1.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in the fourth quarter was primarily du",784,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Loews today reported net income of $268 million or $0.67 per share for the fourth quarter 2011 as compared to $466 million or $1.12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower investment income from limited partnership results of CNA and the increase to insurance reserves for CNA's payout annuity business. The fourth quarter also reflects lower earnings of Diamond Offshore.
Loews' net income for the full year was $1.1 billion or $2.63 per share compared to $1.3 billion or $3.07 per share in 2010. Book value per share for Loews increased to $47.49 at December 31, 2011, as compared to $44.51 at December 31, 2010, approximately a 7% increase.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the fourth quarter was $192 million as compared to $297 million in 2010 and $569 million for the full year of 2011 compared to $609 million for the prior year. The decrease was due to lower investment income from limited partnership results of $57 million and $104 million increase in insurance reserves through its payout annuity business. 
As discussed in the CNA call, the underlying core P&C business continued to show improvement in underwriting profitably and growth. CNA also continues its discipline reserving practices. In the fourth quarter, the P&C business benefited from $250 million of pre-tax favorable prior year loss development. CNA has had 20 consecutive quarters of favorable prior year reserve development.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $88 million compared to $113 million in the prior year quarter and $451 million for the full year 2011 as compared to $446 million from the year before. Results for the fourth quarter were impacted by a higher number of planned downtime days for scheduled maintenance, survey, mobilization and upgrades, while the full year results benefited from historically low unanticipated equipment downtime.
Boardwalk Pipeline's net income for the fourth quarter decreased to $21 million from $34 million in the prior-year quarter and $77 million for the full year in 2011 compared to $114 million from the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributable to one-time items in both 2011 and 2010. Absent those items, the quarter was basically flat year-over-year. Boardwalk recently raised $217 million in an equity offering.
HighMount's net income for the fourth quarter decreased to $12 million from $21 million in the prior year quarter and $62 million for the full year in 2011 compared to $77 million from the prior year. Results are primarily due to decreased sales volumes stemming from a reduction in HighMount's drilling activity and declines in natural gas prices. 
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the fourth quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was $10.7 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.71 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 656,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.36 per barrel; and oil production was 72,000 barrels at an average price of $88.74 per barrel. 
HighMount has hedges in place for about 52% of its total production for 2012 at an average price of $5.79, and has hedges in place for about 16% of its total production for 2013 at an average price of $5.44. During the fourth quarter, HighMount refinanced its outstanding debt, which included a $400 million capital contribution from Loews. 
Loews Hotels had improved results for the quarter and year. Net income increased to $5 million for the fourth quarter in 2011 from breakeven in the prior year. For the full year in 2011, net income rose to $13 million as compared to $1 million for 2010. The improved results were due to the improvement of business in leisure travel with particularly strong results for Loews at the Miami Beach and Orlando Hotels. 
Holding company cash and investments as of December 31, 2011, totaled $3.3 billion as compared to $4 billion at September 30, 2011. In the fourth quarter, we made capital contributions of $400 million to HighMount for the refinancing of its term loans and $106 million to fund the acquisition of working interest in oil and gas properties. 
In addition, we invested $285 million for an 80% equity ownership in a joint venture with Boardwalk Pipeline. We received $159 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2011. We also repurchased 800,000 shares of our common stock for $28 million.
As of December 31, 2011, there were 396.6 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. 
And that concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the call back over to Mary."

Price going up is really appreciated by us. But in order for demand to increase, price needs to be down. Gas price -- spot gas price is now about $2.50 in Mcf. That's the equivalent to about $15 per barrel of oil. Oil is currently trading -- West Texas Intermediate is trading at $97 a barrel and Brent Crude, which has really become the international marker, is at $115 a barrel. So gas is very, very cheap. And what we've seen is that we've had a number of years now where gas has traded under 30% of the price of oil. And what I what that is doing, I believe, is that it is getting people to think about changing from oil to natural gas. I spoke to somebody just this weekend, who told me that he spent a few hundred thousand dollars in his commercial building in New York City, switching from heating oil to natural gas. So all manner of projects to put natural gas, either compressed or LNG, into service stations so that trucks and delivery vehicles and private passenger automobiles can consume natural gas. We're going to have closure of a relatively large number of coal-fired power plants that will then be replaced by natural gas. So there's no doubt in my mind that natural gas consumption will increase rather significantly over the next 4 or 5 years. Combined with that, there will also be, in the next several years, as LNG export facilities that will be able to -- each facility will be able to handle about 1.5% of daily natural gas production. So -- and that will be read by the market as additional demand for natural gas. So in my mind, there's a lot of things that will increase natural gas demand. The only problem is that since virtually all of these things require significant capital expenditures, it will take some time in order for that to be realized. But my belief is it will come online and in the past several years, we've seen natural gas consumption grow dramatically faster than oil consumption in the United States, and I think that's going to continue."

And I think that the decline in rigs is just one symptom of that. Now we'll have to see how this all plays out over the next 6 months to a year, but it looks like we are going to end the heating season with record amounts of natural gas that's going to put some pressure on natural gas prices. We're also seeing the time spreads increasing because people think that natural gas will go up in the future, which is, to some extent, benefiting Boardwalk Pipeline. I think though that it's going to take some time for the -- measured in a number of quarters for natural gas to really hit bottom and start to move up.

And in the first year, it went through -- it just about doubled to about $15 per Mcf. And now gas prices have declined, I guess, 80% or so to under $3 an Mcf. Nobody is making money at these levels. And my guess is that even though HighMount isn't public, that obviously, the value of our investment is lower today than it was when we made the investment. We did not anticipate the tremendous impact that frac-ing would have on the supply of natural gas. And likewise, I don't think that anybody really fully understood what that impact would be. Having said that, what's happened since then is that the cost of looking for natural gas, just as the price of rigs and other services has come down, but nonetheless, at $2.50 or $3 an Mcf, virtually, nobody can look for natural gas or dry gas and be profitable doing it. So my fearless forecast is that natural gas prices will go up over the coming quarters and years, and reach a equilibrium price that will still probably be lower than when we originally got into HighMount. Having said that, I am optimistic about HighMount's future. I'm optimistic about the investment opportunities that we have there, and believe that we will be able to earn good rates of return on our investment in it."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss Loews' first quarter results. Overall, our first quarter financial results were solid.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss Loews' first quarter results. Overall, our first quarter financial results were solid. As you know by now, we reported earnings per share of $0.92 for the quarter, which matched the $0.92 per share that Loews earned in the first quarter of 2011. Book value per share at quarter end was $48.96 per share, a 3.4% increase over our book value per share at year end. Underlying these financial results are the actions being taken by each of our subsidiaries and value creating strategies and to achieve operational exhibits. Let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries beginning with CNA. 
In the time of torment, CNA continues to improve its core P&C operations, which included specialty insurance and commercial insurance businesses. The CNA team is executing strategies to achieve a dual goals of growth and underwriting profitability. Adjusting for the sale of its 50% stake in First Insurance Company of Hawaii during the fourth quarter of 2011, CNA achieved growth in net premiums written in its CNA operations of 5%. The strong growth came from 3 main factors: Strong retention of existing business; rate increases on retained business; and attractive new business in targeted areas. 
By way of example, during the first quarter, CNA specialty and CNA commercial increased rates by 3% and 5%, respectively, with certain sub lines of business showing much stronger rate achievement. Additionally, the ratio of new to lost business is 1.4:1. This means that CNA's underwriting and marketing efforts are gaining traction.
CNA's 68.8% first quarter loss ratio before the impact of catastrophes in prior year development was essentially in line with the prior year quarter. The company's objective is to reduce its loss ratio materially from here. Rate increases, combined with improved underwriting discipline, are the keys to achieving this objective.
Finally, CNA took a major step in March when it reached an agreement to acquire Hardy Underwriting for $227 million. Hardy is a specialized loan underwriting with a respective market reputation and a long history of disciplined underwriting. The proposed acquisition will provide CNA with a key platform for international growth. Shareholders approve this transaction last Friday, and it's expected to close by the end of the second quarter.
Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a good first quarter despite net income being down 26% year-over-year. Diamond's quarterly earnings can vary meaningfully, as a result of such factors like survey downtime, rigs coming off contract and the cost associated with moving rigs from one locale to another. 
As we've discussed previously, Diamond continues its program of fleet renewal and has 3 ultra-deepwater drillships and one more semisubmersible rig under construction. The drillships are already contracted to begin working for Anadarko Petroleum at attractive day rates. The other 2 units are currently being marketed and should be able to benefit from the prevailing robust day rig environment. These 4 units are in addition to the 2 ultra-deepwater semi that Diamond purchased out of bankruptcy in early '09. And the four semis that were upgraded to ultra-deepwater status. We're encouraged about Diamond's market position and the future of offshore drilling business.
Turning to Boardwalk Pipeline. During this past quarter, Boardwalk purchased from Loews for $285 million the 80% equity interest in Boardwalk HP Storage that Loews had acquired to support Boardwalk's purchase of Loews storage assets in December. As we previously said, our intention was always to drop down our 80% stake when it made financial sense for Boardwalk to purchase. This transaction worked just as planned, and ultimately benefited both Boardwalk and Loews' shareholders. Boardwalk continues to pursue projects like Boardwalk HP storage that leverage Boardwalk's core asset, diversify its services in geographic footprint and generate growth. HP storage is a great example of that strategy in action. 
Another example is the Eagle Ford expansion project. Boardwalk announced in February that it had executed a long-term fee-based gathering and processing agreement with for approximately half of the processing plants capacity. Boardwalk's construction of the gathering lines and processing plants are continuing on schedule.
We don't typically spend much time on this call discussing Loews Hotels, but hopefully that will change in the quarters and years ahead. Paul Russel, who joined Loews Hotels as President and CEO in January has hit the ground running. All the Loews Hotels team are sharpening their focus and growing in key urban and resort market while at the same time, improving the performance and profitability of our existing properties. Renovations are either underway or eminent at several of our current hotels where growth opportunities are being continually renewed. As with all our subsidiaries, our goal at Loews Hotels is to create long-term value for all Loews' shareholders.
Finally, let me turn to HighMount E&P. Quite simply, low natural gas prices make life difficult for HighMount, as the company is predominantly a producer of natural gas. Last Friday, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas totaled at $2.06 per Mcf, the equivalent of oil selling for less than $12.5 a barrel.
The good news is that HighMount is not standing still. Instead, it is responding to this unprecedented environment by taking a number of steps, including materially scaling back dry gas development activity in the Permian Basin. Focusing development in the Permian Basin on gas-rich wells with high liquid yield and oil potential, specifically in the Wolfcamp Strada. And also acquiring and developing a core position in the Mississippian line that we believe will be profitable and profitable oil development opportunities for HighMount. HighMount is in the early stages of scaling up its efforts to produce more oil and liquids while current production is still dominated by dry gas. While we are encouraged by management's efforts to pursue projects that have the prospect of generating higher returns in the current environment.
HighMount recorded a non-cash fueling cash impairment charge of $28 million after taxes in the first quarter related to its carrying value of natural gas and oil properties. This non-cash accounting charge was a result of decline in natural gas prices. As prices remain unchanged through 2012 and holding all other assumptions constant, HighMount will incur non-cash after-tax fuel cost impairments that could range from approximately $400 million to $450 million for the full year of 2012, inclusive of the first quarter impairment.
As you know, fuel test and impairment charges are mandated by GAAP, not because gas is no longer in the ground, but simply because the accounting rules require us to value all of our reserves at current prices.
Before I turn the call over to Pete, I want to take a few moments to comment of the natural gas in the face of today's historically low prices. When putting today's natural gas price environment into context, I'd like to remind myself of what I call the second rule of economics, which is what has to happen, happens. Currently, gas prices are unsustainably low due to the combination of extraordinarily warm winter and the over production of shale gas. It is simply not economically viable today to drill a well for dry gas at $2, but a $2 per Mcf price. Like it or not, the natural gas prices this low, gas production will slow down and demand will increase. Eventually, we will arrive at an equilibrium price of natural gas, which I estimate to be at about $4.50 per Mcf, which is the BTU equivalent of $27 per barrel of oil, still a bearable bargain.
At that $4.50 price, United States can and will dramatically increase its production of natural gas. And at that price, there will still be an enormous incentive of consumption of natural gas to increase significantly. In fact, this is already happening. Diesel fuel consumers are currently making the capital investments necessary to switch to natural gas. Often with a 2-year payback on their investments. Not only will truckers and railroads convert to natural gas, but HighMount too is seriously analyzing the option of converting its drilling operation in the oil patch to natural gas from these. 
Due to improvements in frac-ing technologies, which are unlocking enormous amounts of gas shale hydrocarbon, the United States has a virtually unlimited supply of natural gas. This new abundant source of energy can, and will, in next decade transform our economy. With supply assured and prices low, natural gas consumption will certainly continue to increase. Power generation, transportation, industrial production and LNG exports from the U.S. should all combine to material enhance -- materially enhanced gas finance. While the U.S. maybe in for a few more years of unnaturally low gas prices and my belief is over the medium to long term, the most fundamental precept of economics, which is that relative prices drive demand will result in higher natural gas prices and a more favorable pricing environment for HighMount.
Now back to the business at hand, let me turn the call over to Pete for more details on the first quarter."

Loews Corporation today reported net income of $367 million or $0.92 per share for the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $379 million or $0.92 per share in the first quarter of 2011. A slight decrease in the first quarter was due to lower earnings at HighMount and Diamond Offshore. These decreases were offset partially by higher earnings of CNA and increased investment income at the holding company. CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the first quarter was $226 million as compared to $199 million in 2011. The increase was due to lower catastrophe losses in increased investment income especially in limited partnership results.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the first quarter of 2012 was $87 million compared to $117 million in the prior year quarter. Results for the first quarter were impacted by lower utilization, including plant downtime, the impact of lower day rates from contract rollovers on 5 rigs and higher rig downtime for a mobilization, prepping and stacking. Additionally, there are higher contract drilling expenses affecting the higher costs of operating rigs internationally rather than domestically.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the first quarter increased to $35 million from $33 million the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was partially a result of the acquisition of HP Storage to lower interest expense, which was modestly offset by the continuing decline in natural gas prices and lower throughput primarily from mild winter weather.
As Jim mentioned, HighMount recorded a net loss of $22 million for the first quarter 2012 compared to net income of $19 million in the first quarter of 2011. The and lower results were due to a non-cash call centers ceiling test impairment charge of $28 million after taxes related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties as well as decreased sales volumes stemming from a reduction in drilling activity and declines in natural gas prices.
HighMount's production volumes and realize prices in the first quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was 10.3 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.22 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 633,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.79 per barrel; and oil production was 81,000 barrels at an average price of $95 per barrel. HighMount has hedges in place as of March 31, 2012, to cover approximately 51% of projected equivalent production. Natural gas hedges totaled 22.9 billion cubic feet at $5.30 per MM BTU. Natural gas liquid hedges totaled 1,848,000 [ph]  barrels at $37.33 per barrel and crude oil hedges totaled 198,000 barrels at $102.59 per barrel.
At Loews Hotels, net income increased $2 million for the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to equity earnings in joint venture properties as compared to the 2011 period. Revenues per available room increased $3.24 to $155.31 for the first quarter 2012 as compared to the 2011 period. The increase in revenue per available room reflects improving occupancy and average room rates.
Holding company cash investments as of March 31, 2012, totaled $3.7 billion as compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2011. We received $170 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, we received $285 million from Boardwalk Pipeline from the sale of our 80% interest in HP Storage. We also bought back 2,500 shares of Loews common stock for $96,000. 
I'll now turn the call back over to the Mary."

We've seen, for example, over the past few weeks a number of producers in the Haynesville say that they are going -- they're laying down their rigs and they're not going to start to drill for dry gas there again until prices get to somewhere between $4 and $4.50 per Mcf. The Haynesville, going back a year or 2, was one of the most prolific and the most profitable areas to produce natural gas. So we are seeing, in terms of producer planned to drill for dry gas, that they are no longer drilling or they're planning not to drill, and that they're going to wait a good long time until prices get back to reasonable levels so they can earn a rate return on their investments. Now that's different in drilling for wet gas. With wet gas, not only do you get natural gas, dry natural gas, but you also get natural gas liquids. And natural gas liquids, to a large extent, are priced off of oil. So oftentimes, people can drill for wet gas, which can represent 30% or 40% of the BTUs produced. But since the wet gas, propane -- since the wet gas constituents, the liquids, propane, butane, iso propane, natural gas wane and a few others, those are priced off of oil. Then in essence, the producer doesn't care so much about the price of natural gas because the price of the liquid so dramatically outweighs the value of the natural gas that's being produced."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss Loews' first quarter results. Overall, our first quarter financial results were solid.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss Loews' first quarter results. Overall, our first quarter financial results were solid. As you know by now, we reported earnings per share of $0.92 for the quarter, which matched the $0.92 per share that Loews earned in the first quarter of 2011. Our book value per share at quarter end was $48.96 a share, a 3.4% increase over our book value per share at year end. Underlying these financial results are the actions being taken by each of our subsidiaries to set value creating strategies and to achieve operational excellence. Let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries beginning with CNA.
Under Tom Motamed, CNA continues to improve its core P&C operations, which included specialty insurance and commercial insurance businesses. The CNA team is executing strategies to achieve the dual goals of growth and underwriting profitability. Adjusting for the sale of its 50% stake in First Insurance Company of Hawaii during the fourth quarter of 2011, CNA achieved growth in net premiums written in its P&C operations of 5%. The strong growth came from 3 main factors: strong retention of existing business; healthy rate increases on retained business; and attractive new business in targeted areas.
By way of example, during the first quarter, CNA specialty and CNA commercial increased rates by 3% and 5%, respectively, with certain sublines of business showing much stronger rate achievement. Additionally, the ratio of new to lost business is 1.4:1. What this means is that CNA's underwriting and marketing efforts are gaining traction.
CNA's 68.8% first quarter loss ratio before the impact of catastrophes in prior year development was essentially in line with the prior year quarter. The company's objective is to reduce its loss ratio materially from here. Rate increases, combined with improved underwriting discipline, are the keys to achieving this objective.
Finally, CNA took a major step in March when it reached agreement to acquire Hardy Underwriting for $227 million. Hardy is a specialized Lloyd underwriter with a respected market reputation and a long history of disciplined underwriting. The proposed acquisition will provide CNA with a key platform for international growth. Hardy shareholders approve this transaction last Thursday, and it's expected to close by the end of the second quarter.
Turning to Diamond Offshore in the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a good first quarter despite net income being down 26% year-over-year. Diamond's quarterly earnings can vary meaningfully, as a result of such factors as survey downtime, rigs coming off contract and the cost associated with moving rigs from one locale to another.
As we've discussed previously, Diamond continues its program of fleet renewal, and has 3 ultra-deepwater drillships and one more semisubmersible rig under construction. Two of the drillships are already contracted to begin working for Anadarko Petroleum at attractive day rates. The other 2 units are currently being marketed, and should be able to benefit from the prevailing robust day rate environment. These 4 units are in addition to the 2 ultra-deepwater semi that Diamond purchased out of bankruptcy in early '09 and the 4 semis that were upgraded to ultra-deepwater status since '02. We're encouraged about Diamond's market position and the future of its offshore drilling business.
Turning to Boardwalk Pipeline. During this past quarter, Boardwalk purchased from Loews for $285 million the 80% equity interest in Boardwalk HP Storage that Loews had acquired to support Boardwalk's purchase of Loews storage assets in December. As we previously said, our intention was always to drop down our 80% stake when it made financial sense for Boardwalk to purchase it. This transaction worked just as planned, and ultimately benefited both Boardwalk and Loews' shareholders. Boardwalk continues to pursue projects like Boardwalk HP Storage that leverage Boardwalk's core asset, diversify its services in geographic footprint and generate growth. HP Storage is a great example of that strategy in action.
Another example is the Eagle Ford expansion project. Boardwalk announced in February that it had executed a long-term fee-based gathering and processing agreement with Statoil and Talisman for approximately half of the processing plants capacity. Boardwalk's construction of the gathering lines and processing plants are continuing on schedule.
We don't typically spend much time on this call discussing Loews Hotels, but hopefully that will change in the quarters and the years ahead. Paul Whetsell, who joined Loews Hotels as President and CEO in January has hit the ground running. Paul and the Loews Hotels team are sharpening their focus on growing in key urban and resort markets, while at the same time, improving the performance and profitability of our existing properties. Renovations are either underway or imminent at some of our current hotels, and growth opportunities are being continually reviewed. As with all of our subsidiaries, our goal at Loews Hotels is to create long-term value for all Loews' shareholders.
Finally, let me turn to HighMount E&P. Quite simply, low natural gas prices make life difficult for HighMount, as the company is predominantly a producer of natural gas. Last Friday, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas settled at $2.06 per Mcf, the equivalent of oil selling for less than $12.50 a barrel.
The good news is that HighMount is not standing still. Instead, it is responding to this unprecedented environment by taking a number of steps, including materially scaling back dry gas development activity in the Permian Basin. Focusing development in the Permian Basin on gas-rich wells with high liquid yield and oil potential, specifically in the Wolfcamp strata. And also acquiring and developing a core position in the Mississippian line that we believe will be profitable, a profitable oil development opportunities for HighMount. HighMount is in the early stages of scaling up its efforts to produce more oil and liquids so current production is still dominated by dry gas, but we were encouraged by management's efforts to pursue projects that have the prospect of generating higher returns in the current environment.
HighMount recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment charge of $28 million after taxes in the first quarter related to its carrying value of natural gas and oil properties. This non-cash accounting charge was a result of declines in natural gas prices. As prices remain unchanged through 2012 and holding all other assumptions constant, HighMount will incur non-cash after-tax ceiling test impairments that could range from approximately $400 million to $450 million for the full year of 2012, inclusive of the first quarter impairment.
As you know, ceiling test impairment charges are mandated by GAAP, not because gas is no longer in the ground, but simply because the accounting rules require us to value all of our reserves at current prices.
Before I turn the call over to Pete, I want to take a few moments to comment on natural gas in the face of today's historically low prices. When putting today's natural gas price environment into context, I'd like to remind myself of what I call the second rule of economics, which is what has to happen, happens. Currently, gas prices are unsustainably low due to the combination of an extraordinarily warm winter and the over production of shale gas. It is simply not economically viable today to drill a well for dry gas at $2 per Mcf price. Like it or not, with natural gas prices this low, gas production will slow down and demand will increase. Eventually, we will arrive at an equilibrium price of natural gas, which I estimate to be at about $4.50 per Mcf, which is the BTU equivalent of $27 per barrel of oil, still a veritable bargain.
At that $4.50 price, the United States can and will dramatically increase its production of natural gas. And at that price, there will still be an enormous incentive for consumption of natural gas to increase significantly. In fact, this is already happening. Diesel fuel consumers are currently making the capital investments necessary to switch to natural gas, often with a 2-year payback on their investments. Not only were truckers and railroads convert to natural gas, but HighMount too is seriously analyzing the option of converting its drilling operation in the oil patch to natural gas from the Eagle.
Due to improvements in frac-ing technology, which are unlocking enormous amounts of gas shale hydrocarbon, the United States has a virtually unlimited supply of natural gas. This new abundant source of energy can, and will, in the next decade transform our economy. If supply assured and price is low, natural gas consumption will certainly continue to increase. Power generation, transportation, industrial production and L&G exports from the U.S. should all combine to material enhance -- materially enhanced gas demand. So while the U.S. may be in for a few more years of unnaturally low gas prices, I'm under the belief that over the medium to long term, the most fundamental precept of economics, which is that relative prices drive demand, will result in higher natural gas prices and a more favorable pricing environment for HighMount.
Now back to the business at hand, let me turn the call over to Pete for more details on the first quarter."

Loews Corporation today reported net income of $367 million or $0.92 per share for the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $379 million or $0.92 per share in the first quarter of 2011. The slight decrease in the first quarter was due to lower earnings at HighMount and Diamond Offshore. These decreases were offset partially by higher earnings at CNA and increased investment income at the holding company. CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the first quarter was $226 million as compared to $199 million in 2011. The increase was due to lower catastrophe losses in increased investment income, especially in limited partnership results.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the first quarter 2012 was $87 million compared to $117 million in the prior year quarter. Results for the first quarter were impacted by lower utilization, including plant downtime, the impact of lower day rates from contract rollovers on 5 rigs and higher rig downtime for mobilization, prepping and stacking. Additionally, there are higher contract drilling expenses reflecting the higher costs of operating rigs internationally rather than domestically.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the first quarter increased to $35 million from $33 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was partially the result of the acquisition of HP Storage and lower interest expense, which was modestly offset by the continuing decline in natural gas prices and lower throughput primarily from mild winter weather.
As Jim mentioned, HighMount recorded a net loss of $22 million for the first quarter 2012 compared to net income of $19 million in the first quarter 2011. The lower results were due to a non-cash cost centers ceiling test impairment charge of $28 million after taxes related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties, as well as decreased sales volumes stemming from a reduction in drilling activity and declines in natural gas prices.
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the first quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was 10.3 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.22 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 633,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.79 per barrel; and oil production was 81,000 barrels at an average price of $95 per barrel. HighMount has hedges in place as of March 31, 2012, that cover approximately 51% of projected equivalent production. Natural gas hedges totaled 22.9 billion cubic feet at $5.30 per MMBTU. Natural gas liquid hedges total 1,848,000 [ph] barrels at $37.33 per barrel, and crude oil hedges total 198,000 barrels at $102.59 per barrel.
At Loews Hotels, net income increased $2 million for the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to equity earnings in joint venture properties as compared to the 2011 period. Revenues per available room increased $3.24 to $155.31 for the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the 2011 period. The increase in revenue per available room reflects improving occupancy and average room rates.
Holding company cash investments as of March 31, 2012, totaled $3.7 billion as compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2011. We received $170 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, we received $285 million from Boardwalk Pipeline from the sale of our 80% interest in HP Storage. We also bought back 2,500 shares of Loews common stock for $96,000.

And it's a process, first of all, because in terms of demand for natural gas, it will take time for people to make the capital equipment changes that they need to make in order to be able to consume natural gas in trucks and trains and even in the oil patch. And likewise, for supply of natural gas, my guess is that there is still some small amount of drilling that's going on for dry gas. There are a lot of reasons for that, such as people trying to hold property by production and the like. But over time, as gas prices stay down here, my guess is that a lot of that gas, a lot of that drilling will stop. We've seen, for example, over the past few weeks a number of producers in the Haynesville saying that they are going -- they're laying down their rigs and they're not going to start to drill for dry gas there again until prices get to somewhere between $4 and $4.50 per Mcf. The Haynesville, going back a year or 2, was one of the most prolific and the most profitable areas to produce natural gas. So we are seeing, in terms of producer plans to drill for dry gas, that they are no longer drilling or they're planning not to drill, and they're going to wait a good long time until prices get back to reasonable levels so they can earn a rate of return on their investment. Now that's different in drilling for wet gas. With wet gas, not only do you get natural gas, dry natural gas, but you also get natural gas liquids. And natural gas liquids, to a large extent, are priced off of oil. So oftentimes, people can drill for wet gas, which can represent 30% or 40% of the BTUs produced, but since the wet gas, propane -- since the wet gas constituents, the liquids, propane, butane, isobutane, natural gasoline and a few others, since those are priced off of oil, then in essence, the producer doesn't care so much about the price of natural gas because the price of the liquid so dramatically outweighs the value of the natural gas that's being produced."

285930,183966155,292943,"Loews Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2012",2012-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss Loews' first quarter results. Overall, our first quarter financial results were solid.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss Loews' first quarter results. Overall, our first quarter financial results were solid. As you know by now, we reported earnings per share of $0.92 for the quarter, which matched the $0.92 per share that Loews earned in the first quarter of 2011. Our book value per share at quarter end was $48.96 a share, a 3.4% increase over our book value per share at year end. Underlying these financial results are the actions being taken by each of our subsidiaries to set value-creating strategies and to achieve operational excellence. Let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries beginning with CNA.
Under Tom Motamed, CNA continues to improve its core P&C operations, which included specialty insurance and commercial insurance businesses. The CNA team is executing strategies to achieve the dual goals of growth and underwriting profitability. Adjusting for the sale of its 50% stake in First Insurance Company of Hawaii during the fourth quarter of 2011, CNA achieved growth in net premiums written in its P&C operations of 5%. This strong growth came from 3 main factors: strong retention of existing business; healthy rate increases on retained business; and attractive new business in targeted areas.
By way of example, during the first quarter, CNA specialty and CNA commercial increased rates by 3% and 5%, respectively, with certain sub-lines of business showing much stronger rate achievement. Additionally, the ratio of new to lost business is 1.4:1. What this means is that CNA's underwriting and marketing efforts are gaining traction.
CNA's 68.8% first quarter loss ratio before the impact of catastrophes in prior year development was essentially in line with the prior-year quarter. The company's objective is to reduce its loss ratio materially from here. Rate increases, combined with improved underwriting discipline, are the keys to achieving this objective.
Finally, CNA took a major step in March when it reached agreement to acquire Hardy Underwriting for $227 million. Hardy is a specialized Lloyd underwriter with a respected market reputation and a long history of disciplined underwriting. The proposed acquisition will provide CNA with a key platform for international growth. Hardy shareholders approved this transaction last Thursday, and it's expected to close by the end of the second quarter.
Turning to Diamond Offshore in the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a good first quarter, despite net income being down 26% year-over-year. Diamond's quarterly earnings can vary meaningfully, as a result of such factors as survey downtime, rigs coming off contract and the cost associated with moving rigs from one locale to another.
As we've discussed previously, Diamond continues its program of fleet renewal and has 3 ultra-deepwater drillships and one moored semisubmersible rig under construction. Two of the drillships are already contracted to begin working for Anadarko Petroleum at attractive day rates. The other 2 units are currently being marketed and should be able to benefit from the prevailing robust day rate environment. These 4 units are in addition to the 2 ultra-deepwater semis that Diamond purchased out of bankruptcy in early '09 and the 4 semis that were upgraded to ultra-deepwater status since '02. We're encouraged about Diamond's market position and the future of the offshore drilling business.
Turning to Boardwalk Pipeline. During this past quarter, Boardwalk purchased from Loews for $285 million the 80% equity interest in Boardwalk HP Storage that Loews had acquired to support Boardwalk's purchase of those storage assets in December. As we previously said, our intention was always to drop down our 80% stake when it made financial sense for Boardwalk to purchase it. This transaction worked just as planned and ultimately benefited both Boardwalk and Loews shareholders. Boardwalk continues to pursue projects like Boardwalk HP Storage that leverage Boardwalk's core assets, diversify its services and geographic footprint and generate growth. HP Storage is a great example of that strategy in action.
Another example is the Eagle Ford expansion project. Boardwalk announced in February that it had executed a long-term fee-based gathering and processing agreement with Statoil and Talisman for approximately half of the processing plants capacity. Boardwalk's construction of the gathering lines and processing plants are continuing on schedule.
We don't typically spend much time on these calls discussing Loews Hotels, but hopefully, that will change in the quarters and the years ahead. Paul Whetsell, who joined Loews Hotels as President and CEO in January, has hit the ground running. Paul and the Loews Hotels team are sharpening their focus on growing in key urban and resort markets while, at the same time, improving the performance and profitability of our existing properties. Renovations are either underway or imminent at several of our current hotels, and growth opportunities are being continually reviewed. As with all of our subsidiaries, our goal at Loews Hotels is to create long-term value for all Loews' shareholders.
Finally, let me turn to HighMount E&P. Quite simply, low natural gas prices make life difficult for HighMount, as the company is predominantly a producer of natural gas. Last Friday, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas settled at $2.06 per Mcf, the equivalent of oil selling for less than $12.50 a barrel.
The good news is that HighMount is not standing still. Instead, it is responding to this unprecedented environment by taking a number of steps, including materially scaling back dry gas development activity in the Permian Basin, focusing development in the Permian Basin on gas-rich wells with high liquid yield and oil potential, specifically in the Wolfcamp strata, and also acquiring and developing a core position in the Mississippian line that we believe will be profitable -- a profitable oil development opportunity for HighMount. HighMount is in the early stages of scaling up its efforts to produce more oil and liquids, so current production is still dominated by dry gas, but we’re encouraged by management's efforts to pursue projects that have the prospect of generating higher returns in the current environment.
HighMount recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment charge of $28 million after taxes in the first quarter related to its carrying value of natural gas and oil properties. This non-cash accounting charge was a result of declines in natural gas prices. If prices remain unchanged through 2012 and holding all other assumptions constant, HighMount will incur non-cash after-tax ceiling test impairments that could range from approximately $400 million to $450 million for the full year of 2012, inclusive of the first quarter impairment.
As you know, ceiling test impairment charges are mandated by GAAP, not because gas is no longer in the ground, but simply because the accounting rules require us to value all of our reserves at current prices.
Before I turn the call over to Pete, I want to take a few moments to comment on natural gas in the face of today's historically low prices. When putting today's natural gas price environment into context, I'd like to remind myself of what I call the second rule of economics, which is what has to happen, happens. Currently, gas prices are unsustainably low due to the combination of an extraordinarily warm winter and the over production of shale gas. It is simply not economically viable today to drill a well for dry gas at a $2 per Mcf price. Like it or not, with natural gas prices this low, gas production will slow down and demand will increase. Eventually, we will arrive at an equilibrium price of natural gas, which I estimate to be at about $4.50 per Mcf, which is the BTU equivalent of $27 per barrel of oil, still a veritable bargain.
At that $4.50 price, the United States can and will dramatically increase its production of natural gas. And at that price, there will still be an enormous incentive for consumption of natural gas to increase significantly. In fact, this is already happening. Diesel fuel consumers are currently making the capital investments necessary to switch to natural gas, often with a 2-year payback on their investments. Not only will truckers and railroads convert to natural gas, but HighMount too is seriously analyzing the option of converting its drilling operation in the oil patch to natural gas from diesel.
Due to improvements in frac-ing technology, which have unlocked enormous amounts of gas shale hydrocarbon, the United States has a virtually unlimited supply of natural gas. This new abundant source of energy can, and will, in the next decade transform our economy. With supply assured and prices low, natural gas consumption will certainly continue to increase. Power generation, transportation, industrial production and L&G exports from the U.S. should all combine to material enhance -- materially enhance gas demand. So while the U.S. may be in for a few more years of unnaturally low gas prices, I'm of the belief that over the medium to long term, the most fundamental precept of economics, which is that relative prices drive demand, will result in higher natural gas prices and a more favorable pricing environment for HighMount.
Now back to the business at hand, let me turn the call over to Pete for more details on the first quarter."

Loews Corporation today reported net income of $367 million or $0.92 per share for the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $379 million or $0.92 per share in the first quarter of 2011. The slight decrease in the first quarter was due to lower earnings at HighMount and Diamond Offshore. These decreases were offset partially by higher earnings at CNA and increased investment income at the holding company. CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the first quarter was $226 million as compared to $199 million in 2011. The increase was due to lower catastrophe losses in increased investment income, especially in limited partnership results.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the first quarter 2012 was $87 million compared to $117 million in the prior-year quarter. Results for the first quarter were impacted by lower utilization, including planned downtime, the impact of lower day rates from contract rollovers on 5 rigs and higher rig downtime for mobilization, prepping and stacking. Additionally, there were higher contract drilling expenses reflecting the higher costs of operating rigs internationally rather than domestically.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the first quarter increased to $35 million from $33 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in net income was partially the result of the acquisition of HP Storage and lower interest expense, which was modestly offset by the continuing decline in natural gas prices and lower throughput primarily from mild winter weather.
As Jim mentioned, HighMount recorded a net loss of $22 million for the first quarter of 2012 compared to net income of $19 million in the first quarter 2011. The lower results were due to a non-cash cost center ceiling test impairment charge of $28 million after taxes related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties, as well as decreased sales volumes stemming from a reduction in drilling activity and declines in natural gas prices.
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the first quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was 10.3 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.22 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 633,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.79 per barrel; and oil production was 81,000 barrels at an average price of $95 per barrel. HighMount has hedges in place as of March 31, 2012, that cover approximately 51% of projected equivalent production. Natural gas hedges totaled 22.9 billion cubic feet at $5.30 per MMBTU. Natural gas liquid hedges total 1,848,000 [ph] barrels at $37.33 per barrel, and crude oil hedges total 198,000 barrels at $102.59 per barrel.
At Loews Hotels, net income increased $2 million for the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to equity earnings in joint venture properties as compared to the 2011 period. Revenues per available room increased $3.24 to $155.31 for the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the 2011 period. The increase in revenue per available room reflects improving occupancy and average room rates.
Holding company cash investments as of March 31, 2012, totaled $3.7 billion as compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2011. We received $170 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, we received $285 million from Boardwalk Pipeline from the sale of our 80% interest in HP Storage. We also bought back 2,500 shares of Loews common stock for $96,000. 
I'll now turn the call back over to the Mary."

And it's a process, first of all, because in terms of demand for natural gas, it will take time for people to make the capital equipment changes that they need to make in order to be able to consume natural gas in trucks and trains and even in the oil patch. And likewise, for supply of natural gas, my guess is that there is still some small amount of drilling that's going on for dry gas. There are a lot of reasons for that, such as people trying to hold property by production and the like. But over time, if gas prices stay down here, my guess is that a lot of that gas -- a lot of that drilling will stop. We've seen, for example, over the past few weeks a number of producers in the Haynesville say that they are going -- they're laying down their rigs, and they're not going to start to drill for dry gas there again until prices get to somewhere between $4 and $4.50 per Mcf. The Haynesville, going back a year or 2, was one of the most prolific and the most profitable areas to produce natural gas. So we are seeing, in terms of producer plans to drill for dry gas, that they are no longer drilling or they're planning not to drill, and they're going to wait a good long time until prices get back to reasonable levels so they can earn a rate of return on their investment. Now that's different in drilling for wet gas. With wet gas, not only do you get natural gas, dry natural gas, but you also get natural gas liquids. And natural gas liquids, to a large extent, are priced off of oil. So oftentimes, people can drill for wet gas, which can represent 30% or 40% of the BTUs produced, but since the wet gas, propane -- since the wet gas constituents, the liquids, propane, butane, isobutane, natural gasoline and a few others, since those are priced off of oil, then in essence, the producer doesn't really care so much about the price of natural gas because the price of the liquids so dramatically outweighs the value of the natural gas that's being produced."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss Loews' first quarter results. Overall, our first quarter financial results were solid.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss Loews' first quarter results. Overall, our first quarter financial results were solid. As you know by now, we reported earnings per share of $0.92 for the quarter, which matched the $0.92 per share that Loews earned in the first quarter of 2011. Our book value per share at quarter end was $48.96 a share, a 3.4% increase over our book value per share at year end. Underlying these financial results are the actions being taken by each of our subsidiaries to set value-creating strategies and to achieve operational excellence. Let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries beginning with CNA.
Under Tom Motamed, CNA continues to improve its core P&C operations, which included specialty insurance and commercial insurance businesses. The CNA team is executing strategies to achieve the dual goals of growth and underwriting profitability. Adjusting for the sale of its 50% stake in First Insurance Company of Hawaii during the fourth quarter of 2011, CNA achieved growth in net premiums written in its P&C operations of 5%. This strong growth came from 3 main factors: strong retention of existing business; healthy rate increases on retained business; and attractive new business in targeted areas.
By way of example, during the first quarter, CNA specialty and CNA commercial increased rates by 3% and 5%, respectively, with certain sub-lines of business showing much stronger rate achievement. Additionally, the ratio of new to lost business is 1.4:1. What this means is that CNA's underwriting and marketing efforts are gaining traction.
CNA's 68.8% first quarter loss ratio before the impact of catastrophes in prior year development was essentially in line with the prior-year quarter. The company's objective is to reduce its loss ratio materially from here. Rate increases, combined with improved underwriting discipline, are the keys to achieving this objective.
Finally, CNA took a major step in March when it reached agreement to acquire Hardy Underwriting for $227 million. Hardy is a specialized Lloyd underwriter with a respected market reputation and a long history of disciplined underwriting. The proposed acquisition will provide CNA with a key platform for international growth. Hardy shareholders approved this transaction last Thursday, and it's expected to close by the end of the second quarter.
Turning to Diamond Offshore in the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a good first quarter, despite net income being down 26% year-over-year. Diamond's quarterly earnings can vary meaningfully, as a result of such factors as survey downtime, rigs coming off contract and the cost associated with moving rigs from one locale to another.
As we've discussed previously, Diamond continues its program of fleet renewal and has 3 ultra-deepwater drillships and one moored semisubmersible rig under construction. Two of the drillships are already contracted to begin working for Anadarko Petroleum at attractive day rates. The other 2 units are currently being marketed and should be able to benefit from the prevailing robust day rate environment. These 4 units are in addition to the 2 ultra-deepwater semis that Diamond purchased out of bankruptcy in early '09 and the 4 semis that were upgraded to ultra-deepwater status since '02. We're encouraged about Diamond's market position and the future of the offshore drilling business.
Turning to Boardwalk Pipeline. During this past quarter, Boardwalk purchased from Loews for $285 million the 80% equity interest in Boardwalk HP Storage that Loews had acquired to support Boardwalk's purchase of those storage assets in December. As we previously said, our intention was always to drop down our 80% stake when it made financial sense for Boardwalk to purchase it. This transaction worked just as planned and ultimately benefited both Boardwalk and Loews shareholders. Boardwalk continues to pursue projects like Boardwalk HP Storage that leverage Boardwalk's core assets, diversify its services and geographic footprint and generate growth. HP Storage is a great example of that strategy in action.
Another example is the Eagle Ford expansion project. Boardwalk announced in February that it had executed a long-term fee-based gathering and processing agreement with Statoil and Talisman for approximately half of the processing plants capacity. Boardwalk's construction of the gathering lines and processing plants are continuing on schedule.
We don't typically spend much time on these calls discussing Loews Hotels, but hopefully, that will change in the quarters and the years ahead. Paul Whetsell, who joined Loews Hotels as President and CEO in January, has hit the ground running. Paul and the Loews Hotels team are sharpening their focus on growing in key urban and resort markets while, at the same time, improving the performance and profitability of our existing properties. Renovations are either underway or imminent at several of our current hotels, and growth opportunities are being continually reviewed. As with all of our subsidiaries, our goal at Loews Hotels is to create long-term value for all Loews' shareholders.
Finally, let me turn to HighMount E&P. Quite simply, low natural gas prices make life difficult for HighMount, as the company is predominantly a producer of natural gas. Last Friday, the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas settled at $2.06 per Mcf, the equivalent of oil selling for less than $12.50 a barrel.
The good news is that HighMount is not standing still. Instead, it is responding to this unprecedented environment by taking a number of steps, including materially scaling back dry gas development activity in the Permian Basin, focusing development in the Permian Basin on gas-rich wells with high liquid yield and oil potential, specifically in the Wolfcamp strata, and also acquiring and developing a core position in the Mississippian line that we believe will be profitable -- a profitable oil development opportunity for HighMount. HighMount is in the early stages of scaling up its efforts to produce more oil and liquids, so current production is still dominated by dry gas, but we’re encouraged by management's efforts to pursue projects that have the prospect of generating higher returns in the current environment.
HighMount recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment charge of $28 million after taxes in the first quarter related to its carrying value of natural gas and oil properties. This non-cash accounting charge was a result of declines in natural gas prices. If prices remain unchanged through 2012 and holding all other assumptions constant, HighMount will incur non-cash after-tax ceiling test impairments that could range from approximately $400 million to $450 million for the full year of 2012, inclusive of the first quarter impairment.
As you know, ceiling test impairment charges are mandated by GAAP, not because gas is no longer in the ground, but simply because the accounting rules require us to value all of our reserves at current prices.
Before I turn the call over to Pete, I want to take a few moments to comment on natural gas in the face of today's historically low prices. When putting today's natural gas price environment into context, I'd like to remind myself of what I call the second rule of economics, which is what has to happen, happens. Currently, gas prices are unsustainably low due to the combination of an extraordinarily warm winter and the over production of shale gas. It is simply not economically viable today to drill a well for dry gas at a $2 per Mcf price. Like it or not, with natural gas prices this low, gas production will slow down and demand will increase. Eventually, we will arrive at an equilibrium price of natural gas, which I estimate to be at about $4.50 per Mcf, which is the BTU equivalent of $27 per barrel of oil, still a veritable bargain.
At that $4.50 price, the United States can and will dramatically increase its production of natural gas. And at that price, there will still be an enormous incentive for consumption of natural gas to increase significantly. In fact, this is already happening. Diesel fuel consumers are currently making the capital investments necessary to switch to natural gas, often with a 2-year payback on their investments. Not only will truckers and railroads convert to natural gas, but HighMount too is seriously analyzing the option of converting its drilling operation in the oil patch to natural gas from diesel.
Due to improvements in frac-ing technology, which have unlocked enormous amounts of gas shale hydrocarbon, the United States has a virtually unlimited supply of natural gas. This new abundant source of energy can, and will, in the next decade transform our economy. With supply assured and prices low, natural gas consumption will certainly continue to increase. Power generation, transportation, industrial production and L&G exports from the U.S. should all combine to material enhance -- materially enhance gas demand. So while the U.S. may be in for a few more years of unnaturally low gas prices, I'm of the belief that over the medium to long term, the most fundamental precept of economics, which is that relative prices drive demand, will result in higher natural gas prices and a more favorable pricing environment for HighMount.
Now back to the business at hand, let me turn the call over to Pete for more details on the first quarter."

Loews Corporation today reported net income of $367 million or $0.92 per share for the first quarter of 2012 as compared to $379 million or $0.92 per share in the first quarter of 2011. The slight decrease in the first quarter was due to lower earnings at HighMount and Diamond Offshore. These decreases were offset partially by higher earnings at CNA and increased investment income at the holding company. CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the first quarter was $226 million as compared to $199 million in 2011. The increase was due to lower catastrophe losses in increased investment income, especially in limited partnership results.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the first quarter 2012 was $87 million compared to $117 million in the prior-year quarter. Results for the first quarter were impacted by lower utilization, including planned downtime, the impact of lower day rates from contract rollovers on 5 rigs and higher rig downtime for mobilization, prepping and stacking. Additionally, there were higher contract drilling expenses reflecting the higher costs of operating rigs internationally rather than domestically.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the first quarter increased to $35 million from $33 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase in net income was partially the result of the acquisition of HP Storage and lower interest expense, which was modestly offset by the continuing decline in natural gas prices and lower throughput primarily from mild winter weather.
As Jim mentioned, HighMount recorded a net loss of $22 million for the first quarter of 2012 compared to net income of $19 million in the first quarter 2011. The lower results were due to a non-cash cost center ceiling test impairment charge of $28 million after taxes related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties, as well as decreased sales volumes stemming from a reduction in drilling activity and declines in natural gas prices.
HighMount's production volumes and realized prices in the first quarter are as follows: Natural gas production was 10.3 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.22 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was 633,000 barrels at an average realized price of $39.79 per barrel; and oil production was 81,000 barrels at an average price of $95 per barrel. HighMount has hedges in place as of March 31, 2012, that cover approximately 51% of projected equivalent production. Natural gas hedges totaled 22.9 billion cubic feet at $5.30 per MMBTU. Natural gas liquid hedges total 1,848,000 [ph] barrels at $37.33 per barrel, and crude oil hedges total 198,000 barrels at $102.59 per barrel.
At Loews Hotels, net income increased $2 million for the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to equity earnings in joint venture properties as compared to the 2011 period. Revenues per available room increased $3.24 to $155.31 for the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the 2011 period. The increase in revenue per available room reflects improving occupancy and average room rates.
Holding company cash investments as of March 31, 2012, totaled $3.7 billion as compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2011. We received $170 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the first quarter of 2012. Additionally, we received $285 million from Boardwalk Pipeline from the sale of our 80% interest in HP Storage. We also bought back 2,500 shares of Loews common stock for $96,000. 
I'll now turn the call back over to the Mary."

And it's a process, first of all, because in terms of demand for natural gas, it will take time for people to make the capital equipment changes that they need to make in order to be able to consume natural gas in trucks and trains and even in the oil patch. And likewise, for supply of natural gas, my guess is that there is still some small amount of drilling that's going on for dry gas. There are a lot of reasons for that, such as people trying to hold property by production and the like. But over time, if gas prices stay down here, my guess is that a lot of that gas -- a lot of that drilling will stop. We've seen, for example, over the past few weeks a number of producers in the Haynesville say that they are going -- they're laying down their rigs, and they're not going to start to drill for dry gas there again until prices get to somewhere between $4 and $4.50 per Mcf. The Haynesville, going back a year or 2, was one of the most prolific and the most profitable areas to produce natural gas. So we are seeing, in terms of producer plans to drill for dry gas, that they are no longer drilling or they're planning not to drill, and they're going to wait a good long time until prices get back to reasonable levels so they can earn a rate of return on their investment. Now that's different in drilling for wet gas. With wet gas, not only do you get natural gas, dry natural gas, but you also get natural gas liquids. And natural gas liquids, to a large extent, are priced off of oil. So oftentimes, people can drill for wet gas, which can represent 30% or 40% of the BTUs produced, but since the wet gas, propane -- since the wet gas constituents, the liquids, propane, butane, isobutane, natural gasoline and a few others, since those are priced off of oil, then in essence, the producer doesn't really care so much about the price of natural gas because the price of the liquids so dramatically outweighs the value of the natural gas that's being produced."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Loews' second quarter results. As you know by now, we reported earnings of $56 million for the quarter, as compared to $250 million of Loews earned in the second quarter of 2011.",1321,"Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Loews' second quarter results. As you know by now, we reported earnings of $56 million for the quarter, as compared to $250 million of Loews earned in the second quarter of 2011. Net income for the quarter includes after-tax, noncash impairment fueling test charges of $142 million at HighMount, related to the carrying value of its natural gas properties. These charges were the results of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids pricing.
Loews ended the second quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and investments at the holding company level. This quarter, we spent approximately $51 million buying back about 1.3 million shares of Loews' stock.
During the second quarter, Moody's Investors Service upgraded by 1 notch the senior unsecured ratings of Loews, CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore. According to Moody's, Loews' upgrade to A2 reflects the strengthening credit profile of our primary operating subsidiaries and our standalone financial strength and conservative financial policies.
Moody's also affirmed the CNA insurance company's financial strength ratings and revised the outlook on these ratings to positive from stable. So now, both Moody's and S&P have CNA's financial strength on positive outlook, which is a real crack for the progress that's being made by the management team at CNA.
In addition to the good news from the rating agencies, CNA had a solid quarter, which was favorably impacted by lower catastrophe losses and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results. Lower net investment income from CNA's limited partnership investments created a drag on an otherwise strong improvement in net operating income. ELP investment produced a second quarter pretax loss of $35 million in 2012 as compared to pretax income of $11 million in 2011.
The combined ratio for the P&C operations, excluding catastrophe losses in prior year development, improved by nearly 3 points versus last year's second quarter. Also, the reported combined ratio improved by 4.3 points to 101.7 during the second quarter.
CNA continues to close the underwriting performance gap with its best-in-class competitors. There's more work to be done, and we look forward to CNA continuing its steady progress towards becoming a top-tier industry performer.
In July, CNA closed its acquisition of Hardy Underwriting, a specialized Lloyd's underwriter with a solid market reputation and a long history of disciplined underwriting. This acquisition will provide CNA with a key platform for international growth. Hardy's results would be included in CNA's and Loews' third quarter results.
Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a solid quarter despite its net income being down by about $60 million versus last year's second quarter. The biggest driver of the decline was that Diamond had 5 rigs in the shipyard this quarter for the 5-year special surveys compared to none during the same period last year. It's worth mentioning that despite the drop in oil prices, the offshore drilling market continues to show real strength. We believe that Diamond is well positioned to take advantage of these market conditions, given its rig availability over the coming 2 to 3 years.
Recent contracts signed by Diamond and other drillers for mid-water, Deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs indicate the demand is strong.
Diamond continues to focus on modernizing its fleet. As a reminder, Diamond has 4 ultra-deepwater drillships under construction in Korea. Earlier in '09, Diamond purchased 2 ultra-deep waters semisubmersible is in bankruptcy options. And most recently, Diamond is reconstructing an older semisubmersible into a high spectral unit to be named the Ocean Onyx. The rate was recently awarded a 1 year contract at a rate of $490,000 per day to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico upon delivery from the shipyard in the third quarter of 2013.
Diamond is actively considering another project similar to the Ocean Onyx that should provide the company with very attractive returns. The cost of this fleet renewal since '09 announced to -- amounts to almost $4 billion.
Now let's turn to Boardwalk. While Boardwalk had a good quarter, the market fundamentals of its base business remain challenging. Sustaining low natural gas prices, compressed basis spreads and now with seasonal spreads are making it difficult for Boardwalk to grow its base business. In light of this, Boardwalk has prudently decided to hold distribution steady in this quarter rather than raise the payout. This action will help Boardwalk strengthen its balance sheet as it continues to focus on long-term growth prospects.
We remain bullish on Boardwalk over the long term. Stand Horton and his team are not standing still. They have a number of projects in the works that should enhance the company's prospects.
At HighMount E&P, low natural gas prices continue to impact the company's results and produce -- primarily a producer of natural gas. Given the difficult environment for natural gas, HighMount is scaling up its efforts to produce more oil. 
In the Permian Basin, HighMount has put dry gas development activity on hiatus and is focusing on drilling Wolfcamp shale wells that have high oil potential. Additionally, HighMount is now starting to drill for oil on the land required last year in the Mississippian line in Oklahoma. And we are hopeful about seeing significant oil production from this property.
Overall, we are encouraged by HighMount's efforts to pursue projects that have a potential to diversify its product mix and generate high returns in the current environment.
As you know, for the second quarter, HighMount recorded a noncash fuel test impairment charge. As I said last quarter, by the 8 barrels [ph] repeating, test impairment charges are mandated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and not because the gas is no longer in the ground. I continue to be a firm believer that we will see a continuing increase in gas consumption in the U.S., and we remain optimistic about natural gas comes usage and pricing over the long term.
Finally, turning to Loews Hotels and resorts. work while continues to make progress on this great program. Let me point some 3 recent examples: number one, during the second quarter, Loews Hotels acquired Loews Hollywood in Los Angeles, which had 632 guestrooms and 48,000 square feet of meeting space. This should be a great property for Loews Hotels and it's customers; number two, Loews Hotels announced earlier this month that the Regency hotel in New York will undergo an extensive renovation during 2013. The renovation is designed to ensure that the Regency will continue to offer unmatched contemporary conference while maintaining its renounced standard of hospitality and service; and number three, Loews Hotels and Universal announced the Cabanna Bay Beach Resort, a newer hotel development at Universal Orlando with 1,800 rooms offering both modern and value-priced accommodations. This resort will be operated by Loews Hotels and is scheduled to open in 2013.
At The holding company level, Loews' investment income declined in the second quarter as compared to the same period in 2011. This decrease was due to lower performance of limited partnerships and equity investments for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Pete, while you haven't seen us make any acquisitions at the holding company level recently, you may have noticed that there's been no shortage of activity at our subsidiaries, whether it's Diamond Offshore seizing an opportunity to upgrade its fleet or Loews Hotels adding and upgrading assets in profitable Florida, California and New York City markets or CNA expanding its global footprint with its acquisition of Hardy, Loews' subsidiaries have been making attractive, strategic acquisitions. And we, at the holding company level, have been helping to facilitate some of these transactions. We continue to be pleased with, and involve in, each of our subsidiaries future prospects and will continue to focus on creating value over the long term for all Loews' shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Pete."
285930,213783686,334375,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2012",2012-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $56 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $250 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2011.As Jim mentioned, net i",843,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $56 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $250 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2011.
As Jim mentioned, net income for the quarter includes a noncash, ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after-tax at HighMount Exploration & Production, as a result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices.
Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, Loews' net income for 2012 would have been $198 million as compared to $250 million in the second quarter of 2011. The change is due primarily to lower earnings of Diamond Offshore Drilling and decreased performance of equity and limited partnership investments at the parent company. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings of CNA Financial and Boardwalk Pipeline partners.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the second quarter was $138 million as compared to $101 million in 2012 -- in 2011. Period-over-period Comparisons were favorable due to lower catastrophe losses, improved underwriting results and premium rate increases in CNA's core P&C operations, as well as lower losses in its run-off businesses. Results were partially offset by lower net investment income due to decreased limited partnership results.
CNA continues to sustain positive rate momentum across it's P&C portfolio. A 6% rate increase in the quarter, which was up 2 points from the 4% CNA reported in the first quarter and up 5 points from the second quarter last year. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $94 million compared to $125 million in the prior year's quarter. Diamond Offshore's earnings decreased resulted primarily from lower rig utilization as more rigs were undergoing special surveys, the decrease in average day rate and an increase in contract drilling expenses, reflecting the costs of the special surveys. These decreases were partially offset by a $23 million gain after-tax and noncontrolling interests from the sale of 5 jackup rigs in the second quarter of 2012.
Boardwalk pipeline's contribution to net income for the second quarter increased to $25 million from $5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was due to the absence of a $28 million materials and supplies impairment charge from the 2011 period, as well as higher transportation and storage-related revenues and the contribution of HP storage operating results, which was acquired in December 2011.
HighMount recorded a net loss of $139 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to net income of $15 million in the second quarter of 2011. The lower results were due to the noncash cost centers ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after-tax related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties, as well as decreased sales volumes stemming from the reduction in drilling activity and declines in natural gas and NGL prices. Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, net income for the quarter would have been $3 million.
For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, HighMount reported noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $142 million and $170 million after-tax. The ceiling test calculation was based on average 12-month prices of $3.15 per MM BTU for natural gas and $51.59 per barrel of natural gas liquids and $95.67 per barrel of oil.
The price and reserve levels remain unchanged through 2012. It is likely that HighMount will incur noncash an after-tax ceiling test impairments ranging from approximately $230 million to $280 million for the remainder of 2012, amounting to $400 million to $450 million for the full year of 2012.
HighMount's second quarter production volumes and realized prices, which include the benefit of hedges, are as follows: natural gas production was 10.1 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $3.89 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquid production was 582,000 barrels at an average realized price of $38.38 per barrel; and oil production was 101,000 barrels at an average realized price of $89.01 per barrel.
HighMount has hedges in place as of June 30, 2012, that cover approximately 66% of the remaining projected equivalent 2012 production at $5.49 per Mcfe.
At Loews Hotels, net incomes remain flat at $6 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter the previous year. Revenue per available room increased $6.49 to $182.08 for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the 2011 period. The increase in revenue per available room reflects improving occupancy and average room rates. Holding company cash investments as of June 30, 2012, totaled $3.7 billion, the same amount held at March 31, 2012. We received $173 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries, and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the second quarter of 2012.
We also provided $43 million to Loews Hotels for the acquisition of its Hollywood property and bought back 1.3 million shares of Loews' common stock for $51 million.
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Mary."

The strip is up to $3.56, whereas in April, it was about $1 lower. So there has been a significant rally in gas prices already. Spike gas prices, last I look, about just under $3.20 an Mcf. Just as a reminder, that's the equivalent to about $19 a barrel of oil. So even though gas has had a significant rally, it is still very, very cheap relative to oil. And at the $3.20 level, it's still at a price where, for most people drilling for natural gas -- for dry gas, it is generally uneconomic to drill at these prices. So we've seen the rig count -- the natural gas rig count in the past year or so virtually cut in half as people are laying down natural gas rigs. I think that the rally in natural gas has already started, but it still has ways to go. And I think, as I've said before on these calls, I think that the steady state equilibrium price for natural gas in the United States is probably somewhere between $4 and $4.50 an Mcf. We have, at HighMount, we've been looking to diversify our portfolio. We have plenty of gas in the ground that can be produced at higher natural gas prices. And so we've been -- we have acquired, last year, properties that we think are rich in oil, and our drilling programs have been focused on drilling for oil and natural gas liquids.

Net income for the quarter includes after-tax, noncash fueling test impairment charges of $142 million at HighMount, related to the carrying value of its natural gas properties. These charges were the results of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids pricing.
Loews ended the second quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and investments at the holding company level. This quarter, we spent approximately $51 million buying back about 1.3 million shares of Loews' stock.
During the second quarter, Moody's Investors Service upgraded by 1 notch the senior unsecured ratings of Loews, CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore. According to Moody's, Loews' upgrade to A2 reflects the strengthening credit profile of our primary operating subsidiaries and our standalone financial strength and conservative financial policies.
Moody's also affirmed the CNA insurance company's financial strength ratings and revised the outlook on these ratings to positive from stable. So now, both Moody's and S&P have CNA's financial strength on positive outlook, which is a real crack for the progress that's being made by the management team at CNA.
In addition to the good news from the rating agencies, CNA had a solid quarter, which was favorably impacted by lower catastrophe losses and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results. Lower net investment income from CNA's limited partnership investments created a drag on an otherwise strong improvement in net operating income. ELP investment produced a second quarter pretax loss of $35 million in 2012 as compared to pretax income of $11 million in 2011.
The combined ratio for the P&C operations, excluding catastrophe losses in prior year development, improved by nearly 3 points versus last year's second quarter. Also, the reported combined ratio improved by 4.3 points to 101.7 during the second quarter.
CNA continues to close the underwriting performance gap with its best-in-class competitors. There's more work to be done, and we look forward to CNA continuing its steady progress towards becoming a top-tier industry performer.
In July, CNA closed its acquisition of Hardy Underwriting, a specialized Lloyd's underwriter with a solid market reputation and a long history of disciplined underwriting. This acquisition will provide CNA with a key platform for international growth. Hardy's results would be included in CNA's and Loews' third quarter results.
Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a solid quarter despite its net income being down by about $60 million versus last year's second quarter. The biggest driver of the decline was that Diamond had 5 rigs in the shipyard this quarter for the 5-year special surveys compared to none during the same period last year. It's worth mentioning that despite the drop in oil prices, the offshore drilling market continues to show real strength. We believe that Diamond is well positioned to take advantage of these market conditions, given its rig availability over the coming 2 to 3 years.
Recent contracts signed by Diamond and other drillers for mid-water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs indicate that demand is strong.
Diamond continues to focus on modernizing its fleet. As a reminder, Diamond has 4 ultra-deepwater drillships under construction in Korea. Earlier in '09, Diamond purchased 2 ultra-deep waters semisubmersibles in bankruptcy options. And most recently, Diamond is reconstructing an older semisubmersible into a high spectral unit to be named the Ocean Onyx. The rig was recently awarded a 1-year contract at a rate of $490,000 per day to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico upon delivery from the shipyard in the third quarter of 2013.
Diamond is actively considering another project similar to the Ocean Onyx that should provide the company with very attractive returns. The cost of this fleet renewal since '09 announced to -- amounts to almost $4 billion.
Now let's turn to Boardwalk. While Boardwalk had a good quarter, the market fundamentals of its base business remain challenging. Sustaining low natural gas prices, compressed basis spreads and now with seasonal spreads are making it difficult for Boardwalk to grow its base business. In light of this, Boardwalk has prudently decided to hold distribution steady in this quarter rather than raise the payout. This action will help Boardwalk strengthen its balance sheet as it continues to focus on long-term growth prospects.
We remain bullish on Boardwalk over the long term. Stan Horton and his team are not standing still. They have a number of projects in the works that should enhance the company's prospects.
At HighMount E&P, low natural gas prices continue to impact the company's results and produce -- primarily a producer of natural gas. Given the difficult environment for natural gas, HighMount is scaling up its efforts to produce more oil. 
In the Permian Basin, HighMount has put dry gas development activity on hiatus and is focusing on drilling Wolfcamp Shale wells that have high oil potential. Additionally, HighMount is now starting to drill for oil on the land required last year in the Mississippian line in Oklahoma. And we are hopeful about seeing significant oil production from this property.
Overall, we are encouraged by HighMount's efforts to pursue projects that have the potential to diversify its product mix and generate high returns in the current environment.
As you know, for the second quarter, HighMount recorded a noncash fuel test impairment charge. As I said last quarter, by it bears repeating, ceiling test impairment charges are mandated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and not because the gas is no longer in the ground. I continue to be a firm believer that we will see a continuing increase in gas consumption in the U.S., and we remain optimistic about natural gas usage and pricing over the long term.
Finally, turning to Loews Hotels and resorts. Paul Whetsell continues to make progress on this great program. Let me point the 3 recent examples: number one, during the second quarter, Loews Hotels acquired Loews Hollywood in Los Angeles, which has 632 guestrooms and 48,000 square feet of meeting space. This should be a great property for Loews Hotels and its customers; number two, Loews Hotels announced earlier this month that the Regency hotel in New York will undergo an extensive renovation during 2013. The renovation is designed to ensure that the Regency will continue to offer unmatched contemporary comfort while maintaining its renowned standard of hospitality and service; and number three, Loews Hotels and Universal announced the Cabanna Bay Beach Resort, a newer hotel development at Universal Orlando with 1,800 rooms offering both modern and value-priced accommodations. This resort will be operated by Loews Hotels and is scheduled to open in 2014.
At the holding company level, Loews' investment income declined in the second quarter as compared to the same period in 2011. This decrease was due to lower performance of limited partnerships and equity investments for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Pete, while you haven't seen us make any acquisitions at the holding company level recently, you may have noticed that there's been no shortage of activity at our subsidiaries, whether it's Diamond Offshore seizing an opportunity to upgrade its fleet or Loews Hotels adding and upgrading assets in profitable Florida, California and New York City markets or CNA expanding its global footprint with its acquisition of Hardy, Loews' subsidiaries have been making attractive, strategic acquisitions. And we, at the holding company level, have been helping to facilitate some of these transactions. We continue to be pleased with, and involved in, each of our subsidiaries future prospects and will continue to focus on creating value over the long term for all Loews' shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Pete."
285930,213783686,334451,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2012",2012-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $56 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $250 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2011.As Jim mentioned, net i",843,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $56 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $250 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2011.
As Jim mentioned, net income for the quarter includes a noncash, ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after-tax at HighMount Exploration & Production, as a result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices.
Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, Loews' net income for 2012 would have been $198 million as compared to $250 million in the second quarter of 2011. The change is due primarily to lower earnings of Diamond Offshore Drilling and decreased performance of equity and limited partnership investments at the parent company. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings of CNA Financial and Boardwalk Pipeline partners.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the second quarter was $138 million as compared to $101 million in 2012 -- in 2011. Period-over-period comparisons were favorable due to lower catastrophe losses, improved underwriting results and premium rate increases in CNA's core P&C operations, as well as lower losses in its run-off businesses. Results were partially offset by lower net investment income due to decreased limited partnership results.
CNA continues to sustain positive rate momentum across it's P&C portfolio. A 6% rate increase in the quarter, which was up 2 points from the 4% CNA reported in the first quarter and up 5 points from the second quarter last year. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $94 million compared to $125 million in the prior year's quarter. Diamond Offshore's earnings decrease resulted primarily from lower rig utilization as more rigs were undergoing special surveys, the decrease in average day rate and an increase in contract drilling expenses, reflecting the costs of the special surveys. These decreases were partially offset by a $23 million gain after-tax and noncontrolling interests from the sale of 5 jackup rigs in the second quarter of 2012.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the second quarter increased to $25 million from $5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was due to the absence of a $28 million materials and supplies impairment charge from the 2011 period, as well as higher transportation and storage-related revenues and the contribution of HP Storage operating results, which was acquired in just December 2011.
HighMount recorded a net loss of $139 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to net income of $15 million in the second quarter of 2011. The lower results were due to the noncash cost centers ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after-tax related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties, as well as decreased sales volumes stemming from the reduction in drilling activity and declines in natural gas and NGL prices. Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, net income for the quarter would have been $3 million.
For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, HighMount reported noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $142 million and $170 million after-tax. The ceiling test calculation was based on average 12-month prices of $3.15 per MMBTU for natural gas and $51.59 per barrel of natural gas liquids and $95.67 per barrel of oil.
The price and reserve levels remain unchanged through 2012. It is likely that HighMount will incur noncash and after-tax ceiling test impairments ranging from approximately $230 million to $280 million for the remainder of 2012, amounting to $400 million to $450 million for the full year of 2012.
HighMount's second quarter production volumes and realized prices, which include the benefit of hedges, are as follows: natural gas production was 10.1 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $3.89 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquid production was 582,000 barrels at an average realized price of $38.38 per barrel; and oil production was 101,000 barrels at an average realized price of $89.01 per barrel.
HighMount has hedges in place as of June 30, 2012, that cover approximately 66% of the remaining projected equivalent 2012 production at $5.49 per Mcfe.
At Loews Hotels, net incomes remain flat at $6 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter the previous year. Revenue per available room increased $6.49 to $182.08 for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the 2011 period. The increase in revenue per available room reflects improving occupancy and average room rates. Holding company cash investments as of June 30, 2012, totaled $3.7 billion, the same amount held at March 31, 2012. We received $173 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries, and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the second quarter of 2012.
We also provided $43 million to Loews Hotels for the acquisition of its Hollywood property and bought back 1.3 million shares of Loews' common stock for $51 million.
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Mary."

The strip is up to $3.56, whereas in April, it was about $1 lower. So there has been a significant rally in gas prices already. Spike gas prices, last I looked, about just under $3.20 an Mcf. Just as a reminder, that's the equivalent to about $19 a barrel of oil. So even though gas has had a significant rally, it is still very, very cheap relative to oil. And at the $3.20 level, it's still at a price where, for most people drilling for natural gas -- for dry gas, it is generally uneconomic to drill at these prices. So we've seen the rig count -- the natural gas rig count in the past year or so virtually cut in half as people are laying down natural gas rigs. I think that the rally in natural gas has already started, but it still has ways to go. And I think, as I've said before on these calls, I think that the steady state equilibrium price for natural gas in the United States is probably somewhere between $4 and $4.50 an Mcf. We have, at HighMount, we've been looking to diversify our portfolio. We have plenty of gas in the ground that can be produced at higher natural gas prices. And so we've been -- we have acquired, last year, properties that we think are rich in oil. And our drilling programs have been focused on drilling for oil and natural gas liquids.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Loews' second quarter results. As you know by now, we reported earnings of $56 million for the quarter, as compared to $250 million of Loews earned in the second quarter of 2011.",1319,"Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Loews' second quarter results. As you know by now, we reported earnings of $56 million for the quarter, as compared to $250 million of Loews earned in the second quarter of 2011. Net income for the quarter includes after-tax, noncash fueling test impairment charges of $142 million at HighMount, related to the carrying value of its natural gas properties. These charges were the results of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids pricing.
Loews ended the second quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and investments at the holding company level. This quarter, we spent approximately $51 million buying back about 1.3 million shares of Loews' stock.
During the second quarter, Moody's Investors Service upgraded by 1 notch the senior unsecured ratings of Loews, CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore. According to Moody's, Loews' upgrade to A2 reflects the strengthening credit profile of our primary operating subsidiaries and our standalone financial strength and conservative financial policies.
Moody's also affirmed the CNA insurance company's financial strength ratings and revised the outlook on these ratings to positive from stable. So now, both Moody's and S&P have CNA's financial strength on positive outlook, which is a real credit to the progress that's being made by the management team at CNA.
In addition to the good news from the rating agencies, CNA had a solid quarter, which was favorably impacted by lower catastrophe losses and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results. Lower net investment income from CNA's limited partnership investments created a drag on an otherwise strong improvement in net operating income. ELP investment produced a second quarter pretax loss of $35 million in 2012 as compared to pretax income of $11 million in 2011.
The combined ratio for the P&C operations, excluding catastrophe losses in prior year development, improved by nearly 3 points versus last year's second quarter. Also, the reported combined ratio improved by 4.3 points to 101.7 during the second quarter.
CNA continues to close the underwriting performance gap with its best-in-class competitors. There's more work to be done, and we look forward to CNA continuing its steady progress towards becoming a top-tier industry performer.
In July, CNA closed its acquisition of Hardy Underwriting, a specialized Lloyd's underwriter with a solid market reputation and a long history of disciplined underwriting. This acquisition will provide CNA with a key platform for international growth. Hardy's results would be included in CNA's and Loews' third quarter results.
Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a solid quarter despite its net income being down by about $60 million versus last year's second quarter. The biggest driver of the decline was that Diamond had 5 rigs in the shipyard this quarter for the 5-year special surveys compared to none during the same period last year. It's worth mentioning that despite the drop in oil prices, the offshore drilling market continues to show real strength. We believe that Diamond is well positioned to take advantage of these market conditions, given its rig availability over the coming 2 to 3 years.
Recent contracts signed by Diamond and other drillers for mid-water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs indicate that demand is strong.
Diamond continues to focus on modernizing its fleet. As a reminder, Diamond has 4 ultra-deepwater drillships under construction in Korea. Earlier in '09, Diamond purchased 2 ultra-deep waters semisubmersibles in bankruptcy options. And most recently, Diamond is reconstructing an older semisubmersible into a high spec drilling unit to be named the Ocean Onyx. The rig was recently awarded a 1-year contract at a rate of $490,000 per day to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico upon delivery from the shipyard in the third quarter of 2013.
Diamond is actively considering another project similar to the Ocean Onyx that should provide the company with very attractive returns. The cost of this fleet renewal since '09 announced to -- amounts to almost $4 billion.
Now let's turn to Boardwalk. While Boardwalk had a good quarter, the market fundamentals of its base business remain challenging. Sustaining low natural gas prices, compressed basis spreads and now with seasonal spreads are making it difficult for Boardwalk to grow its base business. In light of this, Boardwalk has prudently decided to hold distribution steady in this quarter rather than raise the payout. This action will help Boardwalk strengthen its balance sheet as it continues to focus on long-term growth prospects.
We remain bullish on Boardwalk over the long term. Stan Horton and his team are not standing still. They have a number of projects in the works that should enhance the company's prospects.
At HighMount E&P, low natural gas prices continue to impact the company's results and produce -- primarily a producer of natural gas. Given the difficult environment for natural gas, HighMount is scaling up its efforts to produce more oil. 
In the Permian Basin, HighMount has put dry gas development activity on hiatus and is focusing on drilling Wolfcamp Shale wells that have high oil potential. Additionally, HighMount is now starting to drill for oil on the land it acquired last year in the Mississippian line in Oklahoma. And we are hopeful about seeing significant oil production from this property.
Overall, we are encouraged by HighMount's efforts to pursue projects that have the potential to diversify its product mix and generate high returns in the current environment.
As you know, for the second quarter, HighMount recorded a noncash ceiling test impairment charge. As I said last quarter, by it bears repeating, ceiling test impairment charges are mandated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and not because the gas is no longer in the ground. I continue to be a firm believer that we will see a continuing increase in gas consumption in the U.S., and we remain optimistic about natural gas usage and pricing over the long term.
Finally, turning to Loews Hotels and resorts. Paul Whetsell continues to make progress on this growth program. Let me point the 3 recent examples: number one, during the second quarter, Loews Hotels acquired Loews Hollywood in Los Angeles, which has 632 guestrooms and 48,000 square feet of meeting space. This should be a great property for Loews Hotels and its customers; number two, Loews Hotels announced earlier this month that the Regency hotel in New York will undergo an extensive renovation during 2013. The renovation is designed to ensure that the Regency will continue to offer unmatched contemporary comfort while maintaining its renowned standard of hospitality and service; and number three, Loews Hotels and Universal announced the Cabanna Bay Beach Resort, a newer hotel development at Universal Orlando with 1,800 rooms offering both modern and value-priced accommodations. This resort will be operated by Loews Hotels and is scheduled to open in 2014.
At the holding company level, Loews' investment income declined in the second quarter as compared to the same period in 2011. This decrease was due to lower performance of limited partnerships and equity investments for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Pete, while you haven't seen us make any acquisitions at the holding company level recently, you may have noticed that there's been no shortage of activity at our subsidiaries, whether it's Diamond Offshore seizing an opportunity to upgrade its fleet or Loews Hotels adding and upgrading assets in profitable Florida, California and New York City markets or CNA expanding its global footprint with its acquisition of Hardy, Loews' subsidiaries have been making attractive, strategic acquisitions. And we, at the holding company level, have been helping to facilitate some of these transactions. We continue to be pleased with, and involved in, each of our subsidiaries future prospects and will continue to focus on creating value over the long term for all Loews' shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Pete."
285930,213783686,334482,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2012",2012-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $56 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $250 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2011.As Jim mentioned, net i",844,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $56 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $250 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2011.
As Jim mentioned, net income for the quarter includes a noncash, ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after-tax at HighMount Exploration & Production, as a result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices.
Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, Loews' net income for 2012 would have been $198 million as compared to $250 million in the second quarter of 2011. The change is due primarily to lower earnings of Diamond Offshore Drilling and decreased performance of equity and limited partnership investments at the parent company. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings of CNA Financial and Boardwalk Pipeline partners.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the second quarter was $138 million as compared to $101 million in 2012 -- in 2011. Period-over-period comparisons were favorable due to lower catastrophe losses, improved underwriting results and premium rate increases in CNA's core P&C operations, as well as lower losses in its run-off businesses. Results were partially offset by lower net investment income due to decreased limited partnership results.
CNA continues to sustain positive rate momentum across it's P&C portfolio. A 6% rate increase in the quarter, which was up 2 points from the 4% CNA reported in the first quarter and up 5 points from the second quarter last year. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $94 million compared to $125 million in the prior year's quarter. Diamond Offshore's earnings decrease resulted primarily from lower rig utilization as more rigs were undergoing special surveys, the decrease in average day rate and an increase in contract drilling expenses, reflecting the costs of the special surveys. These decreases were partially offset by a $23 million gain after-tax and noncontrolling interests from the sale of 5 jacked up rigs in the second quarter of 2012.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the second quarter increased to $25 million from $5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was due to the absence of a $28 million materials and supplies impairment charge from the 2011 period, as well as higher transportation and storage-related revenues and the contribution of HP Storage operating results, which was acquired in just December 2011.
HighMount recorded a net loss of $139 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to net income of $15 million in the second quarter of 2011. The lower results were due to the noncash cost centers ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after-tax related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties, as well as decreased sales volumes stemming from the reduction in drilling activity and declines in natural gas and NGL prices. Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, net income for the quarter would have been $3 million.
For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, HighMount reported noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $142 million and $170 million after-tax. The ceiling test calculation was based on average 12-month prices of $3.15 per MMBTU for natural gas and $51.59 per barrel of natural gas liquids and $95.67 per barrel of oil.
The price and reserve levels remain unchanged through 2012. It is likely that HighMount will incur noncash and after-tax ceiling test impairments ranging from approximately $230 million to $280 million for the remainder of 2012, amounting to $400 million to $450 million for the full year of 2012.
HighMount's second quarter production volumes and realized prices, which include the benefit of hedges, are as follows: natural gas production was 10.1 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $3.89 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquid production was 582,000 barrels at an average realized price of $38.38 per barrel; and oil production was 101,000 barrels at an average realized price of $89.01 per barrel.
HighMount has hedges in place as of June 30, 2012, that cover approximately 66% of the remaining projected equivalent 2012 production at $5.49 per Mcfe.
At Loews Hotels, net incomes remain flat at $6 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter the previous year. Revenue per available room increased $6.49 to $182.08 for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the 2011 period. The increase in revenue per available room reflects improving occupancy and average room rates. Holding company cash investments as of June 30, 2012, totaled $3.7 billion, the same amount held at March 31, 2012. We received $173 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries, and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the second quarter of 2012.
We also provided $43 million to Loews Hotels for the acquisition of its Hollywood property and bought back 1.3 million shares of Loews' common stock for $51 million.
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Mary."

The strip is up to $3.56, whereas in April, it was about $1 lower. So there has been a significant rally in gas prices already. Spike gas prices, last I looked, about just under $3.20 an Mcf. Just as a reminder, that's the equivalent to about $19 a barrel of oil. So even though gas has had a significant rally, it is still very, very cheap relative to oil. And at the $3.20 level, it's still at a price where, for most people drilling for natural gas -- for dry gas, it is generally uneconomic to drill at these prices. So we've seen the rig count -- the natural gas rig count in the past year or so virtually cut in half as people are laying down natural gas rigs. I think that the rally in natural gas has already started, but it still has a ways to go. And I think, as I've said before on these calls, I think that the steady state equilibrium price for natural gas in the United States is probably somewhere between $4 and $4.50 an Mcf. We have, at HighMount, we've been looking to diversify our portfolio. We have plenty of gas in the ground that can be produced at higher natural gas prices. And so we've been -- we have acquired, last year, properties that we think are rich in oil. And our drilling programs have been focused on drilling for oil and natural gas liquids. And so we are moving to diversify HighMount away from just being focused on natural gas."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Loews' second quarter results. As you know by now, we reported earnings of $56 million for the quarter, as compared to $250 million of Loews earned in the second quarter of 2011.",1319,"Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Loews' second quarter results. As you know by now, we reported earnings of $56 million for the quarter, as compared to $250 million of Loews earned in the second quarter of 2011. Net income for the quarter includes after-tax, noncash fueling test impairment charges of $142 million at HighMount, related to the carrying value of its natural gas properties. These charges were the results of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids pricing.
Loews ended the second quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and investments at the holding company level. This quarter, we spent approximately $51 million buying back about 1.3 million shares of Loews' stock.
During the second quarter, Moody's Investors Service upgraded by 1 notch the senior unsecured ratings of Loews, CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore. According to Moody's, Loews' upgrade to A2 reflects the strengthening credit profile of our primary operating subsidiaries and our standalone financial strength and conservative financial policies.
Moody's also affirmed the CNA insurance company's financial strength ratings and revised the outlook on these ratings to positive from stable. So now, both Moody's and S&P have CNA's financial strength on positive outlook, which is a real credit to the progress that's being made by the management team at CNA.
In addition to the good news from the rating agencies, CNA had a solid quarter, which was favorably impacted by lower catastrophe losses and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results. Lower net investment income from CNA's limited partnership investments created a drag on an otherwise strong improvement in net operating income. ELP investment produced a second quarter pretax loss of $35 million in 2012 as compared to pretax income of $11 million in 2011.
The combined ratio for the P&C operations, excluding catastrophe losses in prior year development, improved by nearly 3 points versus last year's second quarter. Also, the reported combined ratio improved by 4.3 points to 101.7 during the second quarter.
CNA continues to close the underwriting performance gap with its best-in-class competitors. There's more work to be done, and we look forward to CNA continuing its steady progress towards becoming a top-tier industry performer.
In July, CNA closed its acquisition of Hardy Underwriting, a specialized Lloyd's underwriter with a solid market reputation and a long history of disciplined underwriting. This acquisition will provide CNA with a key platform for international growth. Hardy's results would be included in CNA's and Loews' third quarter results.
Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a solid quarter despite its net income being down by about $60 million versus last year's second quarter. The biggest driver of the decline was that Diamond had 5 rigs in the shipyard this quarter for the 5-year special surveys compared to none during the same period last year. It's worth mentioning that despite the drop in oil prices, the offshore drilling market continues to show real strength. We believe that Diamond is well positioned to take advantage of these market conditions, given its rig availability over the coming 2 to 3 years.
Recent contracts signed by Diamond and other drillers for mid-water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs indicate that demand is strong.
Diamond continues to focus on modernizing its fleet. As a reminder, Diamond has 4 ultra-deepwater drillships under construction in Korea. Earlier in '09, Diamond purchased 2 ultra-deep waters semisubmersibles in bankruptcy options. And most recently, Diamond is reconstructing an older semisubmersible into a high spec drilling unit to be named the Ocean Onyx. The rig was recently awarded a 1-year contract at a rate of $490,000 per day to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico upon delivery from the shipyard in the third quarter of 2013.
Diamond is actively considering another project similar to the Ocean Onyx that should provide the company with very attractive returns. The cost of this fleet renewal since '09 announced to -- amounts to almost $4 billion.
Now let's turn to Boardwalk. While Boardwalk had a good quarter, the market fundamentals of its base business remain challenging. Sustaining low natural gas prices, compressed basis spreads and now with seasonal spreads are making it difficult for Boardwalk to grow its base business. In light of this, Boardwalk has prudently decided to hold distribution steady in this quarter rather than raise the payout. This action will help Boardwalk strengthen its balance sheet as it continues to focus on long-term growth prospects.
We remain bullish on Boardwalk over the long term. Stan Horton and his team are not standing still. They have a number of projects in the works that should enhance the company's prospects.
At HighMount E&P, low natural gas prices continue to impact the company's results and produce -- primarily a producer of natural gas. Given the difficult environment for natural gas, HighMount is scaling up its efforts to produce more oil. 
In the Permian Basin, HighMount has put dry gas development activity on hiatus and is focusing on drilling Wolfcamp Shale wells that have high oil potential. Additionally, HighMount is now starting to drill for oil on the land it acquired last year in the Mississippian line in Oklahoma. And we are hopeful about seeing significant oil production from this property.
Overall, we are encouraged by HighMount's efforts to pursue projects that have the potential to diversify its product mix and generate high returns in the current environment.
As you know, for the second quarter, HighMount recorded a noncash ceiling test impairment charge. As I said last quarter, by it bears repeating, ceiling test impairment charges are mandated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and not because the gas is no longer in the ground. I continue to be a firm believer that we will see a continuing increase in gas consumption in the U.S., and we remain optimistic about natural gas usage and pricing over the long term.
Finally, turning to Loews Hotels and resorts. Paul Whetsell continues to make progress on this growth program. Let me point the 3 recent examples: number one, during the second quarter, Loews Hotels acquired Loews Hollywood in Los Angeles, which has 632 guestrooms and 48,000 square feet of meeting space. This should be a great property for Loews Hotels and its customers; number two, Loews Hotels announced earlier this month that the Regency hotel in New York will undergo an extensive renovation during 2013. The renovation is designed to ensure that the Regency will continue to offer unmatched contemporary comfort while maintaining its renowned standard of hospitality and service; and number three, Loews Hotels and Universal announced the Cabanna Bay Beach Resort, a newer hotel development at Universal Orlando with 1,800 rooms offering both modern and value-priced accommodations. This resort will be operated by Loews Hotels and is scheduled to open in 2014.
At the holding company level, Loews' investment income declined in the second quarter as compared to the same period in 2011. This decrease was due to lower performance of limited partnerships and equity investments for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Pete, while you haven't seen us make any acquisitions at the holding company level recently, you may have noticed that there's been no shortage of activity at our subsidiaries, whether it's Diamond Offshore seizing an opportunity to upgrade its fleet or Loews Hotels adding and upgrading assets in profitable Florida, California and New York City markets or CNA expanding its global footprint with its acquisition of Hardy, Loews' subsidiaries have been making attractive, strategic acquisitions. And we, at the holding company level, have been helping to facilitate some of these transactions. We continue to be pleased with, and involved in, each of our subsidiaries future prospects and will continue to focus on creating value over the long term for all Loews' shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Pete."
285930,213783686,336098,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2012",2012-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $56 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $250 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2011.As Jim mentioned, net i",844,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $56 million or $0.14 per share for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $250 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2011.
As Jim mentioned, net income for the quarter includes a noncash, ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after-tax at HighMount Exploration & Production, as a result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices.
Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, Loews' net income for 2012 would have been $198 million as compared to $250 million in the second quarter of 2011. The change is due primarily to lower earnings of Diamond Offshore Drilling and decreased performance of equity and limited partnership investments at the parent company. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings of CNA Financial and Boardwalk Pipeline partners.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the second quarter was $138 million as compared to $101 million in 2012 -- in 2011. Period-over-period comparisons were favorable due to lower catastrophe losses, improved underwriting results and premium rate increases in CNA's core P&C operations, as well as lower losses in its run-off businesses. Results were partially offset by lower net investment income due to decreased limited partnership results.
CNA continues to sustain positive rate momentum across its P&C portfolio. A 6% rate increase in the quarter, which was up 2 points from the 4% CNA reported in the first quarter and up 5 points from the second quarter last year. 
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $94 million compared to $125 million in the prior year's quarter. Diamond Offshore's earnings decrease resulted primarily from lower rig utilization as more rigs were undergoing special surveys, the decrease in average day rate and an increase in contract drilling expenses, reflecting the costs of the special surveys. These decreases were partially offset by a $23 million gain after-tax and noncontrolling interests from the sale of 5 jacked up rigs in the second quarter of 2012.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the second quarter increased to $25 million from $5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was due to the absence of a $28 million materials and supplies impairment charge from the 2011 period, as well as higher transportation and storage-related revenues and the contribution of HP Storage operating results, which was acquired in just December 2011.
HighMount recorded a net loss of $139 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to net income of $15 million in the second quarter of 2011. The lower results were due to the noncash cost centers ceiling test impairment charge of $142 million after-tax related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties, as well as decreased sales volumes stemming from the reduction in drilling activity and declines in natural gas and NGL prices. Excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, net income for the quarter would have been $3 million.
For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2012, HighMount reported noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $142 million and $170 million after-tax. The ceiling test calculation was based on average 12-month prices of $3.15 per MMBTU for natural gas and $51.59 per barrel of natural gas liquids and $95.67 per barrel of oil.
The price and reserve levels remain unchanged through 2012. It is likely that HighMount will incur noncash and after-tax ceiling test impairments ranging from approximately $230 million to $280 million for the remainder of 2012, amounting to $400 million to $450 million for the full year of 2012.
HighMount's second quarter production volumes and realized prices, which include the benefit of hedges, are as follows: natural gas production was 10.1 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $3.89 per 1,000 cubic feet; natural gas liquid production was 582,000 barrels at an average realized price of $38.38 per barrel; and oil production was 101,000 barrels at an average realized price of $89.01 per barrel.
HighMount has hedges in place as of June 30, 2012, that cover approximately 66% of the remaining projected equivalent 2012 production at $5.49 per Mcfe.
At Loews Hotels, net incomes remain flat at $6 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter the previous year. Revenue per available room increased $6.49 to $182.08 for the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the 2011 period. The increase in revenue per available room reflects improving occupancy and average room rates. Holding company cash investments as of June 30, 2012, totaled $3.7 billion, the same amount held at March 31, 2012. We received $173 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries, and paid $25 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during the second quarter of 2012.
We also provided $43 million to Loews Hotels for the acquisition of its Hollywood property and bought back 1.3 million shares of Loews' common stock for $51 million.
And now, I'll turn the call back over to Mary."

The strip is up to $3.56, whereas in April, it was about $1 lower. So there has been a significant rally in gas prices already. Spike gas prices, last I looked, about just under $3.20 an Mcf. Just as a reminder, that's the equivalent to about $19 a barrel of oil. So even though gas has had a significant rally, it is still very, very cheap relative to oil. And at the $3.20 level, it's still at a price where, for most people drilling for natural gas -- for dry gas, it is generally uneconomic to drill at these prices. So we've seen the rig count -- the natural gas rig count in the past year or so virtually cut in half as people are laying down natural gas rigs. I think that the rally in natural gas has already started, but it still has a ways to go. And I think, as I've said before on these calls, I think that the steady state equilibrium price for natural gas in the United States is probably somewhere between $4 and $4.50 an Mcf. We have, at HighMount, we've been looking to diversify our portfolio. We have plenty of gas in the ground that can be produced at higher natural gas prices. And so we've been -- we have acquired, last year, properties that we think are rich in oil. And our drilling programs have been focused on drilling for oil and natural gas liquids. And so we are moving to diversify HighMount away from just being focused on natural gas."

And I hope everybody is staying dry and staying safe. As you know by now, Loews reported earnings for the quarter of $177 million or $0.47 -- $0.45 per share compared to $162 million or $0.40 per share that Loe",1379,"Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. And I hope everybody is staying dry and staying safe. As you know by now, Loews reported earnings for the quarter of $177 million or $0.47 -- $0.45 per share compared to $162 million or $0.40 per share that Loews earned in the third quarter of 2011. Results for the third quarter of 2012 include impairment charges of $166 million after-tax at HighMount, relating to the carrying value of its producing properties. These charges were the result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Absent the ceiling test impairment charges, our quarterly net income would've been $343 million or $0.87 per share.
Loews ended the third quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and investments at the holding company level. In the third quarter, we spent approximately $88 million buying back about 2.2 million shares of Loews' common stock. Our book value per share increased to $50.41 at the end of the third quarter from $47.33 a year -- at year-end 2011.
Now let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries. CNA had another solid quarter. Results for the quarter were driven primarily by increased investment income, especially from limited partnerships. CNA continues to execute its strategy of focusing on select customer segments. About half of CNA's new business is now coming from new 7 focus segments, including healthcare and construction, areas where CNA has specialized underwriting capabilities.
Rates continue to improve and increased approximately 6% during the quarter in CNA's P&C operations. In CNA commercial, rates were up 8% for the quarter versus 7% in the second quarter and 2% during the third quarter of 2011. Rate increases, combined with management's underwriting strategies, are leading to improvements in CNA's underwriting results. CNA's loss ratio before catastrophes and prior year development continue to improve during the third quarter. In CNA commercial, for example, this ratio improved by almost 2.5 points versus last year's third quarter. Over the past few years, as management's action have taken hold, CNA has now the loss ratio GAAP with peers in its core commercial business.
This is the first quarter CNA has included Hardy Underwriting in its result. Hardy is CNA's recently acquired Lloyd's syndicate and is off to a strong start.
Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a good quarter, although its net income was down $79 million versus the same period last year. Two main factors drove the profit decline. First, a number of rigs rolled off of record high day rates from contracts that have been signed during the previous subcycle. Second main factor was unplanned downtime, which were slightly above average compared to better-than-average downtime in the prior quarter.
Demand in the drilling market for mid-water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs remained strong, as indicated by recent contract signed by Diamond and other drillers. Diamond has entered into new contracts for extended existing contracts of attractive day rates and durations. Also during the third quarter, Diamond announced plans to rebuild the Ocean Apex, a victory class semisubmersible rig that will be delivered from the shipyard in Singapore in 2014 at an all-in cost of about $300 million. The Ocean Apex is the last of Diamond's victory class rebuilds, where 9 victory class holds in the world and Diamond owns all of 9 of them. All victory class holds has extremely long life spans. And since the mid-1990s, Diamond has used each of these holds as the base upon in which to build a new rig, including all new drilling equipment. The end product is the equivalent of a newbuild rig. These victory class newbuilds, including with other Diamond's other newbuild rig acquisitions, are just a few examples of the company's strategy for enhancing its fleet at significantly reduced cost, a strategy that has returned tremendous value to Diamond and to Loews.
The Ocean Apex rebuild follows quickly after that of the Ocean Onyx, another victory class haul being rebuilt and scheduled for delivery in 2013. Also, as I've previously discussed, Diamond will take delivery of 4 newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships in 2013 and 2014.
Now let's turn to Boardwalk. Boardwalk had a good quarter. Net income attributable to Loews was $20 million compared to $18 million for the third quarter last year. Due to the seasonality of the business, the third quarter is typically Boardwalk's weakest of the year. Best distributions to Loews from Boardwalk during the quarter amounted to $72 million. Boardwalk continues to execute its strategy of diversifying its services and geographic footprint in order to generate growth. The company's recent acquisition of PL Midstream, renamed Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, is an example of Boardwalk driving its diversification strategy forward. The acquisition enables Boardwalk to enter the natural gas liquids storage and distribution business, with strategically located and well-contracted assets and a strong experienced management team.
The acquisition in early October of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, together with the organic growth projects such as the Southeast market expansion and the Eagle Ford expansion project, once completed, will result in approximately $1.2 billion of new assets for Boardwalk. Loews initially acquired 65% of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream in early October to assist Boardwalk in the acquisition of the company. In mid-October, just 2 weeks after the closing of that acquisition and subsequent to an equity sale by Boardwalk, Boardwalk then purchased from Loews, Loews' 65% stake in Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream. This transaction worked better than planned as the drop-down occurred sooner than anticipated, which ultimately benefited both Boardwalk and Loews' shareholders. This is the second time that Loews has been able to use its balance sheet to help Boardwalk take advantage of a great opportunity. The first being the purchase of HP Storage, which is another recent acquisition for Boardwalk.
Loews is ready to help the future transactions that we think will add value to Boardwalk and to Loews.
At HighMount E&P, low natural gas prices continue to impact the company's results. Given the difficult pricing environment, HighMount is currently directing its drilling efforts to locations that should result in higher oil production. These areas include the Mississippian line in Oklahoma and the Wolfcamp Strada in Sonora, Texas. Specifically, HighMount has been drilling on the acreage position it acquired last year in the Mississippian line, which is an oil play. HighMount has drilled and completed 12 wells, and initial production rates are comparable to those of other operators in the area. HighMount will continue with this exploratory phase for the next several quarters, and we look forward to sharing additional information on their results as we receive it.
Finally, turning to Loews Hotels and Resorts, we continue to make real progress in our strategy of growing in key urban and resort market such as the new Loews Hollywood. Additionally, through 2012 and into 2013, Loews will be renovating hotels in 6 key locations. One of these properties will be the Loews Regency in New York, where extensive renovations will begin in early 2013.
Turning back to Loews at the holding company level. Loews' investment income increased to $79 million in the third quarter due to improved performance in equity and equity-like investments. This is a $143 million improvement from the $64 million loss that we experienced in the same period in 2011. As a final point, and before handing the call over to Pete, while you haven't seen us make a large acquisition at the holding company level recently, Loews and its subsidiaries have not been standing still. In 2010 to 2012, Loews and its subsidiaries have committed to projects in excess of $6 billion. These projects include Diamond's 4 new drillships and 2 rebuild semisubmersibles; Boardwalk's recent acquisition of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream and HP Storage; CNA's acquisition of Hardy and the remainder of CNA HighMount's addition of acreage in the Mississippian line; and the expansion and renovation activities within Loews Hotels.
Here at the holding company level, we have been helping to facilitate some of these transactions. In addition, during that same time period, the holding company have spent about $1.2 billion in share repurchases. As always, all of these actions are part of our effort to create value over the long term for all Loews shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Pete Keegan."
285930,222709369,372572,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2012",2012-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $177 million or $0.45 per share for the third quarter 2012 as compared to $162 million or $0.40 per share in the third quarter of 2011. As Jim mentioned, net income fo",832,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $177 million or $0.45 per share for the third quarter 2012 as compared to $162 million or $0.40 per share in the third quarter of 2011. As Jim mentioned, net income for the quarter includes a noncash ceiling test impairment charge of $166 million after-tax at HighMount Exploration & Production as a result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices.
Income, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, would've been $343 million as compared to $162 million in the third quarter 2011. The increase is due primarily to higher earnings at CNA Financial and higher holding company investment income due primarily to increased performance of equity and limited partnership investments. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore.
Income, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge for the first 9 months of 2012 is $936 million as compared to $791 million in the 2011 period. The increase is due primarily to the reasons I just mentioned, as well as improved earnings from Boardwalk Pipeline, primarily due to the contribution for Boardwalk HP Storage Company, which is acquired in December 2011, as well as the prior year impact of an impairment charge related to steel pipe materials. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the third quarter was a $195 million as compared to $84 million in 2011. CNA's earnings increased due to higher net investment income, driven by favorable limited partnership income, improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by decreased favorable net prior year development.
Book value per common share for CNA was $46.99 at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 4% from the end of the second quarter. The increase reflects earnings and improvement in CNA's investment portfolio net unrealized gain position.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the third quarter 2012 was $83 million compared to $121 million in the prior year quarter. Diamond Offshore's earnings decreased resulted primarily from lower rig utilization, the decrease in average daily rate, which was partially offset by lower interest expense. Diamond also have lower rig operating cost this quarter.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the third quarter increased slightly to $20 million from $18 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to the storage and transportation revenues earned from HP Storage. In addition, parking and landing revenues increased due to improved market conditions. The increase was partially offset by decrease in transportation revenue due to lower interruptible service.
At HighMount, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, net income for the quarter would've been $8 million compared to net income of $16 million in the third quarter of 2011. For the 9 months ended September 2012, HighMount recorded noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $336 million after-tax. The ceiling test calculation was based on average 12-month prices of $2.83 per MMBTU for natural gas, $46.02 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $94.97 per barrel for oil.
The prices and reserve levels remain unchanged through 2012. It is likely that HighMount will incur noncash after-tax ceiling test impairments ranging from approximately $50 million to $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 amounting to $386 million to $436 million for the full year.
HighMount's third quarter production volumes and realized prices, which included the benefit of hedges are as follows: natural gas production was $9.5 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.28 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production was about 590,000 barrels at an average realized price of $37.48 per barrel; and oil production was about 132,000 barrels at an average realized price of $94.71 per barrel.
HighMount has hedges in place as of September 30, 2012, to cover approximately 75% of the remaining projected equivalent 2012 production at $5.70 per Mcfe.
Loews Hotels and Resorts recorded a net loss of $1 million as compared to breaking even for the same period in 2011. The decrease is primarily due to increased expenses, including acquisition and transition-related costs from the Loews Hollywood Hotel. Revenue per available room increased $7.53 to $169.31 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to the 2011 period.
Occupancy rates increased to 82% in the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, from 79.8% in the 2011 period. Average room rates increased $3.70 or 1.8% in the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to the 2011 period.
Holding company cash and investments as of September 30, 2012, totaled $3.8 billion compared to the $3.7 billion held at June 30, 2012.
We received $169 million interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $24 million in cash to our shareholders during the third quarter 2012. We also bought back 2.2 million shares of Loews common stock for $88 million. And now I'll turn the call back over to Mary."

Actually, I think gas prices, truth to tell, they've come back faster than I would've expected. I think that we, as a nation, first of all, the natural gas picture has changed dramatically over the past 5 years. In the past 5 years, gas has gone from a commodity that was seen to be in shortage, where it traded in '08 at $15 an Mcf. And now it is a commodity that is seen to be in vast abundance. The United States has about that we know of now, about 100 years supply of natural gas. As a country, we produce about 65 billion cubic feet per day. And we could increase that production by 50%, in my opinion, with a gas price in the $4 to $4.50 range. So what's needed now for the gas market is just continued demand growth. The demand growth has come, over the past several years, from the power sector as gas has taken significant market share from coal. But I anticipate in the future that there will be increases in other sectors' demand for gas, as well as continued increases from the power sector. I'm also hopeful that over the intermediate term, 3 to 5 years, will also be significant increases in natural gas coming from the exploitation of natural gas. That will -- exploiting natural gas will benefit a lot of people. First of all, for every additional 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas that we produce a day, it should increase jobs -- my number is 7,000 to 10,000 jobs per million cubic feet, permanent jobs. Again, we're using a number about 40,000 additional jobs per billion cubic feet. So exploiting gas will improve employment by some significant amount. It will also improve our trade deficit and our current account deficit. So those are all positives. And I believe that this all can be done in an environment where natural gas prices remain under -- remain at about $4.50 per Mcf. It will also be -- one other thing, it also will be very transformative for our economy, as we as a nation, switch over time over the next several years, starting with heavy trucks and buses and inner city delivery vehicles from oil and diesel to natural gas. It will be good for the environment, it will be good for our economy, it will bring cost down dramatically. I can see railroads switching from diesel fuel to natural gas. In fact, there are railroads that are already beginning to experiment with that. And when 1 railroad or 1 trucker does that, then others will have to follow very quickly because gas trades at such a significant discount to oil. Our West Texas intermediate is about $86 a barrel, and international oil, as measured by Brent, is $20 higher. We have natural gas, it's trading at under $4 an Mcf, which is the equivalent of less than $25 a barrel. So as I said before, natural gas in the United States is BTUs on the cheap. And the invisible hand of the markets will drive oil consumers to make the switch to natural gas, and we will all be better off as a result."

285930,222709369,372639,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2012",2012-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. And I hope everybody is staying dry and staying safe.

And I hope everybody is staying dry and staying safe. As you know by now, Loews' reported earnings for the quarter of $177 million, or $0.47 -- $0.45 per share, compared to $162 million, or $0.40 per share, that Loews earned in the third quarter of 2011. Results for the third quarter of 2012 include impairment charges of $166 million after-tax at HighMount relating to the carrying value of its producing properties. These charges were the result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Absent the ceiling test impairment charges, our quarterly net income would have been $343 million or $0.87 per share.
Loews ended the third quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and investments at the holding company level. In the third quarter, we spent approximately $88 million buying back about 2.2 million shares of Loews' common stock. Our book value per share increased to $50.41 at the end of the third quarter from $47.33 a year -- at year-end 2011.
Now let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries. CNA had another solid quarter. Results for the quarter were driven primarily by increased investment income, especially from limited partnerships. CNA continues to execute its strategy of focusing on select customer segments. About half of CNA's new business is now coming from new 7 focus segments, including health care and construction, areas where CNA has specialized underwriting capabilities.
Rates continued to improve and increased approximately 6% during the quarter in CNA's P&C operations. In CNA commercial, rates were up 8% for the quarter versus 7% in the second quarter and 2% during the third quarter of 2011. Rate increases, combined with management's underwriting strategies, are leading to improvements in CNA's underwriting results. CNA's loss ratio before catastrophes and prior year development continued to improve during the third quarter. In CNA commercial, for example, this ratio improved by almost 2.5 points versus last year's third quarter. Over the past few years, as management's actions have taken hold, CNA has now the loss ratio gap with peers in its core commercial business.
This is the first quarter CNA has included Hardy Underwriting in its results. Hardy is CNA's recently acquired Lloyd's [ph] syndicate and is off to a strong start.
Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a good quarter, although its net income was down $79 million versus the same period last year. Two main factors drove the profit decline. First, a number of rigs rolled off of record high day rates from contracts that had been signed during the previous subcycle. Second main factor was unplanned downtime, which were slightly above average compared to better-than-average downtime in the prior quarter.
Demand in the drilling market for mid-water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs remained strong, as indicated by recent contracts signed by Diamond and other drillers. Diamond has entered into new contracts or extended existing contracts with attractive day rates and durations. Also during the third quarter, Diamond announced plans to rebuild the Ocean Apex, a Victory-class semisubmersible rig that will be delivered from the shipyard in Singapore in 2014 at an all-in cost of about $300 million. The Ocean Apex is the last of Diamond's Victory-class rebuilds. There are 9 Victory-class holds in the world and Diamond owns all of 9 of them. These Victory-class hauls have extremely long life spans. And since the mid-1990s, Diamond has used each of these hauls as the base upon which to build a new rig, including all new drilling equipment. The end product is the equivalent of a new-build rig. These Victory-class new-builds, along with Diamond's other new-build rig acquisitions, are just a few examples of the company's strategy for enhancing its fleet at significantly reduced cost, a strategy that has returned tremendous value to Diamond and to Loews.
The Ocean Apex rebuild follows quickly after that of the Ocean Onyx, another Victory-class haul being rebuilt and scheduled for delivery in 2013. Also, as I've previously discussed, Diamond will take delivery of 4 new-build ultra-deepwater drillships in 2013 and 2014.
Now let's turn to Boardwalk. Boardwalk had a good quarter. Net income attributable to Loews was $20 million compared to $18 million for the third quarter last year. Due to the seasonality of the business, the third quarter is typically Boardwalk's weakest of the year. Best distributions due Loews from Boardwalk during the quarter amounted to $72 million. Boardwalk continues to execute its strategy of diversifying its services and geographic footprint in order to generate growth. The company's recent acquisition of PL Midstream, renamed Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, is an example of Boardwalk driving its diversification strategy forward. The acquisition enables Boardwalk to enter the natural gas liquids storage and distribution business with strategically located and well-contracted assets and a strong, experienced management team.
The acquisition in early October of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, together with the organic growth projects, such as the Southeast market expansion and the Eagle Ford expansion projects, once completed will result in approximately $1.2 billion of new assets for Boardwalk. Loews initially acquired 65% of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream in early October to assist Boardwalk in the acquisition of the company. In mid-October, just 2 weeks after the closing of that acquisition and subsequent to an equity sale by Boardwalk, Boardwalk then purchased from Loews, Loews' 65% stake in Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream. This transaction worked better than planned as the drop-down occurred sooner than anticipated, which ultimately benefited both Boardwalk and Loews shareholders. This is the second time that Loews has been able to use its balance sheet to help Boardwalk take advantage of a great opportunity, the first being the purchase of HP Storage, which is another recent acquisition for Boardwalk. Loews is ready to help with future transactions that we think will add value to Boardwalk and to Loews.
At HighMount E&P, low natural gas prices continued to impact the company's results. Given the difficult pricing environment, HighMount is currently directing its drilling efforts to locations that should result in higher oil production. These areas include the Mississippian line in Oklahoma and the Wolfcamp strata in Sonora, Texas. Specifically, HighMount has been drilling on the acreage position it acquired last year in the Mississippian line, which is an oil play. HighMount has drilled and completed 12 wells, and initial production rates are comparable to those of other operators in the area. HighMount will continue with this exploratory phase for the next several quarters, and we look forward to sharing additional information about their results as we receive it.
Finally, turning to Loews Hotels & Resorts, we continued to make real progress in our strategy of growing in key urban and resort markets such as the new Loews Hollywood. Additionally, through 2012 and into 2013, Loews will be renovating hotels in 6 key locations. One of these properties will be the Loews Regency in New York, where extensive renovations will begin in early 2013.
Going back to Loews at the holding company, level. Loews' investment income increased to $79 million in the third quarter due to improved performance in equity and equity-like investments. This is a $143 million improvement from the $64 million loss that we experienced in the same period in 2011. 
As a final point, and before handing the call over to Pete, while you haven't seen us make a large acquisition at the holding company level recently, Loews and its subsidiaries have not been standing still. In 2010 to 2012, Loews and its subsidiaries have committed to projects in excess of $6 billion. These projects include Diamond's 4 new drillships and 2 rebuild semisubmersibles, Boardwalk's recent acquisitions of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream and HP Storage, CNA's acquisitions of Hardy and the remainder of CNA Surety, HighMount's addition of acreage in the Mississippian line and the expansion and renovation activities within Loews Hotels.
Here at the holding company level, we have been helping to facilitate some of these transactions. In addition, during that same time period, the holding company had spent about $1.2 billion in share repurchases. As always, all of these actions are part of our effort to create value over the long term for all Loews shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Pete Keegan."

The increase is due primarily to higher earnings at CNA Financial and higher holding company investment income due primarily to increased performance of equity and limited partnership investments. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore.
Income, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge for the first 9 months of 2012 is $936 million as compared to $791 million in the 2011 period. The increase is due primarily to the reasons I just mentioned as well as improved earnings from Boardwalk Pipeline, primarily due to the contribution for Boardwalk HP Storage Company, which was acquired in December 2011, as well as the prior year impact of an impairment charge related to steel pipe materials. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the third quarter was a $195 million as compared to $84 million in 2011. CNA's earnings increased due to higher net investment income driven by favorable limited partnership income, improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by decreased favorable net prior year development.
Book value per common share for CNA was $46.99 at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 4% from the end of the second quarter. The increase reflects earnings and improvement in CNA's investment portfolio net unrealized gain position.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the third quarter 2012 was $83 million compared to $121 million in the prior year quarter. Diamond Offshore's earnings decrease resulted primarily from lower rig utilization and a decrease in average daily rates, which was partially offset by lower interest expense. Diamond also had lower rig operating costs this quarter.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the third quarter increased slightly to $20 million from $18 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to storage and transportation revenues earned from HP Storage. In addition, parking and lending revenues increased due to improved market conditions. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in transportation revenue due to lower interruptible service.
At HighMount, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, net income for the quarter would have been $8 million compared to net income of $16 million in the third quarter of 2011. For the 9 months ended September 2012, HighMount recorded noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $336 million after-tax. The ceiling test calculation was based on average 12-month prices of $2.83 per MMBTU for natural gas, $46.02 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $94.97 per barrel for oil.
When prices and reserve levels remain unchanged through 2012, it is likely that HighMount will incur noncash after-tax ceiling test impairments ranging from approximately $50 million to $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 amounting to $386 million to $436 million for the full year.
HighMount's third quarter production volumes and realized prices, which include the benefit of hedges, are as follows: natural gas production was 9.5 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.28 per thousand cubic feet, natural gas liquids production was about 590,000 barrels at an average realized price of $37.48 per barrel, and oil production was about 132,000 barrels at an average realized price of $94.71 per barrel. HighMount has hedges in place as of September 30, 2012, to cover approximately 75% of the remaining projected equivalent 2012 production at $5.70 per Mcfe.
Loews Hotels & Resorts recorded a net loss of $1 million as compared to breaking even for the same period in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to increased expenses, including acquisition and transition-related costs from the Loews Hollywood Hotel. Revenue per available room increased $7.53 to $169.31 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to the 2011 period. Occupancy rates increased to 82% in the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, from 79.8% in the 2011 period. Average room rates increased $3.70, or 1.8%, in the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to the 2011 period.
Holding company cash and investments as of September 30, 2012, totaled $3.8 billion compared to the $3.7 billion held at June 30, 2012.
We received $169 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $24 million in cash to our shareholders during the third quarter of 2012. We also bought back 2.2 million shares of Loews common stock for $88 million. And now I'll turn the call back over to Mary."

Actually, I think gas prices, truth to tell, have come back faster than I would have expected. I think that we, as a nation -- first of all, the natural gas picture has changed dramatically over the past 5 years. In the past 5 years, gas has gone from a commodity that was seen to be in shortage, where it traded in '08 at $15 an Mcf, and now it is a commodity that is seen to be in vast abundance. The United States has about, that we know of now, about 100 years' supply of natural gas. As a country, we produce about 65 billion cubic feet per day, and we could increase that production by 50%, in my opinion, with a gas price in the $4 to $4.50 range. So what's needed now for the gas market is just continued demand growth. Demand growth has come over the past several years from the power sector as gas has taken significant market share from coal. But I anticipate in the future that there will be increases in other sectors' demand for gas as well as continued increases in -- from the power sector. I'm also hopeful that over the intermediate term, 3 to 5 years, there will also be significant increases in natural gas coming from the exportation of natural gas. That will -- exporting natural gas will benefit a lot of people. First of all, for every additional 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas that we produce a day, it should increase jobs -- my number is 7,000 to 10,000 jobs per billion cubic feet, permanent jobs. Again, Juergen's [ph] using a number of about 40,000 additional jobs per billion cubic feet. So exploiting gas will improve employment by some significant amount. It will also improve our trade deficit and our current account deficit. So those are all positives. And I believe that this all can be done in an environment where natural gas prices remain under -- remain at about $4.50 per Mcf. It will also be -- one other thing, it also will be very transformative for our economy as we as a nation switch over time over the next several years starting with heavy trucks and buses and inner city delivery vehicles from oil and diesel to natural gas. It will be good for the environment. It will be good for our economy. It will bring costs down dramatically. I can see railroads switching from diesel fuel to natural gas. In fact, there are railroads that are already beginning to experiment with that. And when 1 railroad or 1 trucker does that, then others will have to follow very quickly because gas trades at such a significant discount to oil. While West Texas Intermediate is about $86 a barrel and international oil, as measured by Brent, is $20 higher, well, we have natural gas that's trading at under $4 an Mcf, which is the equivalent of less than $25 a barrel. So as I said before, natural gas in the United States in BTUs is on the cheap, and the invisible hand of the markets will drive oil consumers to make the switch to natural gas and we will all be better off as a result."

We are -- when I talk about higher prices, I'm not talking about $7 or $8 an Mcf. It's substantially lower than that, but it's also higher than where we are today."

And I hope everybody is staying dry and staying safe.

And I hope everybody is staying dry and staying safe. As you know by now, Loews reported earnings for the quarter of $177 million, or $0.47 -- $0.45 per share, compared to $162 million, or $0.40 per share, that Loews earned in the third quarter of 2011. Results for the third quarter of 2012 include impairment charges of $166 million after tax at HighMount relating to the carrying value of its producing properties. These charges were the result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Absent the ceiling test impairment charges, our quarterly net income would have been $343 million or $0.87 per share.
Loews ended the third quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and investments at the holding company level. In the third quarter, we spent approximately $88 million buying back about 2.2 million shares of Loews' common stock. Our book value per share increased to $50.41 at the end of the third quarter from $47.33 a year -- at year end 2011.
Now let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries. CNA had another solid quarter. Results for the quarter were driven primarily by increased investment income, especially from limited partnerships. CNA continues to execute its strategy of focusing on select customer segments. About half of CNA's new business is now coming from these 7 focus segments, including health care and construction, areas where CNA has specialized underwriting capabilities.
Rates continued to improve and increased approximately 6% during the quarter in CNA's P&C operations. In CNA commercial, rates were up 8% for the quarter versus 7% in the second quarter and 2% during the third quarter of 2011. Rate increases, combined with management's underwriting strategies, are leading to improvements in CNA's underwriting results. CNA's loss ratio before catastrophes and prior year development continued to improve during the third quarter. In CNA commercial, for example, this ratio improved by almost 2.5 points versus last year's third quarter. Over the past few years, as management's actions have taken hold, CNA has narrowed the loss ratio gap with peers in its core commercial business.
This is the first quarter CNA has included Hardy Underwriting in its results. Hardy is CNA's recently acquired Lloyd's syndicate and is off to a strong start.
Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a good quarter, although its net income was down $79 million versus the same period last year. Two main factors drove the profit decline. First, a number of rigs rolled off of record high day rates from contracts that had been signed during the previous subcycle. Second main factor was unplanned downtime, which was slightly above average compared to better-than-average downtime in the prior quarter.
Demand in the drilling market for mid-water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs remained strong, as indicated by recent contracts signed by Diamond and other drillers. Diamond has entered into new contracts or extended existing contracts with attractive day rates and durations. Also during the third quarter, Diamond announced plans to rebuild the Ocean Apex, a Victory-class semisubmersible rig that will be delivered from the shipyard in Singapore in 2014 at an all-in cost of about $300 million. The Ocean Apex is the last of Diamond's Victory-class rebuilds. There are 9 Victory-class hulls in the world and Diamond owns all 9 of them. These Victory-class hulls have extremely long life spans. And since the mid-1990s, Diamond has used each of these hulls as the base upon which to build a new rig, including all new drilling equipment. The end product is the equivalent of a new-build rig. These Victory-class rebuilds, along with Diamond's other new-build rig acquisitions, are just a few examples of the company's strategy for enhancing its fleet at significantly reduced cost, a strategy that has returned tremendous value to Diamond and to Loews.
The Ocean Apex rebuild follows quickly after that of the Ocean Onyx, another Victory-class hull being rebuilt and scheduled for delivery in 2013. Also, as I've previously discussed, Diamond will take delivery of 4 new-build ultra-deepwater drillships in 2013 and 2014.
Now let's turn to Boardwalk. Boardwalk had a good quarter. Net income attributable to Loews was $20 million compared to $18 million for the third quarter last year. Due to the seasonality of the business, the third quarter is typically Boardwalk's weakest of the year. Best distributions due Loews from Boardwalk during the quarter amounted to $72 million. Boardwalk continues to execute its strategy of diversifying its services and geographic footprint in order to generate growth. The company's recent acquisition of PL Midstream, renamed Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, is an example of Boardwalk driving its diversification strategy forward. The acquisition enables Boardwalk to enter the natural gas liquids storage and distribution business with strategically located and well-contracted assets and a strong, experienced management team.
The acquisition in early October of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, together with the organic growth projects, such as the Southeast market expansion and the Eagle Ford expansion projects, once completed, will result in approximately $1.2 billion of new assets for Boardwalk. Loews initially acquired 65% of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream in early October to assist Boardwalk in the acquisition of the company. In mid-October, just 2 weeks after the closing of that acquisition and subsequent to an equity sale by Boardwalk, Boardwalk then purchased from Loews, Loews' 65% stake in Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream. This transaction worked better than planned as the drop-down occurred sooner than anticipated, which ultimately benefited both Boardwalk and Loews shareholders. This is the second time that Loews has been able to use its balance sheet to help Boardwalk take advantage of a great opportunity, the first being the purchase of HP Storage, which is another recent acquisition for Boardwalk. Loews is ready to help with future transactions that we think will add value to Boardwalk and to Loews.
At HighMount E&P, low natural gas prices continued to impact the company's results. Given the difficult pricing environment, HighMount is currently directing its drilling efforts to locations that should result in higher oil production. These areas include the Mississippian line in Oklahoma and the Wolfcamp strata in Sonora, Texas. Specifically, HighMount has been drilling on the acreage position it acquired last year in the Mississippian line, which is an oil play. HighMount has drilled and completed 12 wells, and initial production rates are comparable to those of other operators in the area. HighMount will continue with this exploratory phase for the next several quarters, and we look forward to sharing additional information about their results as we receive it.
Finally, turning to Loews Hotels & Resorts, we continued to make real progress in our strategy of growing in key urban and resort markets such as the new Loews Hollywood. Additionally, through 2012 and into 2013, Loews will be renovating hotels in 6 key locations. One of these properties will be the Loews Regency in New York, where extensive renovations will begin in early 2013.
Going back to Loews at the holding company level. Loews' investment income increased to $79 million in the third quarter due to improved performance in equity and equity-like investments. This is a $143 million improvement from the $64 million loss that we experienced in the same period in 2011. 
As a final point, and before handing the call over to Pete, while you haven't seen us make a large acquisition at the holding company level recently, Loews and its subsidiaries have not been standing still. From 2010 to 2012, Loews and its subsidiaries have committed to projects in excess of $6 billion. These projects include Diamond's 4 new drillships and 2 rebuild semisubmersibles, Boardwalk's recent acquisitions of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream and HP Storage, CNA's acquisitions of Hardy and the remainder of CNA Surety, HighMount's addition of acreage in the Mississippian line and the expansion and renovation activities within Loews Hotels.
Here at the holding company level, we have been helping to facilitate some of these transactions. In addition, during that same time period, the holding company has spent about $1.2 billion in share repurchases. As always, all of these actions are part of our effort to create value over the long term for all Loews shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Pete Keegan."

Loews Corporation today reported net income of $177 million, or $0.45 per share, for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $162 million, or $0.40 per share, in the third quarter of 2011. As Jim mentioned, net in",842,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $177 million, or $0.45 per share, for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $162 million, or $0.40 per share, in the third quarter of 2011. As Jim mentioned, net income for the quarter includes a noncash ceiling test impairment charge of $166 million after tax at HighMount Exploration & Production as a result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices. Income, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, would have been $343 million as compared to $162 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase is due primarily to higher earnings at CNA Financial and higher holding company investment income due primarily to increased performance of equity and limited partnership investments. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore.
Income, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge for the first 9 months of 2012 is $936 million as compared to $791 million in the 2011 period. The increase is due primarily to the reasons I just mentioned as well as improved earnings from Boardwalk Pipeline, primarily due to the contribution for Boardwalk HP Storage Company, which was acquired in December 2011, as well as the prior year impact of an impairment charge related to steel pipe materials. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the third quarter was a $195 million as compared to $84 million in 2011. CNA's earnings increased due to higher net investment income driven by favorable limited partnership income, improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by decreased favorable net prior year development.
Book value per common share for CNA was $46.99 at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 4% from the end of the second quarter. The increase reflects earnings and improvement in CNA's investment portfolio net unrealized gain position.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the third quarter of 2012 was $83 million compared to $121 million in the prior year quarter. Diamond Offshore's earnings decrease resulted primarily from lower rig utilization and a decrease in average day rate, which was partially offset by lower interest expense. Diamond also had lower rig operating costs this quarter.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the third quarter increased slightly to $20 million from $18 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to storage and transportation revenues earned from HP Storage. In addition, parking and lending revenues increased due to improved market conditions. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in transportation revenue due to lower interruptible service.
At HighMount, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, net income for the quarter would have been $8 million compared to net income of $16 million in the third quarter of 2011. For the 9 months ended September 2012, HighMount recorded noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $336 million after tax. The ceiling test calculation was based on average 12-month prices of $2.83 per MMBTU for natural gas, $46.02 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $94.97 per barrel for oil.
If prices and reserve levels remain unchanged through 2012, it is likely that HighMount will incur noncash after-tax ceiling test impairments ranging from approximately $50 million to $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 amounting to $386 million to $436 million for the full year.
HighMount's third quarter production volumes and realized prices, which include the benefit of hedges, are as follows: natural gas production was 9.5 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.28 per thousand cubic feet, natural gas liquids production was about 590,000 barrels at an average realized price of $37.48 per barrel, and oil production was about 132,000 barrels at an average realized price of $94.71 per barrel. HighMount has hedges in place as of September 30, 2012, to cover approximately 75% of the remaining projected equivalent 2012 production at $5.70 per Mcfe.
Loews Hotels & Resorts recorded a net loss of $1 million as compared to breaking even for the same period in 2011. The decrease is primarily due to increased expenses, including acquisition- and transition-related costs from the Loews Hollywood Hotel. Revenue per available room increased $7.53 to $169.31 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to the 2011 period. Occupancy rates increased to 82% in the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, from 79.8% in the 2011 period. Average room rates increased $3.70, or 1.8%, in the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to the 2011 period.
Holding company cash and investments as of September 30, 2012, totaled $3.8 billion compared to the $3.7 billion held at June 30, 2012.
We received $169 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $24 million in cash to our shareholders during the third quarter of 2012. We also bought back 2.2 million shares of Loews common stock for $88 million. And now I'll turn the call back over to Mary."

Actually, I think gas prices, truth be told, have come back faster than I would have expected. I think that we, as a nation -- first of all, the natural gas picture has changed dramatically over the past 5 years. In the past 5 years, gas has gone from a commodity that was seen to be in shortage, where it traded in '08 at $15 an Mcf, and now it is a commodity that is seen to be in vast abundance. The United States has about, that we know of now, about 100 years' supply of natural gas. As a country, we produce about 65 billion cubic feet per day, and we could increase that production by 50%, in my opinion, with a gas price in the $4 to $4.50 range. So what's needed now for the gas market is just continued demand growth. Demand growth has come over the past several years from the power sector as gas has taken significant market share from coal. But I anticipate in the future that there will be increases in other sectors' demand for gas as well as continued increases in -- from the power sector. I'm also hopeful that over the intermediate term, 3 to 5 years, there will also be significant increases in natural gas coming from the exportation of natural gas. That will -- exporting natural gas will benefit a lot of people. First of all, for every additional 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas that we produce a day, it should increase jobs -- my number is 7,000 to 10,000 jobs per billion cubic feet, permanent jobs. Again, Juergen's [ph] using a number of about 40,000 additional jobs per billion cubic feet. So exploiting gas will improve employment by some significant amount. It will also improve our trade deficit and our current account deficit. So those are all positives. And I believe that this all can be done in an environment where natural gas prices remain under -- remain at about $4.50 per Mcf. It will also be -- one other thing, it also will be very transformative for our economy as we as a nation switch over time, over the next several years, starting with heavy trucks and buses and inner city delivery vehicles from oil and diesel to natural gas. It will be good for the environment. It will be good for our economy. It will bring costs down dramatically. I can see railroads switching from diesel fuel to natural gas. In fact, there are railroads that are already beginning to experiment with that. And when one railroad or one trucker does that, then others will have to follow very quickly because gas trades at such a significant discount to oil. While West Texas Intermediate is about $86 a barrel and international oil, as measured by Brent, is $20 higher, we have natural gas that's trading at under $4 an Mcf, which is the equivalent of less than $25 a barrel. So as I said before, natural gas in the United States in BTUs on the cheap, and the invisible hand of the markets will drive oil consumers to make the switch to natural gas and we will all be better off as a result."

And I hope everybody is staying dry and staying safe.

And I hope everybody is staying dry and staying safe. As you know by now, Loews reported earnings for the quarter of $177 million, or $0.47 -- $0.45 per share, compared to $162 million, or $0.40 per share, that Loews earned in the third quarter of 2011. Results for the third quarter of 2012 include impairment charges of $166 million after tax at HighMount relating to the carrying value of its producing properties. These charges were the result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Absent the ceiling test impairment charges, our quarterly net income would have been $343 million or $0.87 per share.
Loews ended the third quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and investments at the holding company level. In the third quarter, we spent approximately $88 million buying back about 2.2 million shares of Loews' common stock. Our book value per share increased to $50.41 at the end of the third quarter from $47.33 a year -- at year end 2011.
Now let's take a closer look at each of our subsidiaries. CNA had another solid quarter. Results for the quarter were driven primarily by increased investment income, especially from limited partnerships. CNA continues to execute its strategy of focusing on select customer segments. About half of CNA's new business is now coming from these 7 focus segments, including health care and construction, areas where CNA has specialized underwriting capabilities.
Rates continued to improve and increased approximately 6% during the quarter in CNA's P&C operations. In CNA commercial, rates were up 8% for the quarter versus 7% in the second quarter and 2% during the third quarter of 2011. Rate increases, combined with management's underwriting strategies, are leading to improvements in CNA's underwriting results. CNA's loss ratio before catastrophes and prior year development continued to improve during the third quarter. In CNA commercial, for example, this ratio improved by almost 2.5 points versus last year's third quarter. Over the past few years, as management's actions have taken hold, CNA has narrowed the loss ratio gap with peers in its core commercial business.
This is the first quarter CNA has included Hardy Underwriting in its results. Hardy is CNA's recently acquired Lloyd's syndicate and is off to a strong start.
Turning to Diamond Offshore and the offshore drilling market. Diamond had a good quarter, although its net income was down $79 million versus the same period last year. Two main factors drove the profit decline. First, a number of rigs rolled off of record high day rates from contracts that had been signed during the previous subcycle. Second main factor was unplanned downtime, which was slightly above average compared to better-than-average downtime in the prior quarter.
Demand in the drilling market for mid-water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater rigs remained strong, as indicated by recent contracts signed by Diamond and other drillers. Diamond has entered into new contracts or extended existing contracts with attractive day rates and durations. Also during the third quarter, Diamond announced plans to rebuild the Ocean Apex, a Victory-class semisubmersible rig that will be delivered from the shipyard in Singapore in 2014 at an all-in cost of about $300 million. The Ocean Apex is the last of Diamond's Victory-class rebuilds. There are 9 Victory-class hulls in the world and Diamond owns all 9 of them. These Victory-class hulls have extremely long life spans. And since the mid-1990s, Diamond has used each of these hulls as the base upon which to build a new rig, including all new drilling equipment. The end product is the equivalent of a new-build rig. These Victory-class rebuilds, along with Diamond's other new-build rig acquisitions, are just a few examples of the company's strategy for enhancing its fleet at significantly reduced cost, a strategy that has returned tremendous value to Diamond and to Loews.
The Ocean Apex rebuild follows quickly after that of the Ocean Onyx, another Victory-class hull being rebuilt and scheduled for delivery in 2013. Also, as I've previously discussed, Diamond will take delivery of 4 new-build ultra-deepwater drillships in 2013 and 2014.
Now let's turn to Boardwalk. Boardwalk had a good quarter. Net income attributable to Loews was $20 million compared to $18 million for the third quarter last year. Due to the seasonality of the business, the third quarter is typically Boardwalk's weakest of the year. Best distributions due Loews from Boardwalk during the quarter amounted to $72 million. Boardwalk continues to execute its strategy of diversifying its services and geographic footprint in order to generate growth. The company's recent acquisition of PL Midstream, renamed Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, is an example of Boardwalk driving its diversification strategy forward. The acquisition enables Boardwalk to enter the natural gas liquids storage and distribution business with strategically located and well-contracted assets and a strong, experienced management team.
The acquisition in early October of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, together with the organic growth projects, such as the Southeast market expansion and the Eagle Ford expansion projects, once completed, will result in approximately $1.2 billion of new assets for Boardwalk. Loews initially acquired 65% of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream in early October to assist Boardwalk in the acquisition of the company. In mid-October, just 2 weeks after the closing of that acquisition and subsequent to an equity sale by Boardwalk, Boardwalk then purchased from Loews, Loews' 65% stake in Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream. This transaction worked better than planned as the drop-down occurred sooner than anticipated, which ultimately benefited both Boardwalk and Loews shareholders. This is the second time that Loews has been able to use its balance sheet to help Boardwalk take advantage of a great opportunity, the first being the purchase of HP Storage, which is another recent acquisition for Boardwalk. Loews is ready to help with future transactions that we think will add value to Boardwalk and to Loews.
At HighMount E&P, low natural gas prices continued to impact the company's results. Given the difficult pricing environment, HighMount is currently directing its drilling efforts to locations that should result in higher oil production. These areas include the Mississippian line in Oklahoma and the Wolfcamp strata in Sonora, Texas. Specifically, HighMount has been drilling on the acreage position it acquired last year in the Mississippian line, which is an oil play. HighMount has drilled and completed 12 wells, and initial production rates are comparable to those of other operators in the area. HighMount will continue with this exploratory phase for the next several quarters, and we look forward to sharing additional information about their results as we receive it.
Finally, turning to Loews Hotels & Resorts, we continued to make real progress in our strategy of growing in key urban and resort markets such as the new Loews Hollywood. Additionally, through 2012 and into 2013, Loews will be renovating hotels in 6 key locations. One of these properties will be the Loews Regency in New York, where extensive renovations will begin in early 2013.
Going back to Loews at the holding company level. Loews' investment income increased to $79 million in the third quarter due to improved performance in equity and equity-like investments. This is a $143 million improvement from the $64 million loss that we experienced in the same period in 2011. 
As a final point, and before handing the call over to Pete, while you haven't seen us make a large acquisition at the holding company level recently, Loews and its subsidiaries have not been standing still. From 2010 to 2012, Loews and its subsidiaries have committed to projects in excess of $6 billion. These projects include Diamond's 4 new drillships and 2 rebuild semisubmersibles, Boardwalk's recent acquisitions of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream and HP Storage, CNA's acquisitions of Hardy and the remainder of CNA Surety, HighMount's addition of acreage in the Mississippian line and the expansion and renovation activities within Loews Hotels.
Here at the holding company level, we have been helping to facilitate some of these transactions. In addition, during that same time period, the holding company has spent about $1.2 billion in share repurchases. As always, all of these actions are part of our effort to create value over the long term for all Loews shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Pete Keegan."
285930,222709369,373241,"Loews Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2012",2012-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $177 million, or $0.45 per share, for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $162 million, or $0.40 per share, in the third quarter of 2011. As Jim mentioned, net in",842,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Loews Corporation today reported net income of $177 million, or $0.45 per share, for the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $162 million, or $0.40 per share, in the third quarter of 2011. As Jim mentioned, net income for the quarter includes a noncash ceiling test impairment charge of $166 million after tax at HighMount Exploration & Production as a result of declines in natural gas and natural gas liquid prices. Income, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, would have been $343 million as compared to $162 million in the third quarter of 2011. The increase is due primarily to higher earnings at CNA Financial and higher holding company investment income due primarily to increased performance of equity and limited partnership investments. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore.
Income, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge for the first 9 months of 2012 is $936 million as compared to $791 million in the 2011 period. The increase is due primarily to the reasons I just mentioned as well as improved earnings from Boardwalk Pipeline, primarily due to the contribution for Boardwalk HP Storage Company, which was acquired in December 2011, as well as the prior year impact of an impairment charge related to steel pipe materials. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore.
CNA's contribution to Loews' net income for the third quarter was a $195 million as compared to $84 million in 2011. CNA's earnings increased due to higher net investment income driven by favorable limited partnership income, improved current accident year underwriting results and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by decreased favorable net prior year development.
Book value per common share for CNA was $46.99 at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 4% from the end of the second quarter. The increase reflects earnings and improvement in CNA's investment portfolio net unrealized gain position.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the third quarter of 2012 was $83 million compared to $121 million in the prior year quarter. Diamond Offshore's earnings decrease resulted primarily from lower rig utilization and a decrease in average day rate, which was partially offset by lower interest expense. Diamond also had lower rig operating costs this quarter.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the third quarter increased slightly to $20 million from $18 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to storage and transportation revenues earned from HP Storage. In addition, parking and lending revenues increased due to improved market conditions. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in transportation revenue due to lower interruptible service.
At HighMount, excluding the ceiling test impairment charge, net income for the quarter would have been $8 million compared to net income of $16 million in the third quarter of 2011. For the 9 months ended September 2012, HighMount recorded noncash ceiling test impairment charges of $336 million after tax. The ceiling test calculation was based on average 12-month prices of $2.83 per MMBTU for natural gas, $46.02 per barrel for natural gas liquids and $94.97 per barrel for oil.
If prices and reserve levels remain unchanged through 2012, it is likely that HighMount will incur noncash after-tax ceiling test impairments ranging from approximately $50 million to $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 amounting to $386 million to $436 million for the full year.
HighMount's third quarter production volumes and realized prices, which include the benefit of hedges, are as follows: natural gas production was 9.5 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $4.28 per thousand cubic feet, natural gas liquids production was about 590,000 barrels at an average realized price of $37.48 per barrel, and oil production was about 132,000 barrels at an average realized price of $94.71 per barrel. HighMount has hedges in place as of September 30, 2012, to cover approximately 75% of the remaining projected equivalent 2012 production at $5.70 per Mcfe.
Loews Hotels & Resorts recorded a net loss of $1 million as compared to breaking even for the same period in 2011. The decrease is primarily due to increased expenses, including acquisition- and transition-related costs from the Loews Hollywood Hotel. Revenue per available room increased $7.53 to $169.31 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to the 2011 period. Occupancy rates increased to 82% in the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, from 79.8% in the 2011 period. Average room rates increased $3.70, or 1.8%, in the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to the 2011 period.
Holding company cash and investments as of September 30, 2012, totaled $3.8 billion compared to the $3.7 billion held at June 30, 2012.
We received $169 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries and paid $24 million in cash to our shareholders during the third quarter of 2012. We also bought back 2.2 million shares of Loews common stock for $88 million. And now I'll turn the call back over to Mary."

Actually, I think gas prices, truth be told, have come back faster than I would have expected. I think that we, as a nation -- first of all, the natural gas picture has changed dramatically over the past 5 years. In the past 5 years, gas has gone from a commodity that was seen to be in shortage, where it traded in '08 at $15 an Mcf, and now it is a commodity that is seen to be in vast abundance. The United States has about, that we know of now, about 100 years' supply of natural gas. As a country, we produce about 65 billion cubic feet per day, and we could increase that production by 50%, in my opinion, with a gas price in the $4 to $4.50 range. So what's needed now for the gas market is just continued demand growth. Demand growth has come over the past several years from the power sector as gas has taken significant market share from coal. But I anticipate in the future that there will be increases in other sectors' demand for gas as well as continued increases in -- from the power sector. I'm also hopeful that over the intermediate term, 3 to 5 years, there will also be significant increases in natural gas coming from the exportation of natural gas. That will -- exporting natural gas will benefit a lot of people. First of all, for every additional 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas that we produce a day, it should increase jobs -- my number is 7,000 to 10,000 jobs per billion cubic feet, permanent jobs. Again, Juergen's [ph] using a number of about 40,000 additional jobs per billion cubic feet. So exploiting gas will improve employment by some significant amount. It will also improve our trade deficit and our current account deficit. So those are all positives. And I believe that this all can be done in an environment where natural gas prices remain under -- remain at about $4.50 per Mcf. It will also be -- one other thing, it also will be very transformative for our economy as we as a nation switch over time, over the next several years, starting with heavy trucks and buses and inner city delivery vehicles from oil and diesel to natural gas. It will be good for the environment. It will be good for our economy. It will bring costs down dramatically. I can see railroads switching from diesel fuel to natural gas. In fact, there are railroads that are already beginning to experiment with that. And when one railroad or one trucker does that, then others will have to follow very quickly because gas trades at such a significant discount to oil. While West Texas Intermediate is about $86 a barrel and international oil, as measured by Brent, is $20 higher, we have natural gas that's trading at under $4 an Mcf, which is the equivalent of less than $25 a barrel. So as I said before, natural gas in the United States in BTUs on the cheap, and the invisible hand of the markets will drive oil consumers to make the switch to natural gas and we will all be better off as a result."

And if gas prices go higher, I think the amount that we have in the ground will go higher because it will become more economic to produce it. There are 2 ways that we could push the button to restart drilling in Sonora. One is if natural gas prices go up. The other is if we can reduce the cost of drilling for natural gas there. And we are looking very, very carefully at how we can drill wells there to get natural gas production at prices that are lower than -- at costs that are lower than historically we have been able to drill for natural gas. So if we're able to do that, if prices go up a bit, then it's possible that we could restart drilling in Sonora, Texas."

We are -- when I talk about these higher prices, I'm not talking about $7 or $8 an Mcf. It's substantially lower than that, but it's also higher than where we are today."
