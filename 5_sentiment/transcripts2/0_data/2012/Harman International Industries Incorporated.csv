I’m joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker; and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon.
In our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you positive financial results, marking a ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line.
Company wise, we continue to make excellent progress. Our sales increased 18% and our operating income is up 41%. All of our divisions posted higher sales and operating margins, spread by continued higher demand from our automakers, new consumer products, launches and new markets for our professional equipment.
We continue to deliver results in key emerging markets with BRIC country sales increasing by 32%, led by China sales growth of 44%. We are well on our way to meeting the aggressive sales targets. We have set for this sizable BRIC market. We are making further inroads with global and domestic automakers and winning audio contracts for major development and infrastructure projects in BRIC markets.
We told you, we would continue to improve the profitability of our Infotainment division. Well, our Infotainment division sales in the quarter grew by 20% and our operating margin improved to 8.3%. Higher sales were driven by robust demand in the luxury automotive segment and continued strong growth in the BRIC countries led by 35% growth in China. Rapid adoption of the scalable platform is certainly helping us accelerate our margin and reduce our overall cost.
We are also pleased to report that our Lifestyle division sales increased 20% and our operating margin improved to 12.6%. While the world markets continue to manage the effects of the debt crisis in Europe, we continue to gain momentum by executing on our global strategy.
We are investing in our future with the development of connected technologies for the car, the home and on the go. Since, we are first and foremost a technology company, we have cultivated a portfolio of over 4,000 patents and patent spending. Our innovation pipeline has never been more robust.
And at this point, I’d just take a pause to also tell you that today I’m very happy to sit across my colleague Dr. I. P. Park, who had joined the company as our new Chief Technology Officer, and Dr. Park joined us from Samsung Electronics. He had to his credit few dozens of patents, and terrific knowledge of connected space. And he will take over from Sachin Lawande and take us to the next level of innovation.
So coming back to, at CES in Las Vegas, NAM in California, the Detroit Auto Show and the Delhi Auto Show in India, we showcased our latest products and technologies and took home industry awards for innovation, performance and design. These continued investments in innovation positioned us for sustainable profitable growth.
When you have great technology and brands like we have, you got to promote them. We’re investing in our world-class brands with new global campaign for key brands like JBL and Harman Kardon.
To be clear, we launched these to accelerate penetration of our audio systems in the car, at home and on the go, and this strategy is beginning to pay dividends. While we invest in our brands, we remain relentless on our cost and focus. By doing so, we have secured the financial flexibility we need to execute against a number of strategic capital allocation options.
Ladies and gentlemen, we continue to earn your trust and other stakeholders by delivering sound financial returns by investing and bringing new innovation to market and by gaining share from our competitors.
Our hard work to optimize our global footprint has lacked to a sustainable lower cost base. And when you combine with global supply chain management, we have done, it has allowed us to deliver nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in sales and earnings. With our current production footprint in emerging markets, we have the flexibility and a scalability to meet our future growth targets, while maximizing our return on invested capital.
Our performance this quarter speaks for itself. Harman sales and profitability have improved for nine straight quarters and we reported record sales in this quarter ever. Year-to-date, EBITDA is at 10.6%, up from 9.5% last year. Our balance sheet is strong and our liquidity stands at $1.3 billion. Our Infotainment and car audio backlog of awarded business remains the envy of our industry at over $14 billion.
Now comes the interesting part. More than half of this backlog, more than 50% of this $14 billion backlog is now carrying double-digit operating margin, double-digit operating margin and that is really what I wanted to register. That tells you what to expect from Harman in coming years.
We continue to grow faster than the market and we remain dedicated to execute a global strategy to deliver value to our shareholders. Ladies and gentlemen, when you look at the competitive landscape, we believe Harman is the most attractive investment opportunity in our peer group and we are delivering results to support our belief.
I will now ask my colleague, our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, to provide a closer look at our financial results.

Following up on our strong first quarter, I’m pleased to report even better results for the second quarter.

Following up on our strong first quarter, I’m pleased to report even better results for the second quarter. We were able to generate good leverage on our sales growth during the quarter and we continue to make excellent progress mitigating the neodymium cost increases. I will give you more details on the neodymium topic a little latter in my report.
First, let me walk you through a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. As you know, please note that my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring cost. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release, but for your convenience, we took only a $1 million restructuring charge this quarter.
Okay, let’s start with the revenue line for the second quarter. We grew our quarterly revenues by 18% to $1.127 billion, our new quarter record, actually a new record for any quarter that we’ve ever had during this company’s times.
All three of our segments posted a solid increase versus the prior year with Infotainment and Lifestyle divisions both growing at a strong rate of 20%. Our gross margin during the quarter was 27.1%, down 120 basis points primarily as a result of the neodymium cost increases.
I would now take this moment to give you an update on our neodymium costs as I mentioned earlier. I will start first by reiterating the information we shared with you at Analyst Day event in Nashville on October 26 of last year.
At that time, we said the growth exposure was $90 million, but we had identified $55 million of mitigated actions leaving a net exposure for the full year of $35 million. Out of that $35 million, we had already incurred a net impact of $9 million in the first quarter. Leaving a net exposure of $26 million for the remaining three quarters, that is what we said last year October 26.
Now, as of December 31, the growth exposure has declined to $83 million, while mitigated actions have increased to $60 million leaving a net exposure of $18 million for the full-year. And it is important to note that out of this $18 million, we have already incurred a net impact of $11 million year-to-date. So there is a lot of numbers, but the takeaway for you is that we only have $7 million net exposure for the remaining two quarters.
Okay, I’ll move on. But I’d like to first emphasize that this was not an easy task and it took a lot of hard work on the supply management side, customer negotiations, R&D efforts to design it out and we couldn’t be more pleased with what we’ve achieved so far.
Now, moving back to the financial statements. Our SG&A rate for the quarter was very good. The STEP Change program has really helped instill ongoing cost discipline in the organization and we become much more efficient.
Combined with the strong revenue growth, our push for efficiency enabled us to reduce our SG&A expense about 210 basis points down to 18.6%. As you would expect, the result of these activities improved our operating margin quite nicely growing to 8.5% from 7.6% last year.
Now moving on to the net income for the quarter, we reported $60 million, or $0.83 per share compared to net income of $56 million, or $0.79 per share in the prior year’s quarter. Now as many of you would have noticed, our foreign exchange losses were higher than normal during this quarter and this was related to two specific areas.
First, as the business process change in our profession division, we now have one global USD price book. This required a couple of our non-U.S units to change the approximate currency to U.S dollars. This will create more natural hedging but this change required us to revalue our non-U.S. assets at those units and this cause an unreal live loss of some $5 million.
Second, the addition of $2 million is related to four forward points on hedging which is normal increase of our volatility times. Moving to the taxes, our effective tax rate was 27.8% during the quarter, and our tax rate was higher than previous quarters primarily due to significantly improved profits in the U.S.
Moving on to cash, our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $79 million in the quarter bringing our total liquidity position to $1.3 billion, primarily as a result of increased earnings.
Now, following on from this strong cash position we have, let me reaffirm our capital allocation philosophy. We will continue to evaluate alternatives, whether it is an organic growth investment, an acquisition, or share buyback. We remain most interested in investing in organic growth opportunities such as building our footprint in BRIC countries, where long-term returns are the most promising. We believe as we saw with the Selenium acquisition in Brazil and MWM in the United States that strategic acquisitions can create and complement this strategy.
In addition, we remain committed to providing a sustainable dividend stream to our shareholders. And as you will recall, our Board of Directors has pre-authorized of share buyback.
Now let me close by highlighting the fact that this makes our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement at the both top and bottom line. We maintained a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and as a result, we remain positioned to take advantage of a full range of strategic options.
And I finally like to say with two strong quarters behind us and with sufficient visibility to our automotive customers businesses. We are reconfirming our fiscal year 2012 guidance, which we issued to you on October 26 of last year.
And with that said, operator, we are now ready to take your questions.

The Aha, we gone into Aha first in the industry, because we understood the connected car is the way to go. And we have been spearheading that, we’re leading that. One year ago in Geneva, we launched connected car first time based on Aha and everything else. So we continue to lead that. Then your second part was related to smartphone. Look we have been integrating majority of the dominant smartphones in cars already, we have done that. But that’s not the end game. When you integrate the smartphone you’re only integrating 10%, 15% of the capabilities smartphone has, in the car.
You know why? Because you’re not allowed to integrate all feature functionality, because it might interrupt with the car software logic. So the big game is that we have to rewrite most of the car driver related apps and social media. And anything else available in the smart phone in a safe and sound manner, that’s one thing. But then comes the monolithic architecture of the system, which is where we made the change, also that was always a custom development, we said scalable is way to go because we believe technology changing so rapidly, we need to have a modular and a scalable approach.
So our system architecture which is already becoming forefront but continue to be in future years without the powerful drive would be software based. So that your systems would be able to upgrade, download, upload applications, apps and system updates, car, maintenance report, personal information, social media information, all in the car through safe and sound manner through audio.
And we are well on the way by the way. We have hedged on good demonstration in CES and now we are getting ready for first week of March in Geneva to launch few more things. So that’s where we are headed. So there is no change in our strategy, continue to lead in that front.

But then we had little bit of a mixed issue, some of the audio systems are non-branded, which are high volume, but low margin.

So now they’re running about 70%, 75% utilization, and we’re only running two shifts, so we still have a lot of capacity there. We can add another third shift, we can take utilization to 85%, 90%, which is what we normally do. And we still have lot of land in the building, and also built up areas to add few more production line if China production continues - China demand continues to soar. So that’s why I said, we have flexibility to accommodate our future growth in emerging market production. So that’s China.
Then, you asked the capacity utilization overall worldwide. I think worldwide, I’ll have to take an intelligent guess here. I think we are running at this point including our German facilities, American facilities, Hungarian, Mexican, Brazilian and China, I would say we’re about close to 80% utilization right now. And so there’s another - we have capacity there. We can always add shift also third shift, most places we are running two shifts. So plenty of capacity, fixed cost is there, variable cost we can add as the sales comes up.

In fact, we launched couple of products at NAMM show in California where we had similar audio characteristics in our professional audio, but they were not using neo. We are using substitute. So we know how to do it, and it’s also an area where we have some patented technology, and real patented, so we can do it.
As far as the majority of the recovery that’s automotive and professional, both that was a hard work to negotiate the price increases, and we have created an index so that answers the part of the question that what happens if the cost comes down for these things.
So it’s an index, if price remains as they are, then we have a zero some gain, we’ll pass it on to our customers. And if cost goes down, internal cost from our suppliers then we will also reduce accordingly to our customers, so it’s a fair game and they’ve been very fair to us. So the index remains, therefore no impact on us, that’s the idea.

I'm joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker; and our Vice President, Investor Relations",877,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and I thank you for joining the Harman's second quarter fiscal year 2012 investor and analyst call. I'm joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker; and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon. In our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you positive financial results, marking a ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line. Company wise, we continue to make excellent progress. Our sales increased 18% and our operating income is up 41%. All of our divisions posted higher sales and operating margins, spread by continued higher demand from our automakers, new consumer products, launches and new markets for our professional equipment. 
We continue to deliver results in key emerging markets with BRIC country sales increasing by 32%, led by China sales growth of 44%. We are well on our way to meeting the aggressive sales targets we have set for this sizable BRIC market. We are making further inroads with global and domestic automakers and winning audio contracts for major development and infrastructure projects in BRIC markets. We told you, we would continue to improve the profitability of our Infotainment division. Well, our Infotainment division sales in the quarter grew by 20% and our operating margin improved to 8.3%. Higher sales were driven by robust demand in the luxury automotive segment and continued strong growth in the BRIC countries led by 35% growth in China. Rapid adoption of the scalable platform is certainly helping us accelerate our margin and reduce our overall cost. 
We are also pleased to report that our Lifestyle division sales increased 20% and our operating margin improved to 12.6%. While world markets continue to manage the effects of the debt crisis in Europe, we continue to gain momentum by executing on our global strategy. We are investing in our future with the development of connected technologies for the car, the home and on the go. Since, we are first and foremost a technology company, we have cultivated a portfolio of over 4,000 patents and patents pending. Our innovation pipeline has never been more robust. And at this point, I'd just take a pause to also tell you that today I'm very happy to sit across my colleague Dr. I. P. Park, who had joined the company as our new Chief Technology Officer, and Dr. Park joined us from Samsung Electronics. He had to his credit few dozens of patents, and terrific knowledge of connected space. And he will take over from Sachin Lawande and take us to the next level of innovation.
So coming back to, at CES in Las Vegas, NAM in California, the Detroit Auto Show and the Delhi Auto Show in India, we showcased our latest products and technologies and took home industry awards for innovation, performance and design. These continued investments in innovation positioned us for sustainable profitable growth. When you have great technology and brands like we have, you got to promote them. We're investing in our world-class brands with new global campaigns for key brands like JBL and Harman Kardon. To be clear, we launched these to accelerate penetration of our audio systems in the car, at home and on the go, and this strategy is beginning to pay dividends. While we invest in our brands, we remain relentless on our cost and focus. By doing so, we have secured the financial flexibility we need to execute against a number of strategic capital allocation options.
Ladies and gentlemen, we continue to earn your trust and other stakeholders by delivering sound financial returns by investing and bringing new innovation to market and by gaining share from our competitors. Our hard work to optimize our global footprint has lagged to a sustainable lower cost base. And when you combine with global supply chain management, we have done, it has allowed us to deliver 9 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in sales and earnings. With our current production footprint in emerging markets, we have the flexibility and a scalability to meet our future growth targets, while maximizing our return on invested capital. Our performance this quarter speaks for itself. Harman sales and profitability have improved for 9 straight quarters and we reported record sales in this quarter ever. 
Year-to-date, EBITDA is at 10.6%, up from 9.5% last year. Our balance sheet is strong and our liquidity stands at $1.3 billion. Our Infotainment and car audio backlog of awarded business remains the envy of our industry, at over $14 billion. Now comes the interesting part. More than 1/2 of this backlog, more than 50% of this $14 billion backlog is now carrying double-digit operating margin, double-digit operating margin and that is really what I wanted to register. That tells you what to expect from Harman in coming years. We continue to grow faster than the market and we remain dedicated to execute a global strategy to deliver value to our shareholders. 
Ladies and gentlemen, when you look at the competitive landscape, we believe Harman is the most attractive investment opportunity in our peer group and we are delivering results to support our belief. I will now ask my colleague, our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, to provide a closer look at our financial results."

The Aha, we got into Aha first in the industry, because we understood the connected car is the way to go. And we have been spearheading that, we're leading that. One year ago in Geneva, we launched connected car first time based on Aha and everything else. So we continue to lead that. Then your second part was related to smartphone. Look, we have been integrating majority of the dominant smartphones in cars already and we have done that. But that's not the end game. When you integrate the smartphone you're only integrating 10%, 15% of the capabilities smartphone has, in the car. You know why? Because you're not allowed to integrate all feature functionality, because it might interrupt with the car software logic. So the big game is that we have to rewrite most of the car driver related apps and social media. And anything else available in the smart phone in a safe and sound manner, that's one thing. But then comes the monolithic architecture of the system, which is where we made the change also that was always a custom development, we said scalable is way to go because we believe technology changing so rapidly, we need to have a modular and a scalable approach. So our system architecture which is already becoming forefront but continue to be in future years without the powerful drive would be software based. So that your systems would be able to upgrade, download, upload applications, apps and system updates, car, maintenance report, personal information, social media information, all in the car through safe and sound manner through audio. And we are well on the way, by the way. We have hedged on good demonstration in CES and now we are getting ready for first week of March in Geneva to launch a few more things. So that's where we are headed. So there is no change in our strategy, continue to lead in that front."

China factory first, so China factory, in fact 2 factories under one roof in North of China. One, dedicated to our professional audio systems business and other factory is dedicated to our lifestyle car audio business, both are up and running already as of late November. And we're very pleased because we did lot of training. Before even we started the factory, we trained the work force in our Suzhou facility near Shanghai and we then we took those people there. So now they're running about 70%, 75% utilization, and we're only running 2 shifts, so we still have a lot of capacity there. We can add another third shift, we can take utilization to 85%, 90%, which is what we normally do. And we still have lot of land in the building, and also built up areas to add few more production line, if China production continues - China demand continues to soar. So that's why I said, we have flexibility to accommodate our future growth in emerging market production. So that's China. Then, you asked the capacity utilization overall worldwide. I think worldwide, I'll have to take an intelligent guess here. I think we are running at this point, including our German facilities, American facilities, Hungarian, Mexican, Brazilian and China, I would say we're about -- close to 80% utilization right now. And so there's another - we have capacity there. We can always add shift also third shift, most places we are running 2 shifts. So plenty of capacity, fixed cost is there, variable cost we can add as the sales comes up."

In fact, we launched couple of products at NAMM show in California where we had similar audio characteristics in our professional audio, but they were not using neo. We are using substitute. So we know how to do it, and it's also an area where we have some patented technology, and we will patent it, so we can do it. As far as the majority of the recovery that's automotive and professional, both that was a hard work to negotiate the price increases, and we have created an index, so that answers the part of the question that what happens if the cost comes down for these things. So it's an index, if price remains as they are, then we have a 0 some gain, we'll pass it on to our customers. And if cost goes down, our internal cost from our suppliers then we will also reduce accordingly to our customers, so it's a fair game and they've been very fair to us.

I'm joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker; and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon. In our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you positive financial results, marking a ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line. Company wise, we continue to make excellent progress. Our sales increased 18% and our operating income is up 41%. All of our divisions posted higher sales and operating margins, spread by continued higher demand from our automakers, new consumer products, launches and new markets for our professional equipment. 
We continue to deliver results in key emerging markets with BRIC country sales increasing by 32%, led by China sales growth of 44%. We are well on our way to meeting the aggressive sales targets we have set for this sizable BRIC market. We are making further inroads with global and domestic automakers and winning audio contracts for major development and infrastructure projects in BRIC markets. We told you, we would continue to improve the profitability of our Infotainment division. Well, our Infotainment division sales in the quarter grew by 20% and our operating margin improved to 8.3%. Higher sales were driven by robust demand in the luxury automotive segment and continued strong growth in the BRIC countries led by 35% growth in China. Rapid adoption of the scalable platform is certainly helping us accelerate our margin and reduce our overall cost. 
We are also pleased to report that our Lifestyle division sales increased 20% and our operating margin improved to 12.6%. While world markets continue to manage the effects of the debt crisis in Europe, we continue to gain momentum by executing on our global strategy. We are investing in our future with the development of connected technologies for the car, the home and on the go. Since, we are first and foremost a technology company, we have cultivated a portfolio of over 4,000 patents and patents pending. Our innovation pipeline has never been more robust. And at this point, I'd just take a pause to also tell you that today I'm very happy to sit across my colleague Dr. I. P. Park, who had joined the company as our new Chief Technology Officer, and Dr. Park joined us from Samsung Electronics. He had to his credit few dozens of patents, and terrific knowledge of connected space. And he will take over from Sachin Lawande and take us to the next level of innovation.
So coming back to, at CES in Las Vegas, NAM in California, the Detroit Auto Show and the Delhi Auto Show in India, we showcased our latest products and technologies and took home industry awards for innovation, performance and design. These continued investments in innovation positioned us for sustainable profitable growth. When you have great technology and brands like we have, you got to promote them. We're investing in our world-class brands with new global campaigns for key brands like JBL and Harman Kardon. To be clear, we launched these to accelerate penetration of our audio systems in the car, at home and on the go, and this strategy is beginning to pay dividends. While we invest in our brands, we remain relentless on our cost and focus. By doing so, we have secured the financial flexibility we need to execute against a number of strategic capital allocation options.
Ladies and gentlemen, we continue to earn your trust and other stakeholders by delivering sound financial returns by investing and bringing new innovation to market and by gaining share from our competitors. Our hard work to optimize our global footprint has lagged to a sustainable lower cost base. And when you combine with global supply chain management, we have done, it has allowed us to deliver 9 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in sales and earnings. With our current production footprint in emerging markets, we have the flexibility and a scalability to meet our future growth targets, while maximizing our return on invested capital. Our performance this quarter speaks for itself. Harman sales and profitability have improved for 9 straight quarters and we reported record sales in this quarter ever. 
Year-to-date, EBITDA is at 10.6%, up from 9.5% last year. Our balance sheet is strong and our liquidity stands at $1.3 billion. Our Infotainment and car audio backlog of awarded business remains the envy of our industry, at over $14 billion. Now comes the interesting part. More than 1/2 of this backlog, more than 50% of this $14 billion backlog is now carrying double-digit operating margin, double-digit operating margin and that is really what I wanted to register. That tells you what to expect from Harman in coming years. We continue to grow faster than the market and we remain dedicated to execute a global strategy to deliver value to our shareholders. 
Ladies and gentlemen, when you look at the competitive landscape, we believe Harman is the most attractive investment opportunity in our peer group and we are delivering results to support our belief. I will now ask my colleague, our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, to provide a closer look at our financial results."

The Aha, we got into Aha first in the industry, because we understood the connected car is the way to go. And we have been spearheading that, we're leading that. One year ago in Geneva, we launched connected car first time based on Aha and everything else. So we continue to lead that. Then your second part was related to smartphone. Look, we have been integrating majority of the dominant smartphones in cars already and we have done that. But that's not the end game. When you integrate the smartphone you're only integrating 10%, 15% of the capabilities smartphone has, in the car. You know why? Because you're not allowed to integrate all feature functionality, because it might interrupt with the car software logic. So the big game is that we have to rewrite most of the car driver related apps and social media. And anything else available in the smart phone in a safe and sound manner, that's one thing. But then comes the monolithic architecture of the system, which is where we made the change also that was always a custom development, we said scalable is way to go because we believe technology changing so rapidly, we need to have a modular and a scalable approach. So our system architecture which is already becoming forefront but continue to be in future years without the powerful drive would be software based. So that your systems would be able to upgrade, download, upload applications, apps and system updates, car, maintenance report, personal information, social media information, all in the car through safe and sound manner through audio. And we are well on the way, by the way. We have hedged on good demonstration in CES and now we are getting ready for first week of March in Geneva to launch a few more things. So that's where we are headed. So there is no change in our strategy, continue to lead in that front."

China factory first, so China factory, in fact 2 factories under one roof in North of China. One, dedicated to our professional audio systems business and other factory is dedicated to our lifestyle car audio business, both are up and running already as of late November. And we're very pleased because we did lot of training. Before even we started the factory, we trained the work force in our Suzhou facility near Shanghai and we then we took those people there. So now they're running about 70%, 75% utilization, and we're only running 2 shifts, so we still have a lot of capacity there. We can add another third shift, we can take utilization to 85%, 90%, which is what we normally do. And we still have lot of land in the building, and also built up areas to add few more production line, if China production continues - China demand continues to soar. So that's why I said, we have flexibility to accommodate our future growth in emerging market production. So that's China. Then, you asked the capacity utilization overall worldwide. I think worldwide, I'll have to take an intelligent guess here. I think we are running at this point, including our German facilities, American facilities, Hungarian, Mexican, Brazilian and China, I would say we're about -- close to 80% utilization right now. And so there's another - we have capacity there. We can always add shift also third shift, most places we are running 2 shifts. So plenty of capacity, fixed cost is there, variable cost we can add as the sales comes up."

In fact, we launched couple of products at NAMM show in California where we had similar audio characteristics in our professional audio, but they were not using neo. We are using substitute. So we know how to do it, and it's also an area where we have some patented technology, and we will patent it, so we can do it. As far as the majority of the recovery that's automotive and professional, both that was a hard work to negotiate the price increases, and we have created an index, so that answers the part of the question that what happens if the cost comes down for these things. So it's an index, if price remains as they are, then we have a 0 some gain, we'll pass it on to our customers. And if cost goes down, our internal cost from our suppliers then we will also reduce accordingly to our customers, so it's a fair game and they've been very fair to us.

I’m joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon.
I just returned from a 10 day trip to China and just wanted to share with you quickly, I took my entire Harman executive management team to China, as we met the top customers and key government officials. We opened two new manufacturing and engineering plants in Northern China. We opened an engineering center in Beijing, inaugurated second ever flagship store in Beijing, exhibited full suite of technologies at the Beijing Auto Show, and as a result, we also signed major contracts with domestic automakers representing $500 million.
So in our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you encouraging news and solid financial results marking a tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line.
Before I dive into results of this quarter, I want to talk about something very strategic and huge win for our company. I’m extremely pleased to share with you a big news. With the success we’ve had with leading automakers, and our technology leadership, and the knowledge of our innovation pipeline these automakers have, a leading automaker has selected Harman for a follow-on award. And this more than $2 billion award is the largest ever in the industry, and for sure also for Harman ever.
So I’m obviously very, very excited and esthetic, it’s a slam-dunk validation on our innovation pipeline; and also it just validates our strategy that in-dash infotainment systems will continue to drive the progress forward; and it also tells us that the take rates are going up, which are reflected in our year-to-date growth in infotainment.
Now, let us talk about our quarterly results. In the quarter, our sales increased 16%, and are up 19% year-to-date. Our operating income is up 7% for the quarter; and up 36% year-to-date. All our divisions posted higher sales with infotainment division sales growing by 15%; lifestyle by 20%; and professional by 8%.
The luxury car segment reserve has been highly resilient and has outpaced the overall automotive market; and we continue to gain market share. Our successful expansion into the mid-segment with our scalable platform has captured additional growth opportunities. To expand our market, we have invested smartly in high-growth BRIC countries, setting up five new manufacturing and engineering centers with $500 million of new orders recently in India and China, we are well on track to more than double our BRIC sales in next three years, and achieve our $1.5 billion sales target by 2015.
That’s the pace which never been done in any industry, almost from nothing to $1.5 billion in over a span of six years or so. In BRIC country this quarter, sales increased by 28% led by China with sales growth of 30%. If you look at the year-to-date basis, BRIC country sales are up 30%, led by China at 38%, which is more than four times the GDP.
We continue to expand margins in our largest division, infotainment. Our infotainment sales in the quarter grew by 15%, and our operating margin improved to 7.3%. Higher sales were driven by robust demand in the luxury automotive segment, and continued strong growth in BRIC countries. The rapid adoption of the scalable platform is helping us accelerate our margins and reduce our overall cost. We gained the largest ever multi-year order from Geely, which is also the largest Chinese domestic automaker, who also owns Volvo cars from Sweden.
We also picked up BAIC Motors from China, and we replaced a competitor to supply cross carline infotainment systems to Tata Motors in India, that’s the largest Indian automaker who also owns Jaguar Land Rover.
At the Geneva Motor Show we introduced our latest innovations in connectivity technologies, and we were recently awarded Toyota’s most coveted technology and development award, we’re very proud of that.
As I mentioned earlier, we’re pleased to report that our lifestyle division sales increased 20%. Harman’s portfolio of world class brand continues to distinguish Harman from competition. We extended our business with two longstanding customers BMW and Mercedes Benz, with multi-year cross carline branded audio orders. And there are separate press releases put out.
As noted, Harman’s expansion into emerging markets continued with the largest ever branded audio award, in China and India with BAIC, Geely, Great Wall and Tata Motors. These multi-year awards further strengthen the order backlog for branded audio system, which now stands at $3.2 billion; and carries in mid-teens operating margin.
The company unveiled new marketing campaign Hear the truth, featuring Beatles’ Sir Paul McCartney. This complements Harman Kardon, the Beautiful Sound campaign featuring Jennifer Lopez. These campaigns are increasing overall brand awareness and helping drive car audio take rates, and home audio and multimedia sales.
The transition of our professional division from a historically product-focused business to a total solution provider is progressing well. And we are taking share in high growth emerging market. Professional division sales grew by 8%year-over-year; in the environment, where our peer group grew 3%.
We launched a brand new system called IDX, audio visual paging and pedestrian flow system for the airports and hospitals. We have already won projects for hospitals in the United States and at Curacao International Airport.
We are aggressively marketing this new system to multiple airports globally, but particularly in high growth areas like China and India. And we remain the supplier of choice of the world’s biggest sports and entertainment events like Grammy Awards, Oscars, Academy Awards and Super Bowl halftime performance.
Ladies and gentlemen, our relentless focus on innovation and execution has earned us 10 straight quarters of profitable growth. We’re growing in all regions and taking market share. In particular, we’re growing way ahead of the competition in emerging markets. And our hard work to optimize our global foot print and cost base is delivering profitable growth.
We now have the financial flexibility to pursue any number of strategic capital allocation options. So ladies and gentlemen, when you look at the competitive landscape, Harman is the most attractive investment opportunity in our peer group, and we continue to validate that with quarterly results.
Now let me recap key points. We continue to build shareholder value in rapidly rising EBITDA at a CAGR of 280% over ten quarters, half of our 14 billion order backlog now carries double digit profit margin. We are outpacing peer group growth with year-to-date sales up 19%, BRIC sales up 30%, China sales up 38%. We have a global footprint with a world class cost structure. We have invested in sustainable innovation with over 4000 patents are growing. We have a strong balance sheet with liquidity of $1.3 billion, and we are strongly positioned for profitable growth in the future.
So I just say, before I hand it over to my colleague Herbert Parker, well to my investors and analysts; we as a management team have done our job, and we are excited about coming years for what we have in store; and I hope you also see us a stable company which has done a massive turnaround now be positioned for great growth, we’re doing all the right things, and I hope you also hold your position in our company, and show us that you’re also staying long with us.
With that, I’ll ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Parker to provide you a closer look at our financial results.

As you know, please note that my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which exclude restructuring costs. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the press release, but for your convenience we took an $8 million restructuring charge this quarter.
Okay, beginning with the revenue line for the third quarter, we grew our quarterly sales by 16% to $1.96 billion. All three of our segments posted solid growth increases versus the prior year with the infotainment and lifestyle division both growing at double digit rates. Our gross margin during the quarter was 26.8%, down 40 basis points primarily as a result of near premium cost increases.
Now, moving on to the SG&A expenses, excluding the one-time gain of $60 million from the sale of intellectual property last year, our SG&A was reduced by 80 basis points to 20.6%.
Moving on down to the net income for the quarter, we reported $53 million or $0.74 per share compared to net income of $43 million or $0.60 per share in the prior year.
I will note that, our effective tax quality rate was 12.5%, and our year-to-date rate is 22.1%. Now, this excludes the $124 million tax benefit recorded during the quarter related to deferred tax asset allowance release. And in spite of the investments in growth related initiatives, which you heard Dinesh, speak about, our cash and cash equivalents balance was basically unchanged. Also our total liquidity remains at $1.3 billion, our operating cash flow for the quarter remained positive at $12 million despite the increases in net operating working capital.
This increase was primarily due to higher receivables associated with our double-digit revenue growth. As a percentage of sales, our net operating capital was basically flat at 16.6%. We expect a significant portion of the accounts receivables to reconvert into cash during the fourth quarter.
Now, for those of you who are new to our company, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to evaluate alternatives whether it’s an organic growth investment and acquisition or share buyback. We remain most interested in investing in organic growth opportunities such as building our footprint in the BRIC countries, while long-term returns are the most promising. And as demonstrated by Selenium acquisition in Brazil and MWM in the United States, we believe strategic acquisitions can accelerate and complement our capital allocation strategy.
And finally, we remain committed to providing a sustainable dividend stream to our shareholders; and as you recall our Board of Directors has pre-authorized a share buyback program.
Now let me close by highlighting the fact that this makes our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement at both the top and bottom line.
We maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity, and as a result we’re well positioned to take advantage of a full range of strategic options. And with that said operator, we’re now ready to take questions.

Neodymium, we are very happy to report that, we had index in place, which means we’re able to pass on all the cost increases to our customers, but the way that works, it could have worked positively for us, but it does work that we charge the customer at the time of shipping, the spot of the neo and the neo prices have been coming down. So if we bought something at higher price, we are giving actually at a slightly lower price. So it’s a quarter impact maybe another quarter, because you are going to be done with neo by end of this fiscal year.
So that’s probably another $5 million or so to absorb in the fourth quarter. So that explains as Herbert said, 230 in neo, and about 200 basis point in expanding channels, factory ramp up, training of personal, adding dozens of sales folks and little bit of a mixed issue. That’s it, there is nothing unusual. And we’ve also said in our press release, we expect our coming quarters to have favorable margin development.

Another thing you should know about, in the fourth quarter some times a lot of our OEMs will shutdown the last week or so. So that’s the color I can give you on what happen with our seasonality.

This is coming out soon. So indications from the forecast, from that customer are that, this will go at least 10% to 15% higher than the original award was; and that is, it’s going to be lifetime about three years.
After that runs off, the award which we just around $2 billion, that would kick in. And again, there are expectations that in next two to three years, the take rates would definitely be significantly higher than we have today, and also we are driving lot of professional services in our business to create recurring revenue, because we believe that more-and-more to increase the penetration of embedded, which is what OEMs absolutely count on, we have to bring the initial cost of ownership down, and start to build a business case more and more towards professional recurring revenues on services.
So I think, this $2 billion, by the way to begin with, this is more than $2 billion, we didn’t give a specific number, and it’s going to grow.

But to domestic automakers, I think it validates the Tata, BAIC, Geely, they have turned to us with the largest award ever. Then also had two implications: one, we have figured out how to win the jobs in these domestic automakers, compete against the competitor. We did not compete in the past and we still make money, that’s the key. So award we win, they have to be good profitable award otherwise we are not in. So we are aggressively pursuing both in India and China. Brazil not so much, because Brazil doesn’t really have a whole lot of new domestic OEMs, we work with existing guys for VW and Fiat and Chrysler; Ford is another one, which is reasonably represented, we don’t do much business with Ford. So all in all, very aggressively marketing our capabilities. And by the way, emerging market, BRIC countries, will have higher penetration rate to begin with. So they will have a higher scale than even other OECD countries had ever seen. So it makes it particularly more important that we are aggressively pursuing.

The way it’s going, David, it’s not either are, there will be a common play, there will be personal smart devices in the car with limited capability, no matter what we say, because they still cannot do more than two functions at a time, while we do seven or eight or nine functions simultaneously.
Second, automakers absolutely would not like to ship ever a car which costs 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 or 100,000 without a guaranteed performance, which is in the car. So irrespective of what operating what it is, so we’re working closely on both fronts. One, continue to provide automakers what they want, and this was a validation from this leading automaker to put $2 billion order for future. They’ve seen how we will bring latest connectivity in the car, at the same time, they will be working closely with all operating system based phone devices, whether it’s Nokia or Samsung or Motorola or Blackberry or iPhone, we integrate them. So it’s a - what you get, with phone you get some capability and with fully integrated, you get total capability, and both will be there and both will continue to grow. The good thing is, the penetration rate is only 20% or some percent, and car companies tell us that by ’15, they expect 50%, 60% penetration. So there it’s a lot of growth in this sector coming up.

I’m joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon.
I just returned from a 10 day trip to China and just wanted to share with you quickly, I took my entire Harman executive management team to China, as we met the top customers and key government officials. We opened 2 new manufacturing and engineering plants in Northern China. We opened an engineering center in Beijing, inaugurated our second ever flagship store in Beijing, exhibited full suite of technologies at the Beijing Auto Show, and as a result, we also signed major contracts with domestic automakers representing $500 million.
So in our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you encouraging news and solid financial results marking a tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line.
Before I dive into results of this quarter, I want to talk about something very strategic and huge win for our company. I’m extremely pleased to share with you a big news. With the success we’ve had with leading automakers, and our technology leadership, and the knowledge of our innovation pipeline these automakers have, a leading automaker has selected Harman for a follow-on award. And this more than $2 billion award is the largest ever in the industry, and for sure also for Harman ever.
So I’m obviously very, very excited and ecstatic, it’s a slam-dunk validation on our innovation pipeline; and also it just validates our strategy that in-dash infotainment systems will continue to drive the progress forward; and it also tells us that the take rates are going up, which are reflected in our year-to-date growth in infotainment.
Now, let us talk about our quarterly results. In the quarter, our sales increased 16%, and are up 19% year-to-date. Our operating income is up 7% for the quarter; and up 36% year-to-date. All our divisions posted higher sales with infotainment division sales growing by 15%; lifestyle by 20%; and professional by 8%.
The luxury car segment reserve has been highly resilient and has outpaced the overall automotive market; and we continue to gain market share. Our successful expansion into the mid-segment with our scalable platform has captured additional growth opportunities. To expand our market, we have invested smartly in high-growth BRIC countries, setting up 5 new manufacturing and engineering centers with $500 million of new orders recently in India and China, we are well on track to more than double our BRIC sales in next 3 years, and achieve our $1.5 billion sales target by 2015.
That’s the pace which never been done in any industry, almost from nothing to $1.5 billion in over a span of 6 years or so. In BRIC country this quarter, sales increased by 28% led by China with sales growth of 30%. If you look at the year-to-date basis, BRIC country sales are up 30%, led by China at 38%, which is more than 4x the GDP.
We continue to expand margins in our largest division, infotainment. Our infotainment sales in the quarter grew by 15%, and our operating margin improved to 7.3%. Higher sales were driven by robust demand in the luxury automotive segment, and continued strong growth in BRIC countries. The rapid adoption of the scalable platform is helping us accelerate our margins and reduce our overall cost. We gained the largest ever multi-year order from Geely, which is also the largest Chinese domestic automaker, who also owns Volvo cars from Sweden.
We also picked up BAIC Motors from China, and we replaced a competitor to supply cross carline infotainment systems to Tata Motors in India, that’s the largest Indian automaker who also owns Jaguar Land Rover.
At the Geneva Motor Show we introduced our latest innovations in connectivity technologies, and we were recently awarded Toyota’s most coveted technology and development award, we’re very proud of that.
As I mentioned earlier, we’re pleased to report that our lifestyle division sales increased 20%. Harman’s portfolio of world class brands continues to distinguish Harman from competition. We extended our business with two longstanding customers BMW and Mercedes Benz, with multi-year cross carline branded audio orders. And there are separate press releases put out.
As noted, Harman’s expansion into emerging markets continued with the largest ever branded audio award, in China and India with BAIC, Geely, Great Wall and Tata Motors. These multi-year awards further strengthen the order backlog for branded audio system, which now stands at $3.2 billion; and carries in mid-teens operating margin.
The company unveiled new marketing campaign Hear the truth, featuring Beatles’ Sir Paul McCartney. This complements Harman Kardon, the Beautiful Sound campaign featuring Jennifer Lopez. These campaigns are increasing overall brand awareness and helping drive car audio take rates, and home audio and multimedia sales.
The transition of our professional division from a historically product-focused business to a total solution provider is progressing well. And we are taking share in high growth emerging markets. Professional division sales grew by 8%year-over-year; in the environment, where our peer group grew 3%.
We launched a brand new system called IDX, audio visual paging and pedestrian flow system for the airports and hospitals. We have already won projects for hospitals in the United States and at Curacao International Airport.
We are aggressively marketing this new system to multiple airports globally, but particularly in high growth areas like China and India. And we remain the supplier of choice of the world’s biggest sports and entertainment events like Grammy Awards, Oscars, Academy Awards and Super Bowl halftime performance.
Ladies and gentlemen, our relentless focus on innovation and execution has earned us 10 straight quarters of profitable growth. We’re growing in all regions and taking market share. In particular, we’re growing way ahead of the competition in emerging markets. And our hard work to optimize our global foot print and cost base is delivering profitable growth.
We now have the financial flexibility to pursue any number of strategic capital allocation options. So ladies and gentlemen, when you look at the competitive landscape, Harman is the most attractive investment opportunity in our peer group, and we continue to validate that with quarterly results.
Now let me recap key points. We continue to build shareholder value in rapidly rising EBITDA at a CAGR of 280% over ten quarters, half of our 14 billion order backlog now carries double digit profit margin. We are outpacing peer group growth with year-to-date sales up 19%, BRIC sales up 30%, China sales up 38%. We have a global footprint with a world class cost structure. We have invested in sustainable innovation with over 4,000 patents are growing. We have a strong balance sheet with liquidity of $1.3 billion, and we are strongly positioned for profitable growth in the future.
So I just say, before I hand it over to my colleague Herbert Parker, well to my investors and analysts; we as a management team have done our job, and we are excited about coming years for what we have in store; and I hope you also see us a stable company which has done a massive turnaround now be positioned for great growth, we’re doing all the right things, and I hope you also hold your position in our company, and show us that you’re also staying long with us.
With that, I’ll ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Parker to provide you a closer look at our financial results."
29279,199705810,293049,"Harman International Industries Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2012",2012-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. First, let me walk through a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. As usual, please note that my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which exclude restructuring costs. The reconciliation",508,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. First, let me walk through a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. As usual, please note that my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which exclude restructuring costs. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the press release, but for your convenience we took an $8 million restructuring charge this quarter.
Okay, beginning with the revenue line for the third quarter, we grew our quarterly sales by 16% to $1.96 billion. All 3 of our segments posted solid growth increases versus the prior year with the infotainment and lifestyle division both growing at double digit rates. Our gross margin during the quarter was 26.8%, down 40 basis points primarily as a result of near premium cost increases.
Now, moving on to the SG&A expenses, excluding the one-time gain of $60 million from the sale of intellectual property last year, our SG&A was reduced by 80 basis points to 20.6%.
Moving on down to the net income for the quarter, we reported $53 million or $0.74 per share compared to net income of $43 million or $0.60 per share in the prior year.
I will note that, our effective tax quality rate was 12.5%, and our year-to-date rate is 22.1%. Now, this excludes the $124 million tax benefit recorded during the quarter related to deferred tax asset allowance release. And in spite of the investments in growth related initiatives, which you heard Dinesh, speak about, our cash and cash equivalents balance was basically unchanged. Also our total liquidity remains at $1.3 billion, our operating cash flow for the quarter remained positive at $12 million despite the seasonal increases in net operating working capital.
This increase was primarily due to higher receivables associated with our double-digit revenue growth. As a percentage of sales, our net operating capital was basically flat at 16.6%. We expect a significant portion of the accounts receivables to reconvert into cash during the fourth quarter.
Now, for those of you who are new to our company, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to evaluate alternatives whether it’s an organic growth investment and acquisition or share buyback. We remain most interested in investing in organic growth opportunities such as building our footprint in the BRIC countries, while long-term returns are the most promising. And as demonstrated by Selenium acquisition in Brazil and MWM in the United States, we believe strategic acquisitions can accelerate and complement our capital allocation strategy.
And finally, we remain committed to providing a sustainable dividend stream to our shareholders; and as you recall our Board of Directors has pre-authorized a share buyback program.
Now let me close by highlighting the fact that this makes our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement at both the top and bottom line.
We maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity, and as a result we’re well positioned to take advantage of a full range of strategic options. And with that said operator, we’re now ready to take questions."

Neodymium, we are very happy to report that, we had index in place, which means we’re able to pass on all the cost increases to our customers, but the way that index works, it could have worked positively for us, but it does work that we charge the customer at the time of shipping, the spot price of the neo and the neo prices have been coming down. So if we bought something at higher price, we are giving actually at a slightly lower price. So it’s a quarter impact maybe another quarter, because you are going to be done with neo by end of this fiscal year. So that’s probably another $5 million or so to absorb in the fourth quarter. So that explains as Herbert said, 230 in neo, and about 200 basis point in expanding channels, factory ramp up, training of personal, adding dozens of sales folks and little bit of a mixed issue.

We did not compete in the past and we still make money, that’s the key. So award -- we win, they have to be good profitable award otherwise we are not in. So we are aggressively pursuing both in India and China. Brazil not so much, because Brazil doesn’t really have a whole lot of new domestic OEMs, we work with existing guys for VW and Fiat and Chrysler; Ford is another one, which is reasonably represented, we don’t do much business with Ford. So all in all, very aggressively marketing our capabilities. And by the way, emerging market, BRIC countries, will have higher penetration rate to begin with. So they will have a higher scale than even other OECD countries had ever seen. So it makes it particularly more important that we are aggressively pursuing."

And then we are supplying to Volvo now, EFS, this is an electronic engine noise cancellation, which is interesting.

The way it’s going, David, it’s not either are, there will be a common play, there will be personal smart devices in the car with limited capability, no matter what we say, because they still cannot do more than 2 functions at a time, while we do 7 or 8 or 9 functions simultaneously. Second, automakers absolutely would not like to ship ever a car which costs 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 or 100,000 without a guaranteed performance, which is in the car. So irrespective of what operating system -- what it is -- so we’re working closely on both fronts. One, continue to provide automakers what they want, and this was a validation from this leading automaker to put $2 billion order for future. They’ve seen how we will bring latest connectivity in the car, at the same time, they will be working closely with all operating system based phone devices, whether it’s Nokia or Samsung or Motorola or Blackberry or iPhone, we integrate them. So it’s a -- what you get, with phone you get some capability and with fully integrated, you get total capability, and both will be there and both will continue to grow. The good thing is, the penetration rate is only 20% or some percent, and car companies tell us that by ’15, they expect 50%, 60% penetration. So there it’s a lot of growth in this sector coming up."

I’m joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon.
I just returned from a 10 day trip to China and just wanted to share with you quickly, I took my entire Harman executive management team to China, as we met the top customers and key government officials. We opened 2 new manufacturing and engineering plants in Northern China. We opened an engineering center in Beijing, inaugurated our second ever flagship store in Beijing, exhibited full suite of technologies at the Beijing Auto Show, and as a result, we also signed major contracts with domestic automakers representing $500 million.
So in our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you encouraging news and solid financial results marking a tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line.
Before I dive into results of this quarter, I want to talk about something very strategic and huge win for our company. I’m extremely pleased to share with you a big news. With the success we’ve had with leading automakers, and our technology leadership, and the knowledge of our innovation pipeline these automakers have, a leading automaker has selected Harman for a follow-on award. And this more than $2 billion award is the largest ever in the industry, and for sure also for Harman ever.
So I’m obviously very, very excited and ecstatic, it’s a slam-dunk validation on our innovation pipeline; and also it just validates our strategy that in-dash infotainment systems will continue to drive the progress forward; and it also tells us that the take rates are going up, which are reflected in our year-to-date growth in infotainment.
Now, let us talk about our quarterly results. In the quarter, our sales increased 16%, and are up 19% year-to-date. Our operating income is up 7% for the quarter; and up 36% year-to-date. All our divisions posted higher sales with infotainment division sales growing by 15%; lifestyle by 20%; and professional by 8%.
The luxury car segment reserve has been highly resilient and has outpaced the overall automotive market; and we continue to gain market share. Our successful expansion into the mid-segment with our scalable platform has captured additional growth opportunities. To expand our market, we have invested smartly in high-growth BRIC countries, setting up 5 new manufacturing and engineering centers with $500 million of new orders recently in India and China, we are well on track to more than double our BRIC sales in next 3 years, and achieve our $1.5 billion sales target by 2015.
That’s the pace which never been done in any industry, almost from nothing to $1.5 billion in over a span of 6 years or so. In BRIC country this quarter, sales increased by 28% led by China with sales growth of 30%. If you look at the year-to-date basis, BRIC country sales are up 30%, led by China at 38%, which is more than 4x the GDP.
We continue to expand margins in our largest division, infotainment. Our infotainment sales in the quarter grew by 15%, and our operating margin improved to 7.3%. Higher sales were driven by robust demand in the luxury automotive segment, and continued strong growth in BRIC countries. The rapid adoption of the scalable platform is helping us accelerate our margins and reduce our overall cost. We gained the largest ever multi-year order from Geely, which is also the largest Chinese domestic automaker, who also owns Volvo cars from Sweden.
We also picked up BAIC Motors from China, and we replaced a competitor to supply cross carline infotainment systems to Tata Motors in India, that’s the largest Indian automaker who also owns Jaguar Land Rover.
At the Geneva Motor Show we introduced our latest innovations in connectivity technologies, and we were recently awarded Toyota’s most coveted technology and development award, we’re very proud of that.
As I mentioned earlier, we’re pleased to report that our lifestyle division sales increased 20%. Harman’s portfolio of world class brands continues to distinguish Harman from competition. We extended our business with two longstanding customers BMW and Mercedes Benz, with multi-year cross carline branded audio orders. And there are separate press releases put out.
As noted, Harman’s expansion into emerging markets continued with the largest ever branded audio award, in China and India with BAIC, Geely, Great Wall and Tata Motors. These multi-year awards further strengthen the order backlog for branded audio system, which now stands at $3.2 billion; and carries in mid-teens operating margin.
The company unveiled new marketing campaign Hear the truth, featuring Beatles’ Sir Paul McCartney. This complements Harman Kardon, the Beautiful Sound campaign featuring Jennifer Lopez. These campaigns are increasing overall brand awareness and helping drive car audio take rates, and home audio and multimedia sales.
The transition of our professional division from a historically product-focused business to a total solution provider is progressing well. And we are taking share in high growth emerging markets. Professional division sales grew by 8%year-over-year; in the environment, where our peer group grew 3%.
We launched a brand new system called IDX, audio visual paging and pedestrian flow system for the airports and hospitals. We have already won projects for hospitals in the United States and at Curacao International Airport.
We are aggressively marketing this new system to multiple airports globally, but particularly in high growth areas like China and India. And we remain the supplier of choice of the world’s biggest sports and entertainment events like Grammy Awards, Oscars, Academy Awards and Super Bowl halftime performance.
Ladies and gentlemen, our relentless focus on innovation and execution has earned us 10 straight quarters of profitable growth. We’re growing in all regions and taking market share. In particular, we’re growing way ahead of the competition in emerging markets. And our hard work to optimize our global foot print and cost base is delivering profitable growth.
We now have the financial flexibility to pursue any number of strategic capital allocation options. So ladies and gentlemen, when you look at the competitive landscape, Harman is the most attractive investment opportunity in our peer group, and we continue to validate that with quarterly results.
Now let me recap key points. We continue to build shareholder value in rapidly rising EBITDA at a CAGR of 280% over ten quarters, half of our 14 billion order backlog now carries double digit profit margin. We are outpacing peer group growth with year-to-date sales up 19%, BRIC sales up 30%, China sales up 38%. We have a global footprint with a world class cost structure. We have invested in sustainable innovation with over 4,000 patents are growing. We have a strong balance sheet with liquidity of $1.3 billion, and we are strongly positioned for profitable growth in the future.
So I just say, before I hand it over to my colleague Herbert Parker, well to my investors and analysts; we as a management team have done our job, and we are excited about coming years for what we have in store; and I hope you also see us a stable company which has done a massive turnaround now be positioned for great growth, we’re doing all the right things, and I hope you also hold your position in our company, and show us that you’re also staying long with us.
With that, I’ll ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Parker to provide you a closer look at our financial results."
29279,199705810,293536,"Harman International Industries Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2012",2012-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. First, let me walk through a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. As usual, please note that my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which exclude restructuring costs. The reconciliation",508,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. First, let me walk through a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. As usual, please note that my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which exclude restructuring costs. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the press release, but for your convenience we took an $8 million restructuring charge this quarter.
Okay, beginning with the revenue line for the third quarter, we grew our quarterly sales by 16% to $1.96 billion. All 3 of our segments posted solid growth increases versus the prior year with the infotainment and lifestyle division both growing at double digit rates. Our gross margin during the quarter was 26.8%, down 40 basis points primarily as a result of near premium cost increases.
Now, moving on to the SG&A expenses, excluding the one-time gain of $60 million from the sale of intellectual property last year, our SG&A was reduced by 80 basis points to 20.6%.
Moving on down to the net income for the quarter, we reported $53 million or $0.74 per share compared to net income of $43 million or $0.60 per share in the prior year.
I will note that, our effective tax quality rate was 12.5%, and our year-to-date rate is 22.1%. Now, this excludes the $124 million tax benefit recorded during the quarter related to deferred tax asset allowance release. And in spite of the investments in growth related initiatives, which you heard Dinesh, speak about, our cash and cash equivalents balance was basically unchanged. Also our total liquidity remains at $1.3 billion, our operating cash flow for the quarter remained positive at $12 million despite the seasonal increases in net operating working capital.
This increase was primarily due to higher receivables associated with our double-digit revenue growth. As a percentage of sales, our net operating capital was basically flat at 16.6%. We expect a significant portion of the accounts receivables to reconvert into cash during the fourth quarter.
Now, for those of you who are new to our company, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to evaluate alternatives whether it’s an organic growth investment and acquisition or share buyback. We remain most interested in investing in organic growth opportunities such as building our footprint in the BRIC countries, while long-term returns are the most promising. And as demonstrated by Selenium acquisition in Brazil and MWM in the United States, we believe strategic acquisitions can accelerate and complement our capital allocation strategy.
And finally, we remain committed to providing a sustainable dividend stream to our shareholders; and as you recall our Board of Directors has pre-authorized a share buyback program.
Now let me close by highlighting the fact that this makes our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement at both the top and bottom line.
We maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity, and as a result we’re well positioned to take advantage of a full range of strategic options. And with that said operator, we’re now ready to take questions."

Chris, since you do so detail analysis let me tell you the way it’s working. Neodymium, we are very happy to report that, we had index in place, which means we’re able to pass on all the cost increases to our customers, but the way that index works, it could have worked positively for us, but it does work that we charge the customer at the time of shipping, the spot price of the neo and the neo prices have been coming down. So if we bought something at higher price, we are giving actually at a slightly lower price. So it’s a quarter impact maybe another quarter, because you are going to be done with neo by end of this fiscal year. So that’s probably another $5 million or so to absorb in the fourth quarter. So that explains as Herbert said, 230 in neo, and about 200 basis point in expanding channels, factory ramp up, training of personal, adding dozens of sales folks and little bit of a mixed issue. That’s it, there is nothing unusual. And we’ve also said in our press release, we expect our coming quarters to have favorable margin development."

And of course German automakers talking to us and so are Hyundai and others. So give you a ballpark it’s a per car technology license, it is about $60 to $80 per car, so it’s pretty good, it’s a very high margin business. More importantly this differentiates us from others, because others cannot do it, as easily. And then we are supplying to Volvo now, EFS, this is an electronic engine noise cancellation, which is interesting. And when I was in China last week, the Chairman of Geely, Mr. Li Shufu, tells you how these emerging market CEOs are hungry for the latest technology. He asked us that, he won’t like to see that technology in his premier sedan in China, in Geely, so we’re quite excited."

As we look at the moving target, as I’m sure you are aware of the technology on what’s going in vehicles these days. And it seems like we’re really -- 3 different paths we’re on today, one is in embedded system like what you do with BMW today; there is one that’s integrating technology for multiple people, something that you see at a Ford SYNC or at the Toyota In-Tune, and then what we saw at the Consumer Electronics Show, is a lot of technology shown on how the smartphone gets manipulated through the vehicle by voice activation. Your thoughts on where that’s going, where your technology can play into each those 3 paths as consumers want more of this capability inside the vehicle?"

The way it’s going, David, it’s not either are, there will be a common play, there will be personal smart devices in the car with limited capability, no matter what we say, because they still cannot do more than 2 functions at a time, while we do 7 or 8 or 9 functions simultaneously. Second, automakers absolutely would not like to ship ever a car which costs 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 or 100,000 without a guaranteed performance, which is in the car. So irrespective of what operating system -- what it is -- so we’re working closely on both fronts. One, continue to provide automakers what they want, and this was a validation from this leading automaker to put $2 billion order for future. They’ve seen how we will bring latest connectivity in the car, at the same time, they will be working closely with all operating system based phone devices, whether it’s Nokia or Samsung or Motorola or Blackberry or iPhone, we integrate them. So it’s a -- what you get, with phone you get some capability and with fully integrated, you get total capability, and both will be there and both will continue to grow. The good thing is, the penetration rate is only 20% or some percent, and car companies tell us that by ’15, they expect 50%, 60% penetration. So there it’s a lot of growth in this sector coming up."

And on top that, we had a growth engine ramping up quite like nicely in BRIC markets where we have figured out how to get 4x GDP which lot of other companies struggle. So therefore, I just want to leave our investors with big comfort, management team of this company is working hard, we have transformed the company, we had a good cost base in place, global footprint and great backlog with very good margins, and therefore we feel very comfortable, and we feel excited about coming years.

I’m joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon.
I just returned from a 10 day trip to China and just wanted to share with you quickly, I took my entire Harman executive management team to China, as we met the top customers and key government officials. We opened 2 new manufacturing and engineering plants in Northern China. We opened an engineering center in Beijing, inaugurated our second ever flagship store in Beijing, exhibited full suite of technologies at the Beijing Auto Show, and as a result, we also signed major contracts with domestic automakers representing $500 million.
So in our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you encouraging news and solid financial results marking a tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line.
Before I dive into results of this quarter, I want to talk about something very strategic and huge win for our company. I’m extremely pleased to share with you a big news. With the success we’ve had with leading automakers, and our technology leadership, and the knowledge of our innovation pipeline these automakers have, a leading automaker has selected Harman for a follow-on award. And this more than $2 billion award is the largest ever in the industry, and for sure also for Harman ever.
So I’m obviously very, very excited and ecstatic, it’s a slam-dunk validation on our innovation pipeline; and also it just validates our strategy that in-dash infotainment systems will continue to drive the progress forward; and it also tells us that the take rates are going up, which are reflected in our year-to-date growth in infotainment.
Now, let us talk about our quarterly results. In the quarter, our sales increased 16%, and are up 19% year-to-date. Our operating income is up 7% for the quarter; and up 36% year-to-date. All our divisions posted higher sales with infotainment division sales growing by 15%; lifestyle by 20%; and professional by 8%.
The luxury car segment reserve has been highly resilient and has outpaced the overall automotive market; and we continue to gain market share. Our successful expansion into the mid-segment with our scalable platform has captured additional growth opportunities. To expand our market, we have invested smartly in high-growth BRIC countries, setting up 5 new manufacturing and engineering centers with $500 million of new orders recently in India and China, we are well on track to more than double our BRIC sales in next 3 years, and achieve our $1.5 billion sales target by 2015.
That’s the pace which never been done in any industry, almost from nothing to $1.5 billion in over a span of 6 years or so. In BRIC country this quarter, sales increased by 28% led by China with sales growth of 30%. If you look at the year-to-date basis, BRIC country sales are up 30%, led by China at 38%, which is more than 4x the GDP.
We continue to expand margins in our largest division, infotainment. Our infotainment sales in the quarter grew by 15%, and our operating margin improved to 7.3%. Higher sales were driven by robust demand in the luxury automotive segment, and continued strong growth in BRIC countries. The rapid adoption of the scalable platform is helping us accelerate our margins and reduce our overall cost. We gained the largest ever multi-year order from Geely, which is also the largest Chinese domestic automaker, who also owns Volvo cars from Sweden.
We also picked up BAIC Motors from China, and we replaced a competitor to supply cross carline infotainment systems to Tata Motors in India, that’s the largest Indian automaker who also owns Jaguar Land Rover.
At the Geneva Motor Show we introduced our latest innovations in connectivity technologies, and we were recently awarded Toyota’s most coveted technology and development award, we’re very proud of that.
As I mentioned earlier, we’re pleased to report that our lifestyle division sales increased 20%. Harman’s portfolio of world class brands continues to distinguish Harman from competition. We extended our business with two longstanding customers BMW and Mercedes Benz, with multi-year cross carline branded audio orders. And there are separate press releases put out.
As noted, Harman’s expansion into emerging markets continued with the largest ever branded audio award, in China and India with BAIC, Geely, Great Wall and Tata Motors. These multi-year awards further strengthen the order backlog for branded audio system, which now stands at $3.2 billion; and carries in mid-teens operating margin.
The company unveiled new marketing campaign Hear the truth, featuring Beatles’ Sir Paul McCartney. This complements Harman Kardon, the Beautiful Sound campaign featuring Jennifer Lopez. These campaigns are increasing overall brand awareness and helping drive car audio take rates, and home audio and multimedia sales.
The transition of our professional division from a historically product-focused business to a total solution provider is progressing well. And we are taking share in high growth emerging markets. Professional division sales grew by 8%year-over-year; in the environment, where our peer group grew 3%.
We launched a brand new system called IDX, audio visual paging and pedestrian flow system for the airports and hospitals. We have already won projects for hospitals in the United States and at Curacao International Airport.
We are aggressively marketing this new system to multiple airports globally, but particularly in high growth areas like China and India. And we remain the supplier of choice of the world’s biggest sports and entertainment events like Grammy Awards, Oscars, Academy Awards and Super Bowl halftime performance.
Ladies and gentlemen, our relentless focus on innovation and execution has earned us 10 straight quarters of profitable growth. We’re growing in all regions and taking market share. In particular, we’re growing way ahead of the competition in emerging markets. And our hard work to optimize our global foot print and cost base is delivering profitable growth.
We now have the financial flexibility to pursue any number of strategic capital allocation options. So ladies and gentlemen, when you look at the competitive landscape, Harman is the most attractive investment opportunity in our peer group, and we continue to validate that with quarterly results.
Now let me recap key points. We continue to build shareholder value in rapidly rising EBITDA at a CAGR of 280% over ten quarters, half of our 14 billion order backlog now carries double digit profit margin. We are outpacing peer group growth with year-to-date sales up 19%, BRIC sales up 30%, China sales up 38%. We have a global footprint with a world class cost structure. We have invested in sustainable innovation with over 4,000 patents are growing. We have a strong balance sheet with liquidity of $1.3 billion, and we are strongly positioned for profitable growth in the future.
So I just say, before I hand it over to my colleague Herbert Parker, well to my investors and analysts; we as a management team have done our job, and we are excited about coming years for what we have in store; and I hope you also see us a stable company which has done a massive turnaround now be positioned for great growth, we’re doing all the right things, and I hope you also hold your position in our company, and show us that you’re also staying long with us.
With that, I’ll ask our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Parker to provide you a closer look at our financial results."
29279,199705810,294436,"Harman International Industries Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2012",2012-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. First, let me walk through a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. As usual, please note that my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which exclude restructuring costs.

As usual, please note that my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which exclude restructuring costs. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the press release, but for your convenience we took an $8 million restructuring charge this quarter.
Okay, beginning with the revenue line for the third quarter, we grew our quarterly sales by 16% to $1.96 billion. All 3 of our segments posted solid growth increases versus the prior year with the infotainment and lifestyle division both growing at double digit rates. Our gross margin during the quarter was 26.8%, down 40 basis points primarily as a result of near premium cost increases.
Now, moving on to the SG&A expenses, excluding the one-time gain of $60 million from the sale of intellectual property last year, our SG&A was reduced by 80 basis points to 20.6%.
Moving on down to the net income for the quarter, we reported $53 million or $0.74 per share compared to net income of $43 million or $0.60 per share in the prior year.
I will note that, our effective tax quality rate was 12.5%, and our year-to-date rate is 22.1%. Now, this excludes the $124 million tax benefit recorded during the quarter related to deferred tax asset allowance release. And in spite of the investments in growth related initiatives, which you heard Dinesh, speak about, our cash and cash equivalents balance was basically unchanged. Also our total liquidity remains at $1.3 billion, our operating cash flow for the quarter remained positive at $12 million despite the seasonal increases in net operating working capital.
This increase was primarily due to higher receivables associated with our double-digit revenue growth. As a percentage of sales, our net operating capital was basically flat at 16.6%. We expect a significant portion of the accounts receivables to reconvert into cash during the fourth quarter.
Now, for those of you who are new to our company, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to evaluate alternatives whether it’s an organic growth investment and acquisition or share buyback. We remain most interested in investing in organic growth opportunities such as building our footprint in the BRIC countries, while long-term returns are the most promising. And as demonstrated by Selenium acquisition in Brazil and MWM in the United States, we believe strategic acquisitions can accelerate and complement our capital allocation strategy.
And finally, we remain committed to providing a sustainable dividend stream to our shareholders; and as you recall our Board of Directors has pre-authorized a share buyback program.
Now let me close by highlighting the fact that this makes our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement at both the top and bottom line.
We maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity, and as a result we’re well positioned to take advantage of a full range of strategic options. And with that said operator, we’re now ready to take questions."

Chris, since you do so detail analysis let me tell you the way it’s working. Neodymium, we are very happy to report that, we had index in place, which means we’re able to pass on all the cost increases to our customers, but the way that index works, it could have worked positively for us, but it does work that we charge the customer at the time of shipping, the spot price of the neo and the neo prices have been coming down. So if we bought something at higher price, we are giving actually at a slightly lower price. So it’s a quarter impact maybe another quarter, because you are going to be done with neo by end of this fiscal year. So that’s probably another $5 million or so to absorb in the fourth quarter. So that explains as Herbert said, 230 in neo, and about 200 basis point in expanding channels, factory ramp up, training of personal, adding dozens of sales folks and little bit of a mixed issue. That’s it, there is nothing unusual. And we’ve also said in our press release, we expect our coming quarters to have favorable margin development."

The good thing is, the penetration rate is only 20% or some percent, and car companies tell us that by ’15, they expect 50%, 60% penetration. So there it’s a lot of growth in this sector coming up."

We do appreciate the time you’ve taken today to learn more about Harman, and our achievements. Let me tell you that, Harman is a clearly a secular growth story. We’re gaining some market share because of innovation, and very rich patent pipeline. We are gaining from attach rate, our penetration rate going up, we’re gaining from our pro audio, professional audio because a lot of infrastructure were going go, that’s why we are able to grow 8%, 9%, which sector is growing only 3%, 4%. And on top that, we had a growth engine ramping up quite like nicely in BRIC markets where we have figured out how to get 4x GDP which lot of other companies struggle. So therefore, I just want to leave our investors with big comfort, management team of this company is working hard, we have transformed the company, we had a good cost base in place, global footprint and great backlog with very good margins, and therefore we feel very comfortable, and we feel excited about coming years.
With that, I say, thank you very much, and have a terrific afternoon."

I’m joined in Stamford, Connecticut today by our Chief Financial Officer Herbert Parker and our Vice President of Invest",1646,"Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining the Harman fourth quarter and full-year 2012 investor and analyst call. I’m joined in Stamford, Connecticut today by our Chief Financial Officer Herbert Parker and our Vice President of Investor Relations Robert Lardon. 
We had an outstanding  year, and I’m pleased to report solid progress with sales up 16% and operating income up 47% for the fiscal year, with a nice increase of 41% in earnings per share for the year. 
I’m extremely proud to report that we continue to innovate and invest in technology. We added some 600 new patents and patents filings this past year, and our invention portfolio has grown to 4,400, almost doubled in the last five years. Our strong pipeline of new products in our [inaudible 2:27] branch and expansion of our channels globally position us for healthy secular growth. 
We are on the forefront of developing connected car technologies, with a focus on active driver safety. As you know, we successfully collaborate and integrate technologies from Google, Apple, Microsoft and other partners. Actually as a very good example, just a couple days ago, Chrysler put out a press release, and let me talk about it. Harman just launched a latest infotainment system to Chrysler, it is called Uconnect. This will for the first time connect to a cellular network in the United States without an on-board smartphone. Just think of how many percent of Americans carry smartphone in the car, not too many. This is first in the industry that it is phone [inaudible]. The new technology will debut in the 2013 model Ram 1500 pickup truck and 2013 SRT Viper. This Harman technology will allow consumers to use voice command with a touch button on the steering wheel, to do Bing-powered internet searches, read and write text messages and enter navigation destinations without multiple prompts. Vehicles equipped with this Harman technology will also be able to serve as a mobile hotspot. Chrysler’s infotainment chief, actually, Mario Zenios, called it “one-stop shop and connectivity, online apps and smartphone integration.” 
So moving along, car companies have done very extensive research on consumer needs and technology solutions available. Embedded infotainment ranks very high on each automaker’s priority list, principally due to safety requirements and the need for full integration with the car’s sensors and other subsystems in the car. Research validates that embedded infotainment system penetration will continue to grow rapidly, and it will be complemented by smartphones. I remind everybody that only 20% of the cars currently have embedded infotainment systems, and this is likely to go up to 50% within the next five years. In addition, basic telematics and basic connectivity will also grow in the car via smartphone integration. And it’s likely to go from less than 5% today to some 30% in five years. So, these trends really put Harman right in the sweet spot of a big growth opportunity, given our leadership in automotive embedded infotainment system, design and smartphone integration capability. 
I also want to remind you that Harman has led the smartphone integration and we will provide the service to car companies just like what we did with Chrysler this past week, just like what we are doing with BMW this fall. With or without an embedded system in the car, our record car intake for embedded infotainment system and the recent awards from leading automakers confirm our strategy and business model. 
On that note, we are pleased to have scored several key events during fiscal year 2012. We extended our relationship with BMW through a 2 billion+ order that we shared with you on the last call. And earlier in the year, we booked a 400 million [inaudible] award for Porsche-Volkswagen group. 
To meet the growing demand for entry-level embedded infotainment systems, Harman launched a new scalable infotainment platform targeting entry and mixed segment vehicles. It didn’t take much. We had immediate success with this launch and we penetrated Asian automotive companies and one scalable next generation system orders from Tata Motors of India, China’s BRIC, [inaudible] and several others. 
Today we are pleased to share with you a new [inaudible] major breakthrough award. We have received a significant new order from the world’s largest automaker, General Motors. This $900 million order will provide General Motors with a new, advanced, scalable infotainment technology. [inaudible] success in Europe, Asia and now North America with Chrysler, General Motors, thoroughly enforce our leadership in these technology areas. It is important to emphasize that our sales by final destination are very diversified, as shown on slide eight of your deck. 
The EU5 represents only 30% of the company’s sales; 74% of that 30% is in robust German market. Therefore, our exposure to European uncertainty is hardly any. We have got nothing to do with Greece and several other slumping economies, so long Germany continues to do well. 
Our strong sales base in BRIC markets has also reduced our dependence on mature Western economies. Our global marketing campaign featuring celebrity ambassadors such as Paul McCartney, Maroon 5, Jennifer Lopez, Liu Huan, A.R. Rahman and Tim McGraw, is delivering increased brand awareness and improved automotive take rates in all our key markets globally. 
Our emerging market growth during fiscal year 2012 has been outstanding. Amidst the infotainment and branded audio wins noted earlier, we have continued the expansion of our resources in high growth markets. In China, we opened Harman’s largest new manufacturing facility in Dandong, established a brand new engineering center in a city called [inaudible] and inaugurated our second Chinese flagship store in Beijing. We continue to add resources at our multiple development facilities in India, China, United States and Germany. 
We are strengthening our presence in Russia and our operations in Brazil as we pursue opportunities like 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Rio Olympics, to just build on what we did successfully at London Olympics with our professional audio systems. In addition, we recognize the need to remain vigilant against uncertain global economic conditions. Fortunately, the luxury market, car market in particular, continues to show resilience and new automotive customers like GM will strengthen Harman’s access to the world’s top three [inaudible] markets. 
We will continue to pursue growth in both established and emerging markets, positioning Harman as a diverse global player. Our strategic efforts over the last five years have now transformed Harman to a secular and balanced growth company. Our aggressive innovation focus will remain a critical element of this growth. As a prime example, Harman’s scalable system approach has reduced our development costs and dramatically shortened our time to market. Earlier this week, we announced we will acquire Interchain Solutions, a Bangalor, India-based infotainment and telematics company, with expertise in Google and Droid-based open system solutions. Together with our technology portfolio and talented engineers, we are well-equipped to compete on  the [inaudible]. We have built a globally competitive new Harman by taking out 450 million in prominent costs, while redirecting our capital investment by realigning our sourcing for cost and currency and by rebalancing our workforce to best-cost countries, with 50% of our workforce now located in fast-growing, emerging markets. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I have told you earlier that Harman’s strategy is to build an organization that can compete profitably in any economic cycle, and we are well-positioned now. We have worked hard to build a strong balance sheet that facilitates all of these pursuits, and in the last quarter we took advantage of market opportunity to repurchase our stock and announced the doubling of our dividend from $.30 to $.60. I am very proud of Harman’s management team, and thousands of employees worldwide who have embraced this culture of continuous improvement and performance culture. And we are committed to furthering this trend. 
Before I ask my colleague Herbert Parker to take you through our key financial data, let me share a few highlights of fiscal year 2012. We outpaced the market, with sales up 16%, BRIC markets grossed 31%, lagged by China at 42%, which obviously gave us a 41% increase in earnings per share. We posted our 11th consecutive quarter of improvement in both top and bottom line, with our EBITDA growing at a compound aggregate growth rate of 245% during this period. We have continued to book major, multi-year awards with leading automakers in Europe and Asia, while landing a new significant order from GM. We booked a record high $5.2 billion in automotive orders during fiscal 2012, and our automotive backlog now stands at a record high 16.1 billion, and now comes the real good news. This backlog of $16 billion now carried double-digit profit margin. This is the sure thing, which investors like to hear, that what the stream of revenue will look like in coming years. None of us could say that four years ago, five years ago, two years ago, but we worked on replenishing the bad business with good business, while running off the platforms which was generating low-margin business. That took a lot of discipline, a lot of courage, but we have built that culture now. We have more than doubled our patent portfolio in the last five years, and our new product pipeline has never been so rich and relevant. Our balance sheet is healthy, positioning Harman to readily meet its obligations and to search out strategic opportunity for growth. 
With that, ladies and gentlemen, it’s been another exciting year at Harman. Our team is energized to carry this performance into fiscal year ’13, and we look forward to the continued support of our customers, employees and shareholders, who are cementing Harman’s position as the go-to global technology leader in audio infotainment. 
Thank you for your attention, and I will now ask Chief Financial Officer Herbert Parker to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full-year results.

29279,214739422,343232,"Harman International Industries Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2012",2012-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid year of operational and financial improvements, and I’d like to review just a few of our highlights. As always, most of our financial comments are provided on a non-G",803,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid year of operational and financial improvements, and I’d like to review just a few of our highlights. As always, most of our financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which basically excludes restructuring costs and other nonrecurring items. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release, but for your convenience, we took a $9.4 million charge in restructuring [inaudible] this fiscal year. 
Okay, starting with the topline. We increased our annual revenues by 16% to $4.4 billion, and if you exclude the impact of foreign currency, we grew at a rate of 17%. We are pleased to have produced strong, double-digit growth in both infotainment and lifestyle divisions, combined with the delivery of double-digit EBITDA percentages in all three operational divisions. I’d also like to point out that since fiscal 2009, our total automotive backlog has grown from 10.9 billion to 16.1 billion to-date, and this is an all-time record for Harman. 
As shown in slide six of our slide deck released today, this backlog growth is not only related to our existing business, but we have also grown our backlog of new business and new customers from 2.7 billion to 4.5 billion in the same time period. 
Okay, speaking of our gross margin, it expanded by 90 basis points during the year, despite the headwinds we faced in the lifestyle and professional divisions from the neodymian commodity cost increases. The increase in margin percentage was driven by economies of scale on our fixed costs, coupled with our continued benefits from our ongoing global footprint initiative, and our relentless focus on cost efficiency. We also continued to improve in our control over costs. Our full-year SG&A expense declined by 60 basis points to 20.1% of sales, compared to the prior fiscal year, even though we were simultaneously increasing our investments in global brand awareness. These improvements translate into 150 basis points increase in operating income, representing an other annual increase of nearly $100 million. 
Net income for the year was $211 million, and our earnings per share were $2.93, compared to $2.08 per share in fiscal year 2011, this is a 41% increase. Our effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 21.9%. 
Now, regarding the status of our balance sheet items, we reduced our year-end net operating capital as a percentage of annualized sales by 120 basis points to 11.6%. This was primarily driven by DSO and DPO improvements, which was also a key contributor to our ability to generate $260 million of cash from operating activities. As such, our immediate access to available cash, or total liquidity, now stands at 1.4 billion as of the end of this fiscal year, and this gives us sufficient capital to cover our future operating, financing and investing requirements. 
Now for the benefit of any new investors, let me state our capital allocation philosophy. We follow the same type of disciplined approach for deploying our capital to the highest and best use as we do with the allocation of operational resources required to drive improvements into our P&L. Each alternative, whether it be an organic growth investment, acquisition or buyback, is indexed against each other and against the value that a stock buyback program provides as a key hurdle. Having said that, it is our belief and experience that long-term sustainable shareholder value is best created through investing in organic growth opportunities such as building our footprint in the BRIC  countries, combined with accretive acquisitions that either add complementary technical capabilities or provide distribution access to emerging markets. We’ve also determined that the delivery of a growing sustainable dividend stream is an appropriate method to returning value to our shareholders. 
All right, let me now just address a few guidance-related topics. As you know, we did issue guidance today. Since October, 2011, as you know, most global automakers’ production forecasts have come down. However, Harman’s market share gains, favorable customer mix, are helping to offset these headwinds. We have updated our fiscal (2013) guidance for the foreign currency changes only, and we also have updated for the share count, so I’d like to emphasize and point out again that on a constant currency basis for local currencies, we are maintaining our previous guidance provided in October, 2011. 
Finally, I’d like to also note that we have now assumed a tax rate in the range of 26 to 28% for fiscal year 2013. In conclusion, financially we’ve become increasingly strong. Our profitability continues to improve. We have a strong balance sheet to achieve our growth plans. Most importantly, we’ve brought a great deal of cost discipline into the company and that is now part of our culture. 
Operator, we are now ready to take your questions.

So, having said that, rather than tweaking the guidance for one division here and there, we just left it. We wanted to come out, we’re not changing our guidance, we’re leaving it as it is. Actually midpoint of the guidance, you know, tells you where we’ll be, and we are going to definitely have an improvement.  So, we already landed at 7.6% this year, the guidance it starts with 7 and goes to 8.2 if you the quick math, (inaudible) operating income. So, clearly we have a possibility to come out in the top half of the guidance, and hopefully even beat. But a lot of things are still uncertain.

You know, what’s the sales process look like at this point in time?  In other words, I would imagine that as competitive as things have gotten in certain sectors, and as much pressure as there are in people like a Fiat and Ford in Europe and so forth that what you guys have to offer them would be much more valuable going forward from a competitive point of view and from a cost point of view than when things are booming, for example, and they can sell whatever they make.

First of all, the culture in this company is all about pricing and premium pricing.  So GM business is a win-win.  GM gets technology, the latest cutting edge and we get what we deserve for what we’re paying.  And then you mentioned the impact in Europe, the economy, what happens to Fiat, Chrysler and some of the European automakers, you know, that’s why we do track OEMs in three different categories.  
One, we say all OEMs do globally, they are going to grow about 4 or 4.5%.  Then we look at [inaudible] OEMs, including Chrysler, Fiat, Hyundai, Tata, German automakers, they’re going to go about 2%.  Then we look at [inaudible] OEMs, pure luxury, Porsche, Audi, BMW, Tata.  They’re going to grow 0.3%.  So if you put it all together and do the weighted average, find out, we’re going to be growing three times the growth of the car companies, which means we’ll be taking market share and why can I say with such confidence?  Because we have production releases out in our hands already for the next six months and we’re quite pleased.  
And on top of that ,if I may, we’re seeing clearly all of these global players, they may see some slowdown in their mature markets, but they continue to see growth in India, China, Brazil, Russia.  In India, they’re starting from almost near zero, they’re growing 40, 50% a year.  And China would grow also from 15 to 20% a year.  So this is very healthy for us.  And since we are on the market, we’re on the ground, we have R&D, engineering, manufacturing, So I just want to make a quite point for the benefit of all listeners, that we’ve arrived where a good company should be.  Let me serve your customers close to where they are.  So we’re serving Chinese customers whether they are German automakers in China or Asian customers, we’re serving them from China.  
We’re serving German automakers from Germany, American automakers from Mexico and the United States.  So logistic costs and also proximity saves us money and improves the quality  And you get [inaudible] from that from automakers.  The days are gone when Japanese pushed their technology and everything was coming from Japan.  It’s still does, by the way, for some of our competitors, but we’re actually not going to allow you to be on top of the technology.  
One more thing I’ll point is we opened the last couple years with wonderful R&D lab in Palo Alto.  That’s expensive, but it’s very necessary to keep in touch with technology, which is happening in connected space.  We’re opening up another open source R&D in Ann Arbor and Chicago area to really be on the leading side and [inaudible] open-source systems.

I’m joined in Stamford, Connecticut today by our Chief Financial Officer Herbert Parker and our Vice President of Invest",1651,"Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining the Harman fourth quarter and full-year 2012 investor and analyst call. I’m joined in Stamford, Connecticut today by our Chief Financial Officer Herbert Parker and our Vice President of Investor Relations Robert Lardon.
We had an outstanding  year, and I’m pleased to report solid progress with sales up 16% and operating income up 47% for the fiscal year, with a nice increase of 41% in earnings per share for the year.
I’m extremely proud to report that we continue to innovate and invest in technology. We added some 600 new patents and patents filings this past year, and our invention portfolio has grown to 4,400, almost doubled in the last 5 years. Our strong pipeline of new products in our luxury branch and expansion of our channels globally position us for healthy secular growth.
We are on the forefront of developing connected car technologies, with a focus on active driver safety. As you know, we successfully collaborate and integrate technologies from Google, Apple, Microsoft and other partners. Actually as a very good example, just a couple days ago, Chrysler put out a press release, and let me talk about it. Harman just launched a latest infotainment system to Chrysler, it is called Uconnect. This will for the first time connect to a cellular network in the United States without an on-board smartphone. Just think of how many percent of Americans carry smartphone in the car, not too many. This is first in the industry that it is phone or network agnostic. The new technology will debut in the 2013 model Ram 1500 pickup truck and 2013 SRT Viper. This Harman technology will allow consumers to use voice command with a touch button command on the steering wheel, to do Bing-powered internet searches, read and write text messages and enter navigation destinations without multiple prompts. Vehicles equipped with this Harman technology will also be able to serve as a mobile hotspot. Chrysler’s infotainment chief, actually, Mario Zenios, called it “one-stop shop and connectivity, online apps and smartphone integration.”
So moving along, car companies have done very extensive research on consumer needs and technology solutions available. Embedded infotainment ranks very high on each automaker’s priority list, principally due to safety requirements and the need for full integration with the car’s sensors and other subsystems in the car. Research validates that embedded infotainment system penetration will continue to grow rapidly, and it will be complemented by smartphones. I remind everybody that only 20% of the cars currently have embedded infotainment systems, and this is likely to go up to 50% with the next 5 years. In addition, basic telematics and basic connectivity will also grow in the car via smartphone integration. And it’s likely to go from less than 5% today to some 30% in 5 years. So, these trends really put Harman right in the sweet spot of a big growth opportunity, given our leadership in automotive embedded infotainment system, design and smartphone integration capability.
I also want to remind you that Harman has led the smartphone integration and we will provide the service to car companies just like what we did with Chrysler this past week, just like what we are doing with BMW this fall. With or without an embedded system in the car, our record order intake for embedded infotainment system and the recent awards from leading automakers confirm our strategy and business model.
On that note, we are pleased to have scored several key events during fiscal year 2012. We extended our relationship with BMW through a $2 billion-plus order that we shared with you on the last call. And earlier in the year, we booked a $400 million add-on award for Porsche-Volkswagen group.
To meet the growing demand for entry-level embedded infotainment systems, Harman launched a new scalable infotainment platform targeting entry and mixed segment vehicles. It didn’t take much. We had immediate success with this launch and we penetrated Asian automotive companies and one scalable next generation system orders from Tata Motors of India, China’s BIC, [inaudible] and several others.
Today we are pleased to share with you a news update, major breakthrough award. We have received a significant new order from the world’s largest automaker, General Motors. This $900 million order will provide General Motors with a new, advanced, scalable infotainment technology. Our latest success in Europe, Asia and now North America with Chrysler, General Motors, thoroughly enforce our leadership in these technology areas. It is important to emphasize that our sales by final destination are very diversified, as shown on slide eight of your deck.
The EU5 represents only 30% of the company’s sales; 74% of that 30% is in robust German market. Therefore, our exposure to European uncertainty is hardly any. We have got nothing to do with Greece and several other slumping economies, so long Germany continues to do well.
Our strong sales base in BRIC markets has also reduced our dependence on mature Western economies. Our global marketing campaign featuring celebrity ambassadors such as Sir Paul McCartney, Maroon 5, Jennifer Lopez, Liu Huan, A.R. Rahman and Tim McGraw, is delivering increased brand awareness and improved automotive take rates in all our key markets globally.
Our emerging market growth during fiscal year 2012 has been outstanding. Amidst the infotainment and branded audio wins noted earlier, we have continued the expansion of our resources in high growth markets. In China, we opened Harman’s largest new manufacturing facility in Dandong, established a brand new engineering center in a city called [inaudible] and inaugurated our second Chinese flagship store in Beijing. We continue to add resources at our multiple development facilities in India, China, United States and Germany.
We are strengthening our presence in Russia and our operations in Brazil as we pursue opportunities like 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Rio Olympics, to just build on what we did successfully at London Olympics with our professional audio systems. In addition, we recognize the need to remain vigilant against uncertain global economic conditions. Fortunately, the luxury market, car market in particular, continues to show resilience and new automotive customers like GM will strengthen Harman’s access to the world’s top 3 [inaudible] markets.
We will continue to pursue growth in both established and emerging markets, positioning Harman as a diverse global player. Our strategic efforts over the last five years have now transformed Harman to a secular and balanced growth company. Our aggressive innovation focus will remain a critical element of this growth. As a prime example, Harman’s scalable system approach has reduced our development costs and dramatically shortened our time to market. Earlier this week, we announced we will acquire Interchain Solutions, a Bangalor, India-based infotainment and telematics company, with expertise in Google and Droid-based open system solutions. Together with our technology portfolio and talented engineers, we are well-equipped to compete on the global stage. We have built a globally competitive new Harman by taking out $450 million in prominent costs, by redirecting our capital investment by realigning our sourcing for cost and currency and by rebalancing our workforce to best-cost countries, with 50% of our workforce now located in fast-growing, emerging markets.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have told you earlier that Harman’s strategy is to build an organization that can compete profitably in any economic cycle, and we are well-positioned now. We have worked hard to build a strong balance sheet that facilitates all of these pursuits, and in the last quarter we took advantage of market opportunity to repurchase our stock and announced the doubling of our dividend from $.30 to $.60. I am very proud of Harman’s management team, and thousands of employees worldwide who have embraced this culture of continuous improvement and performance culture. And we are committed to furthering this trend.
Before I ask my colleague Herbert Parker to take you through our key financial data, let me share a few highlights of fiscal year 2012. We outpaced the market, with sales up 16%, BRIC markets grossed 31%, lagged by China at 42%, which obviously gave us a 41% increase in earnings per share. We posted our 11th consecutive quarter of improvement in both top and bottom line, with our EBITDA growing at a compound aggregate growth rate of 245% during this period. We have continued to book major, multi-year awards with leading automakers in Europe and Asia, while landing a new significant order from GM. We booked a record high $5.2 billion in automotive orders during fiscal 2012, and our automotive backlog now stands at a record high $16.1 billion, and now comes the real good news. This backlog of $16 billion now carried double-digit profit margin. This is the sure thing, which investors like to hear, that what the stream of revenue will look like in coming years. None of us could say that 4 years ago, 5 years ago, 2 years ago, but we worked on replenishing the bad business with good business, while running off the platforms which was generating low-margin business. That took a lot of discipline, a lot of courage, but we have built that culture now. We have more than doubled our patent portfolio in the last five years, and our new product pipeline has never been so rich and relevant. Our balance sheet is healthy, positioning Harman to readily meet its obligations and to search out strategic opportunity for growth.
With that, ladies and gentlemen, it’s been another exciting year at Harman. Our team is energized to carry this performance into fiscal year ’13, and we look forward to the continued support of our customers, employees and shareholders, who are cementing Harman’s position as the go-to global technology leader in audio infotainment.
Thank you for your attention, and I will now ask Chief Financial Officer Herbert Parker to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full-year results."
29279,214739422,343626,"Harman International Industries Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2012",2012-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid year of operational and financial improvements, and I’d like to review just a few of our highlights. As always, most of our financial comments are provided on a non-G",806,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid year of operational and financial improvements, and I’d like to review just a few of our highlights. As always, most of our financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which basically excludes restructuring costs and other nonrecurring items. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release, but for your convenience, we took a $9.4 million charge in restructuring spend this fiscal year.
Okay, starting with the topline. We increased our annual revenues by 16% to $4.4 billion, and if you exclude the impact of foreign currency, we grew at a rate of 17%. We are pleased to have produced strong, double-digit growth in both the infotainment and lifestyle divisions, combined with the delivery of double-digit EBITDA percentages in all 3 operational divisions. I’d also like to point out that since fiscal 2009, our total automotive backlog has grown from $10.9 billion to $16.1 billion to-date, and this is an all-time record for Harman.
As shown in slide 6 of our slide deck released today, this backlog growth is not only related to our existing business, but we have also grown our backlog of new business and new customers from $2.7 billion to $4.5 billion in the same time period.
Okay, speaking of our gross margin, it expanded by 90 basis points during the year, despite the headwinds we faced in the lifestyle and professional divisions from the neodymian commodity cost increases. The increase in margin percentage was driven by economies of scale on our fixed costs, coupled with our continued benefits from our ongoing global footprint initiative, and our relentless focus on cost efficiency. We also continued to improve in our control over costs. Our full-year SG&A expense declined by 60 basis points to 20.1% of sales, compared to the prior fiscal year, even though we were simultaneously increasing our investments in global brand awareness. These improvements translate into 150 basis points increase in operating income, representing an other annual increase of nearly $100 million.
Net income for the year was $211 million, and our earnings per share were $2.93, compared to $2.08 per share in fiscal year 2011, this is a 41% increase. Our effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 21.9%.
Now, regarding the status of our balance sheet items, we reduced our year-end net operating capital as a percentage of annualized sales by 120 basis points to 11.6%. This was primarily driven by DSO and DPO improvements, which was also a key contributor to our ability to generate $260 million of cash from operating activities. As such, our immediate access to available cash, or total liquidity, now stands at S1.4 billion as of the end of this fiscal year, and this gives us sufficient capital to cover our future operating, financing and investing requirements.
Now for the benefit of any new investors, let me state our capital allocation philosophy. We follow the same type of disciplined approach for deploying our capital to the highest and best use as we do with the allocation of operational resources required to drive improvements into our P&L. Each alternative, whether it be an organic growth investment, acquisition or buyback, is indexed against each other and against the value that a stock buyback program provides as a key hurdle. Having said that, it is our belief and experience that long-term sustainable shareholder value is best created through investing in organic growth opportunities such as building our footprint in the BRIC countries, combined with accretive acquisitions that either add complementary technical capabilities or provide distribution access to emerging markets. We’ve also determined that the delivery of a growing sustainable dividend stream is an appropriate method to returning value to our shareholders.
All right, let me now just address a few guidance-related topics. As you know, we did issue guidance today. Since October, 2011, as you know, most global automakers’ production forecasts have come down. However, Harman’s market share gains, favorable customer mix, are helping to offset these headwinds. We have updated our fiscal 2011 [sic] [2013] guidance for the foreign currency changes only, and we also have updated for the share count, so I’d like to emphasize and point out again that on a constant currency basis for local currencies, we are maintaining our previous guidance provided in October, 2011.
Finally, I’d like to also note that we have now assumed a tax rate in the range of 26 to 28% for fiscal year 2013. In conclusion, financially we’ve become increasingly strong. Our profitability continues to improve. We have a strong balance sheet to achieve our growth plans. Most importantly, we’ve brought a great deal of cost discipline into the company and that is now part of our culture.
Operator, we are now ready to take your questions."

So, we’ve made a turnaround, and we are double digits growth. So all in all very good year for Lifestyle.

And if you look at our range of guidance for 2012, for Infotainment it was $160 million to $175 million operating profit, and we landed at $182 million. So, we did beat it nicely. So, having said that, rather than tweaking the guidance for one division here and there, we just left it. We wanted to come out, we’re not changing our guidance, we’re leaving it as it is. Actually midpoint of the guidance, you know, tells you where we’ll be, and we are going to definitely have an improvement.  So, we already landed 7.6% this year, the guidance it starts with 7 and goes to 8.2 if you the quick math, for revenue and operating income. So, clearly we have a possibility to come out in the top half of the guidance, and hopefully even beat. But a lot of things are still uncertain. And the last item Ryan, which is important, also Chris’s point and other colleagues, that some of the programs are rolling off in ’13, and our high margin programs would be early in the ramp-up phase that’s why revenue is ’13 slightly  breathing sort of exercise, ’14, ’15 we hit up on the high gear again.

But Lifestyle literally exceeded everything in car-audio. As I have said in my earlier calls, emerging market consumers when they’re buying cars happens to be the first time in their family if not first time in their village, first time in the city. And they want to have some things in it which they can appreciate and audio is one of those. So take rates in emerging markets will continue to go up and that’s why building brand is very important. So you will see that. And Infotainment -- so let’s stick with Lifestyle first, Lifestyle had good healthy, more than 50% growth, which is phenomenal, that’s coming from consumer products, and car-audio. Then of course Infotainment we had also good 30%, 35% growth and Professional had in 20s. So we’re building a lot of airports and some of the revenues would be booked perhaps in other year. So I expect all 3 divisions to hit 30-plus-percent growth or even higher in 2013. Moving on to China -- I mean India and Brazil or Russia. Brazil we have an opportunity because we have not even begun our operation in infotainment. We only do pro-audio and part of car-audio so opportunities are immense. I expect ’13, ’14 to take us to the next level. India with good growth but with the $200-plus- million order from Tata motors and that will commissioned, engineered and shipped out of India, I think we’ll start to see good development not in ’13, but ’14 will be [indiscernible] year for India. But ’13 should be a good year for Lifestyle and for pro-audio anyway. And Russia, I think we had a good development we don’t do anything in infotainment in Russia, and we do a little bit of pro-audio, little bit of Lifestyle and that to mainly consumer. But Russia is on our radar screen for ’13 and ’14. So we as a management, first focused on China, then focused on Brazil then India and Russia and now all 4 will be on sort of top gear."

In the past, all the calls, we spend 99% of the time on Infotainment, which I’m glad that because we have turned the corner.  You guys seem to be pleased with the way we’re doing. So let’s come back to Lifestyle and Professional.  You are absolutely spot on that Lifestyle and Pro had been neodymium.  And that is gone away.  We will not talk about neodymium even if the price is still high and we have dissolved that and we took care of that business. Second, Professional launched 140 brand new products earlier in the year, especially in the main bread and butter area of storage sound and [indiscernible] sound in the loud speaker area and that business is just taken off.  So I expect really to be beating our last year’s sales topline growth rate definitely in Pro.  I expect that.  And Lifestyle has done a very good job dealing with all this neodymium issue and ramping up correctional facility Mexico and [inaudible].  Both of these divisions, and that’s totally behind us so that should be falling off the bottom line for the margin expansion. At the same time, I’m getting ready in 2 weeks’ time to go to Berlin, we’ll have the world’s largest home multimedia show where we’ll launch the 25 brand new products.  That’s the highest I’ve ever seen.  No more than 5 products every year and this is 25 products.  So I think we expect quite a good topline at the same time you know we’re very disciplined when it comes to pricing and pricing premium.  So we’re holding on quite well, so I expect both of these divisions to grow topline with new products, to grow topline from the new markets and Pro and Lifestyle both will also benefit from North America, all the slow pickup, but nice pickup.

And we are done with it in terms of never mentioning that, even if it is a bit of a headwind, we will find ways to accomplish it.  Mostly we have passed it on to our customers so it’s in their pricing and that’s, if neodymium goes down to where it used to be 1 year ago, then our customers will get a break, if not, it’s there.  At the same time, we have also had pretty advanced development in material sciences to find substitute to replace neo with better acoustics capabilities and we are doing that in design changes.  So I think between those, neodymium is quite under control. And in terms of capacity, margin expansion for neo hat would drop straight bottom line, you should count on that.  And then it comes to capacity in Mexico and China, there we’re going to be ramping -- we’re ramped up already, but all the products for China factory will be running at 80% production capacity.  That will help us fast expanding Asian market in China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, they are really booming and so I expect topline to be much stronger than 2012.

First of all, the culture in this company is all about pricing and premium pricing.  So GM business is a win-win.  GM gets superb technology, the latest cutting edge and we get what we deserve for what we bring..  And then you mentioned the impact in Europe, the economy, what happens to Fiat, Chrysler and some of the European automakers, you know, that’s why we do track OEMs into 3 different categories. One, we say all OEMs do globally, they are going to grow about 4%, 4.5%.  Then we look at Harman OEMs, including Chrysler, Fiat, Hyundai, Tata, [indiscernible] German automakers, they’re going to go about 2%.  Then we look at Harman OEMs, pure luxury, Porsche, Audi, BMW, Tata.  They’re going to grow 0.3%.  So if you put it all together and do the weighted average, find out, we’re going to be growing 3 times the growth of the car companies, which means we’ll be taking market share and why can I say with such confidence?  Because we have production releases out in our hands already for the next 6 months and we’re quite pleased. And on top of that ,if I may, we’re seeing clearly all of these global players, they may see some slowdown in their mature markets, but they continue to see growth in India, China, Brazil, Russia.  In India, they’re starting from almost near 0, they’re growing 40%, 50% a year, Infotainment growth, car-audio growth.  And China would grow also from 15% to 20% a year.  So this is very healthy for us.  And since we are on the market, we’re on the ground, we have R&D, engineering, manufacturing, so I just want to make a quite point for the benefit of all listeners, that we’ve arrived where a good company should be. That means serve your customers close to where they are.  So we’re serving Chinese customers whether they are German automakers in China or Asian customers, we’re serving them from China. We’re serving German automakers from Germany from Hungary, American automakers from Mexico and the United States.  So logistic costs and also proximity saves us money and improves the quality. And you get premium from that from automakers.  The days are gone when Japanese pushed their technology and everything was coming from Japan.  It’s still does, by the way, for some of our competitors, but that’s really not going to allow you to be on top of the technology. One more thing I’ll point here, we opened last couple years with wonderful R&D lab in Palo Alto.  That’s expensive, but it’s very necessary to keep in touch with technology, which is happening in connected space.  We’re opening up another open source R&D, I mentioned in Ann Arbor and Chicago area to really be on the leading side and Android open-source systems. There’s a lot happening all towards the future.  We’re not about 1 quarter or 1 year maximization of profit or -- in fact the continuous improvement is coming because we took some very drastic steps 3 years ago, 2 years ago. So we will never deter to do that.  So all in all we feel good about it for 2013 in spite of some uncertainty. One could say am I cautiously optimistic? I think I’m more towards optimistic, but if you use the word cautiously that’s fine."

So we continue to be 3 of us, 2 Japanese and 1 American, Harman. So between 3 of us we split roughly 1/3, 1/3 of their infotainment business and that’s sort of continuing. And there is a follow on award will be coming in the next 3 to 6 months which we are also bidding. So until then hold the horses for what it will look like next year. But on the audio side we also have a decent business. We did mention in our press release as well as slide deck that Harmon’s business with Mercedes has been extended on some of the models, that’s always very nice. And in terms of business I think since it’s not 10% of our sales we don’t put out in the 10K but it’s a healthy business.  It’s still our third or fourth largest business after BMW and VW group. Fiat Chrysler is now becoming third largest and Diamler is our fourth largest."

Beyond that what goes in the car has 50 to 100 live sensors in an advanced car and you’ve got 5, 6 sub systems in the car and we are the primary provider. We have a backbone, a software backbone. We write some 3 million to 3.5 million lines of code. So a lot of interaction with the live sensors, live information while cars are on the road. And we are able to manipulate that data and use that to determine the best route calculation. The best eco route if you’re on a green car. So a lot of those things would not be possible for smartphone’s ever because they would not have that access. And why so? Car companies are nervous, for good reasons, to allow more basic integration technology with smartphones, because smartphones carry hundreds of applications which will written by kids anywhere from age 13 to 17 years, especially in the case of Google. Any they really don’t know much about car and how this will interact with the safety of the car, a lot of other engine safety, breaking systems. So this is where the system competence and car eco-system knowledge comes into play. Therefore I’ve always said David, that going forward, both smart integration of the telephone and embedded system will co-exist. Because the starting points are fairly low and we will lead, both  will continue to integrate Google phone, Nokia phone, Microsoft, Blackberry and other phones will come in the market. Example is good. Look at Chrysler which we just launched last week. This will be agnostic to any phone, see if you just had an iPhone what good it is if somebody walks in the car with an Android phone then you are out of luck. So we will provide technology which will allow integration of any phone for basic level of turn-by-turn, point of interest, traffic advisory. So that’s the biggest advantage, and I think car companies get it. That’s why you can see in the last 6 to 12 months the kind of flurry of large awards we have received from BMW, GM and many others."

I’m joined in Stamford, Connecticut today by our Chief Financial Officer Herbert Parker and our Vice President of Investor Relations Robert Lardon.
We had an outstanding year, and I’m pleased to report solid progress with sales up 16% and operating income up 47% for the fiscal year, with a nice increase of 41% in earnings per share for the year.
I’m extremely proud to report that we continue to innovate and invest in technology. We added some 600 new patents and patents filings this past year, and our invention portfolio has grown to 4,400, almost doubled in last 5 years. Our strong pipeline of new products in our luxury branch and the expansion of our channels globally position us for healthy secular growth.
We are on the forefront of developing connected car technologies, with a focus on active driver safety. As you know, we successfully collaborate and integrate technologies from Google, Apple, Microsoft and other partners. Actually as a very good example, just couple days ago, Chrysler put out a press release, and let me talk about it. Harman just launched a latest infotainment system to Chrysler, it is called Uconnect. This will for the first time connect to a cellular network in the United States without an on-board smartphone. Just think of how many percent of Americans carry smartphone in the car, not too many. This is first in the industry that it is phone or network agnostic. The new technology will debut in the 2013 model Ram 1500 pickup truck and 2013 SRT Viper. This Harman technology will allow consumers to use voice command with a touch button command on the steering wheel, to do Bing-powered internet searches, read and write text messages and enter navigation destinations without multiple prompts. Vehicles equipped with this Harman technology will also be able to serve as a mobile hotspot. Chrysler’s infotainment chief, actually, Mario Zenios, called it “one-stop shop in connectivity, online apps and smartphone integration.”
So moving along, car companies have done very extensive research on consumer needs and technology solutions available. Embedded infotainment ranks very high on each automaker’s priority list, principally due to safety requirements and the need for full integration with the car’s sensors and other subsystems in the car. Research validates that embedded infotainment system penetration will continue to grow rapidly, and it will be complemented by smartphones. I remind everybody that only 20% of the cars currently have embedded infotainment system, and this is likely to go up to 50% with the next 5 years. In addition, basic telematics and basic connectivity will also grow in the car via smartphone integration. And it’s likely to go from less than 5% today to some 30% in 5 years. So these trends really put Harman right in the sweet spot of a big growth opportunity, given our leadership in automotive embedded infotainment system, design and a smartphone integration capability.
I also want to remind you that Harman has led smartphone integration and we will provide the service to car companies just like what we did with Chrysler this past week, just like what we are doing with BMW this fall. With or without an embedded system in the car, our record order intake for embedded infotainment system and the recent awards from leading automakers confirm our strategy and business model.
On that note, we are pleased to have scored several key wins during fiscal year 2012. We extended our relationship with BMW through a $2 billion-plus order that we shared with you on the last call. And earlier in the year, we booked a $400 million add-on award for Porsche-Volkswagen group.
To meet the growing demand for entry-level embedded infotainment systems, Harman launched a new scalable infotainment platform targeting entry and mixed segment vehicles. Not -- it didn’t take much. We had immediate success with this launch and we penetrated Asian automotive companies and one scalable next generation system orders from Tata Motors of India, China’s BIC, Changan, Geely brands and several others.
Today we are pleased to share with you a news update, major breakthrough award. We have received a significant new order from the world’s largest automaker, General Motors. This $900 million order will provide General Motors with a new, advanced, scalable infotainment technology. Our latest success in Europe, Asia and now North America with Chrysler, General Motors, further reinforce our leadership in these technology areas. It is important to emphasize that our sales by final destination are very diversified, as shown on Slide 8 of your deck.
The EU5 represents only 30% of the company’s sales; 74% of that 30% is in robust German market. Therefore, our exposure to European uncertainty is hardly any, because we have got nothing to do with Greece and several other slumping economies, so long Germany continues to do well.
Our strong sales base in BRIC markets has also reduced our dependence on mature Western economies. Our global marketing campaign featuring celebrity ambassadors such as Sir Paul McCartney, Maroon 5, Jennifer Lopez, Liu Huan, A.R. Rahman and Tim McGraw, is delivering increased brand awareness and improved automotive take rates in all our key markets globally.
Our emerging market growth during fiscal year 2012 has been outstanding. Amidst the infotainment and branded audio wins noted earlier, we have continued the expansion of our resources in high growth markets. In China, we opened Harman’s largest new manufacturing facility in Dandong, established a brand new engineering center in a city called Chengdu and inaugurated our second Chinese flagship store in Beijing. We continue to add resources at our multiple development facilities in India, China, United States and Germany.
We are strengthening our presence in Russia and our operations in Brazil as we pursue opportunities like 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Rio Olympics, to just build on what we did successfully at London Olympics with our professional audio systems. In addition, we recognize the need to remain vigilant against uncertain global economic conditions. Fortunately, the luxury market, car market in particular, continues to show resilience and new automotive customers like GM will strengthen Harman’s access to the world’s top 3 vehicle markets.
We will continue to pursue growth in both established and emerging markets, positioning Harman as a diverse global player. Our strategic efforts over the last 5 years have now transformed Harman to a secular and balanced growth company. Our aggressive innovation focus will remain a critical element of this growth. As a prime example, Harman’s scalable system approach has reduced our development cost and dramatically shortened our time to market. Earlier this week, we announced we will acquire Interchain Solutions, a Bangalor, India-based infotainment and telematics company, with expertise in Google and Droid-based open system solutions. Together with our technology portfolio and talented engineers, we are well-equipped to compete on the global stage. We have built a globally competitive new Harman by taking out $450 million in permanent cost, by redirecting our capital investment, by realigning our sourcing for cost and currency and by rebalancing our workforce to best-cost countries, with 50% of our workforce now located in fast-growing, emerging markets.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have told you earlier that Harman’s strategy is to build an organization that can compete profitably in any economic cycle, and we are well-positioned now. We have worked hard to build a strong balance sheet that facilitates all of these pursuits, and in the last quarter we took advantage of market opportunity to repurchase our stock and announced the doubling of our dividend from $0.30 to $0.60. I am very proud of Harman’s management team, and thousands of employees worldwide who have embraced this culture of continuous improvement and performance culture. And we are committed to furthering this trend.
Before I ask my colleague Herbert Parker to take you through our key financial data, let me share a few highlights of fiscal year 2012. We outpaced the market, with sales up 16%, BRIC markets growth 31%, lagged by China at 42%, which obviously gave us a 41% increase in earnings per share. We posted our 11th consecutive quarter of improvement in both top and bottom line, with our EBITDA growing at a compound aggregate growth rate of 245% during this period. We have continued to book major, multi-year awards with leading automakers in Europe and Asia, while landing a new significant order from GM. We booked a record high $5.2 billion in automotive orders during fiscal 2012, and our automotive backlog now stands at a record high $16.1 billion, and now comes the real good news. This backlog of $16 billion now carried double-digit profit margin. This is the sure thing, which investors like to hear, that what the stream of revenue will look like in coming years. None of us could say that 4 years ago, 5 years ago, 2 years ago, but we worked on replenishing the bad business with good business, while running off the platforms which were generating low-margin business. That took lot of discipline, lot of courage, but we have built that culture now. We have more than doubled our patent portfolio in the last 5 years, and our new product pipeline has never been so rich and relevant. Our balance sheet is healthy, positioning Harman to readily meet its obligations and to search out strategic opportunity for growth.
With that, ladies and gentlemen, it’s been another exciting year at Harman. Our team is energized to carry this performance into fiscal year ’13, and we look forward to the continued support of our customers, employees and shareholders, who are cementing Harman’s position as the go-to global technology leader in audio infotainment.
Thank you for your attention, and I will now ask Chief Financial Officer Herbert Parker to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full-year results."
29279,214739422,366112,"Harman International Industries Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2012",2012-08-10,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid year of operational and financial improvement, and I’d like to review just a few of our highlights. As always, most of our financial comments are provided on a non-GA",807,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid year of operational and financial improvement, and I’d like to review just a few of our highlights. As always, most of our financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which basically excludes restructuring costs and other nonrecurring items. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release, but for your convenience, we took a $9.4 million charge in restructuring expense this fiscal year.
Okay, starting with the topline. We increased our annual revenues by 16% to $4.4 billion, and if you exclude the impact of foreign currency, we grew at a rate of 17%. We are pleased to have produced strong, double-digit growth in both the infotainment and lifestyle divisions, combined with the delivery of double-digit EBITDA percentages in all 3 operational divisions. I’d also like to point out that since fiscal 2009, our total automotive backlog has grown from $10.9 billion to $16.1 billion to-date, and this is an all-time record for Harman.
As shown in Slide 6 of our slide deck released today, this backlog growth is not only related to our existing business, but we have also grown our backlog of new business and new customers from $2.7 billion to $4.5 billion in the same time period.
Okay, speaking of our gross margin, it expanded by 90 basis points during the year, despite the headwinds we faced in the lifestyle and professional divisions from the neodymian commodity cost increases. The increase in margin percentage was driven by economies of scale on our fixed costs, coupled with our continued benefits from our ongoing global footprint initiative, and our relentless focus on cost efficiency. We also continued to improve in our control over costs. Our full-year SG&A expense declined by 60 basis points to 20.1% of sales, compared to the prior fiscal year, even though we were simultaneously increasing our investments in global brand awareness. These improvements translate into 150 basis points increase in operating income, representing another annual increase of nearly $100 million.
Net income for the year was $211 million, and our earnings per share were $2.93, compared to $2.08 per share in fiscal year 2011, this is a 41% increase. Our effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 21.9%.
Now regarding the status of our balance sheet items, we reduced our year-end net operating capital as a percentage of annualized sales by 120 basis points to 11.6%. This was primarily driven by DSO and DPO improvements, which was also a key contributor to our ability to generate $260 million of cash from operating activities. As such, our immediate access to available cash, or total liquidity, now stands at $1.4 billion as of the end of this fiscal year, and this gives us sufficient capital to cover our future operating, financing and investing requirements.
Now for the benefit of any new investors, let me state our capital allocation philosophy. We follow the same type of disciplined approach for deploying our capital to the highest and best use as we do with the allocation of operational resources required to drive improvements into our P&L. Each alternative, whether it be an organic growth investment, acquisition or buyback, is indexed against each other and against the value that a stock buyback program provides as a key hurdle. Having said that, it is our belief and experience that long-term sustainable shareholder value is best created through investing in organic growth opportunities such as building our footprint in the BRIC countries, combined with accretive acquisitions that either add complementary technical capabilities or provide distribution access to emerging markets. We’ve also determined that the delivery of a growing sustainable dividend stream is an appropriate method to returning value to our shareholders.
All right, let me now just address a few guidance-related topics. As you know, we did issue guidance today. Since October, 2011, as you know, most global automaker production forecasts have come down. However, Harman’s market share gains, favorable customer mix, are helping to offset these headwinds. And we have updated our fiscal 2011 (sic) [2013] guidance for the foreign currency changes only, and we also have updated for the share count, so I’d like to emphasize and point out again that on a constant currency basis on local currencies, we are maintaining our previous guidance provided in October, 2011.
Finally, I’d like to also note that we have now assumed a tax rate in the range of 26 to 28% for fiscal year 2013. In conclusion, financially we’ve become increasingly strong. Our profitability continues to improve. We have a strong balance sheet to achieve our growth plans. Most importantly, we’ve brought a great deal of cost discipline into the company and that is now a part of our culture.

We had a healthy gain of also double digit in Home and Multimedia, and for those of you who have been following Harman long time, our consumer business, now we call it Home and Multimedia under Lifestyle, traditionally has struggled and not made money, but now we are at mid-single digit operating profits, so we made a turnaround, and we are double digits growth. So all in all very good year for Lifestyle. And it also underscores why we made this change when we put consumer and car audio together, we are able to see the branding and marketing dollars really helping us connect consumers, those who are buying home office, on-the-go products and the car audio brands.

First of all we should explain to you that we confirmed the range of our guidance.

First of all we should explain to you that we confirmed the range of our guidance. And if you look at our range of guidance for 2012, for Infotainment it was $160 million to $175 million operating profit, and we landed at $182 million. So we did beat it nicely. So having said that, rather than tweaking the guidance for one division here and there, we just left it. We wanted to come out, we’re not changing our guidance, we’re leaving it as it is. Actually midpoint of the guidance tells you where we’ll be, and we're going to definitely have an improvement.  So we already landed 7.6% this year, the guidance it starts with 7% and goes to 8.2% if you the quick math, for revenue and operating income. So clearly, we have a possibility to come out in the top half of the guidance, and hopefully even beat it. But a lot of things are still uncertain. And the last item, Ryan, which is important, also Chris’s point and other colleagues, that some of the programs are rolling off in ’13, and our high margin programs would be early in the ramp-up phase. That’s why revenue is ’13 slightly breathing sort of exercise, ’14, ’15 we hit it up on the high gear again. And that would be good margin expansion at the same time, good top line because we’ll be ramping a bunch of programs."

But Lifestyle literally exceeded everything in car audio. As I have said in my earlier calls, emerging market consumers when they’re buying cars happen to be the first time in their family if not first time in their village, first time in the city. And they want to have some things in it which they can appreciate and audio is one of those. So take rates in emerging markets will continue to go up and that’s why building brand is very important. So you will see that. And Infotainment -- so let’s stick with Lifestyle first, Lifestyle had good healthy, more than 50% growth, which is phenomenal, that’s coming from consumer products and car audio. And then of course Infotainment we had also good 30%, 35% growth and Professional had in 20s. So we’re building lot of ARPUs and some of the revenues would be booked perhaps in early year. So I expect all 3 divisions to hit 30-plus-percent growth or even higher in 2013. Moving on to China -- I mean India and Brazil or Russia. Brazil we have an opportunity because we have not even begun our operation in infotainment. We only do pro-audio and part of car-audio so opportunities are immense. I expect ’13, ’14 to take us to the next level. India with a good growth but with the $200-plus-million order from Tata motors and that will be commissioned, engineered and shipped out of India, I think we’ll start to see good development not in ’13, but ’14 will be bumper year for India. But ’13 should be a good year for Lifestyle and for pro-audio anyway. And Russia, I think we had a good development. We don’t do anything in infotainment in Russia, and we do a little bit of pro-audio, little bit of Lifestyle and that to mainly consumer. But Russia is on our radar screen for ’13 and ’14. So we as a management, first focused on China, then focused on Brazil then India and Russia and now all 4 will be on sort of top gear."

I mean in the past, all the calls, we spend 99% of the time on Infotainment, which I’m glad that because we have turned the corner.  You guys seem to be pleased with the way we’re doing. So let’s come back to Lifestyle and Professional.  You are absolutely spot on that Lifestyle and Pro had been from neodymium.  And that is gone away.  We will not talk about neodymium even if the prices are still higher, we have resolved that and we took care of that business. Second, Professional launched 140 brand new products earlier in the year, especially in the main bread and butter area of in-store sound and touring sound in the loud speaker area and that business has just taken off.  So I expect really to be beating our last year’s sales topline growth rate definitely in Pro.  I expect that.  And Lifestyle has done a very good job dealing with all this neodymium issue and ramping [indiscernible] facility, Mexico and Dandong.  Both of these divisions, and that’s totally behind us so that should be falling off the bottom line for the margin expansion. At the same time, I’m getting ready in 2 weeks’ time to go to Berlin, we’ll have the world’s largest home multimedia show where we’ll launch the 25 brand new products.  That’s the highest I’ve ever seen.  No more than 5 products every year, so this is 25 products.  So I think we expect quite a good topline at the same time you know we’re very disciplined when it comes to pricing and pricing premium.  So we’re holding on quite well, so I expect both of these divisions to grow topline with new products, to grow topline from the new markets and Pro and Lifestyle both will also benefit from North America, all the slow pickup, but nice pickup.  Both of them are seeing very good inquiry for the quotes."

And we are done with it in terms of never mentioning that, even if it is a bit of a headwind, we will find ways to compensate.  Mostly we have passed it on to our customers so it’s in their pricing index. If neodymium goes down to where it used to be 1 year ago, then our customers will get a break, if not, it’s there.  At the same time, we have also had pretty advanced development in material sciences to find substitute to replace neo with better acoustics capabilities and we are doing that in design changes.  So I think between those, neodymium is quite under control. And in terms of capacity, margin, the margin expansion for new neo, that would drop straight bottom line, you should count on that.  And then when it comes to capacity in Mexico and China, there we’re going to be ramping -- we’re ramped up already, but all the products for China factory will be running at 80% production capacity.  That will help us fast expanding Asian market, China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, they are really booming and so I expect topline for Pro to be much stronger than 2012. And then Lifestyle can come close to what they did last year, I’d be happy.  Last year was an amazing topline, which may be sustainable, we’ll see, but profit expansion is the key."

In other words, I would imagine as competitive as things have gotten in certain sectors, and as much pressure as there are in people like a Fiat and Ford in Europe and so forth that what you guys have to offer them would be much more valuable going forward from a competitive point of view and from a cost point of view than when things are booming, for example, and they can sell whatever they make.

First of all, the culture in this company is all about pricing and premium pricing.  So GM business is a win-win.  GM gets superb technology, the latest cutting edge and we get what we deserve for what we bring.  And then you mentioned the impact in Europe, the economy, what happens to Fiat, Chrysler and some of the European automakers, that’s why we do track OEMs into 3 different categories. One, we say all OEMs globally, they are going to grow about 4%, 4.5%.  Then we look at Harman OEMs, including Chrysler, Fiat, Hyundai, Tata, Geely, German automakers, they’re going to grow about 2%.  Then we look at Harman OEMs, pure luxury, Porsche, Audi, BMW, Tata.  They’re going to grow 0.3%.  So if you put it all together and do the weighted average, find out, we’re going to be growing 3x the growth of the car companies, which means we’ll be taking market share and why can I say with such confidence?  Because we have production releases out in our hands already for the next 6 months and we’re quite pleased. And on top of that ,if I may, we’re seeing clearly all of these global players, they may see some slowdown in their mature markets, but they continue to see growth in India, China, Brazil, Russia.  In India, they’re starting from almost near 0, they’re growing 40%, 50% a year, Infotainment growth, car audio growth.  And China would grow also some 15% to 20% a year.  So this is very healthy for us.  And since we are on the market, we’re on the ground, we have R&D, engineering, manufacturing, so I also want to make a quick point for the benefit of all listeners, that we have arrived where a good company should be. That means serve your customers close to where they are.  So we’re serving Chinese customers whether they are German automakers in China or Asian customers, we’re serving them from China. We’re serving German automakers from Germany from Hungary, American automakers from Mexico and the United States.  So logistic costs and also proximity saves us money and improves the quality. And you get premium for that from automakers.  I mean the days are gone when Japanese pushed their technology and everything was coming from Japan.  It still does, by the way, for some of our competitors, but that’s really not going to allow you to be on top of the technology. One more thing I’ll point here, we opened last couple years a wonderful R&D lab in Palo Alto.  That’s expensive, but it’s very necessary to keep in touch with technology, what's happening in connective space.  And we’re opening up another open source R&D, I mentioned in Ann Arbor and Chicago area to really be on the leading side on Android open-source systems. There’s a lot happening all towards the future.  We’re not about 1 quarter or 1 year maximization of profit, Doug. In fact, the continuous improvement is coming because we took some very drastic steps 3 years ago, 2 years ago. So we will never deter to do that.  So all in all we feel good about it for 2013 in spite of some uncertainty. One could say am I cautiously optimistic? I think I’m more towards optimistic; I'm going to still use the word cautiously, that’s fine."

So we continue to be 3 of us, 2 Japanese and 1 American, Harman. So between 3 of us we split roughly 1/3, 1/3 of their infotainment business and that’s sort of continuing. And there is a follow-on award will be coming in the next 3 to 6 months which we are also bidding. So until then hold the horses that what would it look like next year. But in audio side we also have a decent business. We did mention in our press release as well as slide deck that Harman current business with Mercedes has been extended on some of the models, so that’s always very nice. And in terms of business I think since it’s not 10% of our sales we don’t put out in the 10-K, but it’s a healthy business.  It’s still our third or fourth largest business after BMW and VW group. Fiat Chrysler is now becoming third largest and Daimler is our fourth largest."

Beyond that what goes in the car, as you know, has 50 to 100 live sensors in an advanced car and you’ve got 5, 6 sub-systems in the car and we are the primary provider. We have a backbone, a software backbone. We write some 3 million to 3.5 million lines of code. So a lot of interaction with the live sensors, live information while car is on the road. And we are able to manipulate that data and use that to determine the best route calculation. The best eco route if you’re on a green car. So a lot of those things would not be possible for smartphones ever because they would not have that access. And why so? Car companies are nervous, for good reasons, to allow more than just a basic integration capability with smartphones, because smartphones carry hundreds of applications which were written by kids anywhere from age 13 to 17 years, especially in the case of Google. Any they really don’t know much about car and how this will interact with the safety of the car, a lot of other engine safety, braking system. So this is where the system competence and car eco-system knowledge comes in play. Therefore I’ve always said, David, that going forward, both smart integration of the telephone and embedded system will co-exist. Because the starting points are fairly low and we will lead, both will continue to integrate Google phone, Nokia phone, Microsoft, Blackberry and other phones will come in the market. Example is good. Look at Chrysler, what we just launched last week. This will be agnostic to any phone, see if you just had an iPhone what good it is if someone walks in the car with an Android phone then you are out of luck. So we will provide technology which will allow integration of any phone for basic level of turn-by-turn, point of interest, traffic advisory. So that’s the biggest advantage, and I think car companies get it. That’s why you can see in the last 6 to 12 months the kind of flurry of large awards we have received from BMW, GM and many others."

Before we get underway, please allow me to share our deepest empathy with those of you on the phone today or who were directly or whose friends, families or associates affected by this unprecedented storm. We wish everyone a speedy return to normalcy.
As I mentioned, our new Head of Investor Relations, Sandy Rowland, she brings extensive experience in financial management and analysis to Harman from her prior roles at Kodak and PricewaterhouseCoopers, and she looks forward to meeting you soon. And I’m sure there are lots of opportunities where a few of us will be traveling together to see you and be part of your conferences.
Now Bob Lardon, who is taking a new role as Head of our Luxury Audio unit, is also with us today in this room, and we thank Bob for his dedicated service in Investor Relations over the past four years and for his support ensuring a smooth transition. The good thing would be Bob and Sandy will be in the same building, so there’s a complete good sort of handle while in transition.
As you read earlier today, we delivered another strong quarter with growth in local currency, even against last year’s abnormally strong first quarter and most importantly, in a challenging economic environment, which has changed rather dramatically over the last few months.
Our success continues to be underlined by the launch of several of award-winning new products and with competitive wins in the Car Audio business from BMW, Ford and Volvo. We are proud that our relentless execution and continued cost focus have allowed us to post our twelfth consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. We’re also pleased to see our solid track record recognized by credit rating improvements to investment grade. We are confident that our excellent liquidity profile will enable to continue to utilize a variety of initiatives to deploy capital, invest in growth and generate strong returns for our shareholders.
We also continued our aggressive growth in the emerging markets, with BRIC country sales up 23% in the first quarter. We remain committed to a strategy of growth, intense cost focus, innovation, and speedy execution regardless of the economic cycles ahead.
At this time, I would like to quickly share with you a few highlights that underscore the strength and resiliency of Harman’s growth strategy, including some significant financial events in recent weeks. As you know, Standard & Poor’s raised Harman’s corporate rating to investment grade. Moody’s followed with an investment grade rating just a few weeks later, citing our strong competitive position, revenue growth, and excellent liquidity profile as factors in their decision.
Concurrent with the latest ratings upgrade, we successfully concluded negotiations last month with a group of banks for a new $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility, obviously at much better rates than before. We also secured a five-year $300 million term loan, which we used, along with $100 million of our own cash, to repay $400 million in convertible senior notes held by a series of investors, primarily KKR and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. This transaction concludes any direct financial interest in Harman by these investors.
Each of our three divisions scored significant wins during the first quarter, beginning with infotainment, where Harman continues to be a driving force for innovation. Harman celebrated the market launch of two advanced infotainment systems. The latest BMW infotainment system is debuting on the 7 Series and will roll out to all BMW vehicles worldwide this fall. This system is the most advanced on the market, offering sophisticated features such as three-dimensional navigation and real-time traffic update, office function integration, voice command, intelligence, Internet connectivity, and many more.
In addition, Chrysler’s latest Ram truck and Dodge Viper models went to market featuring the next generation Uconnect infotainment. Uconnect system is designed, engineered and built by Harman, which is getting very positive comments in the marketplace from Chrysler and Fiat.
On Aha Radio technology, it was launched as an integral feature in Honda’s new vehicular connectivity system called HondaLink. That, again, is a good example with a lot of technology we have, outside of regular infotainment or car audio, we’re starting to penetrate customers we never had any business with. Honda is one such customer. We had no business, neither infotainment nor car audio. With our Aha connectivity suite, we have penetrated and it’s been a great starting relationship, which I’m sure with bear fruit for many other business to do.
Similar, HondaLink would be rolled out across all car models in the United States in 2013. These launches are similar to the depth of automotive backlog, an industry-leading backlog of our order business that was built on the success of innovation machine.
To continue this leadership position, in September we announced that Harman will establish a new software engineering center in Chicago. To further expand our global network of infotainment, engineering, and mainly focusing on connectivity and development of such feature functionality, within reach of key customers in Detroit and of course many other European and Japanese customers in that area.
In the Lifestyle Division, Harman extended its global leadership in automotive audio. In our accompanying press release issued this morning, we outlined $800 million in new awards from major OEMs in North America, Europe and Asia. This is the single largest order intake in car audio I have seen, at least in my time here, over five-and-a-half years. And most importantly, I’ll stress this $800 million is in net new business. Every single award is brand new and additive to what we already had, bringing in some new customers which we never did business with.
Let’s start first with extremely prized acquisition that is Ford Motor Company. You have heard me talk about Ford and GM for almost three years. And last quarter, we announced General Motors and this quarter we announced Ford. So, Ford has selected Harman as their audio partner for selected future programs.
This newly established relationship is the result of common focus on technical innovation and a shared vision to create an unmatched ownership experience across Ford line of autos. This new award further broadens our reach in the North American market and follows on the news, as I said, $900 million infotainment win from another U.S. auto maker last quarter. We are well on our way to expand our business with the distinguished Detroit Three.
In Europe, BMW has selected Harman for their future cross-car line ultra premium audio system worldwide, where we replaced a competitor. So, it’s a net new. And Volvo has selected Harman to provide ultra premium branded audio system across all cross-car lines. This is our first branded audio award with Volvo and marks the beginning of an important new strategic relationship. As you know, Volvo is owned by Geely, and Geely has awarded Harman already for infotainment and audio business, and we have a lot of joint relationships and development programs happening with that group.
In Italy, the Fiat Group awarded Harman a second luxury branded audio contract for its Maserati sports car line. In addition to the JBL sound system recently launched on the Fiat 500 Abarth Special Edition, these two awards illustrate the breadth of Harman’s portfolio and our ability to satisfy customer needs in wide-ranged price points and price segments. Also to say, scalability of audio system, first I shared with you scalable infotainment, and now we are after scalable audio systems.
Across Asia, Harman has secured eight new program awards with six different OEMs. In China, we have been selected to provide the first ever branded audio solution for JAC, a domestic automaker, as well as additional programs with current customers like BAIC and Geely. In Japan, we expanded our long-term relationship with Subaru and Lexus, with two replacement platform awards for each company. In Korea, we continued to expand our portfolio of business with Kia by securing Harman’s first branded audio award in the C-segment small SUV, once again underlining our effort to have scalability approach in audio market.
Our Professional division continued its sector leadership during the first quarter, installing Harman systems in more than a dozen major arenas and stadiums and other large venues, looking ahead to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. We have received major contracts for equipment sales to outfit two new official stadiums.
We also booked a major installation at Rio de Janeiro International Airport, which will serve as gateway to the 2016 Olympics. Just to stress that, this international airport would also be connected with the subway system with 99 train stations. This award would be one of a kind in the world, not just the audio, but it will also have the complete network of IDX for the passenger flow and information management. So this is a very, very unique award which will put Harman on the map of information technology, audio technology and audio video integration at the backbone.
Ladies and gentlemen, these first quarter achievements are further evidence of our commitment to delivering long-term profitable growth while we continue to expand our product portfolio. We recognize that regional economic cycles continue to present challenges, but our results this quarter also show that we are acting aggressively to mitigate potential impacts. Our strong liquidity position, our pipeline of differentiating innovations, and our expanding base of premium customers across every region are the catalysts for growth. This has been our philosophy. This has been our strategy. And we have been executing on it and, unfashionably, will continue to drive this strategy. And we’ll exploit each of these aggressively.
Before I turn the call over to Mr. Parker, let me summarize our key actions and achievements that form the foundation for Harman’s long-term particular growth strategy. We have an industry-leading order backlog, with double-digit operating margins. We continue to grow aggressively in BRIC markets. We’re winning new strategic customers, adding names such as Ford, Volvo, to our brand portfolio of automotive partners. We continue to introduce new market-leading innovations, and in this first quarter alone, we added 175 new patents and patents filings to our base.
Let me reiterate. As I said earlier, it was a tough quarter from the top line perspective. And we are closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment, and in particular, the automotive sector, and we will give you an update on our full year guidance together with our second quarter results.
Now with that, I thank you for your attention and I thank you for continued support. I will now ask Herbert Parker to share a closer look at the first quarter financials.

We’ve closed yet another very solid quarter of operational and financial improvements and I’d like to review a few of our highlights.As always, most of my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP",671,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid quarter of operational and financial improvements and I’d like to review a few of our highlights.
As always, most of my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which basically excludes restructuring costs and other non-recurring items. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release, but for your convenience, our restructuring charge for this quarter was $200,000.
Okay. As we always start with the top line -and as Dinesh mentioned earlier - although this quarter was challenging for the top line, we still managed to increase our revenues by 2% when excluding the impact of foreign currencies. And we think it is very important to point out that we reported double-digit EBITDA percentages in all three operational divisions, increasing the total company EBITDA margin by 66 basis points to 10.8%.
Our gross margin has expanded by 34 basis points during the quarter, primarily due to our Lifestyle and Professional divisions’ ability to successfully mitigate the near-term commodity cost increases. All divisions continue to benefit from our ongoing global footprint initiatives and our relentless focus on cost efficiency.
We also had significant improvement in controllable costs for the quarter. Our SG&A expense declined by 36 basis points to 19.9% of sales compared to the prior year, even as we increased investment in our global brand awareness campaigns. We continued to be more effective with our engineering investments, as our R&D costs as a percentage of sales, which is included in our SG&A, declined by 36 basis points to 7.8% of sales compared to last year.
These improvements translate to a combined 69-basis points increase in operating income, bringing the total company EBIT margin to 7.9%. This is the highest level we’ve achieved in the first quarter in over five years.
Net income for the quarter was $55 million, or $0.79 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, a 14% increase. Our effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 24%, which benefited from certain discrete items recorded during the quarter. On a full-year basis, we still expect our effective annual tax rate to fall within our 26% to 28% guidance range.
Our total liquidity stands at $1.3 billion, which gives us sufficient capital to cover our future operating, financing, and investment requirements. Now I’d like to move on to capital allocation.
We follow a disciplined process for deploying our capital to the highest and best long-term returns. Each alternative, whether it be an organic growth investment, acquisition, or dividend, is indexed against each other, and against the value that a stock buyback program provides as a key hurdle.
Now having said that, it is our belief and experience that long-term sustainable shareholder value is best created through investing in organic growth opportunities, such as building our footprint in BRIC countries, combined with accretive acquisitions that either add complementary technical capabilities or provide distribution access to emerging markets. We’ve also determined that the delivery of a growing and sustainable dividend stream is an appropriate method of returning value to our shareholders.
I would like to point out that we have executed on all of the capital allocation strategic initiatives noted above. First of all, we invested heavily in BRIC countries, and we’re seeing the results in strong growth in these markets. Second, we made strategic acquisitions, including an embedded audio company, MWM in the U.S., and Selenium in Brazil, and Interchain in India. Third, we doubled our dividend payout rate. Fourth, we executed on our share buyback plan. And five, we did all of this while still achieving an investment grade from both S&P and Moody’s.
These achievements are indicative of our continuous improvement culture and a validation of our strategy to keep strong operational focus with a clear link to our goal of maintaining an efficient balance sheet and delivering shareholder value to our investors.
Operator, we are now ready to take your questions.

There is so much and so many reports coming out, and they’re all relevant. I personally actually hit the road to get the pulse for the market and from the customers, so I was in - in the last six weeks I’ve been in Germany visiting all our key clients. I’ve been in Korea. I’ve been in China. I’ve been in Brazil. And I’m going to India this weekend. The key - and so is Herbert, so are the division Presidents traveling.
We want to really get to the bottom of it, because any such report may or may not depict exactly where our backlog is coming and where would it turn into revenue and what are the take rates implications. So all in all, I share your sentiments. As I said in my opening comments, that dramatically economic environment has changed in the last few months.
And we’re actually evaluating ourselves that what does this mean, because we’re seeing Europe down 10% for the next two quarters. We’re seeing North America will continue to grow in calendar 2013, which we see nice development. China is still growing 10%.
At the same time, we are growing take rates while our top line due to production step-downs might be coming down, but our take rates might be helping or new technologies like Aha or other things we’ve been launching, that might be helping. Audio take rates are different. So net-net, we are very much part of the softening in Europe you are describing and we are feeling it.
You have seen it in our first quarter. We grew only 2% on a constant currency. But we still feel that we need to evaluate for two more months very closely with our major OEMs, car companies, to be able to assess whether we can maintain the guidance we issued or do we have to address it. We would not know that until end of December. That’s when we’ll know better. But we hope that this European thing is not a mid- to long-term phenomenon. If it is not, I think Harman will do better than peers.

So it’s a bit premature, but I think earlier conversation from some other colleagues were - we’re not different. We’re not totally insulated from what’s happening in the marketplace. Up until now, we held our head up saying that luxury sector was very resilient, but we have seen now that luxury car companies, at least Daimler, came out and said that, look, they may be shutting down for a week or two longer than normal.
So if that’s the trend, that will definitely affect our top line. And top line is as important as bottom line, although we have better control on bottom line because we have much better cost control and productivity measures in place than we have handle top line. So I think we have to wait and see.

So typically, Audio business from the wire to revenue is two-years cycle. In China and India, it’s a different market, because they never had any Audio, and they in fact push us - do it like next month. And that’s also a bit over-ambitious like TATA and Geely and BAIC. They expect us to do revenue, order to revenue, a book and bill much faster. But in case of BMWs and Fords and Volvos, they already had an audio supplier. So there is a life cycle, and it’s not a Plug&Play. A lot of engineering goes in.

China - when I share what I saw in China, people don’t believe, because Chinese on the ground are not feeling any different upbeat environment than they were six months ago. However, our western press and media shows quite the contrary. The truth is somewhere in between. The fact is there is a bit of a softening in China, and we forget that. We are seeing a lot of stand-still sort of - paralysis of decision making in United States, because we have a President to be elected in November. And China will elect a President at four weeks after our President. So six months before President and six months after, the big decisions are generally put off.
However having said that, our industry, particularly the luxury sector, is still doing quite well. Getting a little more challenging, because different standard, different EPS standards, and what have you and they want domestic automakers to pick up the speed, but they’re not there yet. So some of those tug of war goes on, but I expect China to continue to perform at fairly good levels. I’ve said pretty strongly that with Harman’s portfolio and our cost structure, we can grow three times the GDP in China year over year, and I’m still repeating that. Three times GDP is something you can expect from us. So even if they grow 7%, 8%, we’ll grow 25% year over year.

As you read earlier today, we delivered another strong quarter with growth in local currency, even against last year’s abnormally strong first quarter and most importantly, in a challenging economic environment, which has changed Harman rather dramatically over the last few months.
Our success continues to be underlined by the launch of several award-winning new products and with competitive wins in the Car Audio business from BMW, Ford and Volvo. We are proud that our relentless execution and continued cost focus have allowed us to post our twelfth consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. We’re also pleased to see our solid track record recognized by credit rating improvements to investment grade. We are confident that our excellent liquidity profile will enable us to continue to utilize a variety of initiatives to deploy capital, invest in growth and generate strong returns for our shareholders.
We also continued our aggressive growth in the emerging markets, with BRIC country sales up 23% in the first quarter. We remain committed to a strategy of growth, intense cost focus, innovation, and speedy execution regardless of the economic cycles ahead.
At this time, I would like to quickly share with you a few highlights that underscore the strength and resiliency of Harman’s growth strategy, including some significant financial events in recent weeks. As you know, Standard & Poor’s raised Harman’s corporate rating to investment grade. Moody’s followed with an investment grade rating just a few weeks later, citing our strong competitive position, revenue growth, and excellent liquidity profile as factors in their decision.
Concurrent with the latest ratings upgrade, we successfully concluded negotiations last month with a group of banks for a new $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility, obviously at much better rates than before. We also secured a 5-year $300 million term loan, which we used, along with $100 million of our own cash, to repay $400 million in convertible senior notes held by a series of investors, primarily KKR and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. This transaction concludes any direct financial interest in Harman by these investors.
Each of our 3 divisions scored significant wins during the first quarter, beginning with infotainment, where Harman continues to be a driving force for innovation. Harman celebrated the market launch of 2 advanced infotainment systems. The latest BMW infotainment system is debuting on the 7 Series and will roll out to all BMW vehicles worldwide this fall. This system is the most advanced on the market, offering sophisticated features such as 3-dimensional navigation and real-time traffic update, office function integration, voice command, intelligence, Internet connectivity, and many more.
In addition, Chrysler’s latest Ram truck and Dodge Viper models went to market featuring the next generation Uconnect infotainment. Uconnect system is designed, engineered and built by Harman, which is getting very positive comments in the marketplace from Chrysler and Fiat.
On Aha Radio technology, it was launched as an integral feature in Honda’s new vehicular connectivity system called HondaLink. That, again, is a good example with a lot of technology we have, outside of regular infotainment or car audio, we’re starting to penetrate customers we never had any business with. Honda is one such customer. We had no business, neither infotainment nor car audio. With our Aha connectivity suite, we have penetrated and it’s been a great starting relationship, which I’m sure with bear fruit for many other business to do.
Similar, HondaLink would be rolled out across all car models in the United States in 2013. These launches are similar to the depth of our automotive backlog, an industry-leading backlog of awarded business that was built on the success of innovation machine.
To continue this leadership position, in September we announced that Harman will establish a new software engineering center in Chicago. To further expand our global network of infotainment, engineering, and mainly focusing on connectivity and development of such feature functionality, within reach of key customers in Detroit and of course many other European and Japanese customers in that area.
In the Lifestyle Division, Harman extended its global leadership in automotive audio. In our accompanying press release issued this morning, we outlined $800 million in new awards from major OEMs in North America, Europe and Asia. This is the single largest order intake in car audio I have seen, at least in my time here, over 5.5 years. And most importantly, I’ll stress this $800 million is in net new business. Every single award is brand new and additive to what we already had, bringing in some new customers which we never did business with.
Let’s start first with extremely prized acquisition that is Ford Motor Company. You have heard me talk about Ford and GM for almost 3 years. And last quarter, we announced General Motors and this quarter we announced Ford. So, Ford has selected Harman as their audio partner for selected future programs.
This newly established relationship is the result of common focus on technical innovation and a shared vision to create an unmatched ownership experience across Ford line autos. This new award further broadens our reach in the North American market and follows on the news, as I said, $900 million infotainment win from another U.S. automaker last quarter. We are well on our way to expand our business with the distinguished Detroit 3.
In Europe, BMW has selected Harman for their future cross-car line ultra premium audio system worldwide, where we replaced a competitor. So, it’s a net new. And Volvo has selected Harman to provide ultra premium branded audio system across all cross-car lines. This is our first branded audio award with Volvo and marks the beginning of an important new strategic relationship. As you know, Volvo is owned by Geely, and Geely has awarded Harman already for infotainment and audio business, and we have a lot of joint relationships and development programs happening with that group.
In Italy, the Fiat Group awarded Harman a second luxury branded audio contract for its Maserati sports car line. In addition to the JBL sound system recently launched on the Fiat 500 Abarth Special Edition, these 2 awards illustrate the breadth of Harman’s portfolio and our ability to satisfy customer needs in wide-ranged price points and price segments. Also to say, scalability of audio system, first I shared with you scalable infotainment, and now we are after scalable audio systems.
Across Asia, Harman has secured 8 new program awards with 6 different OEMs. In China, we have been selected to provide the first-ever branded audio solution for JAC, a domestic automaker, as well as additional programs with current customers like BAIC and Geely. In Japan, we expanded our long-term relationship with Subaru and Lexus, with 2 replacement platform awards for each company. In Korea, we continued to expand our portfolio of business with Kia by securing Harman’s first branded audio award in the C-segment small SUV, once again underlining our effort to have scalability approach in audio market.
Our Professional division continued its sector leadership during the first quarter, installing Harman systems in more than a dozen major arenas and stadiums and other large venues, looking ahead to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. We have received major contracts for equipment sales to outfit 2 new official stadiums. We also booked a major installation at Rio de Janeiro International Airport, which will serve as gateway to the 2016 Olympics. Just to stress that, this international airport would also be connected with the subway system with 99 train stations. This award would be one of a kind in the world, not just the audio, but it will also have the complete network of IDX for the passenger flow and information management. So this is a very, very unique award which will put Harman on the map of information technology, audio technology and audio-video integration as a backbone.
Ladies and gentlemen, these first quarter achievements are further evidence of our commitment to delivering long-term profitable growth while we continue to expand our product portfolio. We recognize that regional economic cycles continue to present challenges, but our results this quarter also show that we are acting aggressively to mitigate potential impacts. Our strong liquidity position, our pipeline of differentiating innovations, and our expanding base of premium customers across every region are the catalysts for growth. This has been our philosophy. This has been our strategy. And we have been executing on it and, unfashionably [ph], will continue to drive this strategy. And we’ll exploit each of these aggressively.
Before I turn the call over to Mr. Parker, let me summarize our key actions and achievements that form the foundation for Harman’s long-term profitable growth strategy. We have an industry-leading order backlog, with double-digit operating margins. We continue to grow aggressively in BRIC markets. We’re winning new strategic customers, adding names such as Ford, Volvo, to our brand portfolio of automotive partners. We continue to introduce new market-leading innovations, and in this first quarter alone, we added 175 new patents and patents filings to our base.
Let me reiterate. As I said earlier, it was a tough quarter from the top line perspective. And we are closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment, and in particular, the automotive sector, and we will give you an update on our full year guidance together with our second quarter results.
Now with that, I thank you for your attention and I thank you for your continued support. I will now ask Herbert Parker to share a closer look at the first quarter financials."
29279,223200957,377793,"Harman International Industries, Incorporated, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid quarter of operational and financial improvements and I’d like to review a few of our highlights.As always, most of my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP",672,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid quarter of operational and financial improvements and I’d like to review a few of our highlights.
As always, most of my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which basically excludes restructuring costs and other non-recurring items. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release, but for your convenience, our restructuring charge for this quarter was $200,000.
Okay. As we always start with the top line -- and as Dinesh mentioned earlier -- although this quarter was challenging for the top line, we still managed to increase our revenues by 2% when excluding the impact of foreign currencies. And we think it is very important to point out that we reported double-digit EBITDA percentages in all 3 operational divisions, increasing the total company EBITDA margin by 66 basis points to 10.8%.
Our gross margin has expanded by 34 basis points during the quarter, primarily due to our Lifestyle and Professional divisions’ ability to successfully mitigate the near [indiscernible] commodity cost increases. All divisions continue to benefit from our ongoing global footprint initiatives and our relentless focus on cost efficiency.
We also had significant improvement in controllable costs for the quarter. Our SG&A expense declined by 36 basis points to 19.9% of sales compared to the prior year, even as we increased investment in our global brand awareness campaigns. We continued to be more effective with our engineering investments, as our R&D costs as a percentage of sales, which is included in our SG&A, declined by 36 basis points to 7.8% of sales compared to last year.
These improvements translate to a combined 69-basis points increase in operating income, bringing the total company EBIT margin to 7.9%. This is the highest level we’ve achieved in the first quarter in over 5 years.
Net income for the quarter was $55 million, or $0.79 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, a 14% increase. Our effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 24%, which benefited from certain discrete items recorded during the quarter. On a full-year basis, we still expect our effective annual tax rate to fall within our 26% to 28% guidance range.
Our total liquidity stands at $1.3 billion, which gives us sufficient capital to cover our future operating, financing, and investment requirements. Now I’d like to move on to capital allocation.
We follow disciplined processes for deploying our capital to the highest and best long-term returns. Each alternative, whether it be an organic growth investment, acquisition, or dividend, is indexed against each other, and against the value that a stock buyback program provides as a key hurdle.
Now having said that, it is our belief and experience that long-term sustainable shareholder value is best created through investing in organic growth opportunities, such as building our footprint in BRIC countries, combined with accretive acquisitions that either add complementary technical capabilities or provide distribution access to emerging markets. We’ve also determined that the delivery of a growing and sustainable dividend stream is an appropriate method of returning value to our shareholders.
I would like to point out that we have executed on all of the capital allocation strategic initiatives noted above. First of all, we invested heavily in BRIC countries, and we’re seeing the results in strong growth in these markets. Second, we made strategic acquisitions, including an embedded audio company, MWM in the U.S., and Selenium in Brazil, and Interchain in India. Third, we doubled our dividend payout rate. Fourth, we executed on our share buyback plan. And five, we did all of this while still achieving an investment grade from both S&P and Moody’s.
These achievements are indicative of our continuous improvement culture and a validation of our strategy to keep strong operational focus with a clear link to our goal of maintaining an efficient balance sheet and delivering shareholder value to our investors.

I’ve been in China. I’ve been in Brazil. And I’m going to India this weekend. The key -- and so is Herbert, so are the other division presidents traveling.
We want to really get to the bottom of it, because any such report may or may not depict exactly where our backlog is coming and where would it turn into revenue and what are the take rates implications. So all in all, I share your sentiments. As I said in my opening comments, that dramatically economic environment has changed in the last few months.
And we’re actually evaluating ourselves that what does this mean, because we are seeing Europe down 10% for the next 2 quarters. We’re seeing North America will continue to grow in calendar 2013, which we see nice development. China is still growing 10%.
At the same time, we are growing take rates while our top line due to production step-downs might be coming down, but our take rates might be helping or new technologies like Aha or other things we’ve been launching, that might be helping. Audio take rates are different. So net-net, we are very much part of the softening in Europe you are describing and we are feeling it.
You have seen it in our first quarter. We grew only 2% on a constant currency. But we still feel that we need to evaluate for 2 more months very closely with our major OEMs, car companies, to be able to assess whether we can maintain the guidance we issued or do we have to address it? We would not know that until end of December. That’s when we’ll know better. But we hope that this European thing is not a mid- to long-term phenomenon.

So if that’s the trend, that will definitely affect our top line.

Brazil is single most upbeat regional economy I have visited in the last 6 months. That’s really profound statement I make, because people told me they cannot find engineering companies. They cannot find enough earth movers. They cannot find enough workers. Unemployment is all-time low, and a lot of money chasing so many projects, but not enough people to take on.
And we definitely are benefiting from this boom in infrastructure build-up, building up not just for FIFA 2014, but also Olympic 2016. We mentioned 2 big stadiums, but total, 12 plus 6, 18 stadiums are being built, and we expect at least 1/4 of those to come to us. In addition, we have entered first -- very first time in Brazil, a semi-OEM relationship with one of the automakers which we have not announced yet, but we will soon.
And car audio is picking up. In fact, we have a very healthy car audio business, which I expect to grow 25% every year. So all-in-all Brazil is looking good, and for us to do more there -- we have 2 factories, one in Manaus up north in a tax-free zone and one in south of Brazil, Porto Alegre.

However, our Western press and media shows quite the contrary. The truth is somewhere in between. The fact is there is a bit of a softening in China, and we forget that. We are seeing a lot of stand-still sort of -- paralysis of decision making in United States, because we have a President to be elected in November. And China will elect a President at 4 weeks after our President. So 6 months before President and 6 months after, the big decisions are generally put off.
However having said that, our industry, particularly the luxury sector, is still doing quite well. Getting a little more challenging, because different standard, different EPA [ph] standards, and what have you and they want domestic automakers to pick up the speed, but they’re not there yet. So some of those tug of war goes on, but I expect China to continue to perform at fairly good levels. I’ve said pretty strongly that with Harman’s portfolio and our cost structure, we can grow 3x the GDP in China year over year, and I’m still repeating that. 3x GDP is something you can expect from us.

As I mentioned, our new Head of Investor Relations, Sandy Rowland, she brings extensive experience in financial management and analysis to Harman from her prior roles at Kodak and PricewaterhouseCoopers, and she looks forward to meeting you soon. And I’m sure there are lots of opportunities where a few of us will be traveling together to see you and be part of your conferences.

The good thing would be Bob and Sandy will be in the same building, so there’s a complete good sort of handle while in transition.
As you read earlier today, we delivered another strong quarter with growth in local currency, even against last year’s abnormally strong first quarter and most importantly, in a challenging economic environment, which has changed Harman rather dramatically over the last few months.
Our success continues to be underlined by the launch of several award-winning new products and with competitive wins in the Car Audio business from BMW, Ford and Volvo. We are proud that our relentless execution and continued cost focus have allowed us to post our twelfth consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. We’re also pleased to see our solid track record recognized by credit rating improvements to investment grade. We are confident that our excellent liquidity profile will enable us to continue to utilize a variety of initiatives to deploy capital, invest in growth and generate strong returns for our shareholders.
We also continued our aggressive growth in the emerging markets, with BRIC country sales up 23% in the first quarter. We remain committed to a strategy of growth, intense cost focus, innovation, and speedy execution regardless of the economic cycles ahead.
At this time, I would like to quickly share with you a few highlights that underscore the strength and resiliency of Harman’s growth strategy, including some significant financial events in recent weeks. As you know, Standard & Poor’s raised Harman’s corporate rating to investment grade. Moody’s followed with an investment grade rating just a few weeks later, citing our strong competitive position, revenue growth, and excellent liquidity profile as factors in their decision.
Concurrent with the latest ratings upgrade, we successfully concluded negotiations last month with a group of banks for a new $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility, obviously at much better rates than before. We also secured a 5-year $300 million term loan, which we used, along with $100 million of our own cash, to repay $400 million in convertible senior notes held by a series of investors, primarily KKR and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. This transaction concludes any direct financial interest in Harman by these investors.
Each of our 3 divisions scored significant wins during the first quarter, beginning with infotainment, where Harman continues to be a driving force for innovation. Harman celebrated the market launch of 2 advanced infotainment systems. The latest BMW infotainment system is debuting on the 7 Series and will roll out to all BMW vehicles worldwide this fall. This system is the most advanced on the market, offering sophisticated features such as 3-dimensional navigation and real-time traffic update, office function integration, voice command, intelligence, Internet connectivity, and many more.
In addition, Chrysler’s latest Ram truck and Dodge Viper models went to market featuring the next generation Uconnect infotainment. Uconnect system is designed, engineered and built by Harman, which is getting very positive comments in the marketplace from Chrysler and Fiat.
On Aha Radio technology, it was launched as an integral feature in Honda’s new vehicular connectivity system called HondaLink. That, again, is a good example with a lot of technology we have, outside of regular infotainment or car audio, we’re starting to penetrate customers we never had any business with. Honda is one such customer. We had no business, neither infotainment nor car audio. With our Aha connectivity suite, we have penetrated and it’s been a great starting relationship, which I’m sure with bear fruit for many other business to do.
Similar, HondaLink would be rolled out across all car models in the United States in 2013. These launches are similar to the depth of our automotive backlog, an industry-leading backlog of awarded business that was built on the success of innovation machine.
To continue this leadership position, in September we announced that Harman will establish a new software engineering center in Chicago. To further expand our global network of infotainment, engineering, and mainly focusing on connectivity and development of such feature functionality, within reach of key customers in Detroit and of course many other European and Japanese customers in that area.
In the Lifestyle Division, Harman extended its global leadership in automotive audio. In our accompanying press release issued this morning, we outlined $800 million in new awards from major OEMs in North America, Europe and Asia. This is the single largest order intake in car audio I have seen, at least in my time here, over 5.5 years. And most importantly, I’ll stress this $800 million is in net new business. Every single award is brand new and additive to what we already had, bringing in some new customers which we never did business with.
Let’s start first with extremely prized acquisition that is Ford Motor Company. You have heard me talk about Ford and GM for almost 3 years. And last quarter, we announced General Motors and this quarter we announced Ford. So, Ford has selected Harman as their audio partner for selected future programs.
This newly established relationship is the result of common focus on technical innovation and a shared vision to create an unmatched ownership experience across Ford line autos. This new award further broadens our reach in the North American market and follows on the news, as I said, $900 million infotainment win from another U.S. automaker last quarter. We are well on our way to expand our business with the distinguished Detroit 3.
In Europe, BMW has selected Harman for their future cross-car line ultra premium audio system worldwide, where we replaced a competitor. So, it’s a net new. And Volvo has selected Harman to provide ultra premium branded audio system across all cross-car lines. This is our first branded audio award with Volvo and marks the beginning of an important new strategic relationship. As you know, Volvo is owned by Geely, and Geely has awarded Harman already for infotainment and audio business, and we have a lot of joint relationships and development programs happening with that group.
In Italy, the Fiat Group awarded Harman a second luxury branded audio contract for its Maserati sports car line. In addition to the JBL sound system recently launched on the Fiat 500 Abarth Special Edition, these 2 awards illustrate the breadth of Harman’s portfolio and our ability to satisfy customer needs in wide-ranged price points and price segments. Also to say, scalability of audio system, first I shared with you scalable infotainment, and now we are after scalable audio systems.
Across Asia, Harman has secured 8 new program awards with 6 different OEMs. In China, we have been selected to provide the first-ever branded audio solution for JAC, a domestic automaker, as well as additional programs with current customers like BAIC and Geely. In Japan, we expanded our long-term relationship with Subaru and Lexus, with 2 replacement platform awards for each company. In Korea, we continued to expand our portfolio of business with Kia by securing Harman’s first branded audio award in the C-segment small SUV, once again underlining our effort to have scalability approach in audio market.
Our Professional division continued its sector leadership during the first quarter, installing Harman systems in more than a dozen major arenas and stadiums and other large venues, looking ahead to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. We have received major contracts for equipment sales to outfit 2 new official stadiums. We also booked a major installation at Rio de Janeiro International Airport, which will serve as gateway to the 2016 Olympics. Just to stress that, this international airport would also be connected with the subway system with 99 train stations. This award would be one of a kind in the world, not just the audio, but it will also have the complete network of IDX for the passenger flow and information management. So this is a very, very unique award which will put Harman on the map of information technology, audio technology and audio-video integration as a backbone.
Ladies and gentlemen, these first quarter achievements are further evidence of our commitment to delivering long-term profitable growth while we continue to expand our product portfolio. We recognize that regional economic cycles continue to present challenges, but our results this quarter also show that we are acting aggressively to mitigate potential impacts. Our strong liquidity position, our pipeline of differentiating innovations, and our expanding base of premium customers across every region are the catalysts for growth. This has been our philosophy. This has been our strategy. And we have been executing on it and, unfashionably [ph], will continue to drive this strategy. And we’ll exploit each of these aggressively.
Before I turn the call over to Mr. Parker, let me summarize our key actions and achievements that form the foundation for Harman’s long-term profitable growth strategy. We have an industry-leading order backlog, with double-digit operating margins. We continue to grow aggressively in BRIC markets. We’re winning new strategic customers, adding names such as Ford, Volvo, to our brand portfolio of automotive partners. We continue to introduce new market-leading innovations, and in this first quarter alone, we added 175 new patents and patents filings to our base.
Let me reiterate. As I said earlier, it was a tough quarter from the top line perspective. And we are closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment, and in particular, the automotive sector, and we will give you an update on our full year guidance together with our second quarter results.
Now with that, I thank you for your attention and I thank you for your continued support. I will now ask Herbert Parker to share a closer look at the first quarter financials."
29279,223200957,377920,"Harman International Industries, Incorporated, Q1 2013 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2012",2012-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid quarter of operational and financial improvements and I’d like to review a few of our highlights.As always, most of my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP",672,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone. We’ve closed yet another very solid quarter of operational and financial improvements and I’d like to review a few of our highlights.
As always, most of my financial comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which basically excludes restructuring costs and other non-recurring items. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release, but for your convenience, our restructuring charge for this quarter was $200,000.
Okay. As we always start with the top line -- and as Dinesh mentioned earlier -- although this quarter was challenging for the top line, we still managed to increase our revenues by 2% when excluding the impact of foreign currencies. And we think it is very important to point out that we reported double-digit EBITDA percentages in all 3 operational divisions, increasing the total company EBITDA margin by 66 basis points to 10.8%.
Our gross margin has expanded by 34 basis points during the quarter, primarily due to our Lifestyle and Professional divisions’ ability to successfully mitigate the near [indiscernible] commodity cost increases. All divisions continue to benefit from our ongoing global footprint initiatives and our relentless focus on cost efficiency.
We also had significant improvement in controllable costs for the quarter. Our SG&A expense declined by 36 basis points to 19.9% of sales compared to the prior year, even as we increased investment in our global brand awareness campaigns. We continued to be more effective with our engineering investments, as our R&D costs as a percentage of sales, which is included in our SG&A, declined by 36 basis points to 7.8% of sales compared to last year.
These improvements translate to a combined 69-basis points increase in operating income, bringing the total company EBIT margin to 7.9%. This is the highest level we’ve achieved in the first quarter in over 5 years.
Net income for the quarter was $55 million, or $0.79 per share, compared to $0.69 per share in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, a 14% increase. Our effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 24%, which benefited from certain discrete items recorded during the quarter. On a full-year basis, we still expect our effective annual tax rate to fall within our 26% to 28% guidance range.
Our total liquidity stands at $1.3 billion, which gives us sufficient capital to cover our future operating, financing, and investment requirements. Now I’d like to move on to capital allocation.
We follow disciplined processes for deploying our capital to the highest and best long-term returns. Each alternative, whether it be an organic growth investment, acquisition, or dividend, is indexed against each other, and against the value that a stock buyback program provides as a key hurdle.
Now having said that, it is our belief and experience that long-term sustainable shareholder value is best created through investing in organic growth opportunities, such as building our footprint in BRIC countries, combined with accretive acquisitions that either add complementary technical capabilities or provide distribution access to emerging markets. We’ve also determined that the delivery of a growing and sustainable dividend stream is an appropriate method of returning value to our shareholders.
I would like to point out that we have executed on all of the capital allocation strategic initiatives noted above. First of all, we invested heavily in BRIC countries, and we’re seeing the results in strong growth in these markets. Second, we made strategic acquisitions, including an embedded audio company, MWM in the U.S., and Selenium in Brazil, and Interchain in India. Third, we doubled our dividend payout rate. Fourth, we executed on our share buyback plan. And five, we did all of this while still achieving an investment grade from both S&P and Moody’s.
These achievements are indicative of our continuous improvement culture and a validation of our strategy to keep strong operational focus with a clear link to our goal of maintaining an efficient balance sheet and delivering shareholder value to our investors.
Operator, we are now ready to take your questions."

There is so much and so many reports coming out, and they’re all relevant. I personally actually hit the road to get the pulse for the market and from the customers, so I was in -- in the last 6 weeks I’ve been in Germany visiting all our key clients. I’ve been in Korea. I’ve been in China. I’ve been in Brazil. And I’m going to India this weekend. The key -- and so is Herbert, so are the other division presidents traveling. We want to really get to the bottom of it, because any such report may or may not depict exactly where our backlog is coming and where would it turn into revenue and what are the take rates implications. So all in all, I share your sentiments. As I said in my opening comments, that dramatically economic environment has changed in the last few months. And we’re actually evaluating ourselves that what does this mean, because we are seeing Europe down 10% for the next 2 quarters. We’re seeing North America will continue to grow in calendar 2013, which we see nice development. China is still growing 10%. At the same time, we are growing take rates while our top line due to production step-downs might be coming down, but our take rates might be helping or new technologies like Aha or other things we’ve been launching, that might be helping. Audio take rates are different. So net-net, we are very much part of the softening in Europe you are describing and we are feeling it. You have seen it in our first quarter. We grew only 2% on a constant currency. But we still feel that we need to evaluate for 2 more months very closely with our major OEMs, car companies, to be able to assess whether we can maintain the guidance we issued or do we have to address it? We would not know that until end of December. That’s when we’ll know better. But we hope that this European thing is not a mid- to long-term phenomenon. If it is not, I think Harman will do better than peers."

Up until now, we held our head up saying that luxury sector was very resilient, but we have seen now that luxury car companies, at least Daimler, came out and said that, look, they may be shutting down for a week or 2 longer than normal. So if that’s the trend, that will definitely affect our top line. And top line is as important as bottom line, although we have better control on bottom line because we have much better cost control and productivity measures in place than we can handle top line. So I think we have to wait and see.

We are seeing a lot of stand-still sort of -- paralysis of decision making in United States, because we have a President to be elected in November. And China will elect a President at 4 weeks after our President. So 6 months before President and 6 months after, the big decisions are generally put off. However having said that, our industry, particularly the luxury sector, is still doing quite well. Getting a little more challenging, because different standard, different EPA [ph] standards, and what have you and they want domestic automakers to pick up the speed, but they’re not there yet. So some of those tug of war goes on, but I expect China to continue to perform at fairly good levels. I’ve said pretty strongly that with Harman’s portfolio and our cost structure, we can grow 3x the GDP in China year over year, and I’m still repeating that. 3x GDP is something you can expect from us. So even if they grow 7%, 8%, we’ll grow 25% year over year."

I'm joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker; and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon. In our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you positive financial results, marking a ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line. Company wise, we continue to make excellent progress. Our sales increased 18% and our operating income is up 41%. All of our divisions posted higher sales and operating margins, spread by continued higher demand from our automakers, new consumer products, launches and new markets for our professional equipment. 
We continue to deliver results in key emerging markets with BRIC country sales increasing by 32%, led by China sales growth of 44%. We are well on our way to meeting the aggressive sales targets we have set for this sizable BRIC market. We are making further inroads with global and domestic automakers and winning audio contracts for major development and infrastructure projects in BRIC markets. We told you, we would continue to improve the profitability of our Infotainment division. Well, our Infotainment division sales in the quarter grew by 20% and our operating margin improved to 8.3%. Higher sales were driven by robust demand in the luxury automotive segment and continued strong growth in the BRIC countries led by 35% growth in China. Rapid adoption of the scalable platform is certainly helping us accelerate our margin and reduce our overall cost. 
We are also pleased to report that our Lifestyle division sales increased 20% and our operating margin improved to 12.6%. While world markets continue to manage the effects of the debt crisis in Europe, we continue to gain momentum by executing on our global strategy. We are investing in our future with the development of connected technologies for the car, the home and on the go. Since, we are first and foremost a technology company, we have cultivated a portfolio of over 4,000 patents and patents pending. Our innovation pipeline has never been more robust. And at this point, I'd just take a pause to also tell you that today I'm very happy to sit across my colleague Dr. I. P. Park, who had joined the company as our new Chief Technology Officer, and Dr. Park joined us from Samsung Electronics. He had to his credit few dozens of patents, and terrific knowledge of connected space. And he will take over from Sachin Lawande and take us to the next level of innovation.
So coming back to, at CES in Las Vegas, NAM in California, the Detroit Auto Show and the Delhi Auto Show in India, we showcased our latest products and technologies and took home industry awards for innovation, performance and design. These continued investments in innovation positioned us for sustainable profitable growth. When you have great technology and brands like we have, you got to promote them. We're investing in our world-class brands with new global campaigns for key brands like JBL and Harman Kardon. To be clear, we launched these to accelerate penetration of our audio systems in the car, at home and on the go, and this strategy is beginning to pay dividends. While we invest in our brands, we remain relentless on our cost and focus. By doing so, we have secured the financial flexibility we need to execute against a number of strategic capital allocation options.
Ladies and gentlemen, we continue to earn your trust and other stakeholders by delivering sound financial returns by investing and bringing new innovation to market and by gaining share from our competitors. Our hard work to optimize our global footprint has lagged to a sustainable lower cost base. And when you combine with global supply chain management, we have done, it has allowed us to deliver 9 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in sales and earnings. With our current production footprint in emerging markets, we have the flexibility and a scalability to meet our future growth targets, while maximizing our return on invested capital. Our performance this quarter speaks for itself. Harman sales and profitability have improved for 9 straight quarters and we reported record sales in this quarter ever. 
Year-to-date, EBITDA is at 10.6%, up from 9.5% last year. Our balance sheet is strong and our liquidity stands at $1.3 billion. Our Infotainment and car audio backlog of awarded business remains the envy of our industry, at over $14 billion. Now comes the interesting part. More than 1/2 of this backlog, more than 50% of this $14 billion backlog is now carrying double-digit operating margin, double-digit operating margin and that is really what I wanted to register. That tells you what to expect from Harman in coming years. We continue to grow faster than the market and we remain dedicated to execute a global strategy to deliver value to our shareholders. 
Ladies and gentlemen, when you look at the competitive landscape, we believe Harman is the most attractive investment opportunity in our peer group and we are delivering results to support our belief. I will now ask my colleague, our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, to provide a closer look at our financial results."

Following up on our strong first quarter, I'm pleased to report even better results for the second quarter. We were able to generate good leverage on our sales growth during the quarter and we continue to make excellent progress mitigating the neodymium cost increases. I will give you more details on the neodymium topic a little latter in my report. 
First, let me walk you through a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. As you note, please note that my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring cost. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release, but for your convenience, we took only a $1 million restructuring charge this quarter. Okay, let's start with the revenue line for the second quarter. We grew our quarterly revenues by 18% to $1.127 billion, our new quarter record, actually a new record for any quarter that we've ever had during this company's times. All 3 of our segments posted a solid increase versus the prior year with Infotainment and Lifestyle divisions both growing at a strong rate of 20%. Our gross margin during the quarter was 27.1%, down 120 basis points primarily as a result of the neodymium cost increases. 
I would now take this moment to give you an update on our neodymium costs as I mentioned earlier. I will start first by reiterating the information we shared with you at Analyst Day event in Nashville on October 26 of last year. At that time, we said the growth exposure was $90 million, but we had identified $55 million of mitigated actions leaving a net exposure for the full year of $35 million. Out of that $35 million, we had already incurred a net impact of $9 million in the first quarter, leaving a net exposure of $26 million for the remaining 3 quarters, that is what we said last year October 26. Now, as of December 31, the growth exposure has declined to $83 million, while mitigated actions have increased to $60 million, leaving a net exposure of $18 million for the full-year. And it is important to note that out of this $18 million, we have already incurred a net impact of $11 million year-to-date. So there is a lot of numbers, but the takeaway for you is that we only have $7 million net exposure for the remaining 2 quarters. Okay, I'll move on. But I'd like to first emphasize that this was not an easy task and it took a lot of hard work on the supply management side, customer negotiations, R&D efforts to design it out and we couldn't be more pleased with what we've achieved so far. 
Now, moving back to the financial statements. Our SG&A rate for the quarter was very good. The STEP Change program has really helped instill ongoing cost discipline in the organization and we've become much more efficient. Combined with the strong revenue growth, our push for efficiency enabled us to reduce our SG&A expense about 210 basis points down to 18.6%. As you would expect, the result of these activities improved our operating margin quite nicely, growing to 8.5% from 7.6% last year. 
Now moving on to the net income for the quarter, we reported $60 million, or $0.83 per share compared to net income of $56 million, or $0.79 per share in the prior year's quarter. Now as many of you would have noticed, our foreign exchange losses were higher than normal during this quarter and this was related to 2 specific areas. First, as the business process change in our profession [ph] division, we now have one global USD price book. This required a couple of our non-U.S units to change the approximate currency to U.S dollars. This will create more natural hedging but this change required us to revalue our non-U.S. assets at those units and this cause an unreal live loss of some $5 million. Second, the addition of $2 million is related to 4 forward points on hedging which is normal increase [ph] of our volatility times. 
Moving to the taxes, our effective tax rate was 27.8% during the quarter, and our tax rate was higher than previous quarters primarily due to significantly improved profits in the U.S. Moving on to cash, our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $79 million in the quarter bringing our total liquidity position to $1.3 billion, primarily as a result of increased earnings. Now, following on from this strong cash position we have, let me reaffirm our capital allocation philosophy. We will continue to evaluate alternatives, whether it is an organic growth investment, an acquisition, or a share buyback. We remain most interested in investing in organic growth opportunities such as building our footprint in BRIC countries, where long-term returns are the most promising. We believe, as we saw with the Selenium acquisition in Brazil and MWM in the United States, that strategic acquisitions can create and complement this strategy. In addition, we remain committed to providing a sustainable dividend stream to our shareholders. And as you will recall, our Board of Directors has pre-authorized a share buyback. 
Now let me close by highlighting the fact that this makes our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement at the -- both top and bottom line. We maintained a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and as a result, we remain positioned to take advantage of a full range of strategic options. And I finally like to end with saying with 2 strong quarters behind us and with sufficient visibility to our automotive customers' businesses. We are reconfirming our fiscal year 2012 guidance, which we issued to you on October 26 of last year. And with that said, operator, we are now ready to take your questions."

The Aha, we got into Aha first in the industry, because we understood the connected car is the way to go. And we have been spearheading that, we're leading that. One year ago in Geneva, we launched connected car first time based on Aha and everything else. So we continue to lead that. Then your second part was related to smartphone. Look, we have been integrating majority of the dominant smartphones in cars already and we have done that. But that's not the end game. When you integrate the smartphone you're only integrating 10%, 15% of the capabilities smartphone has, in the car. You know why? Because you're not allowed to integrate all feature functionality, because it might interrupt with the car software logic. So the big game is that we have to rewrite most of the car driver related apps and social media. And anything else available in the smart phone in a safe and sound manner, that's one thing. But then comes the monolithic architecture of the system, which is where we made the change also that was always a custom development, we said scalable is way to go because we believe technology changing so rapidly, we need to have a modular and a scalable approach. So our system architecture which is already becoming forefront but continue to be in future years without the powerful drive would be software based. So that your systems would be able to upgrade, download, upload applications, apps and system updates, car, maintenance report, personal information, social media information, all in the car through safe and sound manner through audio. And we are well on the way, by the way. We have hedged on good demonstration in CES and now we are getting ready for first week of March in Geneva to launch a few more things. So that's where we are headed. So there is no change in our strategy, continue to lead in that front."

China factory first, so China factory, in fact 2 factories under one roof in North of China. One, dedicated to our professional audio systems business and other factory is dedicated to our lifestyle car audio business, both are up and running already as of late November. And we're very pleased because we did lot of training. Before even we started the factory, we trained the work force in our Suzhou facility near Shanghai and we then we took those people there. So now they're running about 70%, 75% utilization, and we're only running 2 shifts, so we still have a lot of capacity there. We can add another third shift, we can take utilization to 85%, 90%, which is what we normally do. And we still have lot of land in the building, and also built up areas to add few more production line, if China production continues - China demand continues to soar. So that's why I said, we have flexibility to accommodate our future growth in emerging market production. So that's China. Then, you asked the capacity utilization overall worldwide. I think worldwide, I'll have to take an intelligent guess here. I think we are running at this point, including our German facilities, American facilities, Hungarian, Mexican, Brazilian and China, I would say we're about -- close to 80% utilization right now. And so there's another - we have capacity there. We can always add shift also third shift, most places we are running 2 shifts. So plenty of capacity, fixed cost is there, variable cost we can add as the sales comes up."

In fact, we launched couple of products at NAMM show in California where we had similar audio characteristics in our professional audio, but they were not using neo. We are using substitute. So we know how to do it, and it's also an area where we have some patented technology, and we will patent it, so we can do it. As far as the majority of the recovery that's automotive and professional, both that was a hard work to negotiate the price increases, and we have created an index, so that answers the part of the question that what happens if the cost comes down for these things. So it's an index, if price remains as they are, then we have a 0 some gain, we'll pass it on to our customers. And if cost goes down, our internal cost from our suppliers then we will also reduce accordingly to our customers, so it's a fair game and they've been very fair to us.

I'm joined in Stamford today by our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker; and our Vice President, Investor Relations, Robert Lardon. In our earnings release published this morning, we shared with you positive financial results, marking a ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement to the top and bottom line. Company wise, we continue to make excellent progress. Our sales increased 18% and our operating income is up 41%. All of our divisions posted higher sales and operating margins, spread by continued higher demand from our automakers, new consumer products, launches and new markets for our professional equipment. 
We continue to deliver results in key emerging markets with BRIC country sales increasing by 32%, led by China sales growth of 44%. We are well on our way to meeting the aggressive sales targets we have set for this sizable BRIC market. We are making further inroads with global and domestic automakers and winning audio contracts for major development and infrastructure projects in BRIC markets. We told you, we would continue to improve the profitability of our Infotainment division. Well, our Infotainment division sales in the quarter grew by 20% and our operating margin improved to 8.3%. Higher sales were driven by robust demand in the luxury automotive segment and continued strong growth in the BRIC countries led by 35% growth in China. Rapid adoption of the scalable platform is certainly helping us accelerate our margin and reduce our overall cost. 
We are also pleased to report that our Lifestyle division sales increased 20% and our operating margin improved to 12.6%. While world markets continue to manage the effects of the debt crisis in Europe, we continue to gain momentum by executing on our global strategy. We are investing in our future with the development of connected technologies for the car, the home and on the go. Since, we are first and foremost a technology company, we have cultivated a portfolio of over 4,000 patents and patents pending. Our innovation pipeline has never been more robust. And at this point, I'd just take a pause to also tell you that today I'm very happy to sit across my colleague Dr. I. P. Park, who had joined the company as our new Chief Technology Officer, and Dr. Park joined us from Samsung Electronics. He had to his credit few dozens of patents, and terrific knowledge of connected space. And he will take over from Sachin Lawande and take us to the next level of innovation.
So coming back to, at CES in Las Vegas, NAM in California, the Detroit Auto Show and the Delhi Auto Show in India, we showcased our latest products and technologies and took home industry awards for innovation, performance and design. These continued investments in innovation positioned us for sustainable profitable growth. When you have great technology and brands like we have, you got to promote them. We're investing in our world-class brands with new global campaigns for key brands like JBL and Harman Kardon. To be clear, we launched these to accelerate penetration of our audio systems in the car, at home and on the go, and this strategy is beginning to pay dividends. While we invest in our brands, we remain relentless on our cost and focus. By doing so, we have secured the financial flexibility we need to execute against a number of strategic capital allocation options.
Ladies and gentlemen, we continue to earn your trust and other stakeholders by delivering sound financial returns by investing and bringing new innovation to market and by gaining share from our competitors. Our hard work to optimize our global footprint has lagged to a sustainable lower cost base. And when you combine with global supply chain management, we have done, it has allowed us to deliver 9 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in sales and earnings. With our current production footprint in emerging markets, we have the flexibility and a scalability to meet our future growth targets, while maximizing our return on invested capital. Our performance this quarter speaks for itself. Harman sales and profitability have improved for 9 straight quarters and we reported record sales in this quarter ever. 
Year-to-date, EBITDA is at 10.6%, up from 9.5% last year. Our balance sheet is strong and our liquidity stands at $1.3 billion. Our Infotainment and car audio backlog of awarded business remains the envy of our industry, at over $14 billion. Now comes the interesting part. More than 1/2 of this backlog, more than 50% of this $14 billion backlog is now carrying double-digit operating margin, double-digit operating margin and that is really what I wanted to register. That tells you what to expect from Harman in coming years. We continue to grow faster than the market and we remain dedicated to execute a global strategy to deliver value to our shareholders. 
Ladies and gentlemen, when you look at the competitive landscape, we believe Harman is the most attractive investment opportunity in our peer group and we are delivering results to support our belief. I will now ask my colleague, our Chief Financial Officer, Herbert Parker, to provide a closer look at our financial results."
29279,154036823,2476299,"Harman International Industries Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 07, 2012",2012-02-07,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning to everyone.

Following up on our strong first quarter, I'm pleased to report even better results for the second quarter. We were able to generate good leverage on our sales growth during the quarter and we continue to make excellent progress mitigating the neodymium cost increases. I will give you more details on the neodymium topic a little latter in my report. 
First, let me walk you through a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. As you note, please note that my comments are provided on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes restructuring cost. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release, but for your convenience, we took only a $1 million restructuring charge this quarter. Okay, let's start with the revenue line for the second quarter. We grew our quarterly revenues by 18% to $1.127 billion, our new quarter record, actually a new record for any quarter that we've ever had during this company's times. All 3 of our segments posted a solid increase versus the prior year with Infotainment and Lifestyle divisions both growing at a strong rate of 20%. Our gross margin during the quarter was 27.1%, down 120 basis points primarily as a result of the neodymium cost increases. 
I would now take this moment to give you an update on our neodymium costs as I mentioned earlier. I will start first by reiterating the information we shared with you at Analyst Day event in Nashville on October 26 of last year. At that time, we said the growth exposure was $90 million, but we had identified $55 million of mitigated actions leaving a net exposure for the full year of $35 million. Out of that $35 million, we had already incurred a net impact of $9 million in the first quarter, leaving a net exposure of $26 million for the remaining 3 quarters, that is what we said last year October 26. Now, as of December 31, the growth exposure has declined to $83 million, while mitigated actions have increased to $60 million, leaving a net exposure of $18 million for the full-year. And it is important to note that out of this $18 million, we have already incurred a net impact of $11 million year-to-date. So there is a lot of numbers, but the takeaway for you is that we only have $7 million net exposure for the remaining 2 quarters. Okay, I'll move on. But I'd like to first emphasize that this was not an easy task and it took a lot of hard work on the supply management side, customer negotiations, R&D efforts to design it out and we couldn't be more pleased with what we've achieved so far. 
Now, moving back to the financial statements. Our SG&A rate for the quarter was very good. The STEP Change program has really helped instill ongoing cost discipline in the organization and we've become much more efficient. Combined with the strong revenue growth, our push for efficiency enabled us to reduce our SG&A expense about 210 basis points down to 18.6%. As you would expect, the result of these activities improved our operating margin quite nicely, growing to 8.5% from 7.6% last year. 
Now moving on to the net income for the quarter, we reported $60 million, or $0.83 per share compared to net income of $56 million, or $0.79 per share in the prior year's quarter. Now as many of you would have noticed, our foreign exchange losses were higher than normal during this quarter and this was related to 2 specific areas. First, as the business process change in our profession [ph] division, we now have one global USD price book. This required a couple of our non-U.S units to change the approximate currency to U.S dollars. This will create more natural hedging but this change required us to revalue our non-U.S. assets at those units and this cause an unreal live loss of some $5 million. Second, the addition of $2 million is related to 4 forward points on hedging which is normal increase [ph] of our volatility times. 
Moving to the taxes, our effective tax rate was 27.8% during the quarter, and our tax rate was higher than previous quarters primarily due to significantly improved profits in the U.S. Moving on to cash, our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $79 million in the quarter bringing our total liquidity position to $1.3 billion, primarily as a result of increased earnings. Now, following on from this strong cash position we have, let me reaffirm our capital allocation philosophy. We will continue to evaluate alternatives, whether it is an organic growth investment, an acquisition, or a share buyback. We remain most interested in investing in organic growth opportunities such as building our footprint in BRIC countries, where long-term returns are the most promising. We believe, as we saw with the Selenium acquisition in Brazil and MWM in the United States, that strategic acquisitions can create and complement this strategy. In addition, we remain committed to providing a sustainable dividend stream to our shareholders. And as you will recall, our Board of Directors has pre-authorized a share buyback. 
Now let me close by highlighting the fact that this makes our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement at the -- both top and bottom line. We maintained a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and as a result, we remain positioned to take advantage of a full range of strategic options. And I finally like to end with saying with 2 strong quarters behind us and with sufficient visibility to our automotive customers' businesses. We are reconfirming our fiscal year 2012 guidance, which we issued to you on October 26 of last year. And with that said, operator, we are now ready to take your questions."

And you saw Toyota announcing result this morning very robust, very upbeat about their growth, that's a good thing for Harman. And with that said, next year's number we have given you before like $500 million in scalable, that number has also gone up by at least $100 million to $200 million. So that's again a good thing because that revenue is generating, we have said single digit, high single-digit. It's very well achieved that number."

One year ago in Geneva, we launched connected car first time based on Aha and everything else. So we continue to lead that. Then your second part was related to smartphone. Look, we have been integrating majority of the dominant smartphones in cars already and we have done that. But that's not the end game. When you integrate the smartphone you're only integrating 10%, 15% of the capabilities smartphone has, in the car. You know why? Because you're not allowed to integrate all feature functionality, because it might interrupt with the car software logic. So the big game is that we have to rewrite most of the car driver related apps and social media. And anything else available in the smart phone in a safe and sound manner, that's one thing. But then comes the monolithic architecture of the system, which is where we made the change also that was always a custom development, we said scalable is way to go because we believe technology changing so rapidly, we need to have a modular and a scalable approach. So our system architecture which is already becoming forefront but continue to be in future years without the powerful drive would be software based. So that your systems would be able to upgrade, download, upload applications, apps and system updates, car, maintenance report, personal information, social media information, all in the car through safe and sound manner through audio. And we are well on the way, by the way. We have hedged on good demonstration in CES and now we are getting ready for first week of March in Geneva to launch a few more things.

One, dedicated to our professional audio systems business and other factory is dedicated to our lifestyle car audio business, both are up and running already as of late November.

So now they're running about 70%, 75% utilization, and we're only running 2 shifts, so we still have a lot of capacity there. We can add another third shift, we can take utilization to 85%, 90%, which is what we normally do. And we still have lot of land in the building, and also built up areas to add few more production line, if China production continues - China demand continues to soar. So that's why I said, we have flexibility to accommodate our future growth in emerging market production. So that's China. Then, you asked the capacity utilization overall worldwide. I think worldwide, I'll have to take an intelligent guess here. I think we are running at this point, including our German facilities, American facilities, Hungarian, Mexican, Brazilian and China, I would say we're about -- close to 80% utilization right now. And so there's another - we have capacity there. We can always add shift also third shift, most places we are running 2 shifts.

So we know how to do it, and it's also an area where we have some patented technology, and we will patent it, so we can do it. As far as the majority of the recovery that's automotive and professional, both that was a hard work to negotiate the price increases, and we have created an index, so that answers the part of the question that what happens if the cost comes down for these things. So it's an index, if price remains as they are, then we have a 0 some gain, we'll pass it on to our customers. And if cost goes down, our internal cost from our suppliers then we will also reduce accordingly to our customers, so it's a fair game and they've been very fair to us.
