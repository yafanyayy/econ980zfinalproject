We recorded our all-time record level of income from continuing operations. We also reached our best ever levels for revenue and rig activity for the last quarter.
On this call, we will detail some of the drivers that enabled this performance and walk through some of our expectations going forward into 2012. Including some moderation in the second quarter is daily expenses return to a more expected level from this quarter's significantly reduced number.
Before that discussion, let me comment for a moment just on the dire state of the natural gas market. Prices are plummeting. We see storage overflowing and an ample behind the pipe supply, so the question becomes how much downward pressure may this bring to bear upon the domestic land drilling market?
Clearly, a combination of these factors in previous cycles would have resulted in a predictable drop of the recount. In fact for decades, natural gas pricing was the single most important barometer for the overall rig count. Today, oil and liquids-rich gas have transformed the domestic drilling landscape. Oil-directed drilling has been on a steady march up, while dry gas drilling has lost ground.
And while the gas-directed count will even now most likely accelerate it's declined trend, many expect any fall out to be partially or fully offset by displaced rigs being redirected to oil and liquids-rich targets. This transition that has been underway since the summer of 2008 and may well become more pronounced and impactful.
It has been combined with the transition towards more complex well design and higher performance rig requirements. We would expect higher high-performing Tier 1 AC drive rigs will be best positioned to make the transition while older underperforming rigs will be more likely to be less sidelined, unable to secure the customer sponsorship to be mobilized and repassed through other work.
It has become type of a zero-sum game where oil and liquids-rich gas continue to gain over dry gas and where rigs continue to displace mechanical and SCR rigs.
We're fortunate to have a customer roster with substantial multi-year drilling inventory capable of shifting targets and taking advantage of strong oil prices. Also, we're well-positioned with the most modern and capable fleet in the industry. And by having that historically small exposure in terms of rigs focused on dry gas. Less than 10% of our total active U.S. fleet is currently engaged in dry gas directed drilling on the spot market.
Additional dry gas directed rigs are under term contracts. And we would anticipate some of those to transition to oil and liquids-rich targets over time as well.
We've been asked if some demand for new builds will be satisfied by higher and dislocated rigs during 2012. Our focus will remain the same, because we are coming off such a robust order book from 2011 that totaled 71 fully contracted new builds.
We continue to deliver 4 rigs each month on time and on budget. We have 40 orders remaining in the queue, approximately 30 to complete in fiscal 2012, and 10 slotted in 2013.
Some of our peers continue to have significant numbers of their announced 2012 new build programs without contracts. We would expect to see some of those deliveries delayed. And one would think their appetite for additional spec new builds would be suppressed.
In the meantime, we are solving more for 2013 as we have all but 7 slots fully contracted and spoken for in calendar 2012.
Notwithstanding the added uncertainty of the depressed natural gas prices, we remain upbeat that our business model of delivering premium services will remain a strong demand and provide us with attractive opportunities in 2012 and beyond.
Before closing, let me mention that this is my first call as Chairman, having assumed that title with the passing 3 weeks ago. One of the nice things have already been written and said so I won't do that here. Having worked together for 30 years, I do remember he would say there are more important things than quarterly earnings.  Think more about the kind of company you want to build in the long term. And while he loved the business and was part of this company for 60 years, he would say there are more important things than being the best businessperson around. So especially for the younger analysts and investors on this call, let me pass on his encouragement to us to be folks of strong character, good parents to make an impact on our churches and communities.
So in his memory, I'll share those thoughts for all of us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

As announced earlier today, the company reported $144 million in income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Representing an increase of almost 20% as compared to the immediately preceding quarter.
This very significant increase was mainly attributable to our U.S. Land segment, where we experienced continuing improvement in pricing and activity levels and a very favorable reduction in daily rig expenses. As Hans mentioned, our U.S. land daily rig expenses are expected to return to a normalized level during the second quarter.
Nevertheless, we do expect continuing overall growth in revenue and rig activity as we transition to the second fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of an increasing number of FlexRigs in our U.S. Land segment.
Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion. Our depreciation and our general and administrative expense estimates for the year also remain at approximately $380 million and $105 million, respectively.
Interest expense after capitalized interest is now expected to decrease to approximately $13 million during fiscal 2012 and our tax rate for continuing operations during the year is expected to be approximately 37%.
I will now turn the call to John Lindsay. And after John's comments, we will open the call for questions."

My comments will be on the operational results for our first fiscal quarter 2012 for our 3 operating segments, U.S. Land, Offshore and International, as well as the outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2012. An",1535,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. My comments will be on the operational results for our first fiscal quarter 2012 for our 3 operating segments, U.S. Land, Offshore and International, as well as the outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2012. And I'll begin with our U.S. Land segment first fiscal quarter results, where U.S. Land operating income increased 17% sequentially to $225 million as the U.S. Land segment took delivery of 11 new build FlexRigs during the first fiscal quarter.
Revenue days increased 5% to 20,968 days representing 228 average active rigs in the first quarter. An average of 145 rigs were active under term contracts, an average of 83 rigs were active in the stock market.
Average rig revenue per day increased by $312 to $26,861 per day. Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contracts during the first fiscal quarter was approximately 5% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market.
Average rig expenses per day decreased by $643 to $12,292 per day, primarily as a result of what we believe were only temporary reductions in maintenance and supply costs.
Consequently, average rig margin per day increased by $955 to $14,569 per day. The outlook for U.S. Land during the fiscal quarter remains positive. H&P remains the most active U.S. land contractor, as we have 236 contracted rigs today and 23 idle rigs on 91% utilization rate.
Of these 236 rigs, 152 are under term contracts and 84 are in the spot market, including 82 FlexRigs. Of the rigs in the spot market, 63 are drilling in areas that typically target oil and/or liquids-rich gas.
In the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect revenue days to increase by approximately 2% to 3%. Based on current contractual commitments, an average of 152 rigs are under term contracts for the second fiscal quarter of 2012, an average of 148 rigs for the last 3 quarters of fiscal year '12 and an average of 121 rigs for fiscal year 2013.
Average rig revenue per day in the second quarter may improved slightly up to $200 per day, excluding expenses that are passed through to customers. While average rig expense per day quarter-to-quarter is difficult to predict, we expect the base level of average rig expense per day to return to a $12,700 a day range, similar to previous quarters, excluding any expense increases that would be passed through to customers.
We do expect wages to increase during the second quarter at a range of approximately $500 per day.
Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget. including the 3 additional new FlexRigs announced today, during the past 13 months, we've announced signed term contracts to build and operate a total of 74 new FlexRigs. And currently, 40 remain under construction and are being completed at the rate of approximately 4 rigs per month. The 3 newly contracted rigs are expected to be utilized in the Eagle Ford Shale, the Bakken Shale and the Permian Basin and all 3 are FlexRig3s.
Of the 40 remaining under construction, approximately 30 are expected to be delivered in fiscal year '12 and 10 in fiscal '13 considering a cadence of 4 rigs per month, 7 additional delivery slots remain in our calendar year '12 schedule.
A quick review of our new builds of delivering FlexRigs on time was safe and efficient operations. 1 year ago, we had 198 rigs operating in the U.S. Land and we announced our new build cadence was increasing to 3 rigs per month beginning in January of '11. And we successfully delivered 3 rigs per month, from January through September, plus we increased our cadence to 4 rigs per month beginning in October.
As of today, we've delivered a total of 40 new FlexRigs since our conference call on 27 January of 2011. In addition to our rig construction group delivering rigs on time, we're also proud that the H&P rig leadership and crews on the 40 newly commissioned FlexRigs are able to deliver safety performance during the first year of operation at the rate approximately 2x better than the industry average.
Now we'll talk about the offshore segment and our operating income increased slightly to $12.2 million. Revenue days decreased 1% sequentially to 697 days. Average rig margin per day increased by $388 to $22,171 per day.
Outlook for offshore as of today, the company's offshore segment has 7 rigs active and 2 rigs stacked. Although our rig internet address is returning to the U.S. and is expected to stacked at the end of the second fiscal quarter.
In the second fiscal quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to decrease by approximately 10% and expect average daily margins to decrease by 10% to 15% as some rigs transition between projects.
And now I'll turn to the International segment, where International Land continues to show improvements quarter-to-quarter. Operating income increased by approximately $4.4 million sequentially to  $7.9 million during the second quarter. Revenue days has increased 6% to 1,729 days. Average rig margin per day increased by $1,325 to $9,015 a day.
The primary factor driving the increase in average rig margin per day was the $1.6 million retroactive one-off day rate adjustment. And on the last call, we discussed moving 2 stacked conventional rigs to access markets with higher potential work prospects. And we expected those to occur during the first fiscal quarter. However, now those rigs rig moves are occuring in the second quarter and today, both rigs have contracts.
Outlook for International. As of today, the company's International segment has 20 active rigs and an additional 2 rigs contracted and in-transit between countries. 6 rigs are active or contracted in Colombia, 5 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Of the 4 stacked rigs, 3 are located in Argentina and 1 is located in Colombia.
In the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect International Land revenue days to be sequentially flat as 1 rig became idle in Colombia and the 2 rigs currently in-transit will not have a significant effect on revenue days until the third or fourth fiscal quarters.
Given the absence of the $1.6 million retroactive adjustment payment and the recent stacking of 1 rig in Colombia, we expect average rig margin per day to sequentially fall by 10% to 15%.
One highlight I would like to point out regarding the International segment included in today's 20-rig active fleet is the first FlexRig3 contracted and active in Colombia. You heard us talk previously about the impressive FlexRig4 performance in Argentina and Colombia and this contract is a result of that exceptional performance.
As you may recall, the FlexRig3 is designed to exploit deeper wells than the Flex 4 while maintaining fast rig moves and is well-suited for the majority of wells that we're going to be seeing internationally.
We believe the international market in general appears to be improving for FlexRigs in South America and the Middle East as a result of H&P's performance and safety drilling in rig moves. In each of these regions, FlexRigs have cut well cycle times by half and are delivering well counts in excess of twice what each conventional rig previously was able to provide.
So in closing, we believe the current trends are advantageous to H&P, where unconventional oil and liquids-rich plays have proven to be a game changer in the U.S. Land market as operators shift to drilling more complex horizontal and directional wells. This drilling complexity factor presents real challenges for all conventional rigs and lower technology product offerings.
An example of this change was commented on during our last earnings call. An industry trend where we expected several years ago may have reached the tipping point whereby legacy mechanical rigs are being retired at a higher rate than in previous cycles. Another data point to keep in mind, as well complexity increases and natural gas prices soften, our 3 largest public competitors active fleets rely heavily on their old conventional fleets to maintain their current activity levels.
The competitor's fleet composition of active mechanical and SCR rigs ranges from 50% to 75%. In a very strong market where  both oil and natural gas pricing is high, the old conventional rig fleet is at the lower risk of being stacked but in a sub $3 gas price environment, when dry gas drilling is losing favor, the bottom Tier performing mechanical and SCR rigs are more likely going to be stacked and are less likely candidate to be redirected in mobilized oil and liquids-rich basins.
H&P, on the other hand, no longer operates or markets mechanical rigs and less than 10% of our active U.S. Land fleet today is made-up of SCR rigs. The rest of H&P's active fleets in U.S. Land over 90% of it is made up of AC drive Advanced Technology FlexRigs.
These market trends, along with encouraging conversations with customers for additional new builds, provide us with confidence that more opportunities for new FlexRigs will continue. Now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

We have quite a few conversations still ongoing with customers regarding some of those new build slots. Most of those conversations are in the calendar year 2012. Occasionally, we'll have some discussions regarding 2013. I really think what's driving it is much of what Hans and I tried to portray which is the complexity of wells and how those wells are changing over time. And especially now with some softness in dry gas basins, you're seeing rigs being redirected quite often. And in a lot of cases, on the lower end  rigs, I think what we're seeing is a lot of those rigs are getting stacked because they're not getting moved because of the costs associated with moving them as well as just the overall performance. So we believe that if you look at the overall market in terms of available AC drive rigs, we think there's opportunities to continue to add. And again, I think the biggest challenge right now is that we're about 8 or 9 months out."

And so kind of to the first question and to your question as well, I think that there'll be a transition time and the market will absorb some of these. I mean, we've just come off -- I wouldn't read too much into our 3-rig announcement. We've just come off the holidays and kind of the turmoil around gas prices. And I think the market will take a certain amount of time to settle down. But I don’t think the longer-term trends towards the replacement cycle really get pushed to the side.

The rigs that were most likely obviously, that would be most likely to move to the Utica in the future would be rigs coming out of the Marcellus that are drilling dry gas. That's always a possibility. But we don't have any in the Utica now. We do have some existing customers that are using FlexRigs in other U.S. basins that have acreage positions in the Utica. So we wouldn't be surprised to see some activity in the Utica. I don't really have a feel for when would it be. We do have rigs working in Louisiana, FlexRigs that are capable of doing work in the Tuscaloosa Shale. Again, we got consumers that have acreage position there as well. But to my knowledge, we're not actually drilling any Tuscaloosa shale wells currently. I really can't think of anything that is new out there but I think that the point to keep thinking about is as rigs are redirected, use the Haynesville as an example, there's only almost 100 rigs working there and only for the our AC drive. There's not many mechanical rigs that you wouldn't be surprised that. But there's close to 50 SCR, a little over 50 SCR rigs running. Some of those rigs are probably capable of doing some of this work in the Eagle Ford or Permian but some of them may not be. And so that's where I think we continue to see questions or decisions made by customers and whether they're going to pay to move that rig 300, 400 or 500 miles or whether they're going to go another route with the SCR rigs."

We recorded our all-time record level of income from continuing operations. We also reached our best-ever levels for revenue and rig activity for the last quarter.
On this call, we will detail some of the drivers that enabled this performance and walk through some of our expectations going forward into 2012, including some moderation in the second quarter as daily expenses returned to a more expected levels from this quarter's significantly reduced number.
Before that discussion, let me comment for a moment just on the dire state of the natural gas market. Prices are plummeting. We see storage overflowing and an ample behind of pipe supply, so the question becomes how much downward pressure may this bring to bear upon the domestic land drilling market?
Clearly, a combination of these factors in previous cycles would have resulted in a predictable drop of the rig count. In fact, for decades, natural gas pricing was the single most important barometer for the overall rig count. Today, oil and liquids-rich gas have transformed the domestic drilling landscape. Oil-directed drilling has been on a steady march up, while dry gas drilling has lost ground.
And while the gas-directed count will even now most likely accelerate its declined trend, many expect any fall out to be partially or fully offset by displaced rigs being redirected to oil and liquids-rich targets. This transition that has been underway since the summer of 2008 and may well become more pronounced and impactful. It has been combined with the transition towards more complex well design and higher performance rig requirements. 
We would expect higher performing Tier 1 AC drive rigs will be best positioned to make the transition while older underperforming rigs will be more likely to be less sidelined, unable to secure the customer sponsorship to be mobilized and repassed through other work.
It has become type of a zero-sum game where oil and liquids-rich gas continue to gain over dry gas and where high-efficiency rigs continue to displace mechanical and SCR rigs.
We're fortunate to have a customer roster with substantial multiyear drilling inventory capable of shifting targets and taking advantage of strong oil prices. Also, we're well-positioned with the most modern and capable fleet in the industry and by having that historically small exposure in terms of rigs focused on dry gas. Less than 10% of our total active U.S. fleet is currently engaged in dry gas directed drilling on the spot market. Additional dry gas directed rigs are under term contracts. And we would anticipate some of those to transition to oil and liquids-rich targets over time as well.
We've been asked if some demand for new builds will be satisfied by higher and dislocated rigs during 2012. Our focus will remain the same, because we are coming off such a robust order book from 2011 that totaled 71 fully contracted new builds.
We continue to deliver 4 rigs each month on time and on budget. We have 40 orders remaining in the queue, approximately 30 to complete in fiscal 2012 and 10 slotted for 2013.
Some of our peers continue to have significant numbers of their announced 2012 new build programs without contracts. We would expect to see some of those deliveries delayed, and one would think their appetite for additional spec new builds would be suppressed.
In the meantime, we are solving more for 2013 as we have all but 7 slots fully contracted and spoken for in calendar 2012.
Notwithstanding the added uncertainty of the depressed natural gas prices, we remain upbeat that our business model of delivering premium drilling services will remain a strong demand and provide us with attractive opportunities in 2012 and beyond.
Before closing, let me mention that this is my first call as Chairman, having assumed that title with Dad's passing 3 weeks ago. Lots of nice things have already been written and said about him, so I won't do that here. Having worked together for 30 years, I do remember he would say there are more important things than quarterly earnings. Think more about the kind of company you want to build in the long term. And while he loved business and was a part of this company for 60 years, he would say there are more important things than being the best businessperson around. So especially for the younger analysts and investors on this call, let me pass on his encouragement to us to be folks of strong character, good parents, to make an impact on our churches and communities.
So in his memory, I'll share those thoughts for all of us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

As announced earlier today, the company reported $144 million in income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, representing an increase of almost 20% as compared to the immediately preceding quarter.
This very significant increase was mainly attributable to our U.S. land segment, where we experienced continuing improvement in pricing and activity levels and a very favorable reduction in daily rig expenses. As Hans mentioned, our U.S. land daily rig expenses are expected to return to a normalized level during the second quarter.
Nevertheless, we do expect continuing overall growth in revenue and rig activity as we transition to the second fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of an increasing number of FlexRigs in our U.S. land segment.
Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion. Our depreciation and our general and administrative expense estimates for the year also remain at approximately $380 million and $105 million, respectively.
Interest expense after capitalized interest is now expected to decrease to approximately $13 million during fiscal 2012, and our tax rate for continuing operations during the year is expected to be approximately 37%.
I will now turn the call to John Lindsay. And after John's comments, we will open the call for questions."
278341,146051261,213064,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. My comments will be on the operational results for our first fiscal quarter 2012 for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, offshore and international, as well as the outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2012. An",1534,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. My comments will be on the operational results for our first fiscal quarter 2012 for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, offshore and international, as well as the outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2012. And I'll begin with our U.S. land segment first fiscal quarter results, where U.S. land operating income increased 17% sequentially to $225 million as the U.S. land segment took delivery of 11 new build FlexRigs during the first fiscal quarter.
Revenue days increased 5% to 20,968 days, representing 228 average active rigs in the first quarter. An average of 145 rigs were active under term contracts, an average of 83 rigs were active in the stock market.
Average rig revenue per day increased by $312 to $26,861 per day. Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the first fiscal quarter was approximately 5% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market.
Average rig expenses per day decreased by $643 to $12,292 per day, primarily as a result of what we believe were only temporary reductions in maintenance and supply costs. Consequently, average rig margin per day increased by $955 to $14,569 per day. 
The outlook for U.S. land during the fiscal quarter remains positive. H&P remains the most active U.S. land contractor as we have 236 contracted rigs today and 23 idle rigs on 91% utilization rate.
Of these 236 rigs, 152 are under term contracts and 84 are in the spot market, including 82 FlexRigs. Of the rigs in the spot market, 63 are drilling in areas that typically target oil and/or liquid-rich gas.
In the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect revenue days to increase by approximately 2% to 3%. Based on current contractual commitments, an average of 152 rigs are under term contracts for the second fiscal quarter of 2012, an average of 148 rigs for the last 3 quarters of fiscal year '12 and an average of 121 rigs for fiscal year 2013.
Average rig revenue per day in the second quarter may improve slightly up to $200 per day, excluding expenses that are passed through to customers. While average rig expense per day quarter-to-quarter is difficult to predict, we expect the base level of average rig expense per day to return to a $12,700 a day range, similar to previous quarters, excluding any expense increases that would be passed through to customers.
We do expect wages to increase during the second quarter in a range of approximately $500 per day.
Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget. including the 3 additional new FlexRigs announced today, during the past 13 months, we've announced signed term contracts to build and operate a total of 74 new FlexRigs. And currently, 40 remain under construction and are being completed at the rate of approximately 4 rigs per month. The 3 newly contracted rigs are expected to be utilized in the Eagle Ford Shale, the Bakken Shale and the Permian Basin, and all 3 are FlexRig3s.
Of the 40 remaining under construction, approximately 30 are expected to be delivered in fiscal year '12 and 10 in fiscal '13. Considering a cadence of 4 rigs per month, 7 additional delivery slots remain in our calendar year '12 schedule.
A quick review of our new builds [indiscernible] of delivering FlexRigs on time was safe and efficient operations. One year ago, we had 198 rigs operating in U.S. land and we announced our new build cadence was increasing to 3 rigs per month beginning in January of '11. And we successfully delivered 3 rigs per month, from January through September, plus we increased our cadence to 4 rigs per month beginning in October.
As of today, we've delivered a total of 40 new FlexRigs since our conference call on 27 January of 2011. In addition to our rig construction group delivering rigs on time, we're also proud that the H&P rig leadership and crews on the 40 newly commissioned FlexRigs were able to deliver safety performance during the first year of operation at a rate approximately 2x better than the industry average.
Now we'll talk about the offshore segment, and our operating income increased slightly to $12.2 million. Revenue days decreased 1% sequentially to 697 days. Average rig margin per day increased by $388 to $22,171 per day.
Outlook for offshore. As of today, the company's offshore segment has 7 rigs active and 2 rigs stacked, although our rig in Trinidad is returning to the U.S. and is expected to stack at the end of the second fiscal quarter.
In the second fiscal quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to decrease by approximately 10% and expect average daily margins to decrease by 10% to 15% as some rigs transition between projects.
And now I'll turn to the international segment, where international land continues to show improvements quarter-to-quarter. Operating income increased by approximately $4.4 million sequentially to $7.9 million during the first quarter. Revenue days increased 6% to 1,729 days. Average rig margin per day increased by $1,325 to $9,015 a day.
The primary factor driving the increase in average rig margin per day was a $1.6 million retroactive one-off day rate adjustment. And on the last call, we discussed moving 2 stacked conventional rigs to access markets with higher potential work prospects, and we expected those to occur during the first fiscal quarter. However, now those rig moves are occurring in the second quarter, and today, both rigs have contracts.
Outlook for international. As of today, the company's International segment has 20 active rigs and an additional 2 rigs contracted and in transit between countries. Six rigs are active or contracted in Colombia, 5 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Of the 4 stacked rigs, 3 are located in Argentina and 1 is located in Colombia.
In the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect international land revenue days to be sequentially flat as 1 rig became idle in Colombia and the 2 rigs currently in-transit will not have a significant effect on revenue days until the third or fourth fiscal quarters.
Given the absence of the $1.6 million retroactive adjustment payment and the recent stacking of one rig in Colombia, we expect the average rig margin per day to sequentially fall by 10% to 15%.
One highlight I would like to point out regarding the international segment, included in today's 20-rig active fleet is the first FlexRig3 contracted and active in Colombia. You heard us talk previously about the impressive FlexRig4 performance in Argentina and Colombia, and this contract is a result of that exceptional performance. As you may recall, the FlexRig3 is designed to exploit deeper wells than the Flex 4 while maintaining fast rig moves and is well-suited for the majority of wells that we're going to be seeing internationally.
We believe the international market in general appears to be improving for FlexRigs in South America and the Middle East as a result of H&P's performance and safety drilling and rig moves. In each of these regions, FlexRigs have cut well cycle times by half and are delivering well counts in excess of twice what each conventional rig previously was able to provide.
So in closing, we believe the current trends are advantageous to H&P where unconventional oil and liquid-rich plays have proven to be a game changer in the U.S. land market as operators shift to drilling more complex horizontal and directional wells. This drilling complexity factor presents real challenges for all conventional rigs and lower technology product offerings.
An example of this change was commented on during our last earnings call, an industry trend where we expected several years ago may have reached the tipping point whereby legacy mechanical rigs are being retired at a higher rate than in previous cycles. Another data point to keep in mind, as well complexity increases and natural gas prices soften, our 3 largest public competitors' active fleets rely heavily on their old conventional fleets to maintain their current activity levels.
The competitors' fleet composition of active mechanical and SCR rigs ranges from 50% to 75%. In a very strong market where both oil and natural gas pricing is high, the old conventional rig fleet is at a lower risk of being stacked. But in a sub-$3 gas price environment, when dry gas drilling is losing favor, the bottom-tier-performing mechanical and SCR rigs are more likely going to be stacked and are less likely candidate to be redirected in mobilized to oil and liquid-rich basins.
H&P, on the other hand, no longer operates or markets mechanical rigs, and less than 10% of our active U.S. land fleet today is made-up of SCR rigs. The rest of H&P's active fleets in U.S. land, over 90% of it, is made up of AC drive advanced technology FlexRigs.
These market trends, along with encouraging conversations with customers for additional new builds, provide us with confidence that more opportunities for new FlexRigs will continue. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

We have quite a few conversations still ongoing with customers regarding some of those new build slots. Most of those conversations are in the calendar year 2012. Occasionally, we'll have some discussions regarding 2013. I really think what's driving it is much of what Hans and I tried to portray, which is the complexity of wells and how those wells are changing over time. And especially now, with some softness in dry gas basins, you're seeing rigs being redirected quite often. And in a lot of cases, on the lower-end  rigs, I think what we're seeing is a lot of those rigs are getting stacked because they're not getting moved because of the costs associated with moving them as well as just the overall performance. So we believe that if you look at the overall market in terms of available AC drive rigs, we think there's opportunities to continue to add. And again, I think the biggest challenge right now is that we're about 8 or 9 months out."

And so kind of to the first question and to your question as well, I think that there'll be a transition time and the market will absorb some of these. I mean, we've just come off -- I wouldn't read too much into our 3-rig announcement.

And like John mentioned in his comments, you have 180-plus rigs officially retired last year. And that, in my mind, is not a process that's work itself out. That needs to continue for years and years to come where you have that amount of attrition or potentially more so. We don't see a big imbalance occurring, and we still see a very strong preference for higher-performing rigs, and the complexity of the well designs and the type of drilling is continuing to increase.

That's always a possibility, but we don't have any in the Utica now. We do have some existing customers that are using FlexRigs in other U.S. basins that have acreage positions in the Utica. So we wouldn't be surprised to see some activity in the Utica. I don't really have a feel for when that would be. We do have rigs working in Louisiana, FlexRigs that are capable of doing work in the Tuscaloosa Shale. Again, we've got customers that have acreage positions there as well. But don't -- we are, to my knowledge, we're not actually drilling any Tuscaloosa shale wells currently. I really can't think of anything that's new out there. But I think the point to keep thinking about is as rigs are redirected, use the Haynesville as an example, there's only -- of almost 100 rigs working there, only 40 are AC drive. There's not many mechanical rigs, which you wouldn't be surprised of that. But there's close to 50 SCR, a little over 50 SCR rigs running. Some of those rigs are probably capable of doing some of this work in the Eagle Ford or Permian, but some of them may not be.

We recorded our all-time record level of income from continuing operations. We also reached our best-ever levels for revenue and rig activity for the last quarter.
On this call, we will detail some of the drivers that enabled this performance and walk through some of our expectations going forward into 2012, including some moderation in the second quarter as daily expenses returned to more expected levels from this quarter's significantly reduced number.
Before that discussion, let me comment for a moment just on the dire state of the natural gas market. Prices are plummeting. We see storage overflowing and an ample behind of pipe supply, so the question becomes how much downward pressure may this bring to bear upon the domestic land drilling market?
Clearly, a combination of these factors in previous cycles would have resulted in a predictable drop of the rig count. In fact, for decades, natural gas pricing was the single most important barometer for the overall rig count. Today, oil and liquids-rich gas have transformed the domestic drilling landscape. Oil-directed drilling has been on a steady march up, while dry gas drilling has lost ground.
And while the gas-directed count will even now most likely accelerate its decline trend, many expect any fall out to be partially or fully offset by displaced rigs being redirected to oil and liquids-rich targets. This transition that has been underway since the summer of 2008 and may well become more pronounced and impactful. It has been combined with the transition towards more complex well design and higher performance rig requirements. 
We would expect higher-performing Tier 1 AC drive rigs will be best positioned to make the transition while older underperforming rigs will be more likely to be less sidelined, unable to secure the customer sponsorship to be mobilized and recast for other work. It has become type of a zero-sum game where oil and liquids-rich gas continues to gain over dry gas and where high-efficiency rigs continue to displace mechanical and SCR rigs.
We're fortunate to have a customer roster with substantial multiyear drilling inventory capable of shifting targets and taking advantage of strong oil prices. Also, we're well-positioned with the most modern and capable fleet in the industry and by having that historically small exposure in terms of rigs focused on dry gas. Less than 10% of our total active U.S. fleet is currently engaged in dry gas directed drilling on the spot market. Additional dry gas directed rigs are under term contracts. And we would anticipate some of those to transition to oil and liquids-rich targets over time as well.
We've been asked if some demand for new builds will be satisfied by higher-end dislocated rigs during 2012. Our focus will remain the same, because we are coming off such a robust order book from 2011 that totaled 71 fully contracted new builds. We continue to deliver 4 rigs each month on time and on budget. We have 40 orders remaining in the queue, approximately 30 to complete in fiscal 2012 and 10 slotted for 2013.
Some of our peers continue to have significant numbers of their announced 2012 new build programs without contracts. We would expect to see some of those deliveries delayed, and one would think their appetite for additional spec new builds would be suppressed. In the meantime, we are solving more for 2013 as we have all but 7 slots fully contracted and spoken for in calendar 2012. Notwithstanding the added uncertainty of depressed natural gas prices, we remain upbeat that our business model of delivering premium drilling services will remain a strong demand and provide us with attractive opportunities in 2012 and beyond.
Before closing, let me mention that this is my first call as Chairman, having assumed that title with Dad's passing 3 weeks ago. Lots of nice things have already been written and said about him, so I won't do that here. Having worked together for 30 years, I do remember he would say there are more important things than quarterly earnings. Think more about the kind of company you want to build in the long term. And while he loved business and was a part of this company for 60 years, he would say there are more important things than being the best businessperson around. So especially for the younger analysts and investors on this call, let me pass on his encouragement to us to be folks of strong character, good parents, to make an impact on our churches and communities.
So in his memory, I'll share those thoughts for all of us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

As announced earlier today, the company reported $144 million in income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, representing an increase of almost 20% as compared to the immediately preceding quarter. This very significant increase was mainly attributable to our U.S. land segment, where we experienced continuing improvement in pricing and activity levels and a very favorable reduction in daily rig expenses. As Hans mentioned, our U.S. land daily rig expenses are expected to return to a normalized level during the second quarter. Nevertheless, we do expect continuing overall growth in revenue and rig activity as we transition to the second fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of an increasing number of FlexRigs in our U.S. land segment.
Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion. Our depreciation and our general and administrative expense estimates for the year also remain at approximately $380 million and $105 million, respectively. Interest expense after capitalized interest is now expected to decrease to approximately $13 million during fiscal 2012, and our tax rate for continuing operations during the year is expected to be approximately 37%.
I will now turn the call to John Lindsay. And after John's comments, we will open the call for questions."
278341,146051261,213184,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. My comments will be on the operational results for our first fiscal quarter 2012 for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, offshore and international, as well as the outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2012. An",1540,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. My comments will be on the operational results for our first fiscal quarter 2012 for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, offshore and international, as well as the outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2012. And I'll begin with our U.S. land segment first fiscal quarter results, where U.S. land operating income increased 17% sequentially to $225 million as the U.S. land segment took delivery of 11 new build FlexRigs during the first fiscal quarter.
Revenue days increased 5% to 20,968 days, representing 228 average active rigs in the first quarter. An average of 145 rigs were active under term contracts and an average of 83 rigs were active in the stock market.
Average rig revenue per day increased by $312 to $26,861 per day. Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the first fiscal quarter was approximately 5% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Average rig expenses per day decreased by $643 to $12,292 per day, primarily as a result of what we believe were only temporary reductions in maintenance and supply costs. Consequently, average rig margin per day increased by $955 to $14,569 per day. 
The outlook for U.S. land during the fiscal quarter remains positive. H&P remains the most active U.S. land contractor as we have 236 contracted rigs today and 23 idle rigs, a 91% utilization rate. Of these 236 rigs, 152 are under term contracts and 84 are in the spot market, including 82 FlexRigs. Of the rigs in the spot market, 63 are drilling in areas that typically target oil and/or liquid-rich gas.
In the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect revenue days to increase by approximately 2% to 3%. Based on current contractual commitments, an average of 152 rigs are under term contracts for the second fiscal quarter of 2012, an average of 148 rigs for the last 3 quarters of fiscal year '12 and an average of 121 rigs for fiscal year 2013.
Average rig revenue per day in the second quarter may improve slightly up to $200 per day, excluding expenses that are passed through to customers. While average rig expense per day quarter-to-quarter is difficult to predict, we expect the base level of average rig expense per day to return to a $12,700 a day range, similar to previous quarters, excluding any expense increases that would be passed through to customers. We do expect wages to increase during the second quarter in a range of approximately $500 per day.
Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget. Including the 3 additional new FlexRigs announced today, during the past 13 months, we've announced signed term contracts to build and operate a total of 74 new FlexRigs. And currently, 40 remain under construction and are being completed at the rate of approximately 4 rigs per month. The 3 newly contracted rigs are expected to be utilized in the Eagle Ford Shale, the Bakken Shale and the Permian Basin, and all 3 are FlexRig3s.
Of the 40 remaining under construction, approximately 30 are expected to be delivered in fiscal year '12 and 10 in fiscal '13. Considering a cadence of 4 rigs per month, 7 additional delivery slots remain in our calendar year '12 schedule.
A quick review of our new build success of delivering FlexRigs on time with safe and efficient operations. One year ago, we had 198 rigs operating in U.S. land and we announced our new build cadence was increasing to 3 rigs per month beginning in January of '11. And we successfully delivered 3 rigs per month, from January through September, plus we increased our cadence to 4 rigs per month beginning in October. As of today, we've delivered a total of 40 new FlexRigs since our conference call on 27 January of 2011. In addition to our rig construction group delivering rigs on time, we are also proud that the H&P rig leadership and crews on the 40 newly commissioned FlexRigs were able to deliver safety performance during the first year of operation at a rate approximately 2x better than the industry average.
Now we'll talk about the offshore segment, and our operating income increased slightly to $12.2 million. Revenue days decreased 1% sequentially to 697 days. Average rig margin per day increased by $388 to $22,171 per day.
Outlook for offshore. As of today, the company's offshore segment has 7 rigs active and 2 rigs stacked, although our rig in Trinidad is returning to the U.S. and is expected to stack at the end of the second fiscal quarter. In the second fiscal quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to decrease by approximately 10% and expect average daily margins to decrease by 10% to 15% as some rigs transition between projects.
And now I'll turn to the international segment, where international land continues to show improvements quarter-to-quarter. Operating income increased by approximately $4.4 million sequentially to $7.9 million during the first quarter. Revenue days increased 6% to 1,729 days. Average rig margin per day increased by $1,325 to $9,015 a day. The primary factor driving the increase in average rig margin per day was a $1.6 million retroactive one-off day rate adjustment. And on the last call, we discussed moving 2 stacked conventional rigs to access markets with higher potential work prospects, and we expected those to occur during the first fiscal quarter. However, now those rig moves are occurring in the second quarter, and today, both rigs have contracts.
Outlook for international. As of today, the company's International segment has 20 active rigs and an additional 2 rigs contracted and in transit between countries. Six rigs are active or contracted in Colombia, 5 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Of the 4 stacked rigs, 3 are located in Argentina and 1 is located in Colombia. In the second fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect international land revenue days to be sequentially flat as 1 rig became idle in Colombia and the 2 rigs currently in-transit will not have a significant effect on revenue days until the third or fourth fiscal quarters. Given the absence of the $1.6 million retroactive adjustment payment and the recent stacking of one rig in Colombia, we expect the average rig margin per day to sequentially fall by 10% to 15%.
One highlight I would like to point out regarding the international segment; included in today's 20-rig active fleet is the first FlexRig3 contracted and active in Colombia. You heard us talk previously about the impressive FlexRig4 performance in Argentina and Colombia, and this contract is a result of that exceptional performance. As you may recall, the FlexRig3 is designed to exploit deeper wells than the Flex 4 while maintaining fast rig moves and is well-suited for the majority of wells that we're going to be seeing internationally.
We believe the international market in general appears to be improving for FlexRigs in South America and the Middle East as a result of H&P's performance in safety, drilling and rig moves. In each of these regions, FlexRigs have cut well cycle times by half and are delivering well counts in excess of twice what each conventional rig previously was able to provide.
So in closing, we believe the current trends are advantageous to H&P where unconventional oil and liquid-rich plays have proven to be a game changer in the U.S. land market as operators shift to drilling more complex horizontal and directional wells. This drilling complexity factor presents real challenges for old conventional rigs and lower technology product offerings.
An example of this change was commented on during our last earnings call, an industry trend where we expected several years ago may have reached the tipping point whereby legacy mechanical rigs are being retired at a higher rate than in previous cycles. Another data point to keep in mind, as well complexity increases and natural gas prices soften, our 3 largest public competitors' active fleets rely heavily on their old conventional fleets to maintain their current activity levels.
The competitors' fleet composition of active mechanical and SCR rigs ranges from 50% to 75%. In a very strong market where both oil and natural gas pricing is high, the old conventional rig fleet is at a lower risk of being stacked. But in a sub-$3 gas price environment, when dry gas drilling is losing favor, the bottom-tier-performing mechanical and SCR rigs are more likely going to be stacked and are less likely – a less likely candidate to be redirected and mobilized to oil and liquid-rich basins.
H&P, on the other hand, no longer operates our markets mechanical rigs, and less than 10% of our active U.S. land fleet today is made-up of SCR rigs. The rest of H&P's active fleet in U.S. land, over 90% of it, is made up of AC drive advanced technology FlexRigs. These market trends, along with encouraging conversations with customers for additional new builds, provide us with confidence that more opportunities for new FlexRigs will continue. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

We have quite a few conversations still ongoing with customers regarding some of those new build slots. Most of those conversations are in the calendar year 2012. Occasionally, we'll have some discussions regarding 2013. I really think what's driving it is much of what Hans and I tried to portray, which is the complexity of wells and how those wells are changing over time. And especially now, with some softness in dry gas basins, you're seeing rigs being redirected quite often. And in a lot of cases, on the lower-end rigs, I think what we're seeing is a lot of those rigs are getting stacked because they're not getting moved because of the costs associated with moving them as well as just the overall performance. So we believe that if you look at the overall market in terms of available AC drive rigs, we think there's opportunities to continue to add. And again, I think the biggest challenge right now is that we're about 8 or 9 months out."

We've seen, again coming off of that downturn, the higher-performing rigs get taken up quickly and the activity has been very strong across-the-board, not just with our tier 1 rigs but with our peers. And so kind of to the first question and to your question as well, I think that there'll be a transition time and the market will absorb some of those. I mean, we've just come off -- I wouldn't read too much into our 3-rig announcement. We've just come off the holidays and kind of the turmoil around gas prices, and I think the market will take a certain amount of time to settle down.

So I think companies look at it in a fresh way, trying to project gas prices and then the combination of things.

But when you look at a fleet the size of the U.S. land fleet and the amount of activity, that to me is not a daunting number. And like John mentioned in his comments, you had 180-plus rigs officially retired last year. And that, in my mind, is not a process that's worked itself out. That needs to continue for years and years to come where you have that amount of attrition or potentially more so. We don't see a big imbalance occurring, and we still see a very strong preference for higher-performing rigs, and the complexity of the well designs and the type of drilling is continuing to increase.

That's always a possibility, but we don't have any in the Utica now. We do have some existing customers that are using FlexRigs in other U.S. basins that have acreage positions in the Utica. So we wouldn't be surprised to see some activity in the Utica. I don't really have a feel for when that would be. We do have rigs working in Louisiana, FlexRigs that are capable of doing work in the Tuscaloosa Shale. Again, we've got customers that have acreage positions there as well. But don't -- we aren’t, to my knowledge, we're not actually drilling any Tuscaloosa shale wells currently. I really can't think of anything that's new out there. But I think the point to keep thinking about is as rigs are redirected, use the Haynesville as an example, there's only – there’s almost 100 rigs working there, only 40 are AC drive. There's not many mechanical rigs, which you wouldn't be surprised at that. But there's close to 50 SCR, or a little over 50 SCR rigs running. Some of those rigs are probably capable of doing some of this work in the Eagle Ford or Permian, but some of them may not be. And so that's where I think we continue to see questions or decisions made by customers on whether they're going to pay to move that rig 300, 400 or 500 miles, or whether they're going to go another route with a newer rig."

278341,184272773,289759,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everyone.  As we discussed our quarterly results and update our outlook going forward this morning, we will tackle the issues of increased operating expenses. But first, it may be helpful to revisit a couple of things fro",846,"Thanks, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everyone.  As we discussed our quarterly results and update our outlook going forward this morning, we will tackle the issues of increased operating expenses. But first, it may be helpful to revisit a couple of things from our comments, from our previous quarterly call in January. We posed this question then of how much downward pressure would plummeting natural gas prices, overflowing storage and growing production bring to bigger on the domestic drilling market. We spoke of this transition of rigs being redirected from dry gas targets to oil and liquids-rich targets, suggesting then that the gas directed rig count will even now likely accelerate this decline trend. Well, that has certainly occurred and we now have the rest of the winter and early spring was the warmest since 1895, and gas prices proceeded to fall to 10-year lows. 
In response, customers have been more determined to rotate and redirect their rig related from rig gas efforts. As we expected, higher performing Tier 1 AC joint rigs are best positioned to make the transition, but it won't be totally seamless as it drive some transitional expenses higher. 
For those rigs under the contractors, very little impact from being redirected and transitioned. In fact, we're fortunate to have a very high percentage of our US-led active fleet, 67% currently under long-term contracts. That number remains strong over the next 2 quarters, with an average of 157 rigs under term contracts. On the other hand, for rigs on the flood market, the transition at times can involve a new customer and a new basin and incur additional cost, which could include crude retention, some mobilization cost and often additional maintenance items. So if rig experiences some idle time between customers, cost incurred we hold on to most of that crude and use the opportunity to perform needed maintenance on that rig. That said, while the accelerating rotation contributed to this quarter's surprisingly higher average daily cost, it was one of several factors. We expect that as we mentioned in our last call and then later updated for cost to return to a range somewhere to above the $13,200 per day number. That number increased to $13,826. But if you take a slightly broader perspective when comparing our first 6 months of fiscal 2012 with the last 6 months of fiscal 2011, average costs are up $244, a more modest increase and when you compare it just the last 2 quarters. 
Also some transitional cost increases, we are seeing cost pressures on several fronts. Some higher cost are driven by the steady March of a more complex and challenging drilling and faster cycle times. For example, from 2010 to 2010, our average footage per day increased over 10%. Already in 2012, we have seen average footage per day increase another 10%. So on one hand, our performance continues to improve, but at the same time, simply more is being demanded from the rig. 
We will manage the challenge in a manner that place our strength. Our success is securing premium margin that's relied on consistently reducing the customer's well cycle time. So first, we will continue to focus on safety, delivering performance efficiencies and repeatability to the customer. We have found over the years that often requires additional investment and can incur additional cost, at the same time, that approachis  not mutually exclusive to vigorously managing the cost side of our business. It inform asset-management, purchasing an innovative cost management. 
In balancing both sides, better efficiencies will win the day and will remain our primary focus. 
Going forward, we expect the average daily data to flatten and to trend slightly lower as some of the transitional issue run their course. Only 3 of the 80 rigs we have in the spot market are drilled for dry gas, and only another 3 of the dry gas directed rigs under term roll off during the third quarter. 
Turning for a minute to new builds where our manufacturing efforts continue to lead the industry as we are on track to complete 48 rigs in calendar 2012, outpacing the average of our top 3 competitors in the U.S. by approximately 2x. Since the start of the calendar year, we have previously announced an additional 9 orders to our order book, we continue to deliver rigs at a pace of 4 per month and our schedule going forward to complete 34 fully contracted rigs to customers. This strong backlog will allow us to stay busy throughout the 2012 calendar year. While we are continuing discussions with operators for new builds, those conversations are fewer and we would expect the current rig rotation will have play out for several months before we gain a better visibility into the customer's demand for 2013 delivery. We believe that the current new build cycle is far from over and we'll continue to provide this with attractive opportunities going forward. 
With that, I'm going to ask John to make his comments. Also I'm going back to Juan Pablo for comments and then to John."

As announced earlier today, the company reported $130 million in income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Although we continue to experience overall quarterly growth in revenue and rig activity, the higher",282,"Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported $130 million in income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Although we continue to experience overall quarterly growth in revenue and rig activity, the higher day rate rig expense levels mentioned by Hans contributed to its sequential decline and quarterly income from continuing operations. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to report that we do expect continued growth in revenue and rig activity as we transition to the third fiscal quarter. 
Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and our depreciation estimate for the year remains at $380 million. 
Our general and administrative expense estimate for the year have increased from $105 million to $110 million, and our interest expense estimates, which is net of capitalized interest, has been reduced from $13 million to approximately $10 million during fiscal 2012. 
Our debt-to-cap ratio is now under 9% and our liquidity level remains strong. We expect to fully fund this year's CapEx program and other scheduled outflows from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities. Nonetheless we are working on a new but smaller long-term revolving credit facility to replace the $400 million facility that expired last December. The new facility may be used for issuance of letters of credit, temporary funding or general corporate purposes during the coming years. 
Our tax rate for continuing operations for the second fiscal quarter was 36.8% and is expected to remain at approximately that level during the remaining 2 quarters of the fiscal year. 
I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay, and after John's comments, we will open the call for questions."
278341,184272773,289759,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. Divided and comments will cover the operational results for our second fiscal quarter 2012 for our 3 operating segments: Offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for the third fiscal quarter of 2012.",1480,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. Divided and comments will cover the operational results for our second fiscal quarter 2012 for our 3 operating segments: Offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for the third fiscal quarter of 2012. And I'll begin with our U.S. Land segment second fiscal quarter results where revenue increased 2% to 21,444 days, representing 236 average active rigs in the second quarter as U.S. land segment delivery at 12 new builds FlexRigs during the quarter. An average of 154 rigs were active under arm contracts an average of 82 rigs were active in the stock market. 
As the rig revenue per day increased by $764 to $27,625 per day. Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the first fiscal quarter was approximately 6% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Most of this difference was driven by the mix of riptides in each category as current pricing is similar for comparable rigs under term and in the spot market. 
Upon such many factors to consider that can influence the variability of expenses from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, as mentioned during the previous quarters call as well as in our Investor Conference Presentation filed on March 23, we expect average rig expense to increase by at least $900 per day, given extraordinarily low levels of expenses during the first quarter, combined with wage and other increases to be passed on to customers. 
The remainder of the sequential increase in daily expenses was attributable, one, to higher than usual and expenses related to high investment rig equipment like and pipe equipment; two, higher than expected labor and maintenance expenses associated with the rigs that became at least temporarily idle during the ongoing transition in the U.S.; 3, higher than expected expenses that were passed on to customers; and 4, other expenses that are indirectly associated with rig operations. 
As a result of the average rig expense per day increasing by $1,534 sequentially to $13,826, average rig margin per day decreased to by $770 to $13,799 per day from the first fiscal quarter. Consequently, U.S. land net operating income decreased 7% sequentially to $210 million as compared to the record operating income recorded in the first fiscal quarter, and this quarter is the second highest operating income on record for H&P U.S. land. 
Today, even with natural gas oversupply and weak prices, we remain positive about the long-term outlook for U.S. lands, as well as the third fiscal quarter. H&P continues to be the most active U.S. land contractor, currently with 239 rigs, 239 contracted rigs and 29 idle rigs. Of these 239 rigs, 159 are under term contract and 80 are in spot market, including 77 FlexRigs. That included in the 239 rigs are 2 recently completed new builds FlexRig3 and one existing FlexRig3 that are scheduled to transfer out of the US-led inventory international and I will share more details on that later. 
In the third fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect revenue days to increase by approximately 2%. Based on current contractual commitments, an average of 160 rigs are under term contracts for the third fiscal quarter of 2012, an average of 157 rigs for the last 2 quarters of fiscal '12 and an average of 129 rigs for fiscal 2013. 
Excluding cost that are contractually passed on to customers, we expect average rig revenue per day for our rigs that are already on term contract to increase by approximately $250 in average for the last two fiscal quarters of 2012 and by approximately $550 in average for fiscal 2013. Both of these increases are compared to the second fiscal quarter average rig revenue per day for rigs on term contracts. 
Average rig revenue per day in the third quarter may be flat to up slightly by as much as $200 per day. Third quarter spot market pricing has come under pressure, but thus far, has been flat compared to the second fiscal quarter. 
And as we think about forecasting expenses for the third fiscal quarter, we believe a reasonable, rough estimate of expenses should be in a range of $13,500 to $13,800 per day. Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget, including the 6 new builds announced on March 23, 34 rigs remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month. 
Since 2006, H&P has built a total of 209 AC drive new builds FlexRig3s, FlexRig4s and FlexRigs 5, all sponsored the current term contract. 
Now a review our offshore segment, second fiscal quarter results at 2 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico were transition between projects and our rig in Trinidad completed its contract towards the end of the second fiscal quarter and has been shifted back to the U.S. That primarily as a result of these factors are offshore operating income decreased approximately $2.4 million to $9.8 million. Revenue days decreased by 10% to 627 days and average rig margin per day decreased by $1,610 to $20,561. 
Outlook for offshore as of today, the company's offshore segment has 6 rigs active and rigs stacked, 2 of which are contracted. Of that rigs, one of the stacked we're expect to go back to work in May the second is expected to go back to work in the September quarter. 
In the third fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect offshore revenue days to be flat-to-down 5% and margins to be down 10% to 15%, as one-way rig transitions between projects and one rig begins a new project. 
The international Land segment results from the first fiscal quarter to the second fiscal quarter decreased by approximately $9 million, resulting in $1 million loss for the quarter. The primary factors driving the decrease were as follows: regular and expected expenses related to mobilizing 3 rigs between countries, all 3 of those rigs now have contract commitments; the absence of a $1.6 million retroactive day rate adjustment in Argentina, that was a positive one-off that took place during the first fiscal quarter; a $1 million currency exchange loss and miscellaneous expenses and just other expense items in general during the quarter. 
Revenue days increased 2% to 1,761 days, average rig margin per day decreased $4,131 to $4,884 per day. 
The outlook for international as of April 26, the international land segment has 20 rigs working and 2 additional rigs contracted, one of which is still in transit from Argentina to Colombia. 6 rigs were active and were contracted in Colombia, 5 in Equador, 5 in Argentina, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. As the 4 stacked rigs, 3 are located in Argentina and 1 is located in Colombia. 
As discussed earlier, 2 recently completed new build FlexRigs 3 originally contracted for the U.S. Land segment will instead be sent to the Middle East as the customers request. The first of these rigs is waiting for transport and shift contribute to the full fiscal quarter. The second rig will move in approximately 30 days and should contribute in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
The existing FlexRig 3 sourced from the U.S. Land segment has signed a letter of intent to work in shale play in Argentina and will be working for major oil company. The rig should contribute towards the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012. 
The total number of rigs for international Land segment with increased to 29 rigs once transfers are complete. Of the 29 total rigs, 16 will be FlexRigs. 
In the third fiscal quarter, we expect international land revenue days to increase by approximately 5% and margins to increase by approximately 10% to 20%. As we move beyond the disruptive effect of starting at the new rig contract, we are optimistic that the margins and is for the international Land segment will continue to increase beyond what we expect in the third fiscal quarter. 
We believe this most recent international opportunities reflects an improving market for FlexRigs in South America and the Middle East. And each of these regions over the past 2 years, FlexRigs have cut well cycle times by half and are delivering well counts in excess of twice of the competitor's conventional rig previously available for. 
In closing, we continue to witness the ongoing shift to unconventional oil and liquids-rich plays that required drilling of more complex, horizontal directional wells. And we believe that trend is advantageous to H&P. This drilling complexity factors presents operational challenges for many old conventional rigs and lower end knowledge product offerings. These market trends, along with H&P safety, people and performance advantages provide us with confidence that more opportunities for new FlexRigs will continue. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

We talked in our last call and this transition from the dry gas to the oil and liquids-rich plays has been going on since the fall of '08, and it's been somewhat orderly. I think with coming out of the winter, the psychological impact of gas prices falling below $2, I think it has focused the operators not only on accelerating that rotation, but then also stepping back, seeing how some of this plays out, seeing what the rotation of rigs will provide them opportunities for in terms of will they be able to secure tier 1 rigs. All of that has increased recently. And I think they're playing a wait and see game. In our opinion, that takes a matter of time measured in months to work itself out. But if it does ,  it does impact both to your point about are they willing to just immediately rotate into the term, it impacts that thinking. And it also think it impacts for short amount of time their decision on new builds. In a way the rotation and the uncertainty of this market becomes a competitor, if you will, for additional new build orders. But also think that it is a short term phenomena."

About 70% of those or more transitioned from a basins to another basin. So there is, again, the operator state for the mobilization cost that we had those soft cost associated will do that Hans spoke to. You compare that to previous quarters.

So whether those 3 rigs Weber the customer, I did 1 imply with the absolutely I might a little bit of detail to that, Michael. In those particular cases, I think 2 of those 3 will roll to different customers, and the pricing will be flat to slightly up on those particular contracts. The other rig, I think, will most likely stay with other customer. But part of what's going on in the background and the 2 cases where the rigs are changing hands, those rigs are actually going for a customer that has a competitor rig rolling off of term, and this rig is going to go in and fulfill that particular slot. And then I think in 1 case, that's going in on a spot weld contract and the other case, I think we're taking it and maybe one year term. But as Hans said, there's really all kinds of variations, but what we're seeing is quite a bit of interest in FlexRigs. And particularly in the Eagle Ford and Permian and somewhat in the bakken but particularly in the Eagle Ford and Permian."

It's always possible, but again, we're seeing as Hans mentioned, we're seeing a lot of demand put on the rigs, and there's still this transitioning of rigs from basin to basin, even simple transition, I think very simple, we're even seeing the rigs transition out of Eagle Ford into the Permian, I wouldn't be surprised to see some rigs in Oklahoma transition into the Permian. So I think this transitional period, I think, definitely happens through the third quarter and it may even continue into the fourth quarter. It's just hard to say right now."

As we discussed our quarterly results and update our outlook going forward this morning, we will tackle the issue of increased operating expenses. But first, it may be helpful to revisit a couple of things from",846,"Thanks, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everyone. As we discussed our quarterly results and update our outlook going forward this morning, we will tackle the issue of increased operating expenses. But first, it may be helpful to revisit a couple of things from our comments from our previous quarterly call in January. We posed this question then of how much downward pressure would plummeting natural gas prices, overflowing storage and growing production bring to bear upon the domestic land drilling market. We spoke of this transition of rigs being redirected from dry gas targets to oil and liquid-rich targets, suggesting then that the gas-directed rig count will even now likely accelerate this declining trend. Well, that has certainly occurred and we know how the rest of the winter and early spring was the warmest since 1895, and gas prices proceeded to fall to 10-year lows. 
In response, customers have been more determined to rotate and redirect their rig rosters away from dry gas efforts. As we expected, higher performing Tier 1 AC drive rigs are best positioned to make the transition, but it won't be totally seamless as it drive some transitional expenses higher. 
For those rigs under the contractors, very little impact from being redirected and transitioned. In fact, we're fortunate to have a very high percentage of our U.S. land active fleet, 67% currently under long-term contracts. That number remains strong over the next 2 quarters, with an average of 157 rigs under term contract. On the other hand, for rigs on the spot market, the transition at times can involve a new customer and a new basin and incur additional costs, which can include crew retention, some mobilization costs, and often, additional maintenance items. So if rig experiences some idle time between customers, costs incurred as we hold on to most of that crew and use the opportunity to perform needed maintenance on that rig. That said, while the accelerating rotation contributed to this quarter's surprisingly higher average daily cost, it was one of several factors. We expect that as we mentioned on our last call and then later updated cost to return to a range somewhere above the $13,200 per day number. That number increased to $13,826. But if you take a slightly broader perspective when comparing our first 6 months of fiscal 2012 with the last 6 months of fiscal 2011, average costs are up $244, a more modest increase and when you compare just the last 2 quarters. 
Also beyond some transitional cost increases, we are seeing cost pressures on several fronts. Some higher costs are driven by the steady March of more complex and challenging drilling and faster cycle times. For example, from 2010 to 2010, our average footage per day increased over 10%. Already in 2012, we have seen average footage per day increase another 10%. So on one hand, our performance continues to improve, but at the same time, simply more is being demanded from the rig. 
We will manage the challenge in a manner that plays to our strengths. Our success is securing premium margins that's relied on consistently reducing the customer's well cycle time. So first, we will continue to focus on safety, delivering performance efficiencies and repeatability to the customer. We have found over the years that, that often requires additional investment and can incur additional cost. At the same time, that approach is not mutually exclusive to vigorously managing the cost side of our business to inform asset-management, purchasing and innovative cost management. 
In balancing both sides, better efficiencies will win the day and will remain our primary focus. 
Going forward, we expect the average daily costs to flatten and trend slightly lower as some of the transitional issues run their course. Only 3 of the 80 rigs we have in the spot market are drilling for dry gas, and only another 3 of the dry-gas-directed rigs under term roll off during the third quarter. 
Turning for a minute to new builds where our manufacturing efforts continue to lead the industry as we are on track to complete 48 rigs in calendar 2012, outpacing the average of our top 3 competitors in the U.S. by approximately 2x. Since the start of the calendar year, we have previously announced an additional 9 orders to our order book, we continue to deliver rigs at a pace of 4 per month and our schedule going forward to complete 34 fully contracted rigs to customers. This strong backlog will allow us to stay busy throughout the 2012 calendar year. While we are continuing discussions with operators for new builds, those conversations are fewer and we would expect the current rig rotation have to play out for several months before we gain a better visibility into the customers' demand for 2013 delivery. We believe that the current new build cycle is far from over and we'll continue to provide this with attractive opportunities going forward. 
With that, I'm going to ask John to make his comments. Also, I'm going back to Juan Pablo for comments and then to John."

As announced earlier today, the company reported $130 million in income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Although we continue to experience overall quarterly growth in revenue and rig activity, the higher day rate rig expense levels mentioned by Hans contributed to a sequential decline and quarterly income from continuing operations. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to report that we do expect continued growth in revenue and rig activity as we transition to the third fiscal quarter. 
Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and our depreciation estimate for the year remains at $380 million. 
Our general and administrative expense estimate for the year have increased from $105 million to $110 million, and our interest expense estimates, which is net of capitalized interest, has been reduced from $13 million to approximately $10 million during fiscal 2012. 
Our debt-to-cap ratio is now under 9% and our liquidity level remains strong. We expect to fully fund this year's CapEx program and other scheduled outflows from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities. Nonetheless, we are working on a new but smaller long-term revolving credit facility to replace the $400 million facility that expired last December. The new facility may be used for issuance of letters of credit, temporary funding or other general corporate purposes during the coming years. 
Our tax rate for continuing operations for the second fiscal quarter was 36.8% and is expected to remain at approximately that level during the remaining 2 quarters of the fiscal year.

The following comments will cover the operational results for our second fiscal quarter of 2012 for our 3 operating segments: U.S. land, offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for the third fiscal",1497,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. The following comments will cover the operational results for our second fiscal quarter of 2012 for our 3 operating segments: U.S. land, offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for the third fiscal quarter of 2012. 
And I'll begin with our U.S. land segment second fiscal quarter results where revenue days increased 2% to 21,444 days, representing 236 average active rigs in the second quarter. As U.S. land segment took delivery in 12 new build FlexRigs during the quarter. An average of 154 rigs were active under term contracts, an average of 82 rigs were active in the stock market. 
Average rig revenue per day increased by $764 to $27,625 per day. Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the first fiscal quarter was approximately 6% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Most of this difference was driven by the mix of rig types in each category as current pricing is similar for comparable rigs under term and in the spot market. 
Juan touched upon many factors to consider that can influence variability of expenses from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, as mentioned during the previous quarters call as well as in our Investor Conference Presentation filed on March 23, we expect that average rig expense to increase by at least $900 per day, given extraordinarily low levels of expense during the first quarter, combined with wage and other increases to be passed on to customers. 
The remainder of the sequential increase in daily expenses was attributable, one, to higher-than-usual expenses related to high investment rig equipment like top drives and pipe handling equipment; two, higher-than-expected labor and maintenance expenses associated with rigs that became at least temporarily idle during the ongoing transition in the U.S.; three, higher-than-expected expenses that were passed on to customers; and 4, other expenses that are indirectly associated with rig operations 
As a result of the average rigging expense per day increasing by $1,534 sequentially to $13,826, average rig margin per day decreased to by $770 to $13,799 per day from the first fiscal quarter. Consequently, U.S. land operating income decreased 7% sequentially to $210 million as compared to the record operating income recorded in the first fiscal quarter. And this quarter is the second highest operating income on record for H&P U.S. Land 
Today, even with natural gas oversupply and weak prices, we remain positive about the long-term outlook for U.S. lands, as well as the third fiscal quarter. H&P continues to be the most active U.S. land contractor currently with 239 rigs, 239 contracted rigs and 29 idle rigs. Of these 239 rigs, 159 are under term contracts and 80 are in the spot market, including 77 FlexRigs. Not included in the 239 rigs are 2 recently completed new build FlexRig3s and one existing FlexRig3 that are scheduled to transfer out of the U.S. land inventory international. And I will share more details on that later. 
In the third fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect revenue days to increase by approximately 2%. Based on current contractual commitments, an average of 160 rigs are under term contracts for the third fiscal quarter of 2012, an average of 157 rigs for the last 2 quarters of fiscal '12 and an average of 129 rigs for fiscal 2013. 
Excluding costs that are contractually passed on to customers, we expect average rig revenue per day for our rigs that are already on term contract to increase by approximately $250 in average for the last two fiscal quarters of 2012 and by approximately $550 in average for fiscal 2013. Both of these increases are compared to the second fiscal quarter average rig revenue per day for rigs on term contracts. 
Average rig revenue per day in the third quarter may be flat to up slightly by as much as $200 per day. Third quarter spot market pricing has come under some pressure, but thus far, has been flat compared to the second fiscal quarter. 
And as we think about forecasting expenses for the third fiscal quarter, we believe a reasonable rough estimate of expenses should be in a range of $13,500 to $13,800 per day. Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget. Including the 6 new builds announced on March 23, 34, rigs remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month. 
Since 2006, H&P has built a total of 209 AC drive new build FlexRig3s, Flex 4s and FlexRig5s, all sponsored with a firm term contract. 
Now a review of our offshore segment second fiscal quarter results as 2 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico were transition between projects and our rig in Trinidad completed its contract towards the end of the second fiscal quarter and has been shift back to the U.S. Primarily as a result of these factors, our offshore operating income decreased approximately $2.4 million to $9.8 million. Revenue days decreased by 10% to 627 days and average rig margin per day decreased by $1,610 to $20,561. 
Outlook for offshore as of today, the company's offshore segment has 6 rigs active and 3 rigs stacked, 2 of which are contracted. Of that rigs, one of the stacked we're expect to go back to work in May and the second is expected to go back to work in the September quarter. 
In third fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect offshore revenue days to be flat-to-down 5% and margins to be down 10% to 15%, as one-way rig transitions between projects and one rig begins a new project. 
The international land segment results from the first fiscal quarter to the second fiscal quarter decrease by approximately $9 million, resulting in a $1 million loss for the quarter. The primary factors driving the decrease were as follows: regular and expected expenses related to mobilizing 3 rigs between countries, all 3 of those rigs now have contract commitments; the absence of a $1.6 million retroactive day rate adjustment in Argentina that was a positive one-off that took place during the first fiscal quarter; a $1 million currency exchange loss and miscellaneous expenses and just other expense items in general during the quarter. 
Revenue days increased to 2% to 1,761 days. Average rig margin per day decreased $4,131 to $4,884 per day. 
The outlook for international as of April 26, the international land segment has 20 rigs working and 2 additional rigs contracted, one of which is still in transit from Argentina to Colombia. 6 rigs were active and were contracted in Colombia, 5 in Equador, 5 in Argentina, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Of the 4 stacked rigs, 3 are located in Argentina and 1 is located in Colombia. 
As discussed earlier, 2 recently completed new build FlexRigs3s originally contracted for the U.S. land segment will instead be sent to the Middle East at the customer's request. The first of these rigs is readying for transport and should contribute to the fourth fiscal quarter. The second rig will move in approximately 30 days and should contribute in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
The existing FlexRig3 sourced from the U.S. land segment has signed a letter of intent to work in shale play in the Neuquén Basin shale play in Argentina and will be working for a major oil company. The rig should contribute toward the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012. 
The total number of rigs for international land segment will increase to 29 rigs once the transfers are complete. Of the 29 total rigs, 16 will be FlexRigs. 
In the third fiscal quarter, we expect international land revenue days to increase by approximately 5% and margins to increase by approximately 10% to 20%. As we move beyond the disruptive effect of starting up the new rig contracts, we are optimistic that the margins and days [ph] for the international land segment will continue to increase beyond what we expect in the third fiscal quarter. 
We believe this most recent international opportunities reflect an improving market for FlexRigs in South America and the Middle East. And each of these regions over the past 2 years, FlexRigs have cut well cycle times by half and are delivering well counts in excess of twice of the competitor conventional rig previously available for us [ph] . 
In closing, we continue to witness the ongoing shift to unconventional oil and liquid-rich plays that require drilling of more complex, horizontal directional wells. And we believe that trend is advantageous to H&P. This drilling complexity fact [ph] presents operational challenges for many old conventional rigs and lower-end technology product offerings. These market trends, along with H&P safety, people and performance advantages, provide us with confidence that more opportunities for new FlexRigs will continue. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

We talked in our last call and this transition from the dry gas to the oil and liquids-rich plays has been going on since the fall of '08, and it's been somewhat orderly. I think with coming out of the winter, the psychological impact of gas prices falling below $2, I think it has focused the operators not only on accelerating that rotation, but then also stepping back, seeing how some of this plays out, seeing what the rotation of rigs will provide them opportunities for, meaning in terms of will they be able to secure Tier 1 rigs. All of that has increased recently. And I think they're playing a wait-and-see game. In our opinion, that takes a matter of time measured in months to work itself out. But it does  impact both to your point about are they willing to just immediately rotate into term. It impacts that thinking. And it also I think it impacts for a short amount of time their decision on new builds. In a way, the rotation and the uncertainty of this market becomes a competitor, if you will, for additional new build orders. We also think that is a short term phenomena."

The transitional cost that Hans talked about, that was a big portion. We had about 11 -- 11, 12 rigs changed hands in the quarter, meaning from one customer to another. About 70% of those or more transitioned from a basin to another basin. So there's -- again, the operator is paying for the mobilization cost but we had those soft costs associated with that, that Hans spoke to. You compare that to previous quarters, we had, again, kind of that churn, if you will, from customer to customer, similar type numbers but a very small percentage of those went basin to basin, so you have a much less expenses and much less time kind of waiting between locations, if you know what I mean. So that drove that. There's a certain aspect to just other higher cost that are passed through to the customer.

And I think the other 2 rigs will have an outlook for activity. They're bigger rigs, so they're not rigs that would be directed towards the shale play in the Neuquén area. I think we do have opportunity to work in the Neuquén area on deeper type of activity. So I think the rigs, it make sense for them to be there right now as evidenced by we did move a 30,000-horsepower rig out of Argentina. It's going into Colombia, and it does have a contract. So if we are successful in getting a contract outside of Argentina, then, yes, we'll move the rig out of there. I mean, we're overall pretty excited about Argentina and the opportunity there and excited to have a FlexRig going in down. I think it will start off as a nice trend for us. On the cost, again, we're all disappointed in the high expense that we have for the quarter. But it isn't unusual to have some pretty high variation just on a quarter-to-quarter base. And I think for us to talk about 13 2 right now is a little unreasonable. Again, we're kind of thinking this 13 5 to 13 8 range and that's were, were hoping to get. I haven't really started thinking about fourth quarter yes. It's always possible, but again, we're seeing as Hans mentioned, we're seeing a lot of demand put on the rigs, and there's still this transitioning of rigs from basin to basin, even simple transition, I think very simple, we're even seeing the rigs transition out of Eagle Ford into the Permian. I wouldn't be surprised to see some rigs in Oklahoma transition into the Permian. So I think this transitional period, I think, definitely happens through the third quarter and it may even continue into the fourth quarter. It's just hard to say right now."

As we discuss our quarterly results and update our outlook going forward this morning, we will tackle the issue of increased operating expenses. But first, it may be helpful to revisit a couple of theme from our",851,"Thanks, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everyone. As we discuss our quarterly results and update our outlook going forward this morning, we will tackle the issue of increased operating expenses. But first, it may be helpful to revisit a couple of theme from our comments from our previous quarterly call in January. We posed this question then of how much downward pressure would plummeting natural gas prices, overflowing storage and growing production bring to bear upon the domestic land drilling market. We spoke of this transition of rigs being redirected from dry gas targets to oil and liquid-rich targets, suggesting then that the gas-directed rig count will even now likely accelerate its decline trend. Well, that has certainly occurred and we know how the rest of the winter and early spring was the warmest since 1895, and gas prices proceeded to fall to 10-year lows. 
In response, customers have been more determined to rotate and redirect their rig rosters away from dry gas efforts. As we expected, higher performing Tier 1 AC drive rigs are best positioned to make the transition, but it won't be totally seamless as it drive some transitional expenses higher. 
For those rigs under the contractors, very little impact from being redirected and transitioned. In fact, we're fortunate to have a very high percentage of our U.S. land active fleet, 67%, currently under long-term contracts. That number remains strong over the next 2 quarters, with an average of 157 rigs under term contract. On the other hand, for rigs on the spot market, the transition at times can involve a new customer and a new basin and incur additional costs, which can include crew retention, some mobilization costs, and often, additional maintenance items. So if a rig experiences some idle time between customers, costs are incurred as we hold on to most of that crew and use the opportunity to perform needed maintenance on that rig. That said, while the accelerating rotation contributed to this quarter's surprisingly higher average daily cost, it was one of several factors. We expect that as we mentioned on our last call and then later updated, costs to return to a range somewhere above the $13,200 per day number. That number increased to $13,826. But if you take a slightly broader perspective when comparing our first 6 months of fiscal 2012 with the last 6 months of fiscal 2011, average costs are up $244, a more modest increase than when you compare just the last 2 quarters. 
Also beyond some transitional cost increases, we are seeing cost pressures on several fronts. Some higher costs are driven by the steady march of more complex and challenging drilling and faster cycle times. For example, from 2010 to 2011, our average footage per day increased over 10%. Already in 2012, we have seen average footage per day increase another 10%. So on one hand, our performance continues to improve, but at the same time, simply more is being demanded from the rig. 
We will manage the challenge in a manner that plays to our strengths. Our success is securing premium margins that's relied on consistently reducing the customer's well cycle time. So first, we will continue to focus on safety, delivering performance efficiencies and repeatability to the customer. We have found over the years that, that often requires additional investment and can incur additional cost. At the same time, that approach is not mutually exclusive to vigorously managing the cost side of our business to inform asset management, purchasing and innovative cost management. 
In balancing both sides, better efficiencies will win the day and will remain our primary focus. 
Going forward, we expect the average daily costs to flatten and trend slightly lower as some of the transitional issues run their course. Only 3 of the 80 rigs we have in the spot market are drilling for dry gas, and only another 3 of the dry-gas-directed rigs under term roll off during the third quarter. 
Turning for a minute to new builds where our manufacturing efforts continue to lead the industry as we are on track to complete 48 rigs in calendar 2012, outpacing the average of our top 3 competitors in the U.S. by approximately 2x. Since the start of the calendar year, we have previously announced an additional 9 orders to our order book, we continue to deliver rigs at a pace of 4 per month and our schedule going forward to complete 34 fully contracted rigs to customers. This strong backlog will allow us to stay busy throughout the 2012 calendar year. While we are continuing discussions with operators for new builds, those conversations are fewer and we would expect the current rig rotation to have to play out for several months before we gain a better visibility into the customers' demand for 2013 deliveries. We believe that the current new build cycle is far from over and will continue to provide us with attractive opportunities going forward. 
With that, I'm going to ask John to make his comments. I'm sorry, I'm going back to Juan Pablo for comments and then to John."

As announced earlier today, the company reported $130 million in income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Although we continue to experience overall quarterly growth in revenue and rig activity, the higher daily rig expense levels mentioned by Hans contributed to a sequential decline in quarterly income from continuing operations. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to report that we do expect continued growth in revenue and rig activity as we transition to the third fiscal quarter. 
Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and our depreciation estimate for the year remains at $380 million. 
Our general and administrative expense estimate for the year has increased from $105 million to $110 million, and our interest expense estimates, which is net of capitalized interest, has been reduced from $13 million to approximately $10 million during fiscal 2012. 
Our debt-to-cap ratio is now under 9% and our liquidity level remains strong. We expect to fully fund this year's CapEx program and other scheduled outflows from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities. Nonetheless, we are working on a new but smaller long-term revolving credit facility to replace the $400 million facility that expired last December. The new facility may be used for issuance of letters of credit, temporary funding or other general corporate purposes during the coming years. 
Our tax rate for continuing operations for the second fiscal quarter was 36.8% and is expected to remain at approximately that level during the remaining 2 quarters of the fiscal year. 
I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay, and after John's comments, we will open the call for questions."
278341,184272773,290495,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. The following comments will cover the operational results for our second fiscal quarter of 2012 for our 3 operating segments: U.S. land, offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for the third fiscal",1496,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. The following comments will cover the operational results for our second fiscal quarter of 2012 for our 3 operating segments: U.S. land, offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for the third fiscal quarter of 2012. 
And I'll begin with our U.S. land segment second fiscal quarter results where revenue days increased 2% to 21,444 days, representing 236 average active rigs in the second quarter. As U.S. land segment took delivery of 12 new build FlexRigs during the quarter. An average of 154 rigs were active under term contracts, an average of 82 rigs were active in the spot market. 
Average rig revenue per day increased by $764 to $27,625 per day. Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the first fiscal quarter was approximately 6% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Most of this difference was driven by the mix of rig types in each category as current pricing is similar for comparable rigs under term and in the spot market. 
Hans touched upon many factors to consider that can influence variability of expenses from quarter to quarter. In addition, as mentioned during the previous quarter's call as well as in our Investor Conference Presentation filed on March 23, we expected average rig expense to increase by at least $900 per day, given extraordinarily low levels of expense during the first quarter, combined with wage and other increases to be passed on to customers. 
The remainder of the sequential increase in daily expenses was attributable, one, to higher-than-usual expenses related to high investment rig equipment like top drives and pipe-handling equipment; two, higher-than-expected labor and maintenance expenses associated with rigs that became at least temporarily idle during the ongoing transition in the U.S.; three, higher-than-expected expenses that were passed on to customers; and 4, other expenses that are indirectly associated with rig operations. 
As a result of the average rigging expense per day increasing by $1,534 sequentially to $13,826, average rig margin per day decreased by $770 to $13,799 per day from the first fiscal quarter. Consequently, U.S. land operating income decreased 7% sequentially to $210 million as compared to the record operating income recorded in the first fiscal quarter. And this quarter is the second highest operating income on record for H&P U.S. Land 
To today, even with natural gas oversupply and weak prices, we remain positive about the long-term outlook for U.S. lands, as well as the third fiscal quarter. H&P continues to be the most active U.S. land contractor currently with 239 rigs, 239 contracted rigs and 29 idle rigs. Of these 239 rigs, 159 are under term contracts and 80 are in the spot market, including 77 FlexRigs. Not included in the 239 rigs are 2 recently completed new build FlexRig3s and one existing FlexRig3 that are scheduled to transfer out of the U.S. land inventory to international. And I will share more details on that later. 
In the third fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect revenue days to increase by approximately 2%. Based on current contractual commitments, an average of 160 rigs are under term contracts for the third fiscal quarter of 2012, an average of 157 rigs for the last 2 quarters of fiscal '12 and an average of 129 rigs for fiscal 2013. 
Excluding costs that are contractually passed on to customers, we expect average rig revenue per day for our rigs that are already on term contracts to increase by approximately $250 in average for the last 2 fiscal quarters of 2012 and by approximately $550 in average for fiscal 2013. Both of these increases are compared to the second fiscal quarter average rig revenue per day for rigs on term contracts. 
Average rig revenue per day in the third quarter may be flat to up slightly by as much as $200 per day. Third quarter spot market pricing has come under some pressure, but thus far, has been flat compared to the second fiscal quarter. 
And as we think about forecasting expenses for the third fiscal quarter, we believe a reasonable rough estimate of expenses should be in a range of $13,500 to $13,800 per day. Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget. Including the 6 new builds announced on March 23, 34 rigs remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month. 
Since 2006, H&P has built a total of 209 AC drive new build FlexRig3s, Flex 4s and FlexRig5s, all sponsored with a firm term contract. 
Now a review of our offshore segment second fiscal quarter results as 2 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico were in transition between projects and our rig in Trinidad completed its contract toward the end of the second fiscal quarter and has been shipped back to the U.S. Primarily as a result of these factors, our offshore operating income decreased approximately $2.4 million to $9.8 million. Revenue days decreased by 10% to 627 days and average rig margin per day decreased by $1,610 to $20,561. 
Outlook for offshore as of today, the company's offshore segment has 6 rigs active and 3 rigs stacked, 2 of which are contracted. Of the stacked rigs, one of the stacked rigs is expected to go back to work in May and the second is expected to go back to work in the September quarter. 
In third fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect offshore revenue days to be flat to down 5% and margins to be down 10% to 15%, as one-way rig transitions between projects and one rig begins a new project. 
The international land segment results from the first fiscal quarter to the second fiscal quarter decreased by approximately $9 million, resulting in a $1 million loss for the quarter. The primary factors driving the decrease were as follows: regular and expected expenses related to mobilizing 3 rigs between countries, all 3 of those rigs now have contract commitments; the absence of a $1.6 million retroactive day rate adjustment in Argentina that was a positive one-off that took place during the first fiscal quarter; a $1 million currency exchange loss and miscellaneous expenses and just other expense items in general during the quarter. 
Revenue days increased 2% to 1,761 days. Average rig margin per day decreased $4,131 to $4,884 per day. 
The outlook for international as of April 26, the international land segment has 20 rigs working and 2 additional rigs contracted, one of which is still in transit from Argentina to Colombia. 6 rigs were active and were contracted in Colombia, 5 in Equador, 5 in Argentina, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Of the 4 stacked rigs, 3 are located in Argentina and 1 is located in Colombia. 
As discussed earlier, 2 recently completed new build FlexRigs3s originally contracted for the U.S. land segment will instead be sent to the Middle East at the customer's request. The first of these rigs is readying for transport and should contribute to the fourth fiscal quarter. The second rig will move in approximately 30 days and should contribute in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
The existing FlexRig3 sourced from the U.S. land segment has signed a letter of intent to work in the Neuquen Basin shale play in Argentina and will be working for a major oil company. The rig should contribute toward the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012. 
The total number of rigs for international land segment will increase to 29 rigs once the transfers are complete. Of the 29 total rigs, 16 will be FlexRigs. 
In the third fiscal quarter, we expect international land revenue days to increase by approximately 5% and margins to increase by approximately 10% to 20%. As we move beyond the disruptive effect of starting up the new rig contracts, we are optimistic that the margins and days for the international land segment will continue to increase beyond what we expect in the third fiscal quarter. 
We believe these most recent international opportunities reflect an improving market for FlexRigs in South America and the Middle East. In each of these regions over the past 2 years, FlexRigs have cut well cycle times by half and are delivering well counts in excess of twice of the competitor conventional rig previously was able to provide. 
In closing, we continue to witness the ongoing shift to unconventional oil and liquid-rich plays that require drilling of more complex, horizontal directional wells. And we believe that trend is advantageous to H&P. This drilling complexity factor presents operational challenges for many old, conventional rigs and lower-end technology product offerings. These market trends, along with H&P safety, people and performance advantages, provide us with confidence that more opportunities for new FlexRigs will continue. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

We talked in our last call and this transition from the dry gas to the oil and liquids-rich plays has been going on since the fall of '08, and it's been somewhat orderly. I think with coming out of the winter, the psychological impact of gas prices falling below $2, I think it has focused the operators not only on accelerating that rotation, but then also stepping back, seeing how some of this plays out, seeing what the rotation of rigs will provide them opportunities for, meaning in terms of will they be able to secure Tier 1 rigs. All of that has increased recently. And I think they're playing a wait-and-see game. In our opinion, that takes a matter of time measured in months to work itself out. But it does impact both to your point about are they willing to just immediately rotate into term. It impacts that thinking. And I also think it impacts for a short amount of time their decision on new builds. In a way, the rotation and the uncertainty of this market becomes a competitor, if you will, for additional new build orders. We also think that is a short-term phenomena."

We're confident that because of the amount of opportunities from the oil and liquids-rich plays and the amount of drilling inventory that this is a temporary and will end up being a shorter kind of lull in the cycle. But you just think about our approach and why we have a confidence that the AC drive rigs are going to stay active and in high demand. That's based on the efficiencies and the reduced cycle times we provide. And so when we have a customer that says, ""Gosh, I'm going to slow down or I'm going to turn a rig loose and we're contracting, keeping that rig active and contracting it with a new customer. We're going to keep the crews intact, we're going to look for opportunities. Hey, let's -- we've got a few days of idle time. If this rig needs to be spruced up some and have some money to spent on it, we're going to do that. And it's, again, part of a strategy of having a premium offerings and premium performance.

That was up $900 from the previous quarter. Again, the previous quarter, as you know, was very low. The additional $600 was a combination of things, kind of like I laid out. There's a portion of that, that is associated with top drives and just higher capital cost equipment, pipe-handling equipment, things like that, that were substantially higher in this quarter than usual. The transitional costs that Hans talked about, that was a big portion. We had about 11 -- 11, 12 rigs change hands in the quarter, meaning from one customer to another. About 70% of those or more transitioned from a basin to another basin. So there's -- again, the operator is paying for the mobilization cost but we have those soft costs associated with it that Hans spoke to. You compare that to previous quarters, we had, again, kind of that churn, if you will, from customer to customer, similar type numbers but a very small percentage of those went basin to basin, so you have a much less expenses and much less time kind of waiting between locations, if you know what I mean. So that drove that. There's a certain aspect to just other higher costs that are passed through to the customer.

And there are not that many different ways to do that, it's either through share repurchase or higher dividend streams. So those are things that we'll look at. What we're hoping to see is this replacement cycle providing opportunities where we can continue to build and provide the kind of attractive returns that we've been able to historically secure for that.

I think there's a likelihood that at least one of those rigs will go back to work fairly soon. It's not going to impact third quarter, maybe not even the fourth. But I think it will go to work. And I think the other 2 rigs will have an outlook for activity. They're bigger rigs, so they're not rigs that would be directed towards the shale play in the Neuquen area. I think they do have opportunity to work in the Neuquen area on deeper type of activity. So I think the rigs, it make sense for them to be there right now as evidenced by we did move a 30,000-horsepower rig out of Argentina. It's going into Colombia, and it does have a contract. So if we are successful in getting a contract outside of Argentina, then, yes, we'll move the rig out of there. I mean, we're overall pretty excited about Argentina and the opportunity there and excited to have a FlexRig going in down there. I think it will start off as a nice trend for us. On the cost, again, we're all disappointed in the high expense that we had for the quarter. But it isn't unusual to have some pretty high variation just on a quarter-to-quarter base. And I think for us to talk about $13,200 right now is a little unreasonable. Again, we're kind of thinking this $13,500 to $13,800 range and that's where we're hoping to get. I haven't really started thinking about fourth quarter yet. It's always possible, but again, we're seeing, as Hans mentioned, we're seeing a lot of demand put on the rigs, and there's still this transitioning of rigs from basin to basin, even simple transition, they seem very simple, we're even seeing the rigs transition out of Eagle Ford into the Permian. I wouldn't be surprised to see some rigs in Oklahoma transition into the Permian. So I think this transitional period, I think, definitely happens through the third quarter and it may even continue into the fourth quarter. It's just hard to say right now."

As we discuss our quarterly results and update our outlook going forward this morning, we will tackle the issue of increased operating expenses. But first, it may be helpful to revisit a couple of theme from our",851,"Thanks, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everyone. As we discuss our quarterly results and update our outlook going forward this morning, we will tackle the issue of increased operating expenses. But first, it may be helpful to revisit a couple of theme from our comments from our previous quarterly call in January. We posed this question then of how much downward pressure would plummeting natural gas prices, overflowing storage and growing production bring to bear upon the domestic land drilling market. We spoke of this transition of rigs being redirected from dry gas targets to oil and liquid-rich targets, suggesting then that the gas-directed rig count will even now likely accelerate its decline trend. Well, that has certainly occurred and we know how the rest of the winter and early spring was the warmest since 1895, and gas prices proceeded to fall to 10-year lows. 
In response, customers have been more determined to rotate and redirect their rig rosters away from dry gas efforts. As we expected, higher performing Tier 1 AC drive rigs are best positioned to make the transition, but it won't be totally seamless as it drive some transitional expenses higher. 
For those rigs under the contractors, very little impact from being redirected and transitioned. In fact, we're fortunate to have a very high percentage of our U.S. land active fleet, 67%, currently under long-term contracts. That number remains strong over the next 2 quarters, with an average of 157 rigs under term contract. On the other hand, for rigs on the spot market, the transition at times can involve a new customer and a new basin and incur additional costs, which can include crew retention, some mobilization costs, and often, additional maintenance items. So if a rig experiences some idle time between customers, costs are incurred as we hold on to most of that crew and use the opportunity to perform needed maintenance on that rig. That said, while the accelerating rotation contributed to this quarter's surprisingly higher average daily cost, it was one of several factors. We expect that as we mentioned on our last call and then later updated, costs to return to a range somewhere above the $13,200 per day number. That number increased to $13,826. But if you take a slightly broader perspective when comparing our first 6 months of fiscal 2012 with the last 6 months of fiscal 2011, average costs are up $244, a more modest increase than when you compare just the last 2 quarters. 
Also beyond some transitional cost increases, we are seeing cost pressures on several fronts. Some higher costs are driven by the steady march of more complex and challenging drilling and faster cycle times. For example, from 2010 to 2011, our average footage per day increased over 10%. Already in 2012, we have seen average footage per day increase another 10%. So on one hand, our performance continues to improve, but at the same time, simply more is being demanded from the rig. 
We will manage the challenge in a manner that plays to our strengths. Our success is securing premium margins that's relied on consistently reducing the customer's well cycle time. So first, we will continue to focus on safety, delivering performance efficiencies and repeatability to the customer. We have found over the years that, that often requires additional investment and can incur additional cost. At the same time, that approach is not mutually exclusive to vigorously managing the cost side of our business to inform asset management, purchasing and innovative cost management. 
In balancing both sides, better efficiencies will win the day and will remain our primary focus. 
Going forward, we expect the average daily costs to flatten and trend slightly lower as some of the transitional issues run their course. Only 3 of the 80 rigs we have in the spot market are drilling for dry gas, and only another 3 of the dry-gas-directed rigs under term roll off during the third quarter. 
Turning for a minute to new builds where our manufacturing efforts continue to lead the industry as we are on track to complete 48 rigs in calendar 2012, outpacing the average of our top 3 competitors in the U.S. by approximately 2x. Since the start of the calendar year, we have previously announced an additional 9 orders to our order book, we continue to deliver rigs at a pace of 4 per month and our schedule going forward to complete 34 fully contracted rigs to customers. This strong backlog will allow us to stay busy throughout the 2012 calendar year. While we are continuing discussions with operators for new builds, those conversations are fewer and we would expect the current rig rotation to have to play out for several months before we gain a better visibility into the customers' demand for 2013 deliveries. We believe that the current new build cycle is far from over and will continue to provide us with attractive opportunities going forward. 
With that, I'm going to ask John to make his comments. I'm sorry, I'm going back to Juan Pablo for comments and then to John."

As announced earlier today, the company reported $130 million in income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Although we continue to experience overall quarterly growth in revenue and rig activity, the higher daily rig expense levels mentioned by Hans contributed to a sequential decline in quarterly income from continuing operations. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to report that we do expect continued growth in revenue and rig activity as we transition to the third fiscal quarter. 
Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and our depreciation estimate for the year remains at $380 million. 
Our general and administrative expense estimate for the year has increased from $105 million to $110 million, and our interest expense estimates, which is net of capitalized interest, has been reduced from $13 million to approximately $10 million during fiscal 2012. 
Our debt-to-cap ratio is now under 9% and our liquidity level remains strong. We expect to fully fund this year's CapEx program and other scheduled outflows from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities. Nonetheless, we are working on a new but smaller long-term revolving credit facility to replace the $400 million facility that expired last December. The new facility may be used for issuance of letters of credit, temporary funding or other general corporate purposes during the coming years. 
Our tax rate for continuing operations for the second fiscal quarter was 36.8% and is expected to remain at approximately that level during the remaining 2 quarters of the fiscal year. 
I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay, and after John's comments, we will open the call for questions."
278341,184272773,290605,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. The following comments will cover the operational results for our second fiscal quarter of 2012 for our 3 operating segments: U.S. land, offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for the third fiscal",1495,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning. The following comments will cover the operational results for our second fiscal quarter of 2012 for our 3 operating segments: U.S. land, offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for the third fiscal quarter of 2012. 
And I'll begin with our U.S. land segment second fiscal quarter results where revenue days increased 2% to 21,444 days, representing 236 average active rigs in the second quarter. As U.S. land segment took delivery of 12 new build FlexRigs during the quarter. An average of 154 rigs were active under term contracts, an average of 82 rigs were active in the spot market. 
Average rig revenue per day increased by $764 to $27,625 per day. Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the first fiscal quarter was approximately 6% higher than average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Most of this difference was driven by the mix of rig types in each category as current pricing is similar for comparable rigs under term and in the spot market. 
Hans touched upon many factors to consider that can influence variability of expenses from quarter to quarter. In addition, as mentioned during the previous quarter's call as well as in our Investor Conference Presentation filed on March 23, we expected average rig expense to increase by at least $900 per day, given extraordinarily low levels of expense during the first quarter, combined with wage and other increases to be passed on to customers. 
The remainder of the sequential increase in daily expenses was attributable, one, to higher-than-usual expenses related to high investment rig equipment like top drives and pipe-handling equipment; two, higher-than-expected labor and maintenance expenses associated with rigs that became at least temporarily idle during the ongoing transition in the U.S.; three, higher-than-expected expenses that were passed on to customers; and 4, other expenses that are indirectly associated with rig operations. 
As a result of the average rigging expense per day increasing by $1,534 sequentially to $13,826, average rig margin per day decreased by $770 to $13,799 per day from the first fiscal quarter. Consequently, U.S. land operating income decreased 7% sequentially to $210 million as compared to the record operating income recorded in the first fiscal quarter. And this quarter is the second highest operating income on record for H&P U.S. land. 
Today, even with natural gas oversupply and weak prices, we remain positive about the long-term outlook for U.S. lands, as well as the third fiscal quarter. H&P continues to be the most active U.S. land contractor currently with 239 rigs, 239 contracted rigs and 29 idle rigs. Of these 239 rigs, 159 are under term contracts and 80 are in the spot market, including 77 FlexRigs. Not included in the 239 rigs are 2 recently completed new build FlexRig3s and one existing FlexRig3 that are scheduled to transfer out of the U.S. land inventory to international. And I will share more details on that later. 
In the third fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect revenue days to increase by approximately 2%. Based on current contractual commitments, an average of 160 rigs are under term contracts for the third fiscal quarter of 2012, an average of 157 rigs for the last 2 quarters of fiscal '12 and an average of 129 rigs for fiscal 2013. 
Excluding costs that are contractually passed on to customers, we expect average rig revenue per day for our rigs that are already on term contracts to increase by approximately $250 in average for the last 2 fiscal quarters of 2012 and by approximately $550 in average for fiscal 2013. Both of these increases are compared to the second fiscal quarter average rig revenue per day for rigs on term contracts. 
Average rig revenue per day in the third quarter may be flat to up slightly by as much as $200 per day. Third quarter spot market pricing has come under some pressure, but thus far, has been flat compared to the second fiscal quarter. 
And as we think about forecasting expenses for the third fiscal quarter, we believe a reasonable rough estimate of expenses should be in a range of $13,500 to $13,800 per day. Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget. Including the 6 new builds announced on March 23, 34 rigs remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month. 
Since 2006, H&P has built a total of 209 AC drive new build FlexRig3s, Flex 4s and FlexRig5s, all sponsored with a firm term contract. 
Now a review of our offshore segment second fiscal quarter results as 2 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico were in transition between projects and our rig in Trinidad completed its contract toward the end of the second fiscal quarter and has been shipped back to the U.S. Primarily as a result of these factors, our offshore operating income decreased approximately $2.4 million to $9.8 million. Revenue days decreased by 10% to 627 days and average rig margin per day decreased by $1,610 to $20,561. 
Outlook for offshore as of today, the company's offshore segment has 6 rigs active and 3 rigs stacked, 2 of which are contracted. Of the stacked rigs, one of the stacked rigs is expected to go back to work in May and the second is expected to go back to work in the September quarter. 
In third fiscal quarter of 2012, we expect offshore revenue days to be flat to down 5% and margins to be down 10% to 15%, as one-way rig transitions between projects and one rig begins a new project. 
The international land segment results from the first fiscal quarter to the second fiscal quarter decreased by approximately $9 million, resulting in a $1 million loss for the quarter. The primary factors driving the decrease were as follows: regular and expected expenses related to mobilizing 3 rigs between countries, all 3 of those rigs now have contract commitments; the absence of a $1.6 million retroactive day rate adjustment in Argentina that was a positive one-off that took place during the first fiscal quarter; a $1 million currency exchange loss and miscellaneous expenses and just other expense items in general during the quarter. 
Revenue days increased 2% to 1,761 days. Average rig margin per day decreased $4,131 to $4,884 per day. 
The outlook for international as of April 26, the international land segment has 20 rigs working and 2 additional rigs contracted, one of which is still in transit from Argentina to Colombia. 6 rigs were active and were contracted in Colombia, 5 in Ecuador, 5 in Argentina, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in Tunisia. Of the 4 stacked rigs, 3 are located in Argentina and 1 is located in Colombia. 
As discussed earlier, 2 recently completed new build FlexRigs3s originally contracted for the U.S. land segment will instead be sent to the Middle East at the customer's request. The first of these rigs is readying for transport and should contribute to the fourth fiscal quarter. The second rig will move in approximately 30 days and should contribute in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
The existing FlexRig3 sourced from the U.S. land segment has signed a letter of intent to work in the Neuquen Basin shale play in Argentina and will be working for a major oil company. The rig should contribute toward the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012. 
The total number of rigs for international land segment will increase to 29 rigs once the transfers are complete. Of the 29 total rigs, 16 will be FlexRigs. 
In the third fiscal quarter, we expect international land revenue days to increase by approximately 5% and margins to increase by approximately 10% to 20%. As we move beyond the disruptive effect of starting up the new rig contracts, we are optimistic that the margins and days for the international land segment will continue to increase beyond what we expect in the third fiscal quarter. 
We believe these most recent international opportunities reflect an improving market for FlexRigs in South America and the Middle East. In each of these regions over the past 2 years, FlexRigs have cut well cycle times by half and are delivering well counts in excess of twice of the competitor conventional rig previously was able to provide. 
In closing, we continue to witness the ongoing shift to unconventional oil and liquid-rich plays that require drilling of more complex, horizontal directional wells. And we believe that trend is advantageous to H&P. This drilling complexity factor presents operational challenges for many old, conventional rigs and lower-end technology product offerings. These market trends, along with H&P safety, people and performance advantages, provide us with confidence that more opportunities for new FlexRigs will continue. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

I think with coming out of the winter, the psychological impact of gas prices falling below $2, I think it has focused the operators not only on accelerating that rotation, but then also stepping back, seeing how some of this plays out, seeing what the rotation of rigs will provide them opportunities for, meaning in terms of will they be able to secure Tier 1 rigs. All of that has increased recently. And I think they're playing a wait-and-see game. In our opinion, that takes a matter of time measured in months to work itself out. But it does impact both to your point about are they willing to just immediately rotate into term. It impacts that thinking.

In a way, the rotation and the uncertainty of this market becomes a competitor, if you will, for additional new build orders. We also think that is a short-term phenomena."

That's based on the efficiencies and the reduced cycle times we provide. And so when we have a customer that says, ""Gosh, I'm going to slow down or I'm going to turn a rig loose and we're contracting, keeping that rig active and contracting it with a new customer. We're going to keep the crews intact, we're going to look for opportunities. Hey, let's -- we've got a few days of idle time.

That was up $900 from the previous quarter. Again, the previous quarter, as you know, was very low. The additional $600 was a combination of things, kind of like I laid out. There's a portion of that, that is associated with top drives and just higher capital cost equipment, pipe-handling equipment, things like that, that were substantially higher in this quarter than usual. The transitional costs that Hans talked about, that was a big portion. We had about 11 -- 11, 12 rigs change hands in the quarter, meaning from one customer to another. About 70% of those or more transitioned from a basin to another basin. So there's -- again, the operator is paying for the mobilization cost but we have those soft costs associated with it that Hans spoke to. You compare that to previous quarters, we had, again, kind of that churn, if you will, from customer to customer, similar type numbers but a very small percentage of those went basin to basin, so you have a much less expenses and much less time kind of waiting between locations, if you know what I mean. So that drove that. There's a certain aspect to just other higher costs that are passed through to the customer.

I think there's a likelihood that at least one of those rigs will go back to work fairly soon. It's not going to impact third quarter, maybe not even the fourth. But I think it will go to work. And I think the other 2 rigs will have an outlook for activity. They're bigger rigs, so they're not rigs that would be directed towards the shale play in the Neuquen area. I think they do have opportunity to work in the Neuquen area on deeper type of activity. So I think the rigs, it make sense for them to be there right now as evidenced by we did move a 30,000-horsepower rig out of Argentina. It's going into Colombia, and it does have a contract. So if we are successful in getting a contract outside of Argentina, then, yes, we'll move the rig out of there. I mean, we're overall pretty excited about Argentina and the opportunity there and excited to have a FlexRig going in down there. I think it will start off as a nice trend for us. On the cost, again, we're all disappointed in the high expense that we had for the quarter. But it isn't unusual to have some pretty high variation just on a quarter-to-quarter base. And I think for us to talk about $13,200 right now is a little unreasonable. Again, we're kind of thinking this $13,500 to $13,800 range and that's where we're hoping to get. I haven't really started thinking about fourth quarter yet. It's always possible, but again, we're seeing, as Hans mentioned, we're seeing a lot of demand put on the rigs, and there's still this transitioning of rigs from basin to basin, even simple transition, they seem very simple, we're even seeing the rigs transition out of Eagle Ford into the Permian. I wouldn't be surprised to see some rigs in Oklahoma transition into the Permian. So I think this transitional period, I think, definitely happens through the third quarter and it may even continue into the fourth quarter. It's just hard to say right now."

We're pleased to report the company achieved an all-time record level of quarterly income from continuing operations. This is a nice milestone made possible by literally thousands of H&P employees who work hard every day to exceed our customers' expectations. We have discussed on a number of these calls the impressive rotation from dry gas direct drilling oil NGL directed targets. There's been a steady 3-year upward march in all directored drilling that have been more than enough to offset a slowly deteriorating dry gas wrote drilling rig count. Been a couple things happened earlier this year, natural guys prices plunged beneath $2 per MCF and the gas directed count dropped over a third reaching a 13-year low. Next the oil rig count received a jolt at the time of our last call, WTI prices were over $105 but by the end of the quarter, that oil prices have fallen to $77 and changed. While both Oil & Gas have recovered some lately, the $100 question focuses on what happens next particularly to the future price of oil. Certainly that answers entangled with macroeconomic headlines of the euro crisis, the ongoing Middle East turmoil and the sense for the slowing world economy, but the volatility and uncertainty is being way on in the mind of our customers and impacting their spending in the field. I think the right question to ask at the onset of what appears to be somewhat softening cycle is how deep and will the pain go and how long will it last. While our sense is that the duration and the depth of this slow down will be on the milder side, I can't think of a time in the company's history that we've be better positioned for the uncertainty ahead. In addition to our quality fleet profile and strong balance sheet, we've never had a more robust term contract coverage. Today, 157 FlexRigs or about 2/3 of our active fleet are under long-term contracts in the U.S. land market. Moreover, we already have in place today an average of 136 FlexRigs under term contract during fiscal 2013 and still an average of 95 FlexRigs under term contracts during 2014. These rigs are expected to generate average daily rig margins that are higher than the average reported in the segment during this third fiscal quarter. In addition today, we have 13 rigs under term contracts internationally, as well as 2 platform rigs. Most of these 15 rigs are already contacted through fiscal 2014. 
Turning to our new build effort. We continue to make deliveries on time and on budget, including 11 new FlexRigs since our last webcast. We have 25 rigs that remain under construction that will roll off at a pace of 4 per month. As we mentioned on the last call, the ongoing rig rotation and oil price represents a kind of competition for new build orders as customers have taken a wait and see approach in terms of what rigs may become available. They added volatility that certainty we're discussing today has further quieted conversations at least at this point and this is not a big surprise. Our experience reminds us that this also can turn around very quickly. In the meantime, our ongoing construction effort buys us sometime. We suspect that the entire land industry is dialing back on new builds, resulting in around 150 AC drive the rig deliveries for 2012. It's too early to predict 2013 except to say that the number of industry deliveries will be significantly less. Our own expectations after our last scheduled delivery in February 2013, R4 things did start slowing but buying traction as the year progresses. Our integrated effort affords us an important flexibility that you serve us well. 
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, you may have seen where we purchased 1.75 million shares of stock during the last quarter at an average price of $44.40 per share. We believe the implied you get value of the fleet that those levels makes it an attractive option. As we go forward, our preferrence would be to focus on building iron and what we believe is an on going replacement cycle. At the same time, we'll try to find the right balance in managing our expectation for future excess cash flows in a manner that maximizes shareholder value by returning funds through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

Our record results during the third fiscal quarter were primarily attributable to our U.S. land segment were we experienced continued improvement in average pricing and activity levels along with better-than-expected daily rig expenses. At this point, however, and given the mentioned uncertainty around current market conditions, we are not expecting additional growth in income from continuing operations during the fourth fiscal quarter. Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and total depreciation for the year is expected to be slightly beyond our prior estimate of $380 million. Our general and administrative expenses for the year remains at $110 million and our interest expense estimates, which is net of capitalized interest, remains at $10 million during fiscal 2012. Our income tax rate for continuing operations for the first 9 months of the fiscal year and for the third fiscal quarter were at 36.2% and 35.1%, respectively. We expect that tax rate for the fourth fiscal quarter to be between 36% and 37%. The slightly lower effective rate for the third fiscal quarter was due to an increased level of operations in states with lower tax rates and an increase in the tax benefit due to revised annual income estimates. I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay, and after John's comments we will open the call for questions."

I will highlight the third fiscal quarter 2012 results for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for our fourth fiscal quarter of '12. Beginning with",1370,"Thank you, Juan Pablo. And good morning, everyone. I will highlight the third fiscal quarter 2012 results for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, offshore and international land, as well as the outlook for our fourth fiscal quarter of '12. Beginning with our U.S. Land segment, third fiscal quarter results where revenue days increased 2.5% to 21,977 days, representing 241 average active rigs in the third quarter as the U.S. land segment took delivery of 11 of the 13 new build FlexRigs completed during the quarter. The other 2 FlexRigs were mobilized in the Middle East and I will update further in the International segment. In U.S. Land, an average of 160 rigs were under term contracts an average of 81 rigs were in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day increased by $471 from the second to the third quarter the $28,096 a day. Early termination revenue up accounted for approximately $140 a day and average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the third fiscal quarter was approximately 6% higher than the average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Average rig expense per day decreased $489 sequentially to $13,337 per day after experiencing higher than expected daily cost levels during the first part of the quarter even in the midst of an ongoing cost management efforts we were pleased to see favorable results during the latter portion of the quarter. There were no significant one-time adjustments in our U.S. operating cost. Average rig margin per day increased by $960 sequentially to $14,759 a day. As a result, U.S. land operating income increased 12% to $236 million. As of today, the company's U.S. land segment leads the industry and active rigs with 241 contracted rigs and 38 idle rigs. The 241 contracted rigs include 157 under term contracts and 84 operating in the spot market. Of the 84 rigs in the spot market, 82 are FlexRigs. only 2 of the 84 rigs in the spot market are drilling wells targeting dry gas. Also, we estimate 15 of the 157 rigs under term contracts are drilling wells targeting dry gas but none of these 15 rigs were under term contracts during the remainder of this fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter U.S. Land activity out that begins with a scheduled construction in delivery of 4 new FlexRigs per month. Overall activity outlook is dependent upon the direction of Oil & Gas prices and their impact on the drilling market. A number of revenue days for our U.S. Land segment may increase or decrease by a few percentage points during the fourth quarter as compared to the third fiscal quarter. We do expect a slight increase in quarter-to-quarter average activity in revenue days the drilling market stabilizes but would expect a 1% to 2% decline if the market continues to deteriorate. In response to softening oil prices, several of our customers have taken an even more disciplined approach to their budgets and are using this opportunity to trim the active rig counts. In some cases, operators are hydrating the existing fleet of SCR and mechanical rigs providing an opportunity for AC drive FlexRigs to gaining market share. However, as a consequence of this hydrating trend, we expect several SCR rigs, which include flex 1 and flex 2 rigs. We have regarded that rigs working on term contracts, we expect to have at least 162 rigs working on term contracts in the fourth fiscal quarter of '12 and 153 rigs working on term contracts for the first quarter of Fiscal '13 and an average of 131 rigs working on term for the remainder of Fiscal '13. Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we expect revenue per day for our rigs on term contracts to increase by approximately $150 a day on average in the fourth quarter of '12 and by approximately $400 per day in average for fiscal 2013. Both of these increases are as compared to the third fiscal quarter average. Excluding the impact of early termination fees, we expect average rig revenue per day in the of fourth quarter to remain roughly flat you to spot market pricing softening and term pricing continuing to increase. At this point, we expect early termination fees to be in the $7 million range during the fourth fiscal quarter. We expect average rig expense per day for the U.S. land fleet to be in the range of $13,500 to $13,800 per day. This range of expense level take in to account seasonality and market conditions as described earlier. 
Our FlexRigs new growth program continues to lead to an industry the and delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget including the 3 new builds announced on May 21. 25 FlexRigs remain under construction that are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs for months through the end of the calendar year '12 and 4 rigs are scheduled to deliver in 2013. 
Since January, H&P has built a total of 221 AC drive new build FlexRigs 3s, 4s and FlexRig5s. Our rig construction, safety and operational expertise have allowed us to capture over 40% of the industry AC drive market share in the U.S. The industry AC drive market share has doubled since the 2008 peak rig count to 30% market share today. SCR and mechanical rigs have lost market share during this replacement cycle and the long-term metrics point to that trend continuing. 
Now a review of our Offshore segment, third -- for the third fiscal quarter were off your operating income decreased approximately $2.1 million to $7.7 million. And the outlook for our Offshore segment as of today, the Offshore segment has 7 rigs active and 2 rigs backed although one of the stacked rigs is expected to mobilize in the fourth fiscal quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to increase by 10% to 15% and margin per day to increase by 15% to 20% as 1 recently mobilized rig goes to a full operating rate in August and an addition the rig begins mobilizing in August as well. 
The International Land segment the results from the second fiscal quarter to the third fiscal quarter increased by approximately $7.2 million. The primary factors driving the increase for activity and margins, revenue days increase 5% to 1,852 days, average rig margin per day increased $2,820 to $7,704 per day. Included in this average rig margin per day is approximately $800 per day of net positive one-off retroactive adjustments. 
Now the outlook for the International segment as of July 27, the company's International Land fleet has 29 total rigs, 23 are working and additional 3 rigs are under contract with activity ranging from weighting on location to rigging up and 3 conventional 3000-horsepower rigs are stacked in Argentina. Of the contracted rigs, 7 are in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in both Abu Dhabi and Tunisia. The mobilization of the 2 FlexRigs 3s from our new build facility in Houston to the Abu Dhabi is on schedule. First rig has spud its first well and the second rig should spud mid-August. In the of fourth quarter of fiscal although, we expect International Land revenue days to increase by 5% to 10% and average daily margin to be down 10% to 15% primarily due to the absence of the positive one-offs in the previous quarter. In closing, and as we think about the current and certainty in industry, our efforts will continue to be directed towards delivering compelling performance of our customers and shareholders. Our people, processes and FlexRig technologies completed a competitive advantage for the company. The shift to drilling more complex unconventional resource plays that require the drilling and horizontal and directional Wells only magnifies our competitive advantage. There is in this evidence that our large percentage of the old conventional rigs and lower and technology product offerings are being displaced by new technology AC drive rigs. These replacement cycle provides additional market share capture for H&P and especially, and a soft commodity price environment. And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

They have plans for those rigs and in a lot of cases as I've mentioned before, the plan is to hydrate the rig fleet when those rigs are delivered. As far as the other rigs and it's really very similar in the third quarter going in the fourth quarter, you're looking at a relatively small number of rigs and typically, rigs have very -- I think last quarter was 45 days on average and I don't know what the average days or less for the fourth quarter thus far but, they're reaching the end of their term and so if you think about what our customers are doing in general, they're looking at their rig fleets and they're trying to figure out what rigs make the most sense they have other rigs long-term contracts as well and so a lot of times, it's just happens to be that because of the budget discipline that I've described, you just kind of the one that left without a contract and the end up early terminating it. So it's a relatively small number of days left on the term contract in these cases. It isn't like what we saw in '08 and '09 where we saw multiyear term contracts being early terminated and there was no work to be done. That's not the case here. There's work to be done it's just in a different budget cycle or just looking at trimming budgets."

The last 6 weeks of the quarter, we did get some traction and things improved and so there's a little bit of do more of that and that's our intention but we've also tried to make clear for the last couple of goals that the volatility and the rig rotation it can drive some higher cost for us and it's not so easy to predict and so if we have more rig rotation than we might have anticipated like we mentioned before, you're going to have some issues on crew retention, you're going to take advantage to spend some money on rig that's been working all out and that's going to drive some expenses but clearly, we're being more focused and disciplined on that now and would expect those efforts to continue to pay dividends. So the ranges that we gave going forward, again, I think John put it in the proper context, you look over a number of quarters and there are 240-plus rigs that are running out there and lots of moving parts and I think we are gaining traction on improving on MNS and purchasing and cost management.

Good morning, everybody. We're pleased to report the company achieved an all-time record level of quarterly income from continuing operations. This is a nice milestone made possible by, literally, thousands of H&P employees who work",754,"Thank you, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everybody. We're pleased to report the company achieved an all-time record level of quarterly income from continuing operations. This is a nice milestone made possible by, literally, thousands of H&P employees who work hard every day to exceed our customers' expectations. We have discussed on a number of these calls the impressive rotation from dry gas direct drilling oil NGL and NGL directed targets. There's been a steady 3-year upward march in oil directed drilling that had been more than enough to offset a slowly deteriorating dry gas drilling rig count. Then, a couple things happened earlier this year. Natural gas prices plunged beneath $2 per mcf and the gas directed rig count dropped by over 1/3, reaching a 13-year low. Next, the oil rig count received a jolt at the time of our last call. WTI prices were over $105, but by the end of the quarter, the oil prices have fallen to $77 and changed. While both oil and gas prices have recovered some lately, the $100 question focuses on what happens next, particularly to the future price of oil. Certainly, that answers entangled with macroeconomic headlines of the euro crisis, the ongoing Middle East turmoil and the sense for a slowing world economy, but the volatility and uncertainty is weighing on the minds of our customers and impacting their spending in the field. I think the right question to ask at the onset of what appears to be a somewhat softening cycle is how deep and will the pain go and how long will it last. While our sense is that the duration and the depth of this slowdown will be on the milder side, I can't think of a time in the company's history that we've been better positioned for the uncertainty ahead. In addition to our quality fleet profile and strong balance sheet, we've never had a more robust term contract coverage. Today, 157 FlexRigs or about 2/3 of our active fleet are under long-term contracts in the U.S. land market. Moreover, we already have in place today an average of 136 FlexRigs under term contract during fiscal 2013 and still an average of 95 FlexRigs under term contracts during fiscal 2014. These rigs are expected to generate average daily rig margins that are higher than the average reported in the segment during this third fiscal quarter. In addition, today, we have 13 rigs under term contracts internationally, as well as 2 platform rigs. Most of these 15 rigs are already contracted through fiscal 2014. 
Turning to our new build effort. We continue to make deliveries on time and on budget, including 11 new FlexRigs since our last webcast. We have 25 rigs that remain under construction that will roll off at a pace of 4 per month. As we mentioned on the last call, the ongoing rig rotation in the oil patch represents a kind of competition for new build orders as customers have taken a wait-and-see approach in terms of what rigs may become available. The added volatility and certainty we are discussing today has further quieted conversations at least at this point, and this is not a big surprise. Our experience reminds us that this also can turn around very quickly. In the meantime, our ongoing construction effort buys us some time. We suspect that the entire land industry is dialing back on new builds, resulting in around 150 AC drive rig deliveries for 2012. It's too early to predict 2013 except to say that the number of industry deliveries will be significantly less. Our own expectations after our last scheduled delivery in February 2013 are for things to start slowing but find traction as the year progresses. Our integrated effort affords us an important flexibility that should serve us well. 
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, you may have seen where we repurchased 1.75 million shares of stock during the last quarter at an average price of $44.40 per share. We believe the implied market value of the fleet at those levels makes it an attractive option. As we go forward, our preference would be to focus on building iron and what we believe is an on going replacement cycle. At the same time, we'll try to find the right balance in managing our expectation for future excess cash flow in a manner that maximizes shareholder value by returning funds through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

Our record result during the third fiscal quarter were primarily attributable to our U.S. Land segment, where we experienced continued improvements in average pricing and activity levels along with better-than-expected daily rig expenses.",228,"Thank you, Hans. Our record result during the third fiscal quarter were primarily attributable to our U.S. Land segment, where we experienced continued improvements in average pricing and activity levels along with better-than-expected daily rig expenses. At this point, however, and given the mentioned uncertainty around current market conditions, we are not expecting additional growth in income from continuing operations during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and total depreciation for the year is expected to be slightly beyond our prior estimate of $380 million. 
Our general and administrative expense estimate for the year remains at $110 million, and our interest expense estimate, which is net of capitalized interest, remains at $10 million during fiscal 2012. 
Our income tax rate for continuing operations for the first 9 months of the fiscal year and for the third fiscal quarter were at 36.2% and 35.1%, respectively. We expect the tax rate for the fourth fiscal quarter to be between 36% and 37%. The slightly lower effective rate for the third fiscal quarter was due to an increased level of operations in states with lower tax rates and an increase in the tax benefit due to revised annual income estimates. 
I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay, and after John's comments, we will open the call for questions."

I will highlight the third fiscal 2012 results for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, Offshore and International Land, as well as the outlook for our fourth fiscal quarter of '12. Beginning with our U",1364,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight the third fiscal 2012 results for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, Offshore and International Land, as well as the outlook for our fourth fiscal quarter of '12. 
Beginning with our U.S. Land segment, third fiscal quarter results where revenue days increased 2.5% to 21,977 days, representing 241 average active rigs in the third quarter as the U.S. Land segment took delivery of 11 of the 13 new build FlexRigs completed during the quarter. The other 2 FlexRigs were mobilized to the Middle East, and I will update further in the International segment. In U.S. Land, an average of 160 rigs were under term contracts, an average of 81 rigs were in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day increased by $471 from the second to the third quarter to $28,096 a day. Early termination revenue accounted for approximately $140 a day, and average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the third fiscal quarter was approximately 6% higher than the average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Average rig expense per day decreased $489 sequentially to $13,337 per day after experiencing higher-than-expected daily cost levels during the first part of the quarter even in the midst of an ongoing cost management efforts. We were pleased to see favorable results during the latter portion of the quarter. There were no significant onetime adjustments in our U.S. operating cost. Average rig margin per day increased by $960 sequentially to $14,759 a day. As a result, U.S. Land operating income increased 12% to $236 million. As of today, the company's U.S. Land segment leads the industry in active rigs with 241 contracted rigs and 38 idle rigs. The 241 contracted rigs include 157 under term contracts and 84 operating in the spot market. Of the 84 rigs in the spot market, 82 are FlexRigs. Only 2 of the 84 rigs in the spot market are drilling wells targeting dry gas. Also, we estimate 15 of the 157 rigs under term contracts are drilling wells targeting dry gas, but none of these 15 rigs roll off of their term contracts during the remainder of this fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter U.S. Land activity outlook begins with the scheduled construction and delivery of 4 new FlexRigs per month. Overall activity outlook is dependent upon the direction of oil and gas prices and their impact on the drilling market. The number of revenue days for our U.S. Land segment may increase or decrease by a few percentage points during the fourth quarter as compared to the third fiscal quarter. We would expect a slight increase in quarter-to-quarter average activity and revenue days if the drilling market stabilizes, but would expect a 1% to 2% decline if the market continues to deteriorate. In response to softening oil prices, several of our customers have taken an even more disciplined approach to their budgets and are using this opportunity to trim their active rig counts. In some cases, operators are high grading their existing fleet of SCR and mechanical rigs, providing an opportunity for AC drive FlexRigs to gain market share. However, as a consequence of this high-grading trend, we expect several SCR rigs, which include Flex 1 and Flex 2 rigs. With regard to that rigs working on term contracts, we expect to have at least 162 rigs working on term contracts in the fourth fiscal quarter of '12 and 153 rigs working on term contracts for the first quarter of fiscal '13 and an average of 131 rigs working on term for the remainder of fiscal '13. Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we're going to expect revenue per day for our rigs on term contracts to increase by approximately $150 a day on average in the fourth quarter of '12 and by approximately $400 per day in average for fiscal 2013. Both of these increases are as compared to the third fiscal quarter average. Excluding the impact of early termination fees, we expect average rig revenue per day in the fourth quarter to remain roughly flat due to spot market pricing softening and term pricing continuing to increase. At this point, we expect early termination fees to be in the $7 million range during the fourth fiscal quarter. We expect average rig expense per day for the U.S. Land fleet to be in the range of $13,500 to $13,800 per day. This range of expense levels take in to account seasonality and market conditions, as described earlier. 
Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget, including the 3 new builds announced on May 21. 25 FlexRigs remain under construction are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month through the end of the calendar year '12 and 4 rigs are scheduled to deliver in 2013. 
Since January of 2006, h&P has built a total of 221 AC drive new build FlexRigs3s, 4s and Flex 5s. Our rig construction, safety and operational expertise have allowed us to capture over 40% of the industry AC drive market share in the U.S. The industry AC drive market share has doubled since the 2008 peak rig count to 30% market share today. SCR and mechanical rigs have lost market share during this replacement cycle and the long-term metrics point to that trend continuing. 
Now a review of our Offshore segment, third -- for the third fiscal quarter, where Offshore operating income decreased approximately $2.1 million to $7.7 million. And the outlook for our Offshore segment as of today, the Offshore segment has 7 rigs active and 2 rigs stacked, although one of the stacked rigs is expected to mobilize in the fourth fiscal quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect the Offshore revenue days to increase by 10% to 15% and margin per day to increase by 15% to 20%, as one recently mobilized rig goes to a full operating rate in August and an additional rig begins mobilizing in August as well. 
The International Land segment, the results from the second fiscal quarter to the third fiscal quarter increased by approximately $7.2 million. The primary factors driving the increase were activity and margins, revenue days increase 5% to 1,852 days, average rig margin per day increased $2,820 to $7,704 per day. Included in this average, rig margin per day is approximately $800 per day of net positive oneoff retroactive adjustments. 
Now, the outlook for the International segment as of July 27. The company's International Land fleet has 29 total rigs, 23 are working and additional 3 rigs are under contract, with activity ranging from waiting on location to rigging up and 3 conventional 3,000-horsepower rigs are stacked in Argentina. Of the contracted rigs, 7 are in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in both Abu Dhabi and Tunisia. The mobilization of the 2 FlexRig3s from our new build facility in Houston to Abu Dhabi is on schedule. 
The first rig has spud its first well and the second rig should spud mid-August. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we expect International Land revenue days to increase by 5% to 10% and average daily margin to be down 10% to 15%, primarily due to the absence of the positive oneoffs in the previous quarter. In closing, and as we think about the current uncertainty in the industry, our efforts will continue to be directed toward delivering compelling performance for our customers and shareholders. Our people, processes and FlexRig technology create a competitive advantage for the company. The shift to drilling more complex unconventional resource plays that require the drilling at horizontal and directional wells only magnifies our competitive advantage. There is indisputable evidence that a large percentage of the old conventional rigs and lower-end technology product offerings are being displaced by new technology AC drive rigs. This replacement cycle provides additional market share capture for H&P and especially in a soft commodity price environment. 
And now, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

We don't have any, what I would consider, real long-term contracts and we don't have any that are getting ready to deliver that we've had any customers even hint at being interested and exiting those rigs. They have plans for those rigs, and in a lot of cases, as I have mentioned before, the plan is to high grade the rig fleet when those rigs are delivered. As far as the other rigs, and it's really very similar in the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, you're looking at a relatively small number of rigs, and typically, the rigs have very -- I think last quarter it was 45 days on average and I don't know what the average days are left on for fourth quarter thus far, but they're reaching the end of their term. And so if you think about what our customers are doing in general is, they're looking at their rig fleets and then they're trying to figure out what rigs make the most sense. They have other rigs that are on term contracts as well, and so a lot of times it just happens to be that because of the budget discipline that I described, you just kind of be the one that's left without a contract and they end up early terminating it. So it's a relatively small number of days left on the term contract in these cases. It isn't like what we saw in '08 and '09, where we saw multiyear term contracts being early terminated and there was no work to be done. That's not the case here. There's work to be done, it's just in a different budget cycle. They're just looking at trimming budgets."

As you guys are mapping out the rest of the year and doing the best that you can to kind of gauge some of the sensitivities [indiscernible] and so forth, what do you think prospect is that from this point through the end of the year that the E&P industry essentially just continues to, if you will due to high grading, just lack a sense of urgency, kind of ride out the rest of the year so that there isn't really much in the way of, I think, demand and that the softness continues. If I put that into context of the fact that there's been a significant bounce, obviously, in oil prices back around the $90 level, the strip price for natural gas is well north of $3, I just want to get a read from you guys as whether or not you think the E&P industry will start to get a little bit more optimistic before year end or this will continue to wade out this year and maybe kind of build up their cash and hit the ground running come the first quarter '13, what's your take on that?"

I think people are trying to wade through the uncertainties, watching oil prices closely. One of the things we do here from customers is they don't want to over correct on the downside where they try to spool up too much.

And like what Juan Pablo said, when we saw the very early indications in the first part of the quarter, they were at similar levels through the prior quarter and slightly elevated from that. And we knew we had a focus on cost reduction in the field that had not gained much traction at that point. So we elected to let you guys know what we saw in terms of the visibility we had at the time. The last 6 weeks of the quarter, we did get some traction and things improved. And so there's a little bit of we'll do more of that and that's our intention, but we've also tried to make clear for the last couple of calls that the volatility and the rig rotation, it can drive some higher cost for us and it's not so easy to predict. And so if we have more rig rotation than we might have anticipated, like we mentioned before, you're going to have some issues on crew retention, you're going to take advantage to spend some money on a rig that's been working all out and it's going to drive some expenses. But clearly, we're being more focused and disciplined on that now and we would expect those efforts to continue to pay dividends. So the ranges that we gave going forward, again, I think John put it in the proper context, you look over a number of quarters and there are 240-plus rigs running out there and there are lots of moving parts, but I think we are gaining traction on improving on MNS and purchasing and cost management. And so we think that, that will be a benefit, but we also know that there's still some rotation and uncertainty. And so it's just we're doing our best to give you guys the best feel of what the go forward looks like, but that's the best we can do."

Good morning, everybody. We're pleased to report the company achieved an all-time record level of quarterly income from continuing operations. This is a nice milestone made possible by, literally, thousands of H&P employees who work",754,"Thank you, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everybody. We're pleased to report the company achieved an all-time record level of quarterly income from continuing operations. This is a nice milestone made possible by, literally, thousands of H&P employees who work hard every day to exceed our customers' expectations. We have discussed on a number of these calls the impressive rotation from dry gas direct drilling to oil and NGL directed targets. There's been a steady 3-year upward march in oil directed drilling that had been more than enough to offset a slowly deteriorating dry gas drilling rig count. Then, a couple things happened earlier this year. Natural gas prices plunged beneath $2 per mcf and the gas directed rig count dropped by over 1/3, reaching a 13-year low. Next, the oil rig count received a jolt at the time of our last call. WTI prices were over $105, but by the end of the quarter, the oil prices had fallen to $77 and changed. While both oil and gas prices have recovered some lately, the $100 question focuses on what happens next, particularly to the future price of oil. Certainly, that answers entangled with macroeconomic headlines of the euro crisis, the ongoing Middle East turmoil and the sense for a slowing world economy, but the volatility and uncertainty is weighing on the minds of our customers and impacting their spending in the field. I think the right question to ask at the onset of what appears to be a somewhat softening cycle is how deep and will the pain go and how long will it last. While our sense is that the duration and the depth of this slowdown will be on the milder side, I can't think of a time in the company's history that we've been better positioned for the uncertainty ahead. In addition to our quality fleet profile and strong balance sheet, we've never had a more robust term contract coverage. Today, 157 FlexRigs or about 2/3 of our active fleet are under long-term contracts in the U.S. land market. Moreover, we already have in place today an average of 136 FlexRigs under term contract during fiscal 2013 and still an average of 95 FlexRigs under term contracts during fiscal 2014. These rigs are expected to generate average daily rig margins that are higher than the average reported in the segment during this third fiscal quarter. In addition, today, we have 13 rigs under term contracts internationally, as well as 2 platform rigs. Most of these 15 rigs are already contracted through fiscal 2014. 
Turning to our new build effort. We continue to make deliveries on time and on budget, including 11 new FlexRigs since our last webcast. We have 25 rigs that remain under construction that will roll off at a pace of 4 per month. As we mentioned on the last call, the ongoing rig rotation in the oil patch represents a kind of competition for new build orders as customers have taken a wait-and-see approach in terms of what rigs may become available. The added volatility and uncertainty we are discussing today has further quieted conversations at least at this point, and this is not a big surprise. Our experience reminds us that this also can turn around very quickly. In the meantime, our ongoing construction effort buys us some time. We suspect that the entire land industry is dialing back on new builds, resulting in around 150 AC drive rig deliveries for 2012. It's too early to predict 2013 except to say that the number of industry deliveries will be significantly less. Our own expectations after our last scheduled delivery in February 2013 are for things to start slowing but find traction as the year progresses. Our integrated effort affords us an important flexibility that should serve us well. 
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, you may have seen where we repurchased 1.75 million shares of stock during the last quarter at an average price of $44.40 per share. We believe the implied market value of the fleet at those levels makes it an attractive option. As we go forward, our preference would be to focus on building iron and what we believe is an on going replacement cycle. At the same time, we'll try to find the right balance in managing our expectation for future excess cash flow in a manner that maximizes shareholder value by returning funds through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

Our record result during the third fiscal quarter were primarily attributable to our U.S. Land segment, where we experienced continued improvements in average pricing and activity levels along with better-than-expected daily rig expenses.",228,"Thank you, Hans. Our record result during the third fiscal quarter were primarily attributable to our U.S. Land segment, where we experienced continued improvements in average pricing and activity levels along with better-than-expected daily rig expenses. At this point, however, and given the mentioned uncertainty around current market conditions, we are not expecting additional growth in income from continuing operations during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and total depreciation for the year is expected to be slightly under our prior estimate of $380 million. 
Our general and administrative expense estimate for the year remains at $110 million, and our interest expense estimate, which is net of capitalized interest, remains at $10 million during fiscal 2012. 
Our income tax rate for continuing operations for the first 9 months of the fiscal year and for the third fiscal quarter were at 36.2% and 35.1%, respectively. We expect the tax rate for the fourth fiscal quarter to be between 36% and 37%. The slightly lower effective rate for the third fiscal quarter was due to an increased level of operations in states with lower tax rates and an increase in a tax benefit due to revised annual income estimates. 
I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay, and after John's comments, we will open the call for questions."

I will highlight the third fiscal 2012 results for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, Offshore and International Land, as well as the outlook for our fourth fiscal quarter of '12. Beginning with our U",1363,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight the third fiscal 2012 results for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, Offshore and International Land, as well as the outlook for our fourth fiscal quarter of '12. 
Beginning with our U.S. Land segment, third fiscal quarter results where revenue days increased 2.5% to 21,977 days, representing 241 average active rigs in the third quarter as the U.S. Land segment took delivery of 11 of the 13 new build FlexRigs completed during the quarter. The other 2 FlexRigs were mobilized to the Middle East, and I will update further in the International segment. In U.S. Land, an average of 160 rigs were under term contracts, an average of 81 rigs were in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day increased by $471 from the second to the third quarter to $28,096 a day. Early termination revenue accounted for approximately $140 a day, and average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the third fiscal quarter was approximately 6% higher than the average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Average rig expense per day decreased $489 sequentially to $13,337 per day after experiencing higher-than-expected daily cost levels during the first part of the quarter even in the midst of an ongoing cost management efforts. We were pleased to see favorable results during the latter portion of the quarter. There were no significant onetime adjustments in our U.S. operating cost. Average rig margin per day increased by $960 sequentially to $14,759 a day. As a result, U.S. Land operating income increased 12% to $236 million. As of today, the company's U.S. Land segment leads the industry in active rigs with 241 contracted rigs and 38 idle rigs. The 241 contracted rigs include 157 under term contracts and 84 operating in the spot market. Of the 84 rigs in the spot market, 82 are FlexRigs. Only 2 of the 84 rigs in the spot market are drilling wells targeting dry gas. Also, we estimate 15 of the 157 rigs under term contracts are drilling wells targeting dry gas, but none of these 15 rigs roll off of their term contracts during the remainder of this fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter U.S. Land activity outlook begins with the scheduled construction and delivery of 4 new FlexRigs per month. Overall activity outlook is dependent upon the direction of oil and gas prices and their impact on the drilling market. The number of revenue days for our U.S. Land segment may increase or decrease by a few percentage points during the fourth quarter as compared to the third fiscal quarter. We would expect a slight increase in quarter-to-quarter average activity and revenue days if the drilling market stabilizes, but would expect a 1% to 2% decline if the market continues to deteriorate. In response to softening oil prices, several of our customers have taken an even more disciplined approach to their budgets and are using this opportunity to trim their active rig counts. In some cases, operators are high grading their existing fleet of SCR and mechanical rigs, providing an opportunity for AC drive FlexRigs to gain market share. However, as a consequence of this high-grading trend, we stacked several SCR rigs, which include Flex 1 and Flex 2 rigs. With regard to that rigs working on term contracts, we expect to have at least 162 rigs working on term contracts in the fourth fiscal quarter of '12 and 153 rigs working on term contracts for the first quarter of fiscal '13 and an average of 131 rigs working on term for the remainder of fiscal '13. Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we're going to expect revenue per day for our rigs on term contracts to increase by approximately $150 a day on average in the fourth quarter of '12 and by approximately $400 per day in average for fiscal 2013. Both of these increases are as compared to the third fiscal quarter average. Excluding the impact of early termination fees, we expect average rig revenue per day in the fourth quarter to remain roughly flat due to spot market pricing softening and term pricing continuing to increase. At this point, we expect early termination fees to be in the $7 million range during the fourth fiscal quarter. We expect average rig expense per day for the U.S. Land fleet to be in a range of $13,500 to $13,800 per day. This range of expense levels take in to account seasonality and market conditions, as described earlier. 
Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget, including the 3 new builds announced on May 21. 25 FlexRigs remain under construction are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month through the end of the calendar year '12 and 4 rigs are scheduled to deliver in 2013. 
Since January of 2006, H&P has built a total of 221 AC drive new build FlexRigs3s, 4s and Flex 5s. Our rig construction, safety and operational expertise have allowed us to capture over 40% of the industry AC drive market share in the U.S. The industry AC drive market share has doubled since the 2008 peak rig count to 30% market share today. SCR and mechanical rigs have lost market share during this replacement cycle and the long-term metrics point to that trend continuing. 
Now a review of our Offshore segment, third -- for the third fiscal quarter, where Offshore operating income decreased approximately $2.1 million to $7.7 million. And the outlook for our Offshore segment as of today, the Offshore segment has 7 rigs active and 2 rigs stacked, although one of the stacked rigs is expected to mobilize in the fourth fiscal quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect  Offshore revenue days to increase by 10% to 15% and margin per day to increase by 15% to 20%, as one recently mobilized rig goes to a full operating rate in August and an additional rig begins mobilizing in August as well. 
The International Land segment, the results from the second fiscal quarter to the third fiscal quarter increased by approximately $7.2 million. The primary factors driving the increase were activity and margins, revenue days increase 5% to 1,852 days, average rig margin per day increased $2,820 to $7,704 per day. Included in this average, rig margin per day is approximately $800 per day of net positive one-off retroactive adjustments. 
Now, the outlook for the International segment as of July 27. The company's International Land fleet has 29 total rigs, 23 are working and additional 3 rigs are under contract, with activity ranging from waiting on location to rigging up and 3 conventional 3,000-horsepower rigs are stacked in Argentina. Of the contracted rigs, 7 are in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in both Abu Dhabi and Tunisia. The mobilization of the 2 FlexRig3s from our new build facility in Houston to Abu Dhabi is on schedule. 
The first rig has spud its first well and the second rig should spud mid-August. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we expect International Land revenue days to increase by 5% to 10% and average daily margin to be down 10% to 15%, primarily due to the absence of the positive one-offs in the previous quarter. In closing, and as we think about the current uncertainty in the industry, our efforts will continue to be directed toward delivering compelling performance for our customers and shareholders. Our people, processes and FlexRig technology create a competitive advantage for the company. The shift to drilling more complex unconventional resource plays that require the drilling at horizontal and directional wells only magnifies our competitive advantage. There is indisputable evidence that a large percentage of the old conventional rigs and lower-end technology product offerings are being displaced by new technology AC drive rigs. This replacement cycle provides additional market share capture for H&P and especially in a soft commodity price environment. 
And now, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

They have plans for those rigs, and in a lot of cases, as I have mentioned before, the plan is to high grade the rig fleet when those rigs are delivered. As far as the other rigs, and it's really very similar in the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, you're looking at a relatively small number of rigs, and typically, the rigs have very -- I think last quarter it was 45 days on average and I don't know what the average days are left on for fourth quarter thus far, but they're reaching the end of their term. And so if you think about what our customers are doing in general is, they're looking at their rig fleets and then they're trying to figure out what rigs make the most sense. They have other rigs that are on term contracts as well, and so a lot of times it just happens to be that because of the budget discipline that I described, you just kind of be the one that's left without a contract and they end up early terminating it. So it's a relatively small number of days left on the term contract in these cases. It isn't like what we saw in '08 and '09, where we saw multiyear term contracts being early terminated and there was no work to be done. That's not the case here. There's work to be done, it's just in a different budget cycle. They're just looking at trimming budgets."

If I put that into context of the fact that there's been a significant bounce, obviously, in oil prices back around the $90 level, the strip price for natural gas is well north of $3, I just want to get a read from you guys as whether or not you think the E&P industry will start to get a little bit more optimistic before year end or this will continue to wade out this year and maybe kind of build up their cash and hit the ground running come the first quarter '13, what's your take on that?"

I think people are trying to wade through the uncertainties, watching oil prices closely.

And like what Juan Pablo said, when we saw the very early indications in the first part of the quarter, they were at similar levels to the prior quarter and slightly elevated from that. And we knew we had a focus on cost reduction in the field that had not gained much traction at that point. So we elected to let you guys know what we saw in terms of the visibility we had at the time. The last 6 weeks of the quarter, we did get some traction and things improved. And so there's a little bit of we'll do more of that and that's our intention, but we've also tried to make clear for the last couple of calls that the volatility and the rig rotation, it can drive some higher cost for us and it's not so easy to predict. And so if we have more rig rotation than we might have anticipated, like we mentioned before, you're going to have some issues on crew retention, you're going to take advantage to spend some money on a rig that's been working all out and it's going to drive some expenses. But clearly, we're being more focused and disciplined on that now and we would expect those efforts to continue to pay dividends. So the ranges that we gave going forward, again, I think John put it in the proper context, you look over a number of quarters and there are 240-plus rigs running out there and there are lots of moving parts, but I think we are gaining traction on improving on MNS and purchasing and cost management. And so we think that, that will be a benefit, but we also know that there's still some rotation and uncertainty. And so it's just we're doing our best to give you guys the best feel of what the go forward looks like, but that's the best we can do."

Good morning, everybody. We're pleased to report the company achieved an all-time record level of quarterly income from continuing operations. This is a nice milestone made possible by, literally, thousands of H&P employees who work",753,"Thank you, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everybody. We're pleased to report the company achieved an all-time record level of quarterly income from continuing operations. This is a nice milestone made possible by, literally, thousands of H&P employees who work hard every day to exceed our customers' expectations. We have discussed on a number of these calls the impressive rotation from dry gas direct drilling to oil and NGL directed targets. There's been a steady 3-year upward march in oil directed drilling that had been more than enough to offset a slowly deteriorating dry gas drilling rig count. Then, a couple things happened earlier this year. Natural gas prices plunged beneath $2 per mcf and the gas directed rig count dropped by over 1/3, reaching a 13-year low. Next, the oil rig count received a jolt at the time of our last call. WTI prices were over $105, but by the end of the quarter, the oil prices had fallen to $77 and changed. While both oil and gas prices have recovered some lately, the $100 question focuses on what happens next, particularly to the future price of oil. Certainly, that answers entangled with macroeconomic headlines of the euro crisis, the ongoing Middle East turmoil and the sense for a slowing world economy, but the volatility and uncertainty is weighing on the minds of our customers and impacting their spending in the field. I think the right question to ask at the onset of what appears to be a somewhat softening cycle is how deep and will the pain go and how long will it last. While our sense is that the duration and the depth of this slowdown will be on the milder side, I can't think of a time in the company's history that we've been better positioned for the uncertainty ahead. In addition to our quality fleet profile and strong balance sheet, we've never had a more robust term contract coverage. Today, 157 FlexRigs or about 2/3 of our active fleet are under long-term contracts in the U.S. land market. Moreover, we already have in place today an average of 136 FlexRigs under term contract during fiscal 2013 and still an average of 95 FlexRigs under term contracts during fiscal 2014. These rigs are expected to generate average daily rig margins that are higher than the average reported in the segment during this third fiscal quarter. In addition, today, we have 13 rigs under term contracts internationally, as well as 2 platform rigs. Most of these 15 rigs are already contracted through fiscal 2014. 
Turning to our new build effort. We continue to make deliveries on time and on budget, including 11 new FlexRigs since our last webcast. We have 25 rigs that remain under construction that will roll off at a pace of 4 per month. As we mentioned on the last call, the ongoing rig rotation in the oil patch represents a kind of competition for new build orders as customers have taken a wait-and-see approach in terms of what rigs may become available. The added volatility and uncertainty we are discussing today has further quieted conversations at least at this point, and this is not a big surprise. Our experience reminds us that this also can turn around very quickly. In the meantime, our ongoing construction effort buys us some time. We suspect that the entire land industry is dialing back on new builds, resulting in around 150 AC drive rig deliveries for 2012. It's too early to predict 2013 except to say that the number of industry deliveries will be significantly less. Our own expectations after our last scheduled delivery in February 2013 are for things to start slowing but find traction as the year progresses. Our integrated effort affords us an important flexibility that should serve us well. 
Before turning the call back to Juan Pablo, you may have seen where we repurchased 1.75 million shares of stock during the last quarter at an average price of $44.40 per share. We believe the implied market value of the fleet at those levels makes it an attractive option. As we go forward, our preference would be to focus on building iron and what we believe is an ongoing replacement cycle. At the same time, we'll try to find the right balance in managing our expectation for future excess cash flow in a manner that maximizes shareholder value by returning funds through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

Our record result during the third fiscal quarter were primarily attributable to our U.S. Land segment, where we experienced continued improvements in average pricing and activity levels along with better-than-expected daily rig expenses. At this point, however, and given the mentioned uncertainty around current market conditions, we are not expecting additional growth in income from continuing operations during the fourth fiscal quarter. 
Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2012 remains at approximately $1.1 billion, and total depreciation for the year is expected to be slightly under our prior estimate of $380 million. 
Our general and administrative expense estimate for the year remains at $110 million, and our interest expense estimate, which is net of capitalized interest, remains at $10 million during fiscal 2012. 
Our income tax rate for continuing operations for the first 9 months of the fiscal year and for the third fiscal quarter were at 36.2% and 35.1%, respectively. We expect the tax rate for the fourth fiscal quarter to be between 36% and 37%. The slightly lower effective rate for the third fiscal quarter was due to an increased level of operations in states with lower tax rates and an increase in a tax benefit due to revised annual income estimates. 
I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay, and after John's comments, we will open the call for questions."

Beginning with our U",1363,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight the third fiscal 2012 results for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, Offshore and International Land, as well as the outlook for our fourth fiscal quarter of '12. 
Beginning with our U.S. Land segment, third fiscal quarter results where revenue days increased 2.5% to 21,977 days, representing 241 average active rigs in the third quarter as the U.S. Land segment took delivery of 11 of the 13 new build FlexRigs completed during the quarter. The other 2 FlexRigs were mobilized to the Middle East, and I will update further in the International segment. In U.S. Land, an average of 160 rigs were under term contracts, an average of 81 rigs were in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day increased by $471 from the second to the third quarter to $28,096 a day. Early termination revenue accounted for approximately $140 a day, and average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contract during the third fiscal quarter was approximately 6% higher than the average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. Average rig expense per day decreased $489 sequentially to $13,337 per day after experiencing higher-than-expected daily cost levels during the first part of the quarter even in the midst of an ongoing cost management efforts. We were pleased to see favorable results during the latter portion of the quarter. There were no significant onetime adjustments in our U.S. operating cost. Average rig margin per day increased by $960 sequentially to $14,759 a day. As a result, U.S. Land operating income increased 12% to $236 million. As of today, the company's U.S. Land segment leads the industry in active rigs with 241 contracted rigs and 38 idle rigs. The 241 contracted rigs include 157 under term contracts and 84 operating in the spot market. Of the 84 rigs in the spot market, 82 are FlexRigs. Only 2 of the 84 rigs in the spot market are drilling wells targeting dry gas. Also, we estimate 15 of the 157 rigs under term contracts are drilling wells targeting dry gas, but none of these 15 rigs roll off of their term contracts during the remainder of this fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth quarter U.S. Land activity outlook begins with the scheduled construction and delivery of 4 new FlexRigs per month. Overall activity outlook is dependent upon the direction of oil and gas prices and their impact on the drilling market. The number of revenue days for our U.S. Land segment may increase or decrease by a few percentage points during the fourth quarter as compared to the third fiscal quarter. We would expect a slight increase in quarter-to-quarter average activity and revenue days if the drilling market stabilizes, but would expect a 1% to 2% decline if the market continues to deteriorate. In response to softening oil prices, several of our customers have taken an even more disciplined approach to their budgets and are using this opportunity to trim their active rig counts. In some cases, operators are high grading their existing fleet of SCR and mechanical rigs, providing an opportunity for AC drive FlexRigs to gain market share. However, as a consequence of this high-grading trend, we stacked several SCR rigs, which include Flex 1 and Flex 2 rigs. With regard to that rigs working on term contracts, we expect to have at least 162 rigs working on term contracts in the fourth fiscal quarter of '12 and 153 rigs working on term contracts for the first quarter of fiscal '13 and an average of 131 rigs working on term for the remainder of fiscal '13. Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we're going to expect revenue per day for our rigs on term contracts to increase by approximately $150 a day on average in the fourth quarter of '12 and by approximately $400 per day in average for fiscal 2013. Both of these increases are as compared to the third fiscal quarter average. Excluding the impact of early termination fees, we expect average rig revenue per day in the fourth quarter to remain roughly flat due to spot market pricing softening and term pricing continuing to increase. At this point, we expect early termination fees to be in the $7 million range during the fourth fiscal quarter. We expect average rig expense per day for the U.S. Land fleet to be in a range of $13,500 to $13,800 per day. This range of expense levels take in to account seasonality and market conditions, as described earlier. 
Our FlexRig new build program continues to lead the industry in delivering advanced technology AC drive rigs on time and on budget, including the 3 new builds announced on May 21. 25 FlexRigs remain under construction are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month through the end of the calendar year '12 and 4 rigs are scheduled to deliver in 2013. 
Since January of 2006, H&P has built a total of 221 AC drive new build FlexRigs3s, 4s and Flex 5s. Our rig construction, safety and operational expertise have allowed us to capture over 40% of the industry AC drive market share in the U.S. The industry AC drive market share has doubled since the 2008 peak rig count to 30% market share today. SCR and mechanical rigs have lost market share during this replacement cycle and the long-term metrics point to that trend continuing. 
Now a review of our Offshore segment, third -- for the third fiscal quarter, where Offshore operating income decreased approximately $2.1 million to $7.7 million. And the outlook for our Offshore segment as of today, the Offshore segment has 7 rigs active and 2 rigs stacked, although one of the stacked rigs is expected to mobilize in the fourth fiscal quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect Offshore revenue days to increase by 10% to 15% and margin per day to increase by 15% to 20%, as one recently mobilized rig goes to a full operating rate in August and an additional rig begins mobilizing in August as well. 
The International Land segment, the results from the second fiscal quarter to the third fiscal quarter increased by approximately $7.2 million. The primary factors driving the increase were activity and margins, revenue days increase 5% to 1,852 days, average rig margin per day increased $2,820 to $7,704 per day. Included in this average, rig margin per day is approximately $800 per day of net positive one-off retroactive adjustments. 
Now, the outlook for the International segment as of July 27. The company's International Land fleet has 29 total rigs, 23 are working and additional 3 rigs are under contract, with activity ranging from waiting on location to rigging up and 3 conventional 3,000-horsepower rigs are stacked in Argentina. Of the contracted rigs, 7 are in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 in both Abu Dhabi and Tunisia. The mobilization of the 2 FlexRig3s from our new build facility in Houston to Abu Dhabi is on schedule. 
The first rig has spud its first well and the second rig should spud mid-August. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we expect International Land revenue days to increase by 5% to 10% and average daily margin to be down 10% to 15%, primarily due to the absence of the positive one-offs in the previous quarter. In closing, and as we think about the current uncertainty in the industry, our efforts will continue to be directed toward delivering compelling performance for our customers and shareholders. Our people, processes and FlexRig technology create a competitive advantage for the company. The shift to drilling more complex unconventional resource plays that require the drilling at horizontal and directional wells only magnifies our competitive advantage. There is indisputable evidence that a large percentage of the old conventional rigs and lower-end technology product offerings are being displaced by new technology AC drive rigs. This replacement cycle provides additional market share capture for H&P and especially in a soft commodity price environment. 
And now, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

They have plans for those rigs, and in a lot of cases, as I have mentioned before, the plan is to high grade the rig fleet when those rigs are delivered. As far as the other rigs, and it's really very similar in the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, you're looking at a relatively small number of rigs, and typically, the rigs have very -- I think last quarter it was 45 days on average and I don't know what the average days are left on for fourth quarter thus far, but they're reaching the end of their term. And so if you think about what our customers are doing in general is, they're looking at their rig fleets and then they're trying to figure out what rigs make the most sense. They have other rigs that are on term contracts as well, and so a lot of times it just happens to be that because of the budget discipline that I described, you just kind of be the one that's left without a contract and they end up early terminating it. So it's a relatively small number of days left on the term contract in these cases. It isn't like what we saw in '08 and '09, where we saw multiyear term contracts being early terminated and there was no work to be done. That's not the case here. There's work to be done, it's just in a different budget cycle. They're just looking at trimming budgets."

I think you hit on the most important element in your question in terms of oil prices and what level they're perceived to be at so going forward. So I think, psychologically, when we saw oil prices, WTI get under $80, it caused quite a bit of pause. And I think, certainly, people are looking at the last part of their 2012 budgets, but I don't think it might be as bad as you suggest just in terms of, hey, let's just kind of store up and wait until '13. I think people are trying to wade through the uncertainties, watching oil prices closely. One of the things we do here from customers is they don't want to over correct on the downside where they try to spool up too much. And like I said, over correcting that regard, so I think it's going to be oil price driven but not quite as bad as people might think."

And like what Juan Pablo said, when we saw the very early indications in the first part of the quarter, they were at similar levels to the prior quarter and slightly elevated from that. And we knew we had a focus on cost reduction in the field that had not gained much traction at that point. So we elected to let you guys know what we saw in terms of the visibility we had at the time. The last 6 weeks of the quarter, we did get some traction and things improved. And so there's a little bit of we'll do more of that and that's our intention, but we've also tried to make clear for the last couple of calls that the volatility and the rig rotation, it can drive some higher cost for us and it's not so easy to predict. And so if we have more rig rotation than we might have anticipated, like we mentioned before, you're going to have some issues on crew retention, you're going to take advantage to spend some money on a rig that's been working all out and it's going to drive some expenses. But clearly, we're being more focused and disciplined on that now and we would expect those efforts to continue to pay dividends. So the ranges that we gave going forward, again, I think John put it in the proper context, you look over a number of quarters and there are 240-plus rigs running out there and there are lots of moving parts, but I think we are gaining traction on improving on MNS and purchasing and cost management. And so we think that, that will be a benefit, but we also know that there's still some rotation and uncertainty. And so it's just we're doing our best to give you guys the best feel of what the go forward looks like, but that's the best we can do."

We are pleased to report record revenues and all-time high net income for 2012 fiscal year. During the year, we experienced substantial headwinds across the oilfield services sector in terms of volatile energy prices and a sharply declining gas rig count. It's a nice tribute to our people. And their dedication that allowed us to post several all-time high marks. For example 2012 was also our best safety year ever as the company continues to achieve the lowest recordable injury rate by a wide margin as compared to the industry and our largest competitors. Additional manufacturing and operating performance achievements set new standards during 2012 and acted to further underscore the company's organizational competencies and competitive advantages.
Speaking of organizational competency, it's easy to focus on FlexRigs on the number side of the equation, and over at the primary role that our folks play in our continuing success. But in fact this is very much a people business, and we are convinced that a strong culture is our most sustainable strategic advantage.
We think of culture of the business of encouraging genuine buy end, company-wide of our shared values, touchstones such as integrity, safety, innovation, teamwork and providing the framework and systems with the tools to see those values translated into improved field performance long-term value creation.
Our ability to recruit and retain the best people is a top priority to building on our success going forward. The proof shows up in lots of ways. Here's one interesting snapshot of the recent company service award, we recognized the lift of some of our employees. Listen to the regarding our on the ground experience.
In 2012, we have 911 employees with 10 or more years with H&P. We have 198, with 20 years or more; and then 69 with 30 years or more. Those maybe the numbers we're most proud of today. 
Before I turn back over to Juan Pablo and then to John Lindsay who you'll recall was promoted to President at our last board meeting, let first make some comments about the broader energy landscape as we head into 2013.
The volatility in the energy prices during 2012 from natural gas prices trade below $2 an MCF before improving significantly. However, NGL prices sank and oil prices dropped to $77 before recovering back to a range of $85 to $100 with current pricing on the low end of that range.
Our sense is that oil prices within that range will result in improved activity levels as customers begin to allocate their 2013 budget dollars. It's hard for us to see natural gas price -- prices increasing enough to add much incremental drilling activity early in 2013. In addition to a cold winter, we'd have the see stubborn the high production levels to ease off, and actually decline, and then gain a better understanding of the true scale that associated gas provides the market.
Finally, it's difficult to pinpoint the scope of the well backlog overhang. We expect customers to be patient during the first half of 2013 to allow these issues to play out more fully and to see their impact on natural gas pricing.
In addition to the energy pricing environment, improved drilling efficiencies are receiving more attention as a growing factor in sorting out the feature rig activity levels. 
Of course, drilling efficiencies is a theme we've been focused on for over 10 years, and it comes as no surprise that more and more operators see the potential of executing their drilling programs faster and with fewer rigs. As we expected, the bar is being raised for what constitutes a suitable rig and that squeeze will continue.
We have not only aggressively repositioned our fleet to nearly 100% AC rig offering. We've also delivered significantly better performance from those rigs. For instance, our footage per day has increased by over 50% from 2007 to 2012, while at the same time average well depth has increased by over 40%. As a result of the enhanced average cost per foot, we continue to drive a compelling value proposition for our customers.
And while the rest of the industry has added AC drive rigs of their U.S. land fleets, our top 3 competitors combined have officially retired more rigs than they have built since January of 2009. Another way to look at it is since the industry's rig count peak in 2008, our active U.S. land count has increased by 25%. Whereas the same 3 competitors have seen an average reduction of 25%.
Our expectation is that the drilling efficiency continues to be a driver for operators going forward, and that they will continue to provide attractive opportunities to service companies that deliver top performance. For H&P, we will expect the coming year to offer newbuild opportunities and the prospect to continue to lead the land industry in margins and activity levels.
Now I'm going to turn the call back to Juan Pablo."
278341,224006003,387799,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported a record level of $574 million of income from continuing operations for fiscal 2012, representing an increase of over 30% as compared to the prior year. We also reported all-time high level",482,"Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported a record level of $574 million of income from continuing operations for fiscal 2012, representing an increase of over 30% as compared to the prior year. We also reported all-time high levels of $581 million of net income and $3.15 billion of revenue for the fiscal year.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion during fiscal 2012, and our corresponding estimate for fiscal 2013 is at this point, $740 million. Approximately 50% of this CapEx estimate is related to our newbuild programs, about 30% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to tubulars and special products.
The portion allocated to our newbuild program includes the completion of new FlexRigs that are already under long-term contracts, as well as capital components and fares to either service existing rigs or be used to complete and deploy additional rigs.
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1 billion during fiscal 2012, including approximately $200 million in deferred income taxes. We benefited from these deferred income taxes largely as a result of the deduction for accelerated bonus depreciation used in determining our cash tax obligation. Assuming that the accelerated bonus depreciation is not extended, we estimate that our net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2013 will benefit from approximately $40 million in deferred income taxes. We expect at this point to be able to fully fund our fiscal 2013 CapEx program, as well as other scheduled commitments from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities during the fiscal year.
With a very strong debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 6%, the company's debt levels declined to $235 million at the end of the fiscal year, including $40 million scheduled for payment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
As reported in our consolidated financial statement, depreciation expense for fiscal 2012 was approximately $388 million. This amount included approximately $16 million of abandonment charges, most of which impacted our fourth fiscal quarter as described in our press release. Given the continuing growth of our fleet, we expect our total annual depreciation expense to increase to approximately $450 million during fiscal 2013. As the company continues to grow, general and administrative expenses are also expected to increase to approximately $115 million during fiscal 2013. Nevertheless, interest expense after capitalized interest is expected to decrease to approximately $7 million during the fiscal year. 
Our investment portfolio, comprised of 8 million shares of Atwood Oceanics and 967,500 shares of Schlumberger, recently had a pretax market value of approximately $440 million and an after-tax value of approximately $280 million.
Our effective tax rate for continuing operations during fiscal 2012 was reported at approximately 36.5%, and at this point we expect a similar rate for fiscal 2013.
I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay. And after John's comments, we will open the call for questions. John?"
278341,224006003,387799,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on the results for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, offshore and international land for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, as well as our outlook for the first fiscal quarter of",1490,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on the results for our 3 operating segments, U.S. land, offshore and international land for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, as well as our outlook for the first fiscal quarter of 2013. I'll begin with our U.S. Land segment, where revenue days decreased marginally to 21,951 days representing 239 average active rigs in the fourth quarter. Included in the active rigs is the delivery of 12 newbuild FlexRigs during the quarter, even though these new rigs were offset by previously active rigs becoming idle, AC drive FlexRigs maintained utilization levels above 95% for the quarter.
Of the 239 active rigs, an average of 157 rigs were working under term contracts and an average of 82 rigs were working in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day increased by $229 sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to $28,325 per day. Owed termination revenue accounted for approximately $208 per day in the fourth fiscal quarter as compared to approximately $140 per day in the third fiscal quarter.
Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter was approximately 7% higher than the average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. This difference is mostly attributable to the mix of rig types and regions in these 2 categories. Average rig expense per day decreased $717 per day to $12,620. Average rig margin per day increased by $946 per day to $15,705 per day. 
The outlook for the U.S. land segment continues to remain positive. Our newbuild FlexRigs program continues to lead the industry with on-time and under budget delivery. We have been delivering at a cadence of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month since October of 2011. Since October 1, 2012, the beginning of fiscal 2013, 7 FlexRigs have been completed.
Now in-contracted FlexRigs remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month through calendar year end and we plan to deliver 2 contracted FlexRigs per month in January and February of '13.
As of today, our U.S. land segment active rig counts is 237 rigs, which leads the U.S. land and active rigs. 234 out of the 237 rigs are AC drive rigs. Out of the 237 active rigs include 159 under term contracts and 78 operating in the spot market.
Of the 78 rigs in the spot market, 77 are FlexRigs. 
Our rig count bottomed toward the end of September at 230 active rigs and we believe our U.S. land rig activity is position to improve for the remainder of the calendar year and into the first calendar quarter of 2013.
The qualifiers for this assumption are that oil prices to remain strong provided WTI remains above $80 a barrel and natural gas prices remain in the $3.50 range. We also have 52 stacked rigs today, excluding the 6 conventional rigs that were decommissioned at the end of the fiscal year. Of the stacked rigs, 20 are AC drive FlexRigs, however, at least 6 of those of FlexRigs have commitments to begin operations before the end of December. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect average revenue days to be down approximately 2% as compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination fees, we expect average rig revenue per day in the first quarter to be roughly flat as spot day rates have only slightly declined during the last few months and should remain firm through the remainder of the quarter. Revenues from early terminations are expected to be under $1 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
Our term contract coverage remains strong. We already have an average of 158 rigs locked under term contracts for the first fiscal quarter of '13; 150 rigs for the second quarter of fiscal '13; and 141 and 97 rigs for all of fiscal '13 and for all of fiscal '14, respectively.
Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we expect the revenue per day for our rigs that are already on term contracts to increase by approximately $100 per day on average in the first fiscal quarter of 2013 and by approximately $250 per day on average for fiscal '13. Both of these increases are as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012.
Our guidance continue to work very hard to provide exceptional service to our customers and at the same time control costs. We were very pleased with the expense per day results during the last 2 quarters and expect average rig expense per day for the first fiscal quarter of 2013 to be in the $13,200 per day range. As a reminder during the 2012 fiscal year, expense per day has ranged from $12,292 to $13,826 per day. 
We believe the continued expense per day improvements over the past 2 quarters are a result of our improved systems, supply chain processes and procurement to name a few. We are convinced that we will continue to improve our processes, nonetheless, our average rig expense per day will probably continue to experience quarter-to-quarter volatility as the timing of expenses can be influenced by many different factors.
And now I'll review our offshore segment for fiscal quarter results, where offshore operating income increased by approximately $4.3 million to $12 million as compared to the prior quarter. Revenue days increased by 15% to 695 days as 2 rigs returned to work. Average rig margin per day increased by $6,429, and sequentially to $23,330 per day. The increase was mostly attributable to rigs completing mobilization and commencing drilling operations.
Earnings from management contracts declined by approximately $1 million to $1.2 million primarily as a result of 2 rigs moving to coal stacked rates. Our outlook offshore as of today, the company's offshore segment has 8 rigs active and 1 rigs stacked. As compared to the prior quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to increase by approximately 5% and margin per day to be roughly flat during the first quarter of fiscal '13. We expect pretax earnings for management contracts to be flat at slightly over $1 million during the first fiscal quarter. 
Now, I'll review of our international, where our international land segment operating income results from the third fiscal quarter to the fourth fiscal quarter increased by approximately $1 million. The primary factors driving the increase were increased activity in margins. Revenue days increased 8% to 2,001 days as 4 contracted rigs commenced drilling operations during the fourth fiscal quarter.
Average rig margin per day increased $506 to $8,210 per day, which was mostly attributable to reduced mobilization and start-up costs as compared to the third fiscal quarter. Now the outlook for international as of today the company's international land segment has 26 rigs working, of which 16 are AC drive FlexRigs. 7 rigs are active in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 both in UAE and Tunisia. All 3 idle rigs are 3,000 horsepower conventional rigs located in Argentina.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect international land revenue days to increase approximately 15% and average daily margin to be down approximately 10% primarily due to downtime in labor interruptions in Argentina.
Now that completes the operating segment remarks, and I will conclude with a few examples why we believe current market conditions present an opportunity for H&P to gain market share.
First, we've picked up 10 new FlexRigs customers during the past 12 months. You may recall after the '08 downturn when activity began to improve, we were able to attract more than 20 new FlexRig customers. These new customers have shown a desire to hydrate their rig fleets because of efficiency gains for AC drive FlexRigs.
Second, there's evidence the replacement cycle is continuing. During the past 12 months, the overall U.S. land rig count has decreased by approximately 230 rigs. And yet the AC drive rig count has increased by approximately 70 rigs, indicating AC market share has increased. And overall U.S. AC utilization remains above 85%. Combined, the SCR and mechanical rig counts decreased in total by 300 rigs causing market share reductions and the combined SCR mechanical utilization today is below 60%. With approximately 15% of the AC rigs stacked in the U.S. today, rig count bifurcation is occurring, and we believe those AC rigs are better candidates to return to work before the recently stacked SCR and mechanical rigs will return to work.
Finally and looking ahead to 2013, H&P's efforts will continue to be directed toward delivering best-in-class safety and operational performance for our customers and shareholders. Our people, processes and FlexRig technology create competitive advantages for the company. And we believe this should continue to provide future opportunities to build new AC drive FlexRigs. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Juan Pablo."

And I think the questions are good relating to the expense numbers. And it's hard to give lots of specificity and details but I think and I hope one of the takes out takeaways is we've focused on this for the last year. As an organization, we're getting better at it. And we'll continue to put energy and effort into it. And I think the systems and the folks we have done a great job in managing that, so we're encouraged by that even though as we talked about a range and some of the moving parts, particularly I think John mentioned, the reactivation as we get the guys trained up and get those rigs out in top notch that will drive some of expenses. But now to move to your question related to the CapEx and how it might impact our manufacturing plants and efforts. I think just to remind folks, we've got 9 rigs left to deliver, 5 of those come out in '12, 4 in '13. John mentioned we'll 2 contracted rigs roll off in January and 2 in February. So as we contemplate our CapEx for the year and as what happens from March on, our model and our preference is to have fully contracted rigs. I think in a market like this where we've had a lull for a period of months, we've seen this happen before. And oftentimes as visibility improves and operators respond to a better outlook, we can see a pop back, if you will, after a lull like that. So we what our supply chain to be ready to respond to that. And I think we're in good shape in that respect. We've talked before about the need for capital spares and unitizing some parts and pieces that will support the rig fleet of our size. As we have an active and robust manufacturing effort, we're able to drive those kind of a near 0 status because we can pull that out of the manufacturing queue. If we see things slow down and it'll certainly slowdown in '13, then we will spend some time and effort in dollars having capital spares at the ready. Those can transition into equipment kits and potential newbuilds. So I think maybe lastly, we've had conversations with the folks about, if we get into March, a good position of not having to make a decision now but one of the nice things about the flexibility of our manufacturing effort is as we look to March and forward, would we be willing to capture the continuity, value of a dialback manufacturing effort? And we would certainly consider that. So if that meant 1 or 2 rigs per month for a very short period of time, then we would give that consideration. But we're not at the point where we have the decide that. So that's kind of I hope some color on your question."

278341,224006003,388126,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo.

We are pleased to report record revenues and all-time high net income for 2012 fiscal year. During the year that experienced substantial headwinds across the oilfield service sector in terms of volatile energy prices and a sharply declining gas-directed rig count. It's a nice tribute to our people and their dedication that allowed us to post several all-time high marks. For example, 2012 was also our best safety year ever as the company continues to achieve the lowest recordable injury rate by a wide margin as compared to the industry and our largest competitors. Additional manufacturing and operating performance achievements set new standards during 2012 and acted to further underscore the company's organizational competencies and competitive advantages.
Speaking of organizational competency, it's easy to focus on FlexRigs on the number side of the equation and overlook the primary role that our folks play in our continuing success. But in fact, this is very much a people business, and we are convinced that a strong culture is our most sustainable strategic advantage. We think of culture as the business of encouraging genuine buy-in, company-wide, of our shared values, touchstones such as integrity, safety, innovation, teamwork then providing the framework and the systems with the tools to see those values translated into improved field performance, long-term value creation.
Our ability to recruit and retain the best people is a top priority to building on our success going forward. The proof shows up in lots of ways. Here's one interesting snapshot. At a recent company service award dinner, we recognized the loyalty of some of our long-service employees. 
Listen to the totals regarding our on-the-ground experience. In 2012, we have 911 employees with 10 or more years with H&P; we have 198 with 20 years or more; and then 69 with 30 years or more. Those may be the numbers we're most proud of today. 
Before I turn the call back over to Juan Pablo and then to John Lindsay who, you will recall, was deservedly promoted to President at our last board meeting, let me first make some comments about the broader energy landscape as we head into 2013. The volatility in the energy prices during 2012  saw natural gas prices trade below $2 an Mcf before improving significantly. However, NGL prices sank and oil prices dropped to $77 before recovering back to a range of $85 to $100 with current pricing on the low end of that range. Our sense is that oil prices within that range will result in improved activity levels as customers begin to allocate their 2013 budget dollars. 
It's hard for us to see natural gas price -- prices increasing enough to add much incremental drilling activity early in 2013. In addition to a cold winter, we'd have the see stubbornly high production levels ease off and actually decline and then gain a better understanding of the true scale that associated gas provides the market. Finally, it's difficult to pinpoint the scope of the well backlog overhang. We expect customers to be patient during the first half of 2013 to allow these issues to play out more fully and to see their impact on natural gas pricing.
In addition to the energy pricing environment, improved drilling efficiencies are receiving more attention as a growing factor in sorting out the future rig activity levels. Of course, drilling efficiency is a theme we've been focused on for over 10 years, and it comes as no surprise that more and more operators see the potential of executing their drilling programs faster and with fewer rigs. As we expected, the bar is being raised for what constitutes a suitable rig and that squeeze will continue.
We have not only aggressively repositioned our fleet to nearly 100% AC rig offering, we've also delivered significantly better performance from those rigs. For instance, our footage per day has increased by over 50% from 2007 to 2012, while at the same time average well depth has increased by over 40%. As a result of the enhanced average cost per foot, we continue to drive a compelling value proposition for our customers. And while the rest of the industry has added AC drive rigs to their U.S. land fleets, our top 3 competitors, combined, have officially retired more rigs than they have built since January of 2009. 
Another way to look at it is since the industry's rig count peak in 2008, our active U.S. land count has increased by 25% whereas the same 3 competitors have seen an average reduction of 25%.
Our expectation is that the drilling efficiency continues to be a driver for operators going forward, that they will continue to provide attractive opportunities to service companies that deliver top performance. For H&P, we would expect the coming year to offer new build opportunities and the prospect to continue to lead the land industry in margins and activity levels.
Now I'm going to turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

As announced earlier today, the company reported a record level of $574 million of income from continuing operations for fiscal 2012, representing an increase of over 30% as compared to the prior year. We also reported all-time high level",484,"Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported a record level of $574 million of income from continuing operations for fiscal 2012, representing an increase of over 30% as compared to the prior year. We also reported all-time high levels of $581 million of net income and $3.15 billion of revenue for the fiscal year.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion during fiscal 2012, and our corresponding estimate for fiscal 2013 is, at this point, $740 million. Approximately 50% of this CapEx estimate is related to our new build programs, about 30% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to tubulars and special projects.
The portion allocated to our new build program includes the completion of new FlexRigs that are already under long-term contracts, as well as capital components and spares to either service existing rigs or be used to complete and deploy additional rigs.
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1 billion during fiscal 2012, including approximately $200 million in deferred income taxes. We benefited from these deferred income taxes largely as a result of the deduction for accelerated bonus depreciation used in determining our cash tax obligations. Assuming that the accelerated bonus depreciation is not extended, we estimate that our net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2013 will benefit from approximately $40 million in deferred income taxes. We expect at this point to be able to fully fund our fiscal 2013 CapEx program, as well as other scheduled commitments from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities during the fiscal year. 
With a very strong debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 6%, the company's debt level declined to $235 million at the end of the fiscal year, including $40 million scheduled for payment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
As reported in our consolidated financial statement, depreciation expense for fiscal 2012 was approximately $388 million. This amount included approximately $16 million of abandonment charges, most of which impacted our fourth fiscal quarter as described in our press release. Given the continuing growth of our fleet, we expect our total annual depreciation expense to increase to approximately $450 million during fiscal 2013. 
As the company continues to grow, general and administrative expenses are also expected to increase to approximately $115 million during fiscal 2013. Nevertheless, interest expense, after capitalized interest, is expected to decrease to approximately $7 million during the fiscal year. 
Our investment portfolio, comprised of 8 million shares of Atwood Oceanics and 967,500 shares of Schlumberger, recently had a pretax market value of approximately $440 million and an after-tax value of approximately $280 million.
Our effective tax rate for continuing operations during fiscal 2012 was reported at approximately 36.5%, and at this point, we expect a similar rate for fiscal 2013.

278341,224006003,388126,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on the results for our 3 operating segments, U. S. land, offshore and international land for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, as well as our outlook for the first fiscal quarter o",1482,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on the results for our 3 operating segments, U. S. land, offshore and international land for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, as well as our outlook for the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
I'll begin with our U.S. land segment where revenue days decreased marginally to 21,951 days, representing 239 average active rigs in the fourth quarter. Included in the active rigs is the delivery of 12 new build FlexRigs during the quarter. Even though these new rigs were offset by previously active rigs becoming idle, AC drive FlexRigs maintained utilization levels above 95% for the quarter.
Of the 239 active rigs, an average of 157 rigs were working under term contracts and an average of 82 rigs were working in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day increased by $229 sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to $28,325 per day. Early termination revenue accounted for approximately $280 per day in the fourth fiscal quarter as compared to approximately $140 per day in the third fiscal quarter.
Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter was approximately 7% higher than the average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. This difference is mostly attributable to the mix of rig types and regions in these 2 categories. Average rig expense per day decreased $717 per day to $12,620. Average rig margin per day increased by $946 per day to $15,705 per day. 
The outlook for the U.S. land segment continues to remain positive. Our new build FlexRig program continues to lead the industry with on-time and under budget delivery. We have been delivering at a cadence of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month since October of 2011. Since October 1, 2012, the beginning of fiscal 2013, 7 FlexRigs have been completed.
Nine contracted FlexRigs remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month through calendar year end, and we plan to deliver 2 contracted FlexRigs per month in January and February of '13.
As of today, our U.S. land segment active rig count is 237 rigs, which leads the U.S. land in active rigs, 234 out of the 237 rigs are AC drive rigs. The 237 active rigs include 159 under term contracts and 78 operating in the spot market. Of the 78 rigs in the spot market, 77 are FlexRigs. 
Our rig count bottomed toward the end of September at 230 active rigs, and we believe our U.S. land rig activity is positioned to improve for the remainder of the calendar year and into the first calendar quarter of 2013.
The qualifiers for this assumption are that oil prices remain strong, provided WTI remains above $80 a barrel and natural gas prices remain in the $3.50 range. 
We also have 52 stacked rigs today, excluding the 6 conventional rigs that were decommissioned at the end of the fiscal year. Of the stacked rigs, 20 are AC drive FlexRigs. However, at least 6 of those of FlexRigs have commitments to begin operations before the end of December. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect average revenue days to be down approximately 2% as compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination fees, we expect average rig revenue per day in the first quarter to be roughly flat as spot day rates have only slightly declined during the last few months and should remain firm through the remainder of the quarter. Revenues from early terminations are expected to be under $1 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
Our term contract coverage remains strong. We already have an average of 158 rigs locked under term contracts for the first fiscal quarter of '13; 150 rigs for the second quarter of fiscal '13; and 141 and 97 rigs for all of fiscal '13 and for all of fiscal '14, respectively.
Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we expect the revenue per day for our rigs that are already on term contracts to increase by approximately $100 per day, on average, in the first fiscal quarter of 2013 and by approximately $250 per day, on average, for fiscal '13. Both of these increases are as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012.
Our guys continue to work very hard to provide exceptional service to our customers, and at the same time, control costs. We were very pleased with the expense-per-day results during the last 2 quarters and expect average rig expense per day for the first fiscal quarter of 2013 to be in the $13,200 per day range. 
As a reminder, during the 2012 fiscal year, expense per day has ranged from $12,292 to $13,826 per day. 
We believe the continued expense-per-day improvements over the past 2 quarters are a result of our improved systems, supply chain processes and procurement, to name a few. We are convinced that we will continue to improve our processes. Nonetheless, our average rig expense per day will probably continue to experience quarter-to-quarter volatility as the timing of expenses can be influenced by many different factors.
And now, I'll review our offshore segment for fiscal quarter results where offshore operating income increased by approximately $4.3 million to $12 million as compared to the prior quarter. Revenue days increased by 15% to 695 days as 2 rigs returned to work. Average rig margin per day increased by $6,429, and sequentially, to $23,330 per day. The increase was mostly attributable to rigs completing mobilization and commencing drilling operations.
Earnings from management contracts declined by approximately $1 million to $1.2 million, primarily as a result of 2 rigs moving to cold-stacked rigs. 
Our outlook for offshore. As of today, the company's offshore segment has 8 rigs active and 1 rigs stacked. As compared to the prior quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to increase by approximately 5% and margin per day to be roughly flat during the first quarter of fiscal '13. 
We expect pretax earnings for management contracts to be flat at slightly over $1 million during the first fiscal quarter. 
Now, a review of our international where international land segment operating income results from the third fiscal quarter to the fourth fiscal quarter increased by approximately $1 million. The primary factors driving the increase were increased activity in margins. Revenue days increased 8% to 2,001 days as 4 contracted rigs commenced drilling operations during the fourth fiscal quarter. Average rig margin per day increased $506 to $8,210 per day, which was mostly attributable to reduced mobilization and start-up costs as compared to the third fiscal quarter. 
The outlook for international. As of today, the company's international land segment has 26 rigs working, of which 16 are AC drive FlexRigs. Seven rigs are active in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 both in UAE and Tunisia. All 3 idle rigs are 3,000-horsepower conventional rigs located in Argentina.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect international land revenue days to increase approximately 15% and average daily margin to be down approximately 10%, primarily due to downtime in labor interruptions in Argentina.
Now that completes the operating segment remarks, and I will conclude with a few examples why we believe current market conditions present an opportunity for H&P to gain market share.
First, we've picked up 10 new FlexRig customers during the past 12 months. You may recall, after the '08 downturn when activity began to improve, we were able to attract more than 20 new FlexRig customers. These new customers have shown a desire to high-grade their rig fleets because of efficiency gains for AC drive FlexRigs.
Second, there's evidence the replacement cycle is continuing. During the past 12 months, the overall U.S. land rig count has decreased by approximately 230 rigs and yet the AC drive rig count has increased by approximately 70 rigs, indicating AC market share has increased, and overall, U.S. AC utilization remains above 85%. Combined, the SCR and mechanical rig counts decreased in total by 300 rigs, causing market share reductions, and the combined SCR mechanical utilization today is below 60%. With approximately 15% of the AC rigs stacked in the U.S. today, rig count bifurcation is occurring, and we believe those AC rigs are better candidates to return to work before the recently stacked SCR and mechanical rigs will return to work.
Finally, and looking ahead to 2013, H&P's efforts will continue to be directed toward delivering best-in-class safety and operational performance for our customers and shareholders. Our people, processes and FlexRig technology create competitive advantages for the company, and we believe this should continue to provide future opportunities to build new AC drive FlexRigs. 
And now, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

And I think the questions are good relating to the expense numbers, and it's hard to give lots of specificity and details, but I think and I hope one of the takeaways is we've focused on this for the last year. As an organization, we're getting better at it. We'll continue to put energy and effort into it, and I think the systems and the folks we have are doing a great job in managing that. So we're encouraged by that even though as we talked about a range in some of the moving parts particularly, I think, and John mentioned, the reactivation as we get the guys trained up and get those rigs out in top notch, that will drive some uncertain expenses. But now to move to your question related to the CapEx and how it might impact our manufacturing plans and efforts, I think just to remind folks, we've got 9 rigs left to deliver, 5 of those come out in '12, 4 in '13. John mentioned we'll have 2 contracted rigs roll off in January and 2 in February. So as we contemplate our CapEx for the year and as what happens from March on, our model and our preference is to have fully contracted rigs. I think in a market like this where we've had a lull for a period of months, we've seen this happen before, and oftentimes as visibility improves and operators respond to a better outlook, we can see a pop back, if you will, after a lull like that. So we want our supply chain to be ready to respond to that. And I think we're in good shape in that respect. We've talked before about the need for capital spares and unitizing some parts and pieces that will support a rig fleet of our size. As we have a active and robust manufacturing effort, we're able to drive those kind of a near 0 status because we can pull that out of the manufacturing queue. If we see things slow down, and they'll certainly slow down in '13, then we will spend some time and effort in dollars having capital spares at the ready. Those can transition into equipment kits and potential new builds. So I think, maybe lastly, we've had conversations with folks about, if we get into March, we're in a good position of not having to make a decision now. But one of the nice things about the flexibility of our manufacturing effort is as we look to March and forward, would we be willing to capture the continuity value of a dialed back manufacturing effort? And we would certainly consider that. And so, if that meant 1 or 2 rigs per month for a very short period of time, then we would give that consideration. But we're not at the point where we have to decide that. So that's kind of, I hope, some color on your question."

We are pleased to report record revenues and all-time high net income for our 2012 fiscal year.

We are pleased to report record revenues and all-time high net income for our 2012 fiscal year. During a year that experienced substantial headwinds across the oilfield service sector in terms of volatile energy prices and a sharply declining gas-directed rig count, it's a nice tribute to our people and their dedication that allowed us to post several all-time high marks. For example, 2012 was also our best safety year ever as the company continues to achieve the lowest recordable injury rate by a wide margin as compared to the industry and our largest competitors. Additional manufacturing and operating performance achievements set new standards during 2012 and acted to further underscore the company's organizational competencies and competitive advantages.
Speaking of organizational competency, it's easy to focus on FlexRigs and the number side of the equation and overlook the primary role that our folks play in our continuing success. But in fact, this is very much a people business, and we are convinced that a strong culture is our most sustainable strategic advantage. We think of culture as the business of encouraging genuine buy-in, company-wide, of our shared values, touchstones such as integrity, safety, innovation, teamwork, then providing the framework and the systems with the tools to see those values translated into improved field performance and long-term value creation.
Our ability to recruit and retain the best people is a top priority to building on our success going forward. The proof shows up in lots of ways. Here's one interesting snapshot. At a recent company service award dinner, we recognized the loyalty of some of our long-service employees. 
Listen to the totals regarding our on-the-ground experience. In 2012, we have 911 employees with 10 or more years with H&P; we have 198 with 20 years or more; and then 69 with 30 years or more. Those may be the numbers we're most proud of today. 
Before I turn the call back over to Juan Pablo and then to John Lindsay, who, you will recall, was deservedly promoted to President at our last board meeting, let me first make some comments about the broader energy landscape as we head into 2013. The volatility in the energy prices during 2012 saw natural gas prices trade below $2 an Mcf before improving significantly. However, NGL prices sank and oil prices dropped to $77 before recovering back to a range of $85 to $100, with current pricing on the low end of that range. Our sense is that oil prices within that range will result in improved activity levels as customers begin to allocate their 2013 budget dollars. 
It's hard for us to see natural gas price -- prices increasing enough to add much incremental drilling activity early in 2013. In addition to a cold winter, we'd have to see stubbornly high production levels ease off and actually decline and then gain a better understanding of the true scale that associated gas provides the market. Finally, it's difficult to pinpoint the scope of the well backlog overhang. We expect customers to be patient during the first half of 2013 to allow these issues to play out more fully and to see their impact on natural gas pricing.
In addition to the energy pricing environment, improved drilling efficiencies are receiving more attention as a growing factor in sorting out the future rig activity levels. Of course, drilling efficiency is a theme we've been focused on for over 10 years, and it comes as no surprise that more and more operators see the potential of executing their drilling programs faster and with fewer rigs. As we expected, the bar is being raised for what constitutes a suitable rig and that squeeze will continue.
We have not only aggressively repositioned our fleet to nearly 100% AC rig offering, but we've also delivered significantly better performance from those rigs. For instance, our footage per day has increased by over 50% from 2007 to 2012, while at the same time average well depth has increased by over 40%. As a result of the enhanced average cost per foot, we continue to drive a compelling value proposition for our customers. And while the rest of the industry has added AC drive rigs to their U.S. land fleets, our top 3 competitors, combined, have officially retired more rigs than they have built since January of 2009. 
Another way to look at it is, since the industry's rig count peaked in 2008, our active U.S. land count has increased by 25% ,whereas the same 3 competitors have seen an average reduction of 25%.
Our expectation is that the drilling efficiency continues to be a driver for operators going forward, and that they will continue to provide attractive opportunities to service companies that deliver top performance. For H&P, we would expect the coming year to offer new build opportunities and the prospect to continue to lead the land industry in margins and activity levels.
Now I'm going to turn the call back to Juan Pablo."
278341,224006003,388288,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported a record level of $574 million of income from continuing operations for fiscal 2012, representing an increase of over 30% as compared to the prior year. We also reported all-time high level",484,"Thank you, Hans. As announced earlier today, the company reported a record level of $574 million of income from continuing operations for fiscal 2012, representing an increase of over 30% as compared to the prior year. We also reported all-time high levels of $581 million of net income and $3.15 billion of revenue for the fiscal year.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion during fiscal 2012, and our corresponding estimate for fiscal 2013 is, at this point, $740 million. Approximately 50% of this CapEx estimate is related to our new build programs, about 30% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to tubulars and special projects. The portion allocated to our new build program includes the completion of new FlexRigs that are already under long-term contracts, as well as capital components and spares to either service existing rigs or be used to complete and deploy additional rigs.
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1 billion during fiscal 2012, including approximately $200 million in deferred income taxes. We benefited from these deferred income taxes largely as a result of the deduction for accelerated bonus depreciation used in determining our cash tax obligations. Assuming that the accelerated bonus depreciation is not extended, we estimate that our net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2013 will benefit from approximately $40 million in deferred income taxes. We expect at this point to be able to fully fund our fiscal 2013 CapEx program, as well as other scheduled commitments from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities during the fiscal year. 
With a very strong debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 6%, the company's debt level declined to $235 million at the end of the fiscal year, including $40 million scheduled for payment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
As reported in our consolidated financial statements, depreciation expense for fiscal 2012 was approximately $388 million. This amount included approximately $16 million of abandonment charges, most of which impacted our fourth fiscal quarter as described in our press release. Given the continuing growth of our fleet, we expect our total annual depreciation expense to increase to approximately $450 million during fiscal 2013. 
As the company continues to grow, general and administrative expenses are also expected to increase to approximately $115 million during fiscal 2013. Nevertheless, interest expense, after capitalized interest, is expected to decrease to approximately $7 million during the fiscal year. 
Our investment portfolio, comprised of 8 million shares of Atwood Oceanics and 967,500 shares of Schlumberger, recently had a pretax market value of approximately $440 million and an after-tax value of approximately $280 million.
Our effective tax rate for continuing operations during fiscal 2012 was reported at approximately 36.5%, and at this point, we expect a similar rate for fiscal 2013.
I will now turn the call over to John Lindsay. And after John's comments, we will open the call for questions. John?"
278341,224006003,388288,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on the results for our 3 operating segments, U. S. land, offshore and international land, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, as well as our outlook for the first fiscal quarter",1477,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on the results for our 3 operating segments, U. S. land, offshore and international land, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, as well as our outlook for the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
I'll begin with our U.S. land segment, where revenue days decreased marginally to 21,951 days, representing 239 average active rigs in the fourth quarter. Included in the active rigs is the delivery of 12 new build FlexRigs during the quarter. Even though these new rigs were offset by previously active rigs becoming idle, AC drive FlexRigs maintained utilization levels above 95% for the quarter.
Of the 239 active rigs, an average of 157 rigs were working under term contracts and an average of 82 rigs were working in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day increased by $229 sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to $28,325 per day. Early termination revenue accounted for approximately $280 per day in the fourth fiscal quarter as compared to approximately $140 per day in the third fiscal quarter.
Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter was approximately 7% higher than the average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. This difference is mostly attributable to the mix of rig types and regions in these 2 categories. Average rig expense per day decreased $717 per day to $12,620. Average rig margin per day increased by $946 per day to $15,705 per day. 
The outlook for the U.S. land segment continues to remain positive. Our new build FlexRig program continues to lead the industry with on-time and under budget delivery. We have been delivering at a cadence of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month since October of 2011. Since October 1, 2012, the beginning of fiscal 2013, 7 FlexRigs have been completed.
Nine contracted FlexRigs remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month through calendar year end, and we plan to deliver 2 contracted FlexRigs per month in January and February of '13.
As of today, our U.S. land segment active rig count is 237 rigs, which leads the U.S. land in active rigs. 234 out of the 237 rigs are AC drive rigs. The 237 active rigs include 159 under term contracts and 78 operating in the spot market. Of the 78 rigs in the spot market, 77 are FlexRigs.
Our rig count bottomed toward the end of September at 230 active rigs, and we believe our U.S. land rig activity is positioned to improve for the remainder of the calendar year and into the first calendar quarter of 2013. The qualifiers for this assumption are that oil prices remain strong, provided WTI remains above $80 a barrel and natural gas prices remain in the $3.50 range. 
We also have 52 stacked rigs today, excluding the 6 conventional rigs that were decommissioned at the end of the fiscal year. Of the stacked rigs, 20 are AC drive FlexRigs. However, at least 6 of those of FlexRigs have commitments to begin operations before the end of December. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect average revenue days to be down approximately 2% as compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination fees, we expect average rig revenue per day in the first quarter to be roughly flat as spot day rates have only slightly declined during the last few months and should remain firm through the remainder of the quarter. Revenues from early terminations are expected to be under $1 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
Our term contract coverage remains strong. We already have an average of 158 rigs locked under term contracts for the first fiscal quarter of '13; 150 rigs for the second quarter of fiscal '13; and 141 and 97 rigs for all of fiscal '13 and for all of fiscal '14, respectively.
Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we expect revenue per day for our rigs that are already on term contracts to increase by approximately $100 per day, on average, in the first fiscal quarter of 2013 and by approximately $250 per day, on average, for fiscal '13. Both of these increases are as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012.
Our guys continue to work very hard to provide exceptional service to our customers, and at the same time, control costs. We were very pleased with the expense-per-day results during the last 2 quarters and expect average rig expense per day for the first fiscal quarter of 2013 to be in the $13,200-per-day range. As a reminder, during the 2012 fiscal year, expense per day has ranged from $12,292 to $13,826 per day. 
We believe the continued expense-per-day improvements over the past 2 quarters are a result of our improved systems, supply chain processes and procurement, to name a few. We are convinced that we will continue to improve our processes. Nonetheless, our average rig expense per day will probably continue to experience quarter-to-quarter volatility as the timing of expenses can be influenced by many different factors.
And now, I'll review our offshore segment fourth fiscal quarter results, where offshore operating income increased by approximately $4.3 million to $12 million as compared to the prior quarter. Revenue days increased by 15% to 695 days as 2 rigs returned to work. Average rig margin per day increased by $6,429 sequentially to $23,330 per day. The increase was mostly attributable to rigs completing mobilization and commencing drilling operations.
Earnings from management contracts declined by approximately $1 million to $1.2 million, primarily as a result of 2 rigs moving to cold-stacked rates. 
Our outlook for offshore. As of today, the company's offshore segment has 8 rigs active and 1 rig stacked. As compared to the prior quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to increase by approximately 5% and margin per day to be roughly flat during the first quarter of fiscal '13. We expect pretax earnings for management contracts to be flat at slightly over $1 million during the first fiscal quarter. 
Now a review of our international, where international land segment operating income results from the third fiscal quarter to the fourth fiscal quarter increased by approximately $1 million. The primary factors driving the increase were increased activity and margins. Revenue days increased 8% to 2,001 days as 4 contracted rigs commenced drilling operations during the fourth fiscal quarter. Average rig margin per day increased $506 to $8,210 per day, which was mostly attributable to reduced mobilization and start-up costs as compared to the third fiscal quarter. 
The outlook for international. As of today, the company's international land segment has 26 rigs working, of which 16 are AC drive FlexRigs. Seven rigs are active in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 both in UAE and Tunisia. All 3 idle rigs are 3,000-horsepower conventional rigs located in Argentina. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect international land revenue days to increase approximately 15% and average daily margin to be down approximately 10%, primarily due to downtime and labor interruptions in Argentina.
Now that completes the operating segment remarks, and I will conclude with a few examples why we believe current market conditions present an opportunity for H&P to gain market share.
First, we've picked up 10 new FlexRig customers during the past 12 months. You may recall, after the '08 downturn when activity began to improve, we were able to attract more than 20 new FlexRig customers. These new customers have shown a desire to high-grade their rig fleets because of efficiency gains for AC drive FlexRigs.
Second, there's evidence the replacement cycle is continuing. During the past 12 months, the overall U.S. land rig count has decreased by approximately 230 rigs and yet the AC drive rig count has increased by approximately 70 rigs, indicating AC market share has increased, and overall U.S. AC utilization remains above 85%. Combined, the SCR and mechanical rig counts decreased in total by 300 rigs, causing market share reductions, and the combined SCR/mechanical utilization today is below 60%. With approximately 15% of the AC rigs stacked in the U.S. today, rig count bifurcation is occurring, and we believe those AC rigs are better candidates to return to work before the recently stacked SCR and mechanical rigs will return to work.
Finally, and looking ahead to 2013, H&P's efforts will continue to be directed toward delivering best-in-class safety and operational performance for our customers and shareholders. Our people, processes and FlexRig technology create competitive advantages for the company, and we believe this should continue to provide future opportunities to build new AC drive FlexRigs. 
And now, I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

And I think the questions are good relating to the expense numbers, and it's hard to give lots of specificity and details, but I think and I hope one of the takeaways is we've focused on this for the last year. As an organization, we're getting better at it. We'll continue to put energy and effort into it, and I think the systems and the folks we have are doing a great job in managing that. So we're encouraged by that even though as we talked about a range in some of the moving parts particularly, I think, and John mentioned, the reactivation, as we get guys trained up and get those rigs out and top notch, that will drive some uncertain expenses. But now to move to your question related to the CapEx and how it might impact our manufacturing plans and efforts, I think just to remind folks, we've got 9 rigs left to deliver. 5 of those come out in '12, 4 in '13. John mentioned we'll have 2 contracted rigs roll off in January and 2 in February. So as we contemplate our CapEx for the year and ask what happens from March on, our model and our preference is to have fully contracted rigs. I think in a market like this where we've had a lull for a period of months, we've seen this happen before, and oftentimes as visibility improves and operators respond to a better outlook, we can see a pop back, if you will, after a lull like that. So we want our supply chain to be ready to respond to that. And I think we're in good shape in that respect. We've talked before about the need for capital spares and unitizing some parts and pieces that will support a rig fleet of our size. As we have a active and robust manufacturing effort, we're able to drive those to kind of a near 0 status because we can pull that out of the manufacturing queue. If we see things slow down, and they'll certainly slow down in '13, then we will spend some time and effort and dollars having capital spares at the ready. Those can transition into equipment kits and potential new builds. So I think, maybe lastly, we've had conversations with folks about, if we get into March -- we're in a good position of not having to make a decision now. But one of the nice things about the flexibility of our manufacturing effort is as we look to March and forward, would we be willing to capture the continuity value of a dialed back manufacturing effort? And we would certainly consider that. And so, if that meant 1 or 2 rigs per month for a very short period of time, then we would give that consideration. But we're not at the point where we have to decide that. So that's kind of, I hope, some color on your question."

We are pleased to report record revenues and all-time high net income for our 2012 fiscal year. During a year that experienced substantial headwinds across the oilfield service sector in terms of volatile energy prices and a sharply",835,"Thank you, Juan Pablo. We are pleased to report record revenues and all-time high net income for our 2012 fiscal year. During a year that experienced substantial headwinds across the oilfield service sector in terms of volatile energy prices and a sharply declining gas-directed rig count, it's a nice tribute to our people and their dedication that allowed us to post several all-time high marks. For example, 2012 was also our best safety year ever as the company continues to achieve the lowest recordable injury rate by a wide margin as compared to the industry and our largest competitors. Additional manufacturing and operating performance achievements set new standards during 2012 and acted to further underscore the company's organizational competencies and competitive advantages.
Speaking of organizational competency, it's easy to focus on FlexRigs and the number side of the equation and overlook the primary role that our folks play in our continuing success. But in fact, this is very much a people business, and we are convinced that a strong culture is our most sustainable strategic advantage. We think of culture as the business of encouraging genuine buy-in, company-wide, of our shared values, touchstones such as integrity, safety, innovation, teamwork, then providing the framework and the systems with the tools to see those values translated into improved field performance and long-term value creation.
Our ability to recruit and retain the best people is a top priority to building on our success going forward. The proof shows up in lots of ways. Here's one interesting snapshot. At a recent company service award dinner, we recognized the loyalty of some of our long-service employees. 
Listen to the totals regarding our on-the-ground experience. In 2012, we have 911 employees with 10 or more years with H&P; we have 198 with 20 years or more; and then 69 with 30 years or more. Those may be the numbers we're most proud of today. 
Before I turn the call back over to Juan Pablo and then to John Lindsay, who, you will recall, was deservedly promoted to President at our last board meeting, let me first make some comments about the broader energy landscape as we head into 2013. The volatility in the energy prices during 2012 saw natural gas prices trade below $2 an Mcf before improving significantly. However, NGL prices sank and oil prices dropped to $77 before recovering back to a range of $85 to $100, with current pricing on the low end of that range. Our sense is that oil prices within that range will result in improved activity levels as customers begin to allocate their 2013 budget dollars. 
It's hard for us to see natural gas price -- prices increasing enough to add much incremental drilling activity early in 2013. In addition to a cold winter, we'd have to see stubbornly high production levels ease off and actually decline and then gain a better understanding of the true scale that associated gas provides the market. Finally, it's difficult to pinpoint the scope of the well backlog overhang. We expect customers to be patient during the first half of 2013 to allow these issues to play out more fully and to see their impact on natural gas pricing.
In addition to the energy pricing environment, improved drilling efficiencies are receiving more attention as a growing factor in sorting out the future rig activity levels. Of course, drilling efficiency is a theme we've been focused on for over 10 years, and it comes as no surprise that more and more operators see the potential of executing their drilling programs faster and with fewer rigs. As we expected, the bar is being raised for what constitutes a suitable rig and that squeeze will continue.
We have not only aggressively repositioned our fleet to nearly 100% AC rig offering, but we've also delivered significantly better performance from those rigs. For instance, our footage per day has increased by over 50% from 2007 to 2012, while at the same time average well depth has increased by over 40%. As a result of the enhanced average cost per foot, we continue to drive a compelling value proposition for our customers. And while the rest of the industry has added AC drive rigs to their U.S. land fleets, our top 3 competitors, combined, have officially retired more rigs than they have built since January of 2009. 
Another way to look at it is, since the industry's rig count peaked in 2008, our active U.S. land count has increased by 25% ,whereas the same 3 competitors have seen an average reduction of 25%.
Our expectation is that the drilling efficiency continues to be a driver for operators going forward, and that they will continue to provide attractive opportunities to service companies that deliver top performance. For H&P, we would expect the coming year to offer new build opportunities and the prospect to continue to lead the land industry in margins and activity levels.
Now I'm going to turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

As announced earlier today, the company reported a record level of $574 million of income from continuing operations for fiscal 2012, representing an increase of over 30% as compared to the prior year. We also reported all-time high levels of $581 million of net income and $3.15 billion of revenue for the fiscal year.
Our capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion during fiscal 2012, and our corresponding estimate for fiscal 2013 is, at this point, $740 million. Approximately 50% of this CapEx estimate is related to our new build programs, about 30% to maintenance CapEx and the remainder to tubulars and special projects. The portion allocated to our new build program includes the completion of new FlexRigs that are already under long-term contracts, as well as capital components and spares to either service existing rigs or be used to complete and deploy additional rigs.
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1 billion during fiscal 2012, including approximately $200 million in deferred income taxes. We benefited from these deferred income taxes largely as a result of the deduction for accelerated bonus depreciation used in determining our cash tax obligations. Assuming that the accelerated bonus depreciation is not extended, we estimate that our net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2013 will benefit from approximately $40 million in deferred income taxes. We expect at this point to be able to fully fund our fiscal 2013 CapEx program, as well as other scheduled commitments from existing cash and from cash to be provided by operating activities during the fiscal year. 
With a very strong debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 6%, the company's debt level declined to $235 million at the end of the fiscal year, including $40 million scheduled for payment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
As reported in our consolidated financial statements, depreciation expense for fiscal 2012 was approximately $388 million. This amount included approximately $16 million of abandonment charges, most of which impacted our fourth fiscal quarter as described in our press release. Given the continuing growth of our fleet, we expect our total annual depreciation expense to increase to approximately $450 million during fiscal 2013. 
As the company continues to grow, general and administrative expenses are also expected to increase to approximately $115 million during fiscal 2013. Nevertheless, interest expense, after capitalized interest, is expected to decrease to approximately $7 million during the fiscal year. 
Our investment portfolio, comprised of 8 million shares of Atwood Oceanics and 967,500 shares of Schlumberger, recently had a pretax market value of approximately $440 million and an after-tax value of approximately $280 million.
Our effective tax rate for continuing operations during fiscal 2012 was reported at approximately 36.5%, and at this point, we expect a similar rate for fiscal 2013.

278341,224006003,389273,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 15, 2012",2012-11-15,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on the results for our 3 operating segments, U. S. land, offshore and international land, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, as well as our outlook for the first fiscal quarter",1481,"Thank you, Juan Pablo, and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on the results for our 3 operating segments, U. S. land, offshore and international land, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, as well as our outlook for the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
I'll begin with our U.S. land segment, where revenue days decreased marginally to 21,951 days, representing 239 average active rigs in the fourth quarter. Included in the active rigs is the delivery of 12 new build FlexRigs during the quarter. Even though these new rigs were offset by previously active rigs becoming idle, AC drive FlexRigs maintained utilization levels above 95% for the quarter.
Of the 239 active rigs, an average of 157 rigs were working under term contracts and an average of 82 rigs were working in the spot market. Average rig revenue per day increased by $229 sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter to $28,325 per day. Early termination revenue accounted for approximately $280 per day in the fourth fiscal quarter as compared to approximately $140 per day in the third fiscal quarter.
Average rig revenue per day for rigs working on term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter was approximately 7% higher than the average rig revenue per day for rigs working in the spot market. This difference is mostly attributable to the mix of rig types and regions in these 2 categories. Average rig expense per day decreased $717 per day to $12,620. Average rig margin per day increased by $946 per day to $15,705 per day. 
The outlook for the U.S. land segment continues to remain positive. Our new build FlexRig program continues to lead the industry with on-time and under budget delivery. We have been delivering at a cadence of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month since October of 2011. Since October 1, 2012, the beginning of fiscal 2013, 7 FlexRigs have been completed.
Nine contracted FlexRigs remain under construction and are currently being completed at the rate of approximately 4 FlexRigs per month through calendar year end, and we plan to deliver 2 contracted FlexRigs per month in January and February of '13.
As of today, our U.S. land segment active rig count is 237 rigs, which leads the U.S. land in active rigs. 234 out of the 237 rigs are AC drive rigs. The 237 active rigs include 159 under term contracts and 78 operating in the spot market. Of the 78 rigs in the spot market, 77 are FlexRigs.
Our rig count bottomed toward the end of September at 230 active rigs, and we believe our U.S. land rig activity is positioned to improve for the remainder of the calendar year and into the first calendar quarter of 2013. The qualifiers for this assumption are that oil prices remain strong, provided WTI remains above $80 a barrel and natural gas prices remain in the $3.50 range. 
We also have 52 stacked rigs today, excluding the 6 conventional rigs that were decommissioned at the end of the fiscal year. Of the stacked rigs, 20 are AC drive FlexRigs. However, at least 6 of those of FlexRigs have commitments to begin operations before the end of December. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect average revenue days to be down approximately 2% as compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination fees, we expect average rig revenue per day in the first quarter to be roughly flat as spot day rates have only slightly declined during the last few months and should remain firm through the remainder of the quarter. Revenues from early terminations are expected to be under $1 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. 
Our term contract coverage remains strong. We already have an average of 158 rigs locked under term contracts for the first fiscal quarter of '13; 150 rigs for the second quarter of fiscal '13; and 141 and 97 rigs for all of fiscal '13 and for all of fiscal '14, respectively.
Excluding costs that are passed on to customers, we expect revenue per day for our rigs that are already on term contracts to increase by approximately $100 per day, on average, in the first fiscal quarter of 2013 and by approximately $250 per day, on average, for fiscal '13. Both of these increases are as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2012.
Our guys continue to work very hard to provide exceptional service to our customers, and at the same time, control costs. We were very pleased with the expense-per-day results during the last 2 quarters and expect average rig expense per day for the first fiscal quarter of 2013 to be in the $13,200 per day range. As a reminder, during the 2012 fiscal year, expense per day has ranged from $12,292 to $13,826 per day. 
We believe the continued expense per day improvements over the past 2 quarters are a result of our improved systems, supply chain processes and procurement, to name a few. We are convinced that we will continue to improve our processes. Nonetheless, our average rig expense per day will probably continue to experience quarter-to-quarter volatility as the timing of expenses can be influenced by many different factors.
And now, I'll review our offshore segment fourth fiscal quarter results, where offshore operating income increased by approximately $4.3 million to $12 million as compared to the prior quarter. Revenue days increased by 15% to 695 days as 2 rigs returned to work. Average rig margin per day increased by $6,429 sequentially to $23,330 per day. The increase was mostly attributable to rigs completing mobilization and commencing drilling operations.
Earnings from management contracts declined by approximately $1 million to $1.2 million, primarily as a result of 2 rigs moving to cold-stacked rates. 
Our outlook for offshore. As of today, the company's offshore segment has 8 rigs active and 1 rig stacked. As compared to the prior quarter, we expect offshore revenue days to increase by approximately 5% and margin per day to be roughly flat during the first quarter of fiscal '13. We expect pretax earnings for management contracts to be flat at slightly over $1 million during the first fiscal quarter. 
Now a review of our international, where international land segment operating income results from the third fiscal quarter to the fourth fiscal quarter increased by approximately $1 million. The primary factors driving the increase were increased activity and margins. Revenue days increased 8% to 2,001 days as 4 contracted rigs commenced drilling operations during the fourth fiscal quarter. Average rig margin per day increased $506 to $8,210 per day, which was mostly attributable to reduced mobilization and start-up costs as compared to the third fiscal quarter. 
The outlook for international. As of today, the company's international land segment has 26 rigs working, of which 16 are AC drive FlexRigs. Seven rigs are active in Colombia, 6 in Argentina, 5 in Ecuador, 4 in Bahrain and 2 both in UAE and Tunisia. All 3 idle rigs are 3,000-horsepower conventional rigs located in Argentina. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect international land revenue days to increase approximately 15% and average daily margin to be down approximately 10%, primarily due to downtime and labor interruptions in Argentina.
Now that completes the operating segment remarks, and I will conclude with a few examples why we believe current market conditions present an opportunity for H&P to gain market share.
First, we've picked up 10 new FlexRig customers during the past 12 months. You may recall, after the '08 downturn when activity began to improve, we were able to attract more than 20 new FlexRig customers. These new customers have shown a desire to high-grade their rig fleets because of efficiency gains for AC drive FlexRigs.
Second, there's evidence the replacement cycle is continuing. During the past 12 months, the overall U.S. land rig count has decreased by approximately 230 rigs and yet the AC drive rig count has increased by approximately 70 rigs, indicating AC market share has increased, and overall U.S. AC utilization remains above 85%. Combined, the SCR and mechanical rig counts decreased in total by 300 rigs, causing market share reductions, and the combined SCR/mechanical utilization today is below 60%. With approximately 15% of the AC rigs stacked in the U.S. today, rig count bifurcation is occurring, and we believe those AC rigs are better candidates to return to work before the recently stacked SCR and mechanical rigs will return to work.
Finally, and looking ahead to 2013, H&P's efforts will continue to be directed toward delivering best-in-class safety and operational performance for our customers and shareholders. Our people, processes and FlexRig technology create competitive advantages for the company, and we believe this should continue to provide future opportunities to build new AC drive FlexRigs.

But the second piece is that, just anecdotally, we've had conversations with customers that indicate they will push the restart button on some budget dollars and as they even approach the turn of the calendar, prior to that, they're trying to sort through what type of rig rosters and what upgrades and additional rigs they may be interested in as they go forward into executing their 2013 drilling plans. So from several of those conversations, we've been encouraged that we'll see some lift there. And then we'll start the year and see what happens.

And I think the questions are good relating to the expense numbers, and it's hard to give lots of specificity and details, but I think and I hope one of the takeaways is we've focused on this for the last year. As an organization, we're getting better at it. We'll continue to put energy and effort into it, and I think the systems and the folks we have are doing a great job in managing that. So we're encouraged by that even though as we talked about a range in some of the moving parts particularly, I think, and John mentioned, the reactivation, as we get guys trained up and get those rigs out and top notch, that will drive some uncertain expenses. But now to move to your question related to the CapEx and how it might impact our manufacturing plans and efforts, I think just to remind folks, we've got 9 rigs left to deliver. 5 of those come out in '12, 4 in '13. John mentioned we'll have 2 contracted rigs roll off in January and 2 in February. So as we contemplate our CapEx for the year and ask what happens from March on, our model and our preference is to have fully contracted rigs. I think in a market like this where we've had a lull for a period of months, we've seen this happen before, and oftentimes as visibility improves and operators respond to a better outlook, we can see a pop back, if you will, after a lull like that. So we want our supply chain to be ready to respond to that. And I think we're in good shape in that respect. We've talked before about the need for capital spares and unitizing some parts and pieces that will support a rig fleet of our size. As we have a active and robust manufacturing effort, we're able to drive those to kind of a near 0 status because we can pull that out of the manufacturing queue. If we see things slow down, and they'll certainly slow down in '13, then we will spend some time and effort and dollars having capital spares at the ready. Those can transition into equipment kits and potential new builds. So I think, maybe lastly, we've had conversations with folks about, if we get into March -- we're in a good position of not having to make a decision now. But one of the nice things about the flexibility of our manufacturing effort is as we look to March and forward, would we be willing to capture the continuity value of a dialed back manufacturing effort? And we would certainly consider that. And so, if that meant 1 or 2 rigs per month for a very short period of time, then we would give that consideration. But we're not at the point where we have to decide that. So that's kind of, I hope, some color on your question."
