As you saw in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2011 earnings of $3.19 per diluted share, compared to $1.57 per diluted share in 2010. After adjusting for several items which accumulatively added $148.4",1200,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2011 earnings of $3.19 per diluted share, compared to $1.57 per diluted share in 2010. After adjusting for several items which accumulatively added $148.4 million to our net income, our adjusted EPS was $2.21 in 2011. 
The adjustments to net income include the impacts of the sale of Big Sandy Pipeline in the third quarter, the purchase of the outstanding interest in ANPI in the second quarter, the sale of the Langley Natural Gas Processing Complex, and an adjustment for non-income tax matters in the first quarter, and a gain on the sale of some available for-sale securities in the first half of the year.
Operating cash flow, which was not significantly impacted by these items in 2011 also increased by $236 million or by about 36%. These results were driven by another outstanding operational year at each of EQT’s business units. 
Leading the way on the annual operating performance was a 44% increase in sales of produced natural gas and liquids at EQT production, which represented our highest annual sales growth rate ever. The other volumes at EQT Midstream also increased by 32%, trending up with the higher volumes at EQT Production. 
The EQT average wellhead sales price was $5.37 per Mcf in 2011, or about $0.25 lower than in 2010. The realized price drop resulted from lower NYMEX natural gas prices in ’11 as compared to ’10, partially offset by higher natural gas liquids prices. Approximately 7% of EQT’s total production in 2011 was in the form of liquids.
For segment reporting purposes, of that $5.37 per Mcf of revenue, realized by EQT Corporation, $4.04 per Mcf was allocated to EQT Production, and the remaining $1.33 per Mcf to EQT Midstream.
Overall, absolute cost increase is expected given our outstanding growth rate, but on a unit basis, the total cost to produce, gather, process and transport EQT’s produced natural gas and NGLs was down about 22%. 
The fourth quarter results basically mirrored the full year, so I do not intend to discuss them in detail. However, I will point out that the revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing, and transportation was $0.43 for the full year of 2011 and $0.29 in the fourth quarter, as shown in the table, in this morning’s press release.
The fourth quarter number was positively impacted by the company’s ability to resell it’s unused contractive capacity on the recently completed El Paso 300 line, at unit rates above what we currently pay under the existing agreement with El Paso. The margin from capacity that was sold under short-term contracts, that is contracts with a duration of less than a year, reduced the revenue deduction by about $0.12 per Mcf on gas sold by EQT in the quarter.
Put another way, by adding the $0.12 to the $0.29 reported in the fourth quarter, a reasonable per-unit rate - run rate for the deduction for third-party gathering, processing, and transportation in models, would be approximately $0.41 for Mcf.
This number will be impacted positively or negatively going forward, depending on market rates we will receive for the resell of our 300 line capacity that is not currently reserved for EQT Production, or under long-term resell contracts with third-parties.
Moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segments, starting with EQT Production, and there, as has been the case for several years now, the big story in the quarter at EQT Production was the growth rate in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was a little bit north of 44% for the year, and was slightly north of 37% for the quarter. By the way, the sixth straight consecutive quarter of more than 35% rolling year-over-year growth. Those growth rates were driven by sales from our Marcellus wells, which contributed 42% of the volumes in 2011.
In the fourth quarter, Marcellus sales volumes accounted for 47% of the total volumes. Total sales volume would have been about 300 Mcf equivalent higher for the year and the quarter but for a dehydration equipment malfunction in December. 
Unit realized price at EQT Production was slightly, or about 3% higher than last year, even as the corporations realized price declined a bit as I already mentioned. This is one of the benefits of an increase in the Marcellus sales percentage, as the Marcellus gathering rate is $0.60 per Mcf, compared to $1.25 per Mcf for the majority of our other production.
Moving on to expenses in the production unit. Total operating expenses were $90 million higher, year-over-year. Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth. 
DD&A represented about $73 million of the $90 million increase. Absolute LOE was a bit higher year-over-year, however volume increases have been outpacing the general trend of higher absolute expenses. And as you would expect, per unit LOE was lower in 2011 by about $0.04, or 17% to $0.20 per Mcfe for the full-year 2011.
Moving on to the Midstream business, excluding the gains of the Big Sandy and Langley sales, operating income here was up about 19%, consistent with the 32% growth in gathered volumes, mainly from EQT Productions growing sales volume, and that resulted in a 18% increase in gathering, net operating revenues. 
Transmission net revenues also increased by almost 7% year-over-year as a result of added equitrans capacity from the Equitrans-Marcellus expansion project, an increased throughput, more than offsetting revenues no longer received by - received from the Big Sandy pipeline.
On the other hand, the line item titled storage, marketing, and other net operating income was down, up $7 million in the fourth quarter, and $35 million for the full year. This part of the Midstream business, as we talked repeatedly about it, it relies on seasonal volatility and spreads and the forward curve, and those continue to trend down in 2011 versus prior years.
Also, the loss of processing fees from Langley third-party liquids, resulted in lower marketing revenues. For 2012, we expect revenues from storage, marketing and other to be approximately $45 million.
Net operating expenses at Midstream were about $27 million lower year-over-year, lower O&M and DD&A expenses which collectively were $28 million lower year-over-year, represent basically the entire absolute decrease in Midstream expenses. The absence of expenses associated with the sole Big Sandy and Langley assets and reductions in non-income tax reserves, resulted in those decreases.
Then in conclusion with finally, with our standard liquidity update. We did close the year in a great liquidity position with $0 in net short-term debt outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver, and about $830 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
As detailed in the press release, due to the current low natural gas price environment, we have lowered our cash flow forecast for 2012 by about $100 million, and therefore consistent with our intent to live within our means, the company has decided to discontinue drilling Huron wells. As a result, our 2012 CapEx forecast decreased by about $135 million to $1.465 billion for 2012.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to David Porges.

Earnings per share, operating cash flow, sales volumes, Midstream throughput and natural gas reserves were all higher than ever before. Though the primary purpose of this call is to communicate with investors, I first wish to convey my congratulations for these accomplishments to the 1,800-plus employees of EQT Corporation. Having such a strong group managing our assets gives me confidence that we will continue to earn premium returns for our shareholders.
Sales of produced natural gas and liquids were 44% higher than in 2010. This is on top of 30% growth in 2010 over 2009. Put another way, our daily sales volumes, when we exited 2009 totalled 300 million cubic feet. We exited 2011 at 580 million cubic feet per day, 93% higher in just two years. The Marcellus continues to drive our growth. Marcellus Production accounted for 47% of our sales of produced natural gas in the fourth quarter. 
EQT has tremendous assets. While our objective is to maximize value creation rather than volume creation from these assets, the only practical way to do so is by economically monetizing our extensive reserve base, be it production and other means, and by extracting value from our Midstream assets and Midstream opportunities. However, we believe it is also necessary that we live within our means financially, without issuing equity.
In 2011, I believe we made great strides towards doing so, but the work continues. I’d like to review a little of how we did this in 2011, and also how we intend to do so in 2012. In 2011 we invested $1.4 billion in to our business. We funded this investment with $900 million of operating cash flow, plus $620 million of Midstream asset sales. The proceeds from the asset sales came from the outright sale of two assets. We examined other structures and assets, but determined that selling these two assets outright was the best approach. For 2012, we have decided that the best approach to create value is again investing our operating cash flow, plus also utilizing other available capital. This other capital includes utilizing our investment grade debt capacity, which we did in late 2011, and further monetizing Midstream assets by forming a MLP.
As we announced last month, we plan to file the S1 this quarter, though we recognize that this merely starts the process with the SEC. The advantages to EQT shareholders of forming a MLP include maintaining operational control of where, when, ad to what speck gathering is built, access to a on-going source of low cost capital, and participation in any MLP distribution growth. Of course, a publically traded currency would also provide a market view of the value of the MLPs assets.  
Our objective, maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing this, the ammonization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities, while living within our means, is also largely unaffected by the changes we have experienced lately. 
Tactics, however can and should change. Despite of a bit of a rebound this week, natural gas prices are down sharply since we established our capital budget in December. Lower prices impact us in two ways. First they reduce cash flow from operations and less cash available for investments. 
We have over 50% of our dry gas hedged in a average price of $5.43 and about 7% of our production in the form of NGLs and oil. And incidentally, recall we include ethane in our dry gas numbers since the [inaudible] for ethane are essentially equivalent to methane on a per Btu basis. 
Even so, based on cases we ran, using last week’s lows for the 2012 strip, our 2012 cash flow estimates were almost $100 million lower than when we established our capital budget. Lower prices also reduced the projected returns of our drilling program. Marcellus returns are still strong at the current five year strip, about $3.90. We also stress test our investments and the projected are still adequate at [inaudible] strip. Please do keep in mind that the lags between spending capital on Marcellus wells and selling natural gas produced from those wells is several months, meaning the relevant five year strip when looking at 2012 investments is actually the 2013 to 2017 strip, which is currently somewhat north of $4. Therefore, it is clear to us that investments in developing our Marcellus play, are attractive though they would obviously be even more attractive at higher prices.
Regarding our Huron wells, even though they are liquids rich, the returns are still below the Marcellus wells. But since lower prices mean a reduction in operating cash flow and we are commitment to living within our means, something has to give. That something is the Huron, and this is why we have suspended drilling in that play effective immediately. We will complete the wells that we have already - that have already been spud, and continue to produce from existing wells.
  This decision will reduce our 2012 CapEx by about $135 million, and reduce our forecast of sales of produced natural gas by approximately 5 Bcfe. The effect of this decision of volumes in the out years is the decline of 6 Bcfe in 2013, and a little over 3 Bcfe in 2014. The fact that the lag between drilling and sales in the Huron is much less than in the Marcellus, is why the 2012 impact is as large as this, and the 2013/2014 impacts are as small as they are.
Normally, one might lean away from cutting spending in a area in which we experience a shorter lag, but 2012 is not shaping up as a normal year. 
I’d now like to comment on our reserve report, which was released today. Our continued success in the Marcellus resulted in a 535 Bcfe or 18.5% increase in prude reserves. This increase was partially offset by a 413 Bcfe decrease in Huron prude reserves, and we eliminated all of the prude undeveloped reserves, consistent with our decision to suspend drilling of Huron wells.
  I remain confident that this play has value for our shareholders, but we are not going to be pursuing that value in the near future, so we’re moving these PUDs now, seemed appropriate. Further regarding reserves, we continued to have success with our experiment with tighter frac clusters. As we previously noted, this design works best in the more brittle areas of our play. Brittleness is also positively correlated with higher EURs using the standard frac design. 
With the year of well [inaudible] in Rogersville, Green County, we estimate an IP 40% higher than a standard frac well, with EURs trending, 20 to 25% higher. Our 2012 plan includes 49 wells using this design, with about half applied where we have well control, and half to these risk areas where predict success. We still do not have enough data to book many reserves, or extrapolate these results across our acreage, but are excited about the results so far.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investment, and doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. 
  We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash from operations and from future monetization. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and appreciate your continued support. Pat?

Our number, even at the current stripe prices, show the returns on that incremental capital to be in excess of the base return on our Marcellus drilling.  So I think even exceptionally low prices on half of those wells, it makes excellent sense.  
The other half, or still, I guess I would call them experiments, but based on what we’ve seen in Rogersville where we have the most data, we feel like those experiments are worthwhile and they’re targeted in areas that, based on the geology, we expect good economic returns, but we need to gather more data to be sure.

We announced what the percentage is of liquids that would double essentially with the take of ethane.  As we mentioned before, the plant that will be coming online in Northern West Virginia will provide EQT the opportunity to extract ethane, which would increase the amount of gallons from 2 ½ to 5.  
We have the flexibility to make that decision economically and as we look out and make that decision, if it is in EQT’s best interest to extra ethane from the price that we will receive, then we’ll have the ability to do that.  And if we are in a position to sell it as methane as we today and blend it, if that’s in the economic best interest, then we’ll do that as well. 
And we’re glad that pipelines are being built to move ethane.  That’s good, but realistically, if you look at the macro situation for ethane supply demand in the Marcellus, and you read through the specifics of any kind of the agreements that people enter into, you come up with ways to, you extract methane - I’m sorry, you extract ethane from the methane stream mainly because you have to to get down to pipelines.  It doesn’t really create a lot of value the way propane and butane, et cetera do.  It’s, you know, if you can, as Randy said, if the pipelines are there and you can enter into transactions where you can have a little bit of money, that’s great, but the mindset we still thing - we still think the prudent mindset with ethane is to assume that you extract it when you have to to meet pipeline specs.  And if you can make a few bucks on top of that, well, then that’s obviously great.

When we look at the going economics of the program, obviously we take the hedges into account.  But when we’re making marginal decisions, on the margin, every MMBTU of every incremental or detrimental MMBTU of natural gas should be priced at the market.  And I think that extends even if you were fully hedged and you dropped, you can always tear up the contract.  You can cancel the contract.  Nobody has to know that the production’s there.  The accountants might have an issue with it.  But you can still collect the money on a hedge even if you were fully hedged and decided to cut production.  
So the right way to make marginal decisions is based on the strip.  No matter how - what your hedge percentage is or isn’t, it happens, of course that the Huron decision on a piece of paper increases the percent hedge that we’ve got just because it takes the denominator down.  But we make these decisions on what we should do on the margin by looking at the market.

As you saw in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2011 earnings of $3.19 per diluted share, compared to $1.57 per diluted share in 2010. After adjusting for several items which cumulatively added $148.4 mi",1205,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2011 earnings of $3.19 per diluted share, compared to $1.57 per diluted share in 2010. After adjusting for several items which cumulatively added $148.4 million to our net income, our adjusted EPS was $2.21 in 2011. The adjustments to net income include the impacts of the sale of Big Sandy Pipeline in the third quarter, the purchase of the outstanding interest in ANPI in the second quarter, the sale of the Langley Natural Gas Processing Complex and an adjustment for non-income tax matters in the first quarter, and a gain on the sale of some available for-sale securities in the first half of the year. Operating cash flow, which was not significantly impacted by these items in 2011 also increased by $236 million or by about 36%. These results were driven by another outstanding operational year at each of EQT’s business units. 
Leading the way on the annual operating performance was a 44% increase in sales of produced natural gas and liquids at EQT Production, which represented our highest annual sales growth rate ever. The other volumes at EQT Midstream also increased by 32%, trending up with the higher volumes at EQT Production. The EQT average wellhead sales price was $5.37 per Mcf in 2011, or about $0.25 lower than in 2010. The realized price drop resulted from lower NYMEX natural gas prices in ’11 as compared to ’10, partially offset by higher natural gas liquids prices. Approximately 7% of EQT’s total production in 2011 was in the form of liquids. For segment reporting purposes, of that $5.37 per Mcf of revenue realized by EQT Corporation, $4.04 per Mcf was allocated to EQT Production, and the remaining $1.33 per Mcf to EQT Midstream.
Overall, absolute cost increased as expected given our outstanding growth rate, but on a unit basis, the total cost to produce, gather, process and transport EQT’s produced natural gas and NGLs was down about 22%. The fourth quarter results basically mirrored the full year, so I do not intend to discuss them in detail. However, I will point out that the revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing, and transportation was $0.43 for the full year of 2011 and $0.29 in the fourth quarter, as shown in the table in this morning’s press release. The fourth quarter number was positively impacted by the company’s ability to resell it’s unused contractive capacity on the recently completed El Paso 300 line at unit rates above what we currently pay under the existing agreement with El Paso. The margin from capacity that was sold under short-term contracts, that is contracts with a duration of less than a year, reduced the revenue deduction by about $0.12 per Mcf on gas sold by EQT in the quarter. Put another way, by adding the $0.12 to the $0.29 reported in the fourth quarter, a reasonable per-unit rate -- run rate for the deduction for third-party gathering, processing, and transportation end year [ph] models would be approximately $0.41 for Mcf. This number will be impacted positively or negatively going forward depending on market rates we will receive for the resell of our 300 line capacity that is not currently reserved for EQT Production, or under long-term resell contracts with third-parties.
Moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segments, starting with EQT Production, and there, as has been the case for several years now, the big story in the quarter at EQT Production was the growth rate in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was a little bit north of 44% for the year, and was slightly north of 37% for the quarter. By the way, the sixth straight consecutive quarter of more than 35% rolling year-over-year growth. Those growth rates were driven by sales from our Marcellus wells, which contributed 42% of the volumes in 2011. In the fourth quarter, Marcellus sales volumes accounted for 47% of the total volumes. Total sales volume would have been about 300 Mcf equivalent higher for the year and the quarter but for a dehydration equipment malfunction in December. Unit realized price at EQT Production was slightly, or about 3% higher than last year, even as the corporation's realized price declined a bit as I already mentioned. This is one of the benefits of an increase in the Marcellus sales percentage, as the Marcellus gathering rate is $0.60 per Mcf, compared to $1.25 per Mcf for the majority of our other production.
Moving on to expenses in the production unit. Total operating expenses were $90 million higher year-over-year. Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth. DD&A represented about $73 million of the $90 million increase. Absolute LOE was a bit higher year-over-year, however volume increases have been outpacing the general trend of higher absolute expenses. And as you would expect, per unit LOE was lower in 2011 by about $0.04, or 17% to $0.20 per Mcfe for the full-year 2011.
Moving on to the Midstream business, excluding the gains of the Big Sandy and Langley sales, operating income here was up about 19%, consistent with the 32% growth in gathered volumes, mainly from EQT's Production's growing sales volume, and that resulted in a 18% increase in gathering net operating revenues. Transmission net revenues also increased by almost 7% year-over-year as a result of added Equitrans capacity from the Equitrans-Marcellus expansion project and increased throughput more than offsetting revenues no longer received by -- received from the Big Sandy pipeline. On the other hand, the line item titled storage, marketing, and other net operating income was down about $7 million in the fourth quarter and $35 million for the full year. This part of the Midstream business, as we've talked repeatedly about, relies on seasonal volatility and spreads and the forward curve, and those continued to trend down in 2011 versus prior years. Also, the loss of processing fees from Langley third-party liquids resulted in lower marketing revenues. For 2012, we expect revenues from storage, marketing and other to be approximately $45 million. Net operating expenses at Midstream were about $27 million lower year-over-year. Lower O&M and DD&A expenses which collectively were $28 million lower year-over-year represented basically the entire absolute decrease in Midstream expenses. The absence of expenses associated with the sole Big Sandy and Langley assets and reductions in non-income tax reserves resulted in those decreases.
And then in conclusion with -- finally, with our standard liquidity update. We did close the year in a great liquidity position with $0 in net short-term debt outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver, and about $830 million of cash on the balance sheet. As detailed in the press release, due to the current low natural gas price environment, we have lowered our gas -- our cash flow forecast for 2012 by about $100 million, and therefore, consistent with our intent to live within our means, the company has decided to discontinue drilling Huron wells. As a result, our 2012 CapEx forecast decreased by about $135 million to $1.465 billion for 2012.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to David Porges."

Earnings per share, operating cash flow, sales volumes, Midstream throughput and natural gas reserves were all higher than ever before. Though the primary purpose of this call is to communicate with investors, I first wish to convey my congratulations for these accomplishments to the 1,800-plus employees of EQT Corporation. Having such a strong group managing our assets gives me confidence that we will continue to earn premium returns for our shareholders.
Sales of produced natural gas and liquids were 44% higher than in 2010. This is on top of 30% growth in 2010 over 2009. Put another way, our daily sales volumes when we exited 2009 totalled 300 million cubic feet. We exited 2011 at 580 million cubic feet per day, 93% higher in just 2 years. The Marcellus continues to drive our growth. Marcellus Production accounted for 47% of our sales of produced natural gas in the fourth quarter. EQT has tremendous assets. While our objective is to maximize value creation rather than volume creation from these assets, the only practical way to do so is by economically monetizing our extensive reserve base, be it production and other means, and by extracting value from our Midstream assets and Midstream opportunities. However, we believe it is also necessary that we live within our means financially, without issuing equity. In 2011, I believe we made great strides towards doing so, but the work continues. I’d like to review a little of how we did this in 2011, and also how we intend to do so in 2012. 
In 2011 we invested $1.4 billion into our business. We funded this investment with $900 million of operating cash flow plus $620 million of Midstream asset sales. The proceeds from the asset sales came from the outright sale of 2 assets. We examined other structures and assets, but determined that selling these two assets outright was the best approach. For 2012, we have decided that the best approach to create value is again investing our operating cash flow, plus also utilizing other available capital. This other capital includes utilizing our investment grade debt capacity, which we did in late 2011, and further monetizing Midstream assets by forming a MLP. As we announced last month, we plan to file the S1 this quarter, though we recognize that this merely starts the process with the SEC. The advantages to EQT shareholders of forming an MLP include maintaining operational control of where, when and to what specs gathering is built, access to an ongoing source of low-cost capital, and participation in any MLP distribution growth. Of course, a publicly-traded currency would also provide a market view of the value of the MLP's assets. 
Our objective, maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy -- accomplishing this, the monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities while living within our means, is also largely unaffected by the changes we have experienced lately. Tactics, however can and should change. Despite of a bit of a rebound this week, natural gas prices are down sharply since we established our capital budget in December. Lower prices impact us in two ways. First they reduce cash flow from operations and thus cash available for investments. We have over 50% of our dry gas hedged at an average price of $5.43, and about 7% of our production is in the form of NGLs and oil. And incidentally, recall we include ethane in our dry gas numbers since the netbacks for ethane are essentially equivalent to methane on a per Btu basis. 
Even so, based on cases we ran using last week’s lows for the 2012 strip, our 2012 cash flow estimates were almost $100 million lower than when we established our capital budget. Lower prices also reduced the projected returns of our drilling program. Marcellus returns are still strong at the current 5-year strip, about $3.90. We also stress test our investments and the projected returns are still adequate at $3.00 [indiscernible] strip. Please do keep in mind that the lags between spending capital on Marcellus wells and selling natural gas produced from those wells is several months, meaning the relevant 5-year strip when looking at 2012 investments is actually the 2013 to 2017 strip, which is currently somewhat north of $4. Therefore, it is clear to us that investments in developing our Marcellus play are attractive though they would obviously be even more attractive at higher prices.
Regarding our Huron wells, even though they are liquids rich, the returns are still below the Marcellus wells. But since lower prices mean a reduction in operating cash flow and we are commitment to living within our means, something has to give. That something is the Huron, and this is why we have suspended drilling in that play effective immediately. We will complete the wells that we have already -- that have already been spud, and continue to produce from existing wells. This decision will reduce our 2012 CapEx by about $135 million and reduce our forecast of sales of produced natural gas by approximately 5 Bcfe. The effect of this decision of volumes in the out years is the decline of 6 Bcfe in 2013 and a little over 3 Bcfe in 2014. The fact that the lag between drilling and sales in the Huron is much less than in the Marcellus is why the 2012 impact is as large as this, and the 2013/2014 impacts are as small as they are. Normally, one might lean away from cutting spending in an area in which we experience a shorter lag, but 2012 is not shaping up as a normal year. 
I’d now like to comment on our reserve report, which was released today. Our continued success in the Marcellus resulted in a 535 Bcfe or 18.5% increase in proved reserves. This was -- this increase was partially offset by a 413 Bcfe decrease in Huron proved reserves and we eliminated all of the proved undeveloped reserves consistent with our decision to suspend drilling of Huron wells. I remain confident that this play has value for our shareholders, but we are not going to be pursuing that value via the drill bit [ph] in the near future, so removing these PUDs now seemed appropriate. Further regarding reserves, we continue to have success with our experiment with tighter frac clusters. As we previously noted, this design works best in the more brittle areas of our play. Brittleness is also positively correlated with higher EURs using the standard frac design. With a year of well data in Rogersville, Greene County, we estimate an IP 40% higher than a standard frac well, with EURs trending 20% to 25% higher. Our 2012 plan includes 49 wells using this design, with about half applied where we have well control and half to de-risk areas where we predict success. We still do not have enough data to book many reserves or extrapolate these results across our acreage, but are excited about the results so far.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments, and doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash from operations and from future monetization. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and appreciate your continued support.

We will look at the cash flows, obviously. I guess that would be the thing that would cause us to change something is if we thought because of prices that cash flows were drying up enough that we had to make some other form of move and then we’d take a look at the rest of the operations to see what other forms of move was required.

As you saw in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2011 earnings of $3.19 per diluted share, compared to $1.57 per diluted share in 2010.

As you saw in the press release this morning, EQT announced 2011 earnings of $3.19 per diluted share, compared to $1.57 per diluted share in 2010. After adjusting for several items which cumulatively added $148.4 million to our net income, our adjusted EPS was $2.21 in 2011. The adjustments to net income include the impacts of the sale of Big Sandy Pipeline in the third quarter, the purchase of the outstanding interest in ANPI in the second quarter, the sale of the Langley Natural Gas Processing Complex and an adjustment for non-income tax matters in the first quarter, and a gain on the sale of some available for-sale securities in the first half of the year. Operating cash flow, which was not significantly impacted by these items in 2011 also increased by $236 million or by about 36%. These results were driven by another outstanding operational year at each of EQT’s business units. 
Leading the way on the annual operating performance was a 44% increase in sales of produced natural gas and liquids at EQT Production, which represented our highest annual sales growth rate ever. The other volumes at EQT Midstream also increased by 32%, trending up with the higher volumes at EQT Production. The EQT average wellhead sales price was $5.37 per Mcf in 2011, or about $0.25 lower than in 2010. The realized price drop resulted from lower NYMEX natural gas prices in ’11 as compared to ’10, partially offset by higher natural gas liquids prices. Approximately 7% of EQT’s total production in 2011 was in the form of liquids. For segment reporting purposes, of that $5.37 per Mcf of revenue realized by EQT Corporation, $4.04 per Mcf was allocated to EQT Production, and the remaining $1.33 per Mcf to EQT Midstream.
Overall, absolute cost increased as expected given our outstanding growth rate, but on a unit basis, the total cost to produce, gather, process and transport EQT’s produced natural gas and NGLs was down about 22%. The fourth quarter results basically mirrored the full year, so I do not intend to discuss them in detail. However, I will point out that the revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing, and transportation was $0.43 for the full year of 2011 and $0.29 in the fourth quarter, as shown in the table in this morning’s press release. The fourth quarter number was positively impacted by the company’s ability to resell its unused contractive capacity on the recently completed El Paso 300 line at unit rates above what we currently pay under the existing agreement with El Paso. The margin from capacity that was sold under short-term contracts, that is contracts with a duration of less than a year, reduced the revenue deduction by about $0.12 per Mcf on gas sold by EQT in the quarter. Put another way, by adding the $0.12 to the $0.29 reported in the fourth quarter, a reasonable per-unit rate -- run rate for the deduction for third-party gathering, processing, and transportation end year [ph] models would be approximately $0.41 for Mcf. This number will be impacted positively or negatively going forward depending on market rates we will receive for the resell of our 300 line capacity that is not currently reserved for EQT Production, or under long-term resell contracts with third-parties.
Moving on to a brief discussion of results by business segments, starting with EQT Production, and there, as has been the case for several years now, the big story in the quarter at EQT Production was the growth rate in sales of produced natural gas. As I mentioned, the growth rate was a little bit north of 44% for the year, and was slightly north of 37% for the quarter. By the way, the sixth straight consecutive quarter of more than 35% rolling year-over-year growth. Those growth rates were driven by sales from our Marcellus wells, which contributed 42% of the volumes in 2011. In the fourth quarter, Marcellus sales volumes accounted for 47% of the total volumes. Total sales volume would have been about 300 Mcf equivalent higher for the year and the quarter but for a dehydration equipment malfunction in December. Unit realized price at EQT Production was slightly, or about 3% higher than last year, even as the corporation's realized price declined a bit as I already mentioned. This is one of the benefits of an increase in the Marcellus sales percentage, as the Marcellus gathering rate is $0.60 per Mcf, compared to $1.25 per Mcf for the majority of our other production.
Moving on to expenses in the production unit. Total operating expenses were $90 million higher year-over-year. Absolute DD&A, SG&A, LOE and production taxes were all higher, consistent with the significant production growth. DD&A represented about $73 million of the $90 million increase. Absolute LOE was a bit higher year-over-year, however volume increases have been outpacing the general trend of higher absolute expenses. And as you would expect, per unit LOE was lower in 2011 by about $0.04, or 17% to $0.20 per Mcfe for the full-year 2011.
Moving on to the Midstream business, excluding the gains of the Big Sandy and Langley sales, operating income here was up about 19%, consistent with the 32% growth in gathered volumes, mainly from EQT's Production's growing sales volume, and that resulted in a 18% increase in gathering net operating revenues. Transmission net revenues also increased by almost 7% year-over-year as a result of added Equitrans capacity from the Equitrans-Marcellus expansion project and increased throughput more than offsetting revenues no longer received by -- received from the Big Sandy pipeline. On the other hand, the line item titled storage, marketing, and other net operating income was down about $7 million in the fourth quarter and $35 million for the full year. This part of the Midstream business, as we've talked repeatedly about, relies on seasonal volatility and spreads and the forward curve, and those continued to trend down in 2011 versus prior years. Also, the loss of processing fees from Langley third-party liquids resulted in lower marketing revenues. For 2012, we expect revenues from storage, marketing and other to be approximately $45 million. Net operating expenses at Midstream were about $27 million lower year-over-year. Lower O&M and DD&A expenses which collectively were $28 million lower year-over-year represented basically the entire absolute decrease in Midstream expenses. The absence of expenses associated with the sole Big Sandy and Langley assets and reductions in non-income tax reserves resulted in those decreases.
And then in conclusion with -- finally, with our standard liquidity update. We did close the year in a great liquidity position with $0 in net short-term debt outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver, and about $830 million of cash on the balance sheet. As detailed in the press release, due to the current low natural gas price environment, we have lowered our gas -- our cash flow forecast for 2012 by about $100 million, and therefore, consistent with our intent to live within our means, the company has decided to discontinue drilling Huron wells. As a result, our 2012 CapEx forecast decreased by about $135 million to $1.465 billion for 2012.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to David Porges."

Earnings per share, operating cash flow, sales volumes, Midstream throughput and natural gas reserves were all higher than ever before. Though the primary purpose of this call is to communicate with investors, I first wish to convey my congratulations for these accomplishments to the 1,800-plus employees of EQT Corporation. Having such a strong group managing our assets gives me confidence that we will continue to earn premium returns for our shareholders.
Sales of produced natural gas and liquids were 44% higher than in 2010. This is on top of 30% growth in 2010 over 2009. Put another way, our daily sales volumes when we exited 2009 totaled 300 million cubic feet. We exited 2011 at 580 million cubic feet per day, 93% higher in just 2 years. The Marcellus continues to drive our growth. Marcellus Production accounted for 47% of our sales of produced natural gas in the fourth quarter. EQT has tremendous assets. While our objective is to maximize value creation rather than volume creation from these assets, the only practical way to do so is by economically monetizing our extensive reserve base, be it production and other means, and by extracting value from our Midstream assets and Midstream opportunities. However, we believe it is also necessary that we live within our means financially, without issuing equity. In 2011, I believe we made great strides towards doing so, but the work continues. I’d like to review a little of how we did this in 2011, and also how we intend to do so in 2012. 
In 2011 we invested $1.4 billion into our business. We funded this investment with $900 million of operating cash flow plus $620 million of Midstream asset sales. The proceeds from the asset sales came from the outright sale of 2 assets. We examined other structures and assets, but determined that selling these two assets outright was the best approach. For 2012, we have decided that the best approach to create value is again investing our operating cash flow, plus also utilizing other available capital. This other capital includes utilizing our investment grade debt capacity, which we did in late 2011, and further monetizing Midstream assets by forming a MLP. As we announced last month, we plan to file the S1 this quarter, though we recognize that this merely starts the process with the SEC. The advantages to EQT shareholders of forming an MLP include maintaining operational control of where, when and to what specs gathering is built, access to an ongoing source of low-cost capital, and participation in any MLP distribution growth. Of course, a publicly-traded currency would also provide a market view of the value of the MLP's assets. 
Our objective, maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy -- accomplishing this, the monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities while living within our means, is also largely unaffected by the changes we have experienced lately. Tactics, however can and should change. Despite of a bit of a rebound this week, natural gas prices are down sharply since we established our capital budget in December. Lower prices impact us in two ways. First they reduce cash flow from operations and thus cash available for investments. We have over 50% of our dry gas hedged at an average price of $5.43, and about 7% of our production is in the form of NGLs and oil. And incidentally, recall we include ethane in our dry gas numbers since the netbacks for ethane are essentially equivalent to methane on a per Btu basis. 
Even so, based on cases we ran using last week’s lows for the 2012 strip, our 2012 cash flow estimates were almost $100 million lower than when we established our capital budget. Lower prices also reduced the projected returns of our drilling program. Marcellus returns are still strong at the current 5-year strip, about $3.90. We also stress test our investments and the projected returns are still adequate at $3.00 [indiscernible] strip. Please do keep in mind that the lags between spending capital on Marcellus wells and selling natural gas produced from those wells is several months, meaning the relevant 5-year strip when looking at 2012 investments is actually the 2013 to 2017 strip, which is currently somewhat north of $4. Therefore, it is clear to us that investments in developing our Marcellus play are attractive though they would obviously be even more attractive at higher prices.
Regarding our Huron wells, even though they are liquids rich, the returns are still below the Marcellus wells. But since lower prices mean a reduction in operating cash flow and we are commitment to living within our means, something has to give. That something is the Huron, and this is why we have suspended drilling in that play effective immediately. We will complete the wells that we have already -- that have already been spud, and continue to produce from existing wells. This decision will reduce our 2012 CapEx by about $135 million and reduce our forecast of sales of produced natural gas by approximately 5 Bcfe. The effect of this decision of volumes in the out years is the decline of 6 Bcfe in 2013 and a little over 3 Bcfe in 2014. The fact that the lag between drilling and sales in the Huron is much less than in the Marcellus is why the 2012 impact is as large as this, and the 2013/2014 impacts are as small as they are. Normally, one might lean away from cutting spending in an area in which we experience a shorter lag, but 2012 is not shaping up as a normal year. 
I’d now like to comment on our reserve report, which was released today. Our continued success in the Marcellus resulted in a 535 Bcfe or 18.5% increase in proved reserves. This was -- this increase was partially offset by a 413 Bcfe decrease in Huron proved reserves and we eliminated all of the proved undeveloped reserves consistent with our decision to suspend drilling of Huron wells. I remain confident that this play has value for our shareholders, but we are not going to be pursuing that value via the drill bit [ph] in the near future, so removing these PUDs now seemed appropriate. Further regarding reserves, we continue to have success with our experiment with tighter frac clusters. As we previously noted, this design works best in the more brittle areas of our play. Brittleness is also positively correlated with higher EURs using the standard frac design. With a year of well data in Rogersville, Greene County, we estimate an IP 40% higher than a standard frac well, with EURs trending 20% to 25% higher. Our 2012 plan includes 49 wells using this design, with about half applied where we have well control and half to de-risk areas where we predict success. We still do not have enough data to book many reserves or extrapolate these results across our acreage, but are excited about the results so far.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments, and doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash from operations and from future monetization. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders, and appreciate your continued support.

We will look at the cash flows, obviously. I guess that would be the thing that would cause us to change something is if we thought because of prices that cash flows were drying up enough that we had to make some other form of move and then we’d take a look at the rest of the operations to see what other forms of move was required.

Nobody asked to know that the production’s there. The accountants might have an issue with how you record it.

With me today are Dave Porges, President and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Conti, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Randy Crawford, Senior Vice President and President of Midstream, Distribution and Commercial; and Steve Schlotterbeck, Senior Vice President and President of Exploration and Production.

In just a moment, Phil will summarize our operational and financial results for the first quarter 2012, which were released this morning. Then Dave will provide an update on our strategic operational matters. Following Dave's remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy, and Steve will be available to answer your questions.

I'd like to point out that today on our website we provided additional details on our cost per well and EUR per well at different well lengths. Historically, we have provided these estimates assuming a 5300-foot lateral, which was our projected average. As you will see, the EUR per foot of lateral is unchanged and the cost per well is lower.

This call will be replayed for a 7-day period beginning at approximately 1.30 pm Eastern Time today. The phone number for the replay is 412-317-0088. The confirmation code is 10006583. The call will also be available for seven days on our website.

But first, I'd like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today's press release under risk factors in the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was filed with the SEC and updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are also filed with the SEC and available on our website. Today's call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning's press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, a 42% decrease from EPS in the first quarter 2011. The first quarter of 2012 included $6.2 million",1110,"Thanks Pat and good morning everyone.  As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, a 42% decrease from EPS in the first quarter 2011. The first quarter of 2012 included $6.2 million of expense associated with the retroactive portion of newly enacted Pennsylvania legislation imposing an impact fee on all wells drilled in the state including those wells drilled prior to 2012. In addition, there were two items that cumulatively added $36 million to our pre-tax income in the first of 2011 which distort the year-over-year comparisons.

Adjusting for those three items, EPS was $0.50 this year compared to $0.60 in the first quarter last year or a 24% decrease. The decrease in EPS comes as a result of lower natural gas prices on our un-hedged production, lower operating income at Equitable Gas as a result of unusually warm weather, and higher depletion rates at production. All of which more than offset another solid operational quarter including record produced natural gas sales and another record in gathering volumes. Operating cash flow which adjusts for those 2011 non-cash items as well as the non-cash impact of higher depletion rates decreased by 9% to $227 million for the quarter.

With that, I will go into a little more detail by business segments starting with EQT production, which continues to generate impressive growth in sales of produced natural gas. The growth rate was 26% in the recently completed quarter over the first quarter of 2011. That growth was primarily organic and was driven by sales from our Marcellus shale play, which contributed nearly 50% of the volumes in the quarter.

As I mentioned, gas prices were lower in the quarter. The realized price at EQT production was $3.59 compared to $3.97 last year. At the corporate level, EQT received $4.84 per Mcf equivalent or 11% less than last year. Produced liquids excluding ethane accounted for 6% of the volumes and 34% of the un-hedged revenues in the quarter.

Total operating expense of EQT production was higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, production taxes, and SG&A. The increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to an increase in cost to drill and complete wells, the removal of some proved reserves due to lower natural gas prices at year end, and the suspension of drilling activity in the Huron play.

As alluded to earlier, in February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed a natural gas impact fee. The legislation, which covers a significant portion of EQT’s Marcellus shale acreage, imposes an manual fee for a period of 15 years on each well of drilled. The impact fee adjust yearly based on three factors, age of the well, changes in the consumer price index, and the average monthly NYMEX natural gas price. Production taxes increased primarily due to the $8.2 million accrual in the first quarter of 2012 for this impact fee. Again, $6.2 million of that represents the retroactive portion of the fee for pre-2012 Marcellus wells.

Moving on to Midstream business, operating income here was up 10% versus last year excluding the impacts from the sale of the Langley processing complex and the Big Sandy Pipeline, and a reduction of non-income tax accruals in 2011. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity based transmission charges. Gathering net revenues increased by $10.3 million as gathering volumes increased by 21% while the average gathering rate declined by 4% driven by the Marcellus mix.

Transmission net revenues decreased by 13% to just under $23 million, resulting from the loss of revenues associated with the Big Sandy Pipeline, which we sold in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the Big Sandy revenues, transmission net revenues increased by 24%.

Storage marketing and other net operating income was down about $6 million in the first quarter. These results included $5.4 million in unrealized losses related to our storage inventory and a steeper slope in the front end of the near term natural gas curve. Because we have financial hedges associated with those inventories, we expect to have unrealized gains that will offset these unrealized losses over time. Given current market conditions, we estimate that full year 2012 net revenues in storage marketing and other will be approximately $50 million to $60 million.

Net operating expenses at Midstream were slightly higher quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of the previously mentioned non-income tax adjustments. For unit gathering and compression expense, again, excluding the non-income tax adjustments was down 7% to $0.28 per Mcf equivalent as a result of higher throughput while maintaining our cost structure.

And then finally, on the Midstream on February 13, 2012, EQT Midstream Partners' limited partnership filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as we move forward on forming an MLP.

Moving on to distribution, operating income, distribution was down 31% versus the first quarter last year. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA, the first quarter of 2012 was the warmest first quarter period on record in the service territory for Equitable Gas, 24% warmer than last year when measured by heating degree days. As a result, total net operating revenues for the first quarter 2012 were 19% lower, while operating expenses were down slightly excluding the prior year tax adjustments. Basically for each 100 heating degree day change in weather going to winter at Equitable Gas, our distribution margins change by about $2 million. So, the warmer weather in the quarter negatively impacted our EPS by about $0.05 per share versus normal weather and about $0.06 per share versus last year.

Moving on to 2012 guidance, today, we reiterated our production sales forecast for full year 2012 of between 250 and 255 Bcf equivalent or 30% higher than last year. Our forecasts are intended to represent our realistic projection factoring in some negative impacts from inevitable unplanned delays or disruptions such as delays in Midstream projects, permit delays, weather impacts etcetera. As a result of the lower forecast of natural gas prices for our un-hedged volumes, we are decreasing our operating cash flow estimate for 2012 to approximately $800 million. At the same time, as a result of our lower well cost estimates, we are also lowering our 2012 CapEx estimates by $100 million to $1.365 billion.

We exited the quarter with $745 million in cash on the balance sheet, no short-term debt including no cash frauds under our $1.5 billion credit facility. And so we remain in a great position as far as liquidity growth for 2012.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges.

As we have previously communicated, our objective of maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing this, the monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities while living within our means is also unchanged.

Our tactics, however, can and must change when circumstances warrant. In an environment in which natural gas prices are down sharply, we have already made tough decision, but you have January suspension of Huron drilling cutting CapEx by about $130 million.

We are focusing our drilling on our highest return opportunities with nearly 75% of our 2012 Marcellus wells being drilled in either our highest EUR areas or in the more liquids-rich portion of our West Virginia acreage. With the liquids uplift, the returns of the West Virginia wells are similar to more prolific dry gas wells in Pennsylvania. There is always a lag between making such decisions and having those changes show up with a cash register, but we are getting some immediate benefits from reducing our service cost as gas prices are declining. The cost of a 5300-foot well is down to $6.1 million from $6.7 million last year mainly due to those reductions. This will impact our 2012 CapEx, but will now show up in our depletion rate until next year just as last year's increases hit this year's depletion.

Our online after-tax IRR estimate is now 29% at the current NYMEX five-year strip of 366 per MMBtu and 25% at a flat $3 NYMEX. Therefore, it is clear to us that investments in our Marcellus play remain attractive even at current prices. So, they are obviously not as attractive as they would be in higher prices. We believe that prices will begin moving up once the current storage balance is worked off, however, (the long) that takes, but are structuring our business, so that they can thrive in an environment, which prices never get above, where say the back end of the curve currently sits. Practically, this means that we will continue to prioritize our spending rigorously and focus on improvements in cost structure whether they come from different ways of doing things or reduction at service costs. So, this heightened focus has already resulted in some reductions in activity level, notably the Huron decision.

I do want to reiterate what Phil mentioned about the volume guides for the year that is the fact that our growth versus same quarter last year is below our annual guidance, is not a result of changes in activities rather it's just the nature of the business given multi-well pads, large compressor stations, etcetera. Note, this is little lumpy. We also note that the three higher sequential growth rates in EQT's history in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first two quarters of 2011. So, the current comparisons are a little tougher than they will be later in the year. As for cash flow, we are aware that projections are lower than they were a few months ago due largely to decline in natural gas prices, but the reduction in well cost keeps our CapEx forecast in line with this lower cash flow even at a constant activity level. We will, of course, continually monitor market conditions and adapt our tactics accordingly.

In 2012, we are investing our operating cash flow plus also utilizing some of our other available capital. This other capital includes cash from our investment grade debt issuance completed in late 2011 and further monetizing Midstream assets by forming in MLP. As Phil mentioned on February 13, 2012, we filed the initial S1 for the MLP, but we recognize that this nearly starts the review process with the SEC. To remind you, the advantages of EQT shareholder - to EQT shareholders of forming an MLP includes, maintaining operational control of where, when, and to what specs gathering is built, access to an ongoing source of low cost capital, and participation in any MLP distribution growth. Of course, a publicly traded currency would also provide a market view of the value of the MLP's assets.

Moving on to some other operational matters, as we told on the last call, Mark West is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. This plant was originally scheduled to be up and running by mid-year. However, due to a number of delays that they experienced in permitting and construction, the project is now scheduled to be complete in the first quarter. We are looking into work arounds that would improve on this, but believe that we will meet our production sales volume targets even with the current schedule. The real impact of this is not on the overall volumes, but rather that additional margins from the revenue uplift expected from liquids extraction FF plant will obviously being delayed somewhat.

We are also working to a short adequate processing and transportation capacity to support our Marcellus growth beyond this year. We were an anchor tenant taking 150,000 dekatherms per day on Spectra Energy's Texas Eastern Pipeline expansion to Eastern Pennsylvania and Mid-Atlantic markets, plus 150,000 dekatherms per day of backhaul runs. The expansion is expected to be complete by the end of 2014. And we are in the process of securing additional processing capacity to enable further growth from our wet Marcellus acreage.

In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource via accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and they are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will say disciplined and live within our means investing our available cash from operations and from future monetizations as appropriate. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate we’ll continue to.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, a 42% decrease from EPS in the first quarter 2011. The first quarter of 2012 included $6.2 million",1109,"Thanks Pat and good morning everyone.  As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, a 42% decrease from EPS in the first quarter 2011. The first quarter of 2012 included $6.2 million of expense associated with the retroactive portion of newly enacted Pennsylvania legislation imposing an impact fee on all wells drilled in the state including those wells drilled prior to 2012. In addition, there were two items that cumulatively added $36 million to our pre-tax income in the first of 2011 which distort the year-over-year comparisons.
Adjusting for those three items, EPS was $0.50 this year compared to $0.60 in the first quarter last year or a 24% decrease. The decrease in EPS comes as a result of lower natural gas prices on our un-hedged production, lower operating income at Equitable Gas as a result of unusually warm weather, and higher depletion rates of production. All of which more than offset another solid operational quarter including record produced natural gas sales and another record in gathering volumes. Operating cash flow which adjusts for those 2011 non-cash items as well as the non-cash impact of higher depletion rates decreased by 9% to $227 million for the quarter.
With that, I will go into a little more detail by business segments starting with EQT production, which continues to generate impressive growth in sales of produced natural gas. The growth rate was 26% in the recently completed quarter over the first quarter of 2011. That growth was primarily organic and was driven by sales from our Marcellus shale play, which contributed nearly 50% of the volumes in the quarter.
As I mentioned, gas prices were lower in the quarter. The realized price at EQT production was $3.59 compared to $3.97 last year. At the corporate level, EQT received $4.84 per Mcf equivalent or 11% less than last year. Produced liquids excluding ethane accounted for 6% of the volumes and 34% of the un-hedged revenues in the quarter.
Total operating expense in EQT production was higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, production taxes, and SG&A. The increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to an increase in cost to drill and complete wells, the removal of some proved reserves due to lower natural gas prices at year end, and the suspension of drilling activity in the Huron play.
As alluded to earlier, in February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed a natural gas impact fee. The legislation, which covers a significant portion of EQT’s Marcellus shale acreage, imposes an annual fee for a period of 15 years on each well drilled. The impact fee adjusts yearly based on three factors, age of the well, changes in the consumer price index, and the average monthly NYMEX natural gas price. Production taxes increased primarily due to the $8.2 million accrual in the first quarter of 2012 for this impact fee. Again, $6.2 million of that represents the retroactive portion of the fee for pre-2012 Marcellus wells.
Moving on to Midstream business, operating income here was up 10% versus last year excluding the impacts from the sale of the Langley processing complex and the Big Sandy Pipeline, and a reduction of non-income tax accruals in 2011. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity based transmission charges. Gathering net revenues increased by $10.3 million as gathering volumes increased by 21% while the average gathering rate declined by 4% driven by the Marcellus mix.
Transmission net revenues decreased by 13% to just under $23 million, resulting from the loss of revenues associated with the Big Sandy Pipeline, which was sold in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the Big Sandy revenues, transmission in net revenues increased by 24%.
Storage marketing and other net operating income was down about $6 million in the first quarter. These results included $5.4 million in unrealized losses related to our storage inventory and a steeper slope in the front end of the near-term natural gas curve. Because we have financial hedges associated with those inventories, we expect to have unrealized gains that will offset these unrealized losses over time. Given current market conditions, we estimate that full year 2012 net revenues in storage, marketing and other will be approximately $50 million to $60 million.
Net operating expenses at Midstream were slightly higher quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of the previously mentioned non-income tax adjustments. For unit gathering and compression expense, again, excluding the non-income tax adjustments was down 7% to $0.28 per Mcf equivalent as a result of higher throughput while maintaining our cost structure.
And then finally, on the Midstream on February 13, 2012, EQT Midstream Partners' limited partnership filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as we move forward on forming an MLP.
Moving on to distribution, operating income, distribution was down 31% versus the first quarter last year. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA, the first quarter of 2012 was the warmest first quarter period on record in the service territory for Equitable Gas, 24% warmer than last year when measured by heating degree days. As a result, total net operating revenues for the first quarter 2012 were 19% lower, while operating expenses were down slightly, excluding the prior year tax adjustments. Basically for each 100 heating degree day change in weather going to winter at Equitable Gas, our distribution margins change by about $2 million. So, the warmer weather in the quarter negatively impacted our EPS by about $0.05 per share versus normal weather and about $0.06 per share versus last year.
Moving on to 2012 guidance, today, we reiterated our production sales forecast for full year 2012 of between 250 and 255 Bcf equivalent or 30% higher than last year. Our forecasts are intended to represent our realistic projection factoring in some negative impacts from inevitable unplanned delays or disruptions such as delays in Midstream projects, permit delays, weather impacts etcetera. As a result of the lower forecast of natural gas prices for our un-hedged volumes, we are decreasing our operating cash flow estimate for 2012 to approximately $800 million. At the same time, as a result of our lower well cost estimates, we are also lowering our 2012 CapEx estimates by $100 million to $1.365 billion.
We exited the quarter with $745 million in cash on the balance sheet, no short-term debt including no cash draws under our $1.5 billion credit facility. And so we remain in a great position as far as liquidity goes for 2012.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges."

As we have previously communicated, our objective of maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate.

As we have previously communicated, our objective of maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing this, the monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities while living within our means is also unchanged.
Our tactics, however, can and must change when circumstances warrant. In an environment in which natural gas prices are down sharply, we have already made tough decisions, such as our January suspension of Huron drilling, cutting CapEx by about $130 million.
We are focusing our drilling on our highest return opportunities with nearly 75% of our 2012 Marcellus wells being drilled in either our highest EUR areas or in the more liquids-rich portion of our West Virginia acreage. With the liquids uplift, the returns of the West Virginia wells are similar to more prolific dry gas wells in Pennsylvania. There is always a lag between making such decisions and having those changes show up at the cash register, but we are getting some immediate benefits from reducing our service cost as gas prices are declining. The cost of a 5300-foot well is down to $6.1 million from $6.7 million last year mainly due to those reductions. This will impact our 2012 CapEx, but will now show up in our depletion rate until next year just as last year's increases hit this year's depletion.
Our online after-tax IRR estimate is now 29% at the current NYMEX five-year strip of 366 per MMBtu and 25% at a flat $3 NYMEX. Therefore, it is clear to us that investments in our Marcellus play remain attractive even at current prices. So, they are obviously not as attractive as they would be at higher prices. We believe that prices will begin moving up once the current storage balance is worked off, however long that takes, but are structuring our business, so that they can thrive in an environment, which prices never get above, where say the back end of the curve currently sits. Practically, this means that we will continue to prioritize our spending rigorously and focus on improvements in cost structure whether they come from different ways of doing things or reductions in service costs. So, this heightened focus has already resulted in some reductions in activity level, notably the Huron decision.
I do want to reiterate what Phil mentioned about the volume guides for the year, that is the fact that our growth versus same quarter last year is below our annual guidance, is not a result of changes in activities rather it's just the nature of the business given multi-well pads, large compressor stations, etcetera. Note, this is little lumpy. We also note that the three higher sequential growth rates in EQT's history in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first two quarters of 2011. So, the current comparisons are a little tougher than they will be later in the year. As for cash flow, we are aware that projections are lower than they were a few months ago due largely to decline in natural gas prices, but the reduction in well cost keeps our CapEx forecast in line with this lower cash flow even at a constant activity level. We will, of course, continually monitor market conditions and adapt our tactics accordingly.
In 2012, we are investing our operating cash flow plus also utilizing some of our other available capital. This other capital includes cash from our investment grade debt issuance completed in late 2011 and further monetizing Midstream assets by forming in MLP. As Phil mentioned on February 13, 2012, we filed the initial S1 for the MLP, but we recognize that this nearly starts the review process with the SEC. To remind you, the advantages of EQT shareholder - to EQT shareholders of forming an MLP includes, maintaining operational control of where, when, and to what specs gathering is built, access to an ongoing source of low cost capital, and participation in any MLP distribution growth. Of course, a publicly traded currency would also provide a market view of the value of the MLP's assets.
Moving on to some other operational matters, as we told on the last call, MarkWest is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. This plant was originally scheduled to be up and running by mid-year. However, due to a number of delays that they experienced in permitting and construction, the project is now scheduled to be complete in the forth quarter. We are looking into work arounds that would improve on this, but believe that we will meet our production sales volume targets even with the current schedule. The real impact of this is not on the overall volumes, but rather that additional margins from the revenue uplift expected from liquids extraction FF plant will obviously being delayed somewhat.
We are also working to a short adequate processing and transportation capacity to support our Marcellus growth beyond this year. We were an anchor tenant taking 150,000 dekatherms per day on Spectra Energy's Texas Eastern Pipeline expansion to Eastern Pennsylvania and Mid-Atlantic markets, plus 150,000 dekatherms per day of backhaul runs. The expansion is expected to be complete by the end of 2014. And we are in the process of securing additional processing capacity to enable further growth from our wet Marcellus acreage.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource via accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will say disciplined and live within our means investing our available cash from operations and from future monetizations as appropriate. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support."

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, a 42% decrease from EPS in the first quarter 2011. The first quarter of 2012 included $6.2 milli",1109,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone.  As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $0.48 per diluted share, a 42% decrease from EPS in the first quarter 2011. The first quarter of 2012 included $6.2 million of expense associated with the retroactive portion of newly enacted Pennsylvania legislation imposing an impact fee on all wells drilled in the state including those wells drilled prior to 2012. In addition, there were 2 items that cumulatively added $36 million to our pre-tax income in the first of 2011 which distort the year-over-year comparisons.
Adjusting for those 3 items, EPS was $0.50 this year compared to $0.60 in the first quarter last year or a 24% decrease. The decrease in EPS comes as a result of lower natural gas prices on our un-hedged production, lower operating income at Equitable Gas as a result of unusually warm weather, and higher depletion rates of production. All of which more than offset another solid operational quarter including record produced natural gas sales and another record in gathering volumes. Operating cash flow which adjusts for those 2011 non-cash items as well as the non-cash impact of higher depletion rates decreased by 9% to $227 million for the quarter.
With that, I will go into a little more detail by business segments starting with EQT production, which continues to generate impressive growth in sales of produced natural gas. The growth rate was 26% in the recently completed quarter over the first quarter of 2011. That growth was primarily organic and was driven by sales from our Marcellus shale play, which contributed nearly 50% of the volumes in the quarter.
As I mentioned, gas prices were lower in the quarter. The realized price at EQT production was $3.59 compared to $3.97 last year. At the corporate level, EQT received $4.84 per Mcf equivalent or 11% less than last year. Produced liquids excluding ethane accounted for 6% of the volumes and 34% of the un-hedged revenues in the quarter.
Total operating expense in EQT production was higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, production taxes, and SG&A. The increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to an increase in cost to drill and complete wells, the removal of some proved reserves due to lower natural gas prices at year end, and the suspension of drilling activity in the Huron play.
As alluded to earlier, in February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed a natural gas impact fee. The legislation, which covers a significant portion of EQT’s Marcellus shale acreage, imposes an annual fee for a period of 15 years on each well drilled. The impact fee adjusts yearly based on 3 factors, age of the well, changes in the consumer price index, and the average monthly NYMEX natural gas price. Production taxes increased primarily due to the $8.2 million accrual in the first quarter of 2012 for this impact fee. Again, $6.2 million of that represents the retroactive portion of the fee for pre-2012 Marcellus wells.
Moving on to Midstream business, operating income here was up 10% versus last year excluding the impacts from the sale of the Langley processing complex and the Big Sandy Pipeline, and a reduction of non-income tax accruals in 2011. This is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity based transmission charges. Gathering net revenues increased by $10.3 million as gathering volumes increased by 21% while the average gathering rate declined by 4% driven by the Marcellus mix.
Transmission net revenues decreased by 13% to just under $23 million, resulting from the loss of revenues associated with the Big Sandy Pipeline, which was sold in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the Big Sandy revenues, transmission in net revenues increased by 24%.
Storage marketing and other net operating income was down about $6 million in the first quarter. These results included $5.4 million in unrealized losses related to our storage inventory and a steeper slope in the front end of the near-term natural gas curve. Because we have financial hedges associated with those inventories, we expect to have unrealized gains that will offset these unrealized losses over time. Given current market conditions, we estimate that full year 2012 net revenues in storage, marketing and other will be approximately $50 million to $60 million.
Net operating expenses at Midstream were slightly higher quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of the previously mentioned non-income tax adjustments. For unit gathering and compression expense, again, excluding the non-income tax adjustments was down 7% to $0.28 per Mcf equivalent as a result of higher throughput while maintaining our cost structure. And then finally, on the Midstream on February 13, 2012, EQT Midstream Partners' limited partnership filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as we move forward on forming an MLP.
Moving on to distribution, operating income, distribution was down 31% versus the first quarter last year. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA, the first quarter of 2012 was the warmest first quarter period on record in the service territory for Equitable Gas, 24% warmer than last year when measured by heating degree days. As a result, total net operating revenues for the first quarter 2012 were 19% lower, while operating expenses were down slightly, excluding the prior year tax adjustments. Basically for each 100 heating degree day change in weather going to winter at Equitable Gas, our distribution margins change by about $2 million. So, the warmer weather in the quarter negatively impacted our EPS by about $0.05 per share versus normal weather and about $0.06 per share versus last year.
Moving on to 2012 guidance, today, we reiterated our production sales forecast for full year 2012 of between 250 and 255 Bcf equivalent or 30% higher than last year. Our forecasts are intended to represent our realistic projection factoring in some negative impacts from inevitable unplanned delays or disruptions such as delays in Midstream projects, permit delays, weather impacts etcetera. As a result of the lower forecast of natural gas prices for our un-hedged volumes, we are decreasing our operating cash flow estimate for 2012 to approximately $800 million. At the same time, as a result of our lower well cost estimates, we are also lowering our 2012 CapEx estimates by $100 million to $1.365 billion.
We exited the quarter with $745 million in cash on the balance sheet, no short-term debt including no cash draws under our $1.5 billion credit facility. And so we remain in a great position as far as liquidity goes for 2012.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges."

As we have previously communicated, our objective of maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing this, the monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities while living within our means is also unchanged.
Our tactics, however, can and must change when circumstances warrant. In an environment in which natural gas prices are down sharply, we have already made tough decisions, such as our January suspension of Huron drilling, cutting CapEx by about $130 million.
We are focusing our drilling on our highest return opportunities with nearly 75% of our 2012 Marcellus wells being drilled in either our highest EUR areas or in the more liquids-rich portion of our West Virginia acreage. With the liquids uplift, the returns of the West Virginia wells are similar to more prolific dry gas wells in Pennsylvania. There is always a lag between making such decisions and having those changes show up at the cash register, but we are getting some immediate benefits from reducing our service cost as gas prices are declining. The cost of a 5300-foot well is down to $6.1 million from $6.7 million last year mainly due to those reductions. This will impact our 2012 CapEx, but will now show up in our depletion rate until next year just as last year's increases hit this year's depletion.
Our online after-tax IRR estimate is now 29% at the current NYMEX 5-year strip of 366 per MMBtu and 25% at a flat $3 NYMEX. Therefore, it is clear to us that investments in our Marcellus play remain attractive even at current prices. So, they are obviously not as attractive as they would be at higher prices. We believe that prices will begin moving up once the current storage balance is worked off, however long that takes, but are structuring our business, so that they can thrive in an environment, which prices never get above, where say the back end of the curve currently sits. Practically, this means that we will continue to prioritize our spending rigorously and focus on improvements in cost structure whether they come from different ways of doing things or reductions in service costs. So, this heightened focus has already resulted in some reductions in activity level, notably the Huron decision.
I do want to reiterate what Phil mentioned about the volume guides for the year, that is the fact that our growth versus same quarter last year is below our annual guidance, is not a result of changes in activities rather it's just the nature of the business given multi-well pads, large compressor stations, etcetera. Note, this is little lumpy. We also note that the 3 higher sequential growth rates in EQT's history in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first 2 quarters of 2011. So, the current comparisons are a little tougher than they will be later in the year. As for cash flow, we are aware that projections are lower than they were a few months ago due largely to decline in natural gas prices, but the reduction in well cost keeps our CapEx forecast in line with this lower cash flow even at a constant activity level. We will, of course, continually monitor market conditions and adapt our tactics accordingly.
In 2012, we are investing our operating cash flow plus also utilizing some of our other available capital. This other capital includes cash from our investment grade debt issuance completed in late 2011 and further monetizing Midstream assets by forming in MLP. As Phil mentioned on February 13, 2012, we filed the initial S1 for the MLP, but we recognize that this nearly starts the review process with the SEC. To remind you, the advantages of EQT shareholder -- to EQT shareholders of forming an MLP includes, maintaining operational control of where, when, and to what specs gathering is built, access to an ongoing source of low cost capital, and participation in any MLP distribution growth. Of course, a publicly traded currency would also provide a market view of the value of the MLP's assets.
Moving on to some other operational matters, as we told on the last call, MarkWest is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. This plant was originally scheduled to be up and running by mid-year. However, due to a number of delays that they experienced in permitting and construction, the project is now scheduled to be complete in the fourth quarter. We are looking into workarounds that would improve on this, but believe that we will meet our production sales volume targets even with the current schedule. The real impact of this is not on the overall volumes, but rather that additional margins from the revenue uplift expected from liquids extraction FF plant will obviously being delayed somewhat.
We are also working to a short adequate processing and transportation capacity to support our Marcellus growth beyond this year. We were an anchor tenant taking 150,000 dekatherms per day on Spectra Energy's Texas Eastern Pipeline expansion to Eastern Pennsylvania and Mid-Atlantic markets, plus 150,000 dekatherms per day of backhaul runs. The expansion is expected to be complete by the end of 2014. And we are in the process of securing additional processing capacity to enable further growth from our wet Marcellus acreage.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource via accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will say disciplined and live within our means investing our available cash from operations and from future monetizations as appropriate. We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support."

As you already know, we successfully completed an IPO of EQT Midstream Partners earlier this month. Before we review this quarter’s results, I want to remind you that there was no impact to our second quarter results as the IPO did not close until July 2. next quarter, our EQT results will include the results of EQT Midstream Partners on a consolidated basis.

Cash distributions from the partnership to the non-controlling interest will be reflected in the financing section of EQT’s statement of cash flows as a use of cash. The cash distributions to the non-controlling interest will not impact the consolidated cash flows provided by the operating activities or cash flows from investing activities. There will also be a separate press release, 10-Q and conference call to detail EQT Midstream Partners third quarter results.
In just a moment, Phil will summarize our operational and financial results for the second quarter 2012, which were released this morning. Then Dave will provide an update on our strategic operational matters. Following Dave’s remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy, and Steve will all be available to answer your questions.
But first, as usual, I’d like to remind you that today’s call may contain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today’s press release and under Risk Factors in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 filed with the SEC, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our website.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2012 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share, a $0.30 decrease from adjusted EPS in the second quarter 2011. Two price related items together",1312,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2012 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share, a $0.30 decrease from adjusted EPS in the second quarter 2011. Two price related items together reduced EQT production revenues by $15.3 million or $0.07 per share this quarter, one item was related to gas price put that should have been recognized in 2010 and 2011 resulting in a non-cash revenue reduction of $8.2 million in the second quarter of 2012.
The other was a $7.1 million increase in third-party gathering, processing and transmission revenue deductions, from the sale of unused firm capacity at rates below what we are paying, and I will give you some more on that in a minute. Operating cash flow in the quarter of approximately $160 million decreased by 14% versus cash flow in the second quarter of 2011. Other than that, the operating results this quarter are fairly straightforward.
In short, we had another strong operating quarter at EQT. Production and sales volumes were 28% higher than last year and a 11% higher than in the first quarter this year. NGL volumes were 10% higher than the last year and 8% higher than in the first quarter, and midstream gathering volumes were 24% higher than last year and 9% higher than in the first quarter.
However, commodity prices were significantly lower than last year and that more than overwhelmed our operational progress. I would discuss that in a bit more detail in the segment results starting with EQT Production, where sales volumes continued to grow as planned. As I mentioned, production volumes were 28% higher and that growth was driven by a 74% increase in sales from our Marcellus Shale play.
We do, we did hit two significant Marcellus milestones this quarter. First, we turned our 200 Marcellus horizontal well online and second, our Marcellus production accounted for over half of our total volumes for the first time hitting 54% of the total in the quarter. Offsetting the impact of volume growth, however, the realized price at EQT Production was $2.62 for Mcfe compared to $4.16 last year or about 37% lower. At the corporate level, EQT received $3.83 per Mcfe compared to $5.60 received last year.
NYMEX gas prices basis and liquid revenues were all lower in the quarter somewhat offset by our natural gas hedges, which contributed about $85 million to revenue in the second quarter. The two price related items that I mentioned upfront lowered both the EQT production and EQT corporate price in the second quarter 2012 by a combined 26% per Mcfe.
The revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation to arrive at those realized prices, was $0.56 for the second quarter, and you can see that in the table in this morning's press release. That $0.56 includes $0.12 per Mcfe resulting from the company's inability in the quarter to resell it unused contracted capacity on the recently completed El Paso 300 line at unit rates at or above what we currently pay under the existing agreement with El Paso.
Put another way, by subtracting that $0.12 from the $0.56 reported for the second quarter 2012, a reasonable per unit run rate for the deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation would be approximately $0.44 per Mcfe.
Going forward, the run rate will vary from - we think $0.40 to $0.045 and the actual reported rate each quarter will be impacted positively or negatively depending on the market rates we receive for the short-term resale of our 300 line capacity that is not currently reserved for EQT production, or that is not currently under long-term resale contracts with third parties.
The value of the unused capacity will vary seasonally, and to illustrate that point in the first quarter of 2012 the revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation was actually offset positively by about $0.12 from the run rate as a result of sales of unused capacity at rates above our cost.
We expect to continue to see this volatility prospectively as we continue to contract for capacity to move production and sales volumes to market, and then sell the unused portion as those volumes ramp up. As such, we will quantify the impact each quarter. So that you can see the underlying trend of the production revenue deductions more clearly.
Produced NGL volumes, mainly from our liquids-rich Huron and West Virginia Marcellus plays were 10% higher than last year and account for 6% of the volumes in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include ethane in this calculation as it is currently mostly sold as an ethane. If we included ethane, the percentage of liquids produced would approximately double.
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, LOE and production taxes, per unit LOE excluding production taxes was down 14% to $0.19 per Mcf in the quarter that decrease was a result of producing higher volumes while maintaining our cost structure that is already among the best in the industry. Production taxes were also lower on a unit basis at $0.17 per Mcfe versus $0.20 last year, this time due to lower prices in the second quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2011.
Moving on to midstream results, in the second quarter operating income here was up 14% consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission charges. Gathering net revenues increased by $10.9 million as gathering volumes increased by 24% somewhat offset by the average gathering rate, which declined by 5% due to the increase in Marcellus gathered volumes was due to get charged the lower rate.
As Marcellus production continues to grow as a percent of our total production mix, the average gathering rate paid by EQT production will continue to decline. However, EQT Midstream margins will continue to be strong that the per unit midstream expenses from Marcellus production is also lower than our current average.
Midstream transmission net revenues also increased by 31% in the quarter after adjusting for $8.1 million of Big Sandy revenues recorded last year, and we’re still on Big Sandy.
Storage, marketing and other net operating revenues was up about $2.7 million in the second quarter. As has been mentioned before the storage and marketing part of the midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve and those have continued to deteriorate.
Given current marketing conditions, we now estimate that full year 2012 net revenues and storage marketing and other will total approximately $50 million. Net operating expenses at midstream were up quarter-over-quarter consistent with the growth of the business per unit gathering and transmission expense was flat as we maintained our cost structure.
Finally a little bit of guidance, today we did reiterate our production sales forecast for full year 2012 of between 250 Bcfe and 255 Bcfe or approximately 30% higher than 2011. We expect that third quarter 2012 production sales will obviously be approximately 66 Bcfe.
Based on our forecast we are reiterating our operating cash flow estimate for 2012 of approximately $800 million using the current strip. We are also tweaking our production CapEx forecast to $900 million from $965 million and our total company CapEx forecast to $1.3 billion from $1.365 billion to reflect year-to-date actual investments and our second half investing plans. Our plan is still to drill 132 Marcellus wells in 2012.
We closed the quarter with approximately $515 million in cash on hand and subsequent to quarter end, we did receive $232 million in proceeds from the IPO of EQT Midstream Partners, which Dave will discuss momentarily. We continue to have full availability under our $1.5 billion credit facility, which was recently expanded through November 2016.
With that I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges.

Of course, the specifics of these monetizations the assets, the timing, the form are very much affected by market conditions. We took another major step forward this month with the successful IPO of EQT Midstream Partners LP.
Including the impact of the underwriters over allotment option, which was fully exercised EQT Midstream sold about 40% of the limited partnership units to the public, with the units pricing on-schedule and at the top of the indicated price range. These units trade on the New York Stock Exchange using the ticker EQM. We believe EQM will provide us with ongoing access to capital at relatively low cost consistent with the steady cash flows generated by those midstream assets.
As we were on our multi-city MLP IPO roadshow, we met with many of our existing EQT shareholders and many of our new EQM unit holders. Both groups of equity owners including those now owning both securities recognized the symbiotic relationship between EQT and EQM.
The capital raised in this offering will be redeployed to accelerate the development of our vast Marcellus acreage position. This acceleration will lead to increased sales of produced volumes, and also increased gathering and transmission volumes and cash flow for EQT Midstream and EQM.
This increase in Midstream cash flow drives MLP unitholder returns and will help increase the amount of capital available through additional midstream sales of assets from EQT to EQM so-called dropdown.
For the time being we anticipate that most large Midstream investments will be made and EQT level. With most of the EQM capital investments coming in the form of purchases from EQT. We do anticipate that there will be some direct construction of facilities at the EQM level, but we do not want too much of EQM’s capital tied up in investments that are not yet generating cash flow. Therefore the basic model is to build most of the facilities at the EQT level until EQM is larger.
Conceptually, our current construct is that over time EQT’s capital expenditures in the midstream will roughly equal proceeds from sales to EQM. As EQM grows more of the capital expenditures related to midstream construction will be made inside EQM. We believe that this approach will allow us to continue to benefit from a key attribute of the MLP structure in that we retain operational control, so that we make sure that we have gathering capacity, where and when we need it to achieve our development targets.
Moving on to other operational matters, as we told you on the last call, MarkWest is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. This plant construction is moving along, and we still anticipate completion by year-end. This is later than originally anticipated, but the schedule has remained the same since our last quarterly update.
Since that last call, EQT and MarkWest have also developed an interim solution, using some existing and some new assets to provide EQT with some cryogenic processing until the originally contracted facilities are turned in line. This capacity roughly equivalent to 40 million cubic feet per day are a third of contractual capacity, came online late last week.
As we also mentioned in the last call, our production sales volume target remain the same even with the current schedule for the full plant that we will obviously not have as higher percentage of natural gas liquids in that full-year total as originally anticipated. Still this interim solution will help us gain back some of the liquids uplift that was considered lost due to the delay.
As you saw in this morning’s press release, we reiterated our production sales volume guidance. New production sales volume is up by 11% over the first quarter and expect to grow at a similar sequential rate in the third and fourth quarters.
I mentioned in the last call that growth rates versus same quarter prior year can vary due to the inherent lumpiness of how we add volumes. As an example, since the beginning of 2010, our sequential growth rates probably a better way to capture this particular issue, averaged about 8%. That is an average quarter had volumes about 8% higher than the immediately preceding quarter. However, these sequential growth rates range from just over 3% to nearly 14%. This lumpiness is largely the result of a combination of pad drilling and the timing of infrastructure [apps].
Knowing all that, we're right on plan year-to-date and confident that we will hit our targets. To give you a specific example to speak to this, we are just now bringing online a 10 well pad in Greene County. On average, the wells on this pad will have initial flow rates of about 10 to 12 billion cubic feet per day each. So we expect that this will be our first 100 million per day pad.
Typically turn the wells on such pads in line one at a time and we will be well into August before all 10 wells on this pad are flowing. You can expect that over the next couple of years, we will continue to have periods during which volumes more or less plateau for a period of time and then surge with the turning in line of a multi-well pad or a new infrastructure project.
Moving on to other matters, earlier this month EQT announced the launch of pilot program to begin converting drilling rigs to LNG, liquefied natural gas, displacing the diesel used to power equipment at the well site. EQT is the first operator in the Marcellus to convert a diesel rig to LNG, which will provide a cleaner burning alternative fuel for the regions drilling operations.
However, we do believe that this is going to quickly become more commonplace throughout the industry, and that will improve the logistics of getting natural gas of the rigs for all of us.
EQTs initial rig conversion is now operating in northern West Virginia and pending evaluation of the pilot program, we hope to convert additional rigs in the West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The LNG being used for EQT's pilot program is produced from Marcellus natural gas reserves and is about 40% less expensive than diesel. The use of LNG also provides another means of adding to the use of natural gas, and we do expect that there will be circumstances in which we will be able to improve the economics further by using field gas.
We are proud to be a leader in reducing the environmental impacts related to drilling. Along with safety, protection of the environment is top of mind for our employees, contractors, and of course, communities. Compared to diesel, natural gas emits between 20% and 30% less carbon dioxide, and has a fraction of the emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxides and particulates.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash flow from operations and from future monetizations.
We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate continued support. Pat?

The issue that we have though is that as we understand because we are neophyte in this MLP world. But as we understand it what we’re really trying to do to drive value at that level is, as you try to drive unit distribution growth and it is more difficult to do that when a high percentage of the capital employed is tied up in non-cash generating assets, such as assets under construction.
So, from that perspective - actually you think even with large MLPs, you see that there’s only a certain percentage of their capital that they have invested in non-cash generating assets, is just the size of EQM, that’s not a very big number right now. Over time you would expect to see that number to grow.

As you already know, we successfully completed an IPO of EQT Midstream Partners earlier this month. Before we review this quarter’s results, I want to remind you that there was no impact to our second quarter results as the IPO did not close until July 2. Next quarter, our EQT results will include the results of EQT Midstream Partners on a consolidated basis.
Below in that income line in the statement of consolidated income, EQT will present the amount of net income attributable to the public unitholders under the caption “net income attributable to non-controlling interest”.
Cash distributions from the partnership to the non-controlling interest will be reflected in the financing section of EQT’s statement of cash flows as a use of cash. The cash distributions to the non-controlling interest will not impact the consolidated cash flows provided by the operating activities or cash flows from investing activities. There will also be a separate press release, 10-Q and conference call to detail EQT Midstream Partners' third quarter results.
In just a moment, Phil will summarize our operational and financial results for the second quarter 2012, which were released this morning. Then Dave will provide an update on our strategic operational matters. Following Dave’s remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy, and Steve will all be available to answer your questions.
But first, as usual, I’d like to remind you that today’s call may contain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today’s press release and under Risk Factors in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 filed with the SEC, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our website.
Today’s call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to this morning’s press release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.

Two price-related items together reduced EQT production revenues by $15.3 million or $0.07 per share this quarter, one item was related to gas price put that should have been recognized in 2010 and 2011, resulting in a non-cash revenue reduction of $8.2 million in the second quarter of '12.
The other was a $7.1 million increase in third-party gathering, processing and transmission revenue deductions, from the sale of unused firm capacity at rates below what we are paying, and I will give you some more on that in a minute. Operating cash flow in the quarter of approximately $160 million decreased by 14% versus cash flow in the second quarter of 2011.

In short, we had another strong operating quarter at EQT. Production and sales volumes were 28% higher than last year and 11% higher than in the first quarter this year. NGL volumes were 10% higher than the last year and 8% higher than in the first quarter. And midstream gathering volumes were 24% higher than last year and 9% higher than in the first quarter.
However, commodity prices were significantly lower than last year and that more than overwhelmed our operational progress. I will discuss that in a bit more detail in the segment results starting with EQT Production, where sales volumes continued to grow as planned. As I mentioned, production volumes were 28% higher and that growth was driven by a 74% increase in sales from our Marcellus Shale play.
We do, we did hit 2 significant Marcellus milestones this quarter. First, we turned our 200th Marcellus horizontal well online. And second, our Marcellus production accounted for over 1/2 of our total volumes for the first time hitting 54% of the total in the quarter. Offsetting the impact of volume growth, however, the realized price at EQT Production was $2.62 for Mcfe compared to $4.16 last year or about 37% lower. At the corporate level, EQT received $3.83 per Mcfe compared to $5.60 received last year.
NYMEX gas prices basis and liquid revenues were all lower in the quarter somewhat offset by our natural gas hedges, which contributed about $85 million to revenue in the second quarter. The 2 price-related items that I mentioned upfront lowered both the EQT production and EQT corporate price in the second quarter 2012 by a combined 26% per Mcfe.
The revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation to arrive at those realized prices, was $0.56 for the second quarter, and you can see that in the table in this morning's press release. That $0.56 includes $0.12 per Mcfe resulting from the company's inability in the quarter to resell it unused contracted capacity on the recently completed El Paso 300 line at unit rates at or above what we currently pay under the existing agreement with El Paso.
Put another way, by subtracting that $0.12 from the $0.56 reported for the second quarter 2012, a reasonable per unit run rate for the deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation would be approximately $0.44 per Mcfe.
Going forward, the run rate will vary from - we think $0.40 to $0.045 and the actual reported rate each quarter will be impacted positively or negatively depending on the market rates we receive for the short-term resale of our 300 line capacity that is not currently reserved for EQT production, or that is not currently under long-term resale contracts with third parties.
The value of the unused capacity will vary seasonally, and to illustrate that point in the first quarter of 2012 the revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation was actually offset positively by about $0.12 from the run rate as a result of sales of unused capacity at rates above our cost.
We expect to continue to see this volatility prospectively as we continue to contract for capacity to move production and sales volumes to market, and then sell the unused portion as those volumes ramp up. As such, we will quantify the impact each quarter so that you can see the underlying trend of the production revenue deductions more clearly.
Produced NGL volumes, mainly from our liquids-rich Huron and West Virginia Marcellus plays were 10% higher than last year and account for 6% of the volumes in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include ethane in this calculation as it is currently mostly sold as methane. If we included ethane, the percentage of liquids produced would approximately double.
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, LOE and production taxes. Per unit LOE excluding production taxes was down 14% to $0.19 per Mcf in the quarter that decrease was a result of producing higher volumes while maintaining our cost structure that is already among the best in the industry. Production taxes were also lower on a unit basis at $0.17 per Mcfe versus $0.20 last year, this time due to lower prices in the second quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2011.
Moving on to midstream results, in the second quarter operating income here was up 14% consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission charges. Gathering net revenues increased by $10.9 million as gathering volumes increased by 24% somewhat offset by the average gathering rate, which declined by 5% due to the increase in Marcellus gathered volumes was due to get charged the lower rate.
As Marcellus production continues to grow as a percent of our total production mix, the average gathering rate paid by EQT production will continue to decline. However, EQT Midstream margins will continue to be strong that the per unit midstream expenses from Marcellus production is also lower than our current average.
Midstream transmission net revenues also increased by 31% in the quarter after adjusting for $8.1 million of Big Sandy revenues recorded last year, when we still owned Big Sandy.
Storage, marketing and other net operating revenues was up about $2.7 million in the second quarter. As has been mentioned before the storage and marketing part of the midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve and those have continued to deteriorate.
Given current marketing conditions, we now estimate that full year 2012 net revenues and storage marketing and other will total approximately $50 million. Net operating expenses at midstream were up quarter-over-quarter consistent with the growth of the business per unit gathering and transmission expense was flat as we maintained our cost structure.
Finally a little bit of guidance. Today we did reiterate our production sales forecast for full year 2012 of between 250 Bcfe and 255 Bcfe or approximately 30% higher than 2011. We expect that third quarter 2012 production sales will obviously be approximately 66 Bcfe.
Based on our forecast we are reiterating our operating cash flow estimate for 2012 of approximately $800 million using the current strip. We are also tweaking our production CapEx forecast to $900 million from $965 million and our total company CapEx forecast to $1.3 billion from $1.365 billion to reflect year-to-date actual investments and our second half investing plans. Our plan is still to drill 132 Marcellus wells in 2012.
We closed the quarter with approximately $515 million in cash on hand and subsequent to quarter end, we did receive $232 million in proceeds from the IPO of EQT Midstream Partners, which Dave will discuss momentarily. We continue to have full availability under our $1.5 billion credit facility, which was recently expanded through November 2016.
With that I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges."
269924,145605992,332391,"EQT Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phil. As I’ve previously communicated our objective of maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing the amortization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investmen",1269,"Thank you, Phil. As I’ve previously communicated our objective of maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing the amortization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities while living within our means is also unchanged. Of course, the specifics of these monetizations the assets, the timing, the form are very much affected by market conditions. We took another major step forward this month with the successful IPO of EQT Midstream Partners LP.
Including the impact of the underwriters over allotment option, which was fully exercised EQT Midstream sold about 40% of the limited partnership units to the public, with the units pricing on-schedule and at the top of the indicated price range. These units trade on the New York Stock Exchange using the ticker EQM. We believe EQM will provide us with ongoing access to capital at relatively low cost consistent with the steady cash flows generated by those midstream assets.
As we were on our multi-city MLP IPO roadshow, we met with many of our existing EQT shareholders and many of our new EQM unit holders. Both groups of equity owners including those now owning both securities recognized the symbiotic relationship between EQT and EQM.
The capital raised in this offering will be redeployed to accelerate the development of our vast Marcellus acreage position. This acceleration will lead to increased sales of produced volumes, and also increased gathering and transmission volumes and cash flow for EQT Midstream and EQM.
This increase in Midstream cash flow drives MLP unitholder returns and will help increase the amount of capital available through additional midstream sales of assets from EQT to EQM so-called dropdown.
For the time being we anticipate that most large Midstream investments will be made and EQT level. With most of the EQM capital investments coming in the form of purchases from EQT. We do anticipate that there will be some direct construction of facilities at the EQM level, but we do not want too much of EQM’s capital tied up in investments that are not yet generating cash flow. Therefore the basic model is to build most of the facilities at the EQT level until EQM is larger.
Conceptually, our current construct is that over time EQT’s capital expenditures in the midstream will roughly equal proceeds from sales to EQM. As EQM grows more of the capital expenditures related to midstream construction will be made inside EQM. We believe that this approach will allow us to continue to benefit from a key attribute of the MLP structure in that we retain operational control, so that we can make sure that we have gathering capacity, where and when we need it to achieve our development targets.
Moving on to other operational matters. As we told you on the last call, MarkWest is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. This plant construction is moving along, and we still anticipate completion by year end. This is later than originally anticipated, but the schedule has remained the same since our last quarterly update.
Since that last call, EQT and MarkWest have also developed an interim solution, using some existing and some new assets to provide EQT with some cryogenic processing until the originally contracted facilities are turned in line. This capacity, roughly equivalent to 40 million cubic feet per day or 1/3 of contractual capacity, came online late last week.
As we also mentioned in the last call, our production sales volume targets remain the same even with the current schedule for the full plant that we will obviously not have as high a percentage of natural gas liquids in that full-year total as originally anticipated. Still this interim solution will help us gain back some of the liquids uplift that was considered lost due to the delay.
As you saw in this morning’s press release, we reiterated our production sales volume guidance. New production sales volume is up by 11% over the first quarter and expect it to grow at a similar sequential rate in the third and fourth quarters.
I mentioned in the last call that growth rates versus same quarter prior year can vary due to the inherent lumpiness of how we add volumes. As an example, since the beginning of 2010, our sequential growth rates, probably a better way to capture this particular issue, averaged about 8%. That is an average quarter had volumes about 8% higher than the immediately preceding quarter. However, these sequential growth rates range from just over 3% to nearly 14%. This lumpiness is largely the result of a combination of pad drilling and the timing of infrastructure adds.
Knowing all that, we're right on plan year-to-date and confident that we will hit our targets. To give you a specific example that speaks to this, we are just now bringing online a 10 well pad in Greene County. On average, the wells on this pad will have initial flow rates of about 10 to 12 billion cubic feet per day each. So we expect that this will be our first 100 million per day pad.
Typically turn the wells on such pads in line one at a time and we will be well into August before all 10 wells on this pad are flowing. You can expect that over the next couple of years, we will continue to have periods during which volumes more or less plateau for a period of time and then surge with the turning in line of a multi-well pad or a new infrastructure project.
Moving on to other matters, earlier this month EQT announced the launch of a pilot program to begin converting drilling rigs to LNG, liquefied natural gas, displacing the diesel used to power equipment at the well site. EQT is the first operator in the Marcellus to convert a diesel rig to LNG, which will provide a cleaner burning alternative fuel for the region's drilling operations.
However, we do believe that this is going to quickly become more commonplace throughout the industry, and that will improve the logistics of getting natural gas of the rigs for all of us.
EQTs initial rig conversion is now operating in northern West Virginia and pending evaluation of the pilot program, we hope to convert additional rigs in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The LNG being used for EQT's pilot program is produced from Marcellus natural gas reserves and is about 40% less expensive than diesel. The use of LNG also provides another means of adding to the use of natural gas, and we do expect that there will be circumstances in which we will be able to improve the economics further by using field gas.
We are proud to be a leader in reducing the environmental impacts related to drilling. Along with safety, protection of the environment is top of mind for our employees, contractors, and of course, communities. Compared to diesel, natural gas emits between 20% and 30% less carbon dioxide, and has a fraction of the emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxides and particulates.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash flow from operations and from future monetizations.
We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate continued support. Pat?"

As you already know, we successfully completed an IPO of EQT Midstream Partners earlier this month. Before we review this quarter’s results, I want to remind you that there was no impact to our second quarter results as the IPO did not close until July 2. Next quarter, our EQT results will include the results of EQT Midstream Partners on a consolidated basis.
Below in that income line in the statement of consolidated income, EQT will present the amount of net income attributable to the public unitholders under the caption “net income attributable to non-controlling interest”.
Cash distributions from the partnership to the non-controlling interest will be reflected in the financing section of EQT’s statement of cash flows as a use of cash. The cash distributions to the non-controlling interest will not impact the consolidated cash flows provided by the operating activities or cash flows from investing activities. There will also be a separate press release, 10-Q and conference call to detail EQT Midstream Partners' third quarter results.
In just a moment, Phil will summarize our operational and financial results for the second quarter 2012, which were released this morning. Then Dave will provide an update on our strategic operational matters. Following Dave’s remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy, and Steve will all be available to answer your questions.
But first, as usual, I’d like to remind you that today’s call may contain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today’s press release and under Risk Factors in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 filed with the SEC, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our website.

As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2012 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share, a $0.30 decrease from adjusted EPS in the second quarter 2011. Two price-related items together",1308,"Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced second quarter 2012 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share, a $0.30 decrease from adjusted EPS in the second quarter 2011. Two price-related items together reduced EQT production revenues by $15.3 million or $0.07 per share this quarter, one item was related to gas price put that should have been recognized in 2010 and 2011, resulting in a non-cash revenue reduction of $8.2 million in the second quarter of '12.
The other was a $7.1 million increase in third-party gathering, processing and transmission revenue deductions, from the sale of unused firm capacity at rates below what we are paying, and I will give you some more on that in a minute. Operating cash flow in the quarter of approximately $160 million decreased by 14% versus cash flow in the second quarter of 2011. Other than that, the operating results this quarter are fairly straightforward.
In short, we had another strong operating quarter at EQT. Production and sales volumes were 28% higher than last year and 11% higher than in the first quarter this year. NGL volumes were 10% higher than the last year and 8% higher than in the first quarter. And midstream gathering volumes were 24% higher than last year and 9% higher than in the first quarter.
However, commodity prices were significantly lower than last year and that more than overwhelmed our operational progress. I will discuss that in a bit more detail in the segment results starting with EQT Production, where sales volumes continued to grow as planned. As I mentioned, production volumes were 28% higher and that growth was driven by a 74% increase in sales from our Marcellus Shale play.
We do, we did hit 2 significant Marcellus milestones this quarter. First, we turned our 200th Marcellus horizontal well online. And second, our Marcellus production accounted for over 1/2 of our total volumes for the first time hitting 54% of the total in the quarter. Offsetting the impact of volume growth, however, the realized price at EQT Production was $2.62 for Mcfe compared to $4.16 last year or about 37% lower. At the corporate level, EQT received $3.83 per Mcfe compared to $5.60 received last year.
NYMEX gas prices basis and liquid revenues were all lower in the quarter somewhat offset by our natural gas hedges, which contributed about $85 million to revenue in the second quarter. The 2 price-related items that I mentioned upfront lowered both the EQT production and EQT corporate price in the second quarter 2012 by a combined 26% per Mcfe.
The revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation to arrive at those realized prices, was $0.56 for the second quarter, and you can see that in the table in this morning's press release. That $0.56 includes $0.12 per Mcfe resulting from the company's inability in the quarter to resell it unused contracted capacity on the recently completed El Paso 300 line at unit rates at or above what we currently pay under the existing agreement with El Paso.
Put another way, by subtracting that $0.12 from the $0.56 reported for the second quarter 2012, a reasonable per unit run rate for the deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation would be approximately $0.44 per Mcfe.
Going forward, the run rate will vary from -- we think $0.40 to $0.045 and the actual reported rate each quarter will be impacted positively or negatively depending on the market rates we receive for the short-term resale of our 300 line capacity that is not currently reserved for EQT production, or that is not currently under long-term resale contracts with third parties.
The value of the unused capacity will vary seasonally, and to illustrate that point in the first quarter of 2012 the revenue deduction for third-party gathering, processing and transportation was actually offset positively by about $0.12 from the run rate as a result of sales of unused capacity at rates above our cost.
We expect to continue to see this volatility prospectively as we continue to contract for capacity to move production and sales volumes to market, and then sell the unused portion as those volumes ramp up. As such, we will quantify the impact each quarter so that you can see the underlying trend of the production revenue deductions more clearly.
Produced NGL volumes, mainly from our liquids-rich Huron and West Virginia Marcellus plays were 10% higher than last year and account for 6% of the volumes in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not include ethane in this calculation as it is currently mostly sold as methane. If we included ethane, the percentage of liquids produced would approximately double.
Total operating expenses at EQT Production were higher quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher DD&A, LOE and production taxes. Per unit LOE excluding production taxes was down 14% to $0.19 per Mcf in the quarter that decrease was a result of producing higher volumes while maintaining our cost structure that is already among the best in the industry. Production taxes were also lower on a unit basis at $0.17 per Mcfe versus $0.20 last year, this time due to lower prices in the second quarter of 2012 versus the second quarter of 2011.
Moving on to midstream results, in the second quarter operating income here was up 14% consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity-based transmission charges. Gathering net revenues increased by $10.9 million as gathering volumes increased by 24% somewhat offset by the average gathering rate, which declined by 5% due to the increase in Marcellus gathered volumes was due to get charged the lower rate.
As Marcellus production continues to grow as a percent of our total production mix, the average gathering rate paid by EQT production will continue to decline. However, EQT Midstream margins will continue to be strong that the per unit midstream expenses from Marcellus production is also lower than our current average.
Midstream transmission net revenues also increased by 31% in the quarter after adjusting for $8.1 million of Big Sandy revenues recorded last year, when we still owned Big Sandy.
Storage, marketing and other net operating revenues was up about $2.7 million in the second quarter. As has been mentioned before the storage and marketing part of the midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve and those have continued to deteriorate.
Given current marketing conditions, we now estimate that full year 2012 net revenues and storage marketing and other will total approximately $50 million. Net operating expenses at midstream were up quarter-over-quarter consistent with the growth of the business per unit gathering and transmission expense was flat as we maintained our cost structure.
Finally a little bit of guidance. Today we did reiterate our production sales forecast for full year 2012 of between 250 Bcfe and 255 Bcfe or approximately 30% higher than 2011. We expect that third quarter 2012 production sales will obviously be approximately 66 Bcfe.
Based on our forecast we are reiterating our operating cash flow estimate for 2012 of approximately $800 million using the current strip. We are also tweaking our production CapEx forecast to $900 million from $965 million and our total company CapEx forecast to $1.3 billion from $1.365 billion to reflect year-to-date actual investments and our second half investing plans. Our plan is still to drill 132 Marcellus wells in 2012.
We closed the quarter with approximately $515 million in cash on hand and subsequent to quarter end, we did receive $232 million in proceeds from the IPO of EQT Midstream Partners, which Dave will discuss momentarily. We continue to have full availability under our $1.5 billion credit facility, which was recently expanded through November 2016.
With that I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges."
269924,145605992,332591,"EQT Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phil. As I’ve previously communicated our objective of maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing the amortization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investmen",1269,"Thank you, Phil. As I’ve previously communicated our objective of maximizing shareholder value is unchanged by changes in the environment in which we operate. The strategy accomplishing the amortization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities while living within our means is also unchanged. Of course, the specifics of these monetizations the assets, the timing, the form are very much affected by market conditions. We took another major step forward this month with the successful IPO of EQT Midstream Partners LP.
Including the impact of the underwriters over allotment option, which was fully exercised EQT Midstream sold about 40% of the limited partnership units to the public, with the units pricing on-schedule and at the top of the indicated price range. These units trade on the New York Stock Exchange using the ticker EQM. We believe EQM will provide us with ongoing access to capital at relatively low cost consistent with the steady cash flows generated by those midstream assets.
As we were on our multi-city MLP IPO roadshow, we met with many of our existing EQT shareholders and many of our new EQM unit holders. Both groups of equity owners including those now owning both securities recognized the symbiotic relationship between EQT and EQM.
The capital raised in this offering will be redeployed to accelerate the development of our vast Marcellus acreage position. This acceleration will lead to increased sales of produced volumes, and also increased gathering and transmission volumes and cash flow for EQT Midstream and EQM.
This increase in Midstream cash flow drives MLP unitholder returns and will help increase the amount of capital available through additional midstream sales of assets from EQT to EQM so-called dropdown.
For the time being we anticipate that most large Midstream investments will be made and EQT level. With most of the EQM capital investments coming in the form of purchases from EQT. We do anticipate that there will be some direct construction of facilities at the EQM level, but we do not want too much of EQM’s capital tied up in investments that are not yet generating cash flow. Therefore the basic model is to build most of the facilities at the EQT level until EQM is larger.
Conceptually, our current construct is that over time EQT’s capital expenditures in the midstream will roughly equal proceeds from sales to EQM. As EQM grows more of the capital expenditures related to midstream construction will be made inside EQM. We believe that this approach will allow us to continue to benefit from a key attribute of the MLP structure in that we retain operational control, so that we can make sure that we have gathering capacity, where and when we need it to achieve our development targets.
Moving on to other operational matters. As we told you on the last call, MarkWest is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. This plant construction is moving along, and we still anticipate completion by year end. This is later than originally anticipated, but the schedule has remained the same since our last quarterly update.
Since that last call, EQT and MarkWest have also developed an interim solution, using some existing and some new assets to provide EQT with some cryogenic processing until the originally contracted facilities are turned in line. This capacity, roughly equivalent to 40 million cubic feet per day or 1/3 of contractual capacity, came online late last week.
As we also mentioned in the last call, our production sales volume targets remain the same even with the current schedule for the full plant that we will obviously not have as high a percentage of natural gas liquids in that full-year total as originally anticipated. Still this interim solution will help us gain back some of the liquids uplift that was considered lost due to the delay.
As you saw in this morning’s press release, we reiterated our production sales volume guidance. New production sales volume is up by 11% over the first quarter and expect it to grow at a similar sequential rate in the third and fourth quarters.
I mentioned in the last call that growth rates versus same quarter prior year can vary due to the inherent lumpiness of how we add volumes. As an example, since the beginning of 2010, our sequential growth rates, probably a better way to capture this particular issue, averaged about 8%. That is an average quarter had volumes about 8% higher than the immediately preceding quarter. However, these sequential growth rates range from just over 3% to nearly 14%. This lumpiness is largely the result of a combination of pad drilling and the timing of infrastructure adds.
Knowing all that, we're right on plan year-to-date and confident that we will hit our targets. To give you a specific example that speaks to this, we are just now bringing online a 10 well pad in Greene County. On average, the wells on this pad will have initial flow rates of about 10 to 12 billion cubic feet per day each. So we expect that this will be our first 100 million per day pad.
Typically turn the wells on such pads in line one at a time and we will be well into August before all 10 wells on this pad are flowing. You can expect that over the next couple of years, we will continue to have periods during which volumes more or less plateau for a period of time and then surge with the turning in line of a multi-well pad or a new infrastructure project.
Moving on to other matters, earlier this month EQT announced the launch of a pilot program to begin converting drilling rigs to LNG, liquefied natural gas, displacing the diesel used to power equipment at the well site. EQT is the first operator in the Marcellus to convert a diesel rig to LNG, which will provide a cleaner burning alternative fuel for the region's drilling operations.
However, we do believe that this is going to quickly become more commonplace throughout the industry, and that will improve the logistics of getting natural gas of the rigs for all of us.
EQTs initial rig conversion is now operating in northern West Virginia and pending evaluation of the pilot program, we hope to convert additional rigs in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The LNG being used for EQT's pilot program is produced from Marcellus natural gas reserves and is about 40% less expensive than diesel. The use of LNG also provides another means of adding to the use of natural gas, and we do expect that there will be circumstances in which we will be able to improve the economics further by using field gas.
We are proud to be a leader in reducing the environmental impacts related to drilling. Along with safety, protection of the environment is top of mind for our employees, contractors, and of course, communities. Compared to diesel, natural gas emits between 20% and 30% less carbon dioxide, and has a fraction of the emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxides and particulates.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash flow from operations and from future monetizations.
We look forward to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate continued support. Pat?"

In just a moment, Phil will summarize EQT’s operational and financial results for the third quarter 2012, which were released this morning. Then Dave will provide an update on our strategic operational matters. Following Dave’s remarks, Dave, Phil, Randy, and Steve will all be available to answer your questions.
But first, as usual, I’d like to remind you that today’s call may contain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements listed in today’s Press Release under Risk Factors in the EQT Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 which was filed with the SEC, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the SEC and available on our website.
Today’s call may also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to this morning’s Press Release for important disclosures regarding such measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.
Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Phil Conti.

269924,145606002,370710,"EQT Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thanks Pat, and good morning, everyone. This morning, EQT announced third quarter 2012 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share. That compares to EPS of $0.45 in third quarter 2011, after the adjusting for the sale of Big Sandy. Operating cash flow was a $176",1091,"Thanks Pat, and good morning, everyone. This morning, EQT announced third quarter 2012 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share. That compares to EPS of $0.45 in third quarter 2011, after the adjusting for the sale of Big Sandy. Operating cash flow was a $176 million in our third quarter of 2012, compared to $191 million for the third quarter of 2011 and adjusted cash flow per share was a $1.18 in the current quarter, compared to a $1.28 in the third quarter last year.
Our operational performance was outstanding again this quarter, with 33% higher production volumes, 30% higher gathering volumes and continued low per unit operating costs. However, as I’m sure, you are aware commodity prices in the recently completed quarter were significantly lower than they were last year, resulting in both lower operating income and cash flow.
This quarter, as Pat mentioned was our third with an MLP. As you know EQT Midstream Partners complete its initial public offering in early July. The EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT results and we recorded a $4.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share deduction in the quarter for the portion that went to non-controlling interest unit holders to arrive at the net income to EQT shareholders.
While there is no gain on the accounting books as a result of the IPO, on the tax books we recognized a gain of approximately $110 million. That gain results in additional cash taxes for 2012 of approximately $13 million as we were able to offset most of the tax obligation with our tax yields from intangible drilling cost deductions and tax depreciation.
Another non-operational variance from the norm this quarter was our effective tax rate of 24%. The lower effective tax rate was due to less income on our companies that pay state taxes, a tax benefit recorded in the third quarter to reflect the 2011 tax return that we recently file and the impact of the EQT Midstream Partners. As we've mentioned, from a financial reporting standpoint, we consolidate 100% of EQM pretax income at EQT. However, we only report taxes on our 60% share. That has the effect of lowering the average effective tax right?
Despite the quarterly rate, we do expect our full year effective tax rate to be around 38.5% after making adjustments at year end to reflect our increasing income contribution from Pennsylvania, which taxes at a higher rate than other states will operate.
Moving on to the segment results starting with EQT production; sales volumes continue to grow rapidly. The growth rate in the recently completed quarter, as we mentioned was 33% over the third quarter of ’11. That growth rate was driven by sales from our Marcellus play, which contributed approximately 60% of the volumes in the quarter.
Marcellus volumes were 85% higher than the same quarter a year ago. However as I mentioned gas prices were lower in the quarter, consistent with lower NYMEX prices. At the corporate level EQT received an average wellhead sales price of $4.04/mcf equivalent, compared to $5.25 received in the same quarter last year. The realized price at EQT production was $2.85/mcf equivalent this quarter, compared to $4.02 last year.
Even with more than 50% of our volumes hedged in 2012, EQT productions average realized price per Mcfe was 41% lower than the third quarter 2011. Produced Liquids accounted for 5% of the volumes in the quarter, and as we always remind you, we do not include ethane in this calculation, given that it's currently primarily sold as methane.
Total operating expenses at EQT production were higher quarter-over-quarter, mainly as a result of higher DD&A expense, which was driven by the 33% higher volumes and a higher DD&A rate in 2012. Our average DD&A rate was $1.54 per unit for the recent quarter and we estimate that it will be up a penny to approximately a $1.55 in the fourth quarter.
As a result of the impressive volume growth in the quarter, I'm looking at the well schedule to come online. As you saw, we are raising our 2012 sales volume estimate to 257 bcf equivalent. Furthermore, even though we are still completing our Development Plan for 2013, we are comfortable that our growth rate off of that revised 2012 estimate would be at least 335 bcf or up 30% or more on an annual basis versus 2011. We will provide an update in December, when we announce our 2013 capital budget.
Moving on to Midstream results in the third quarter, operating incoming here was up 22%, again adjusted for the Big Sandy gain in 2011. The increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity based transmission charges. Net gathering revenues increased 22% to $77 million in the third quarter ‘12, primarily due to a 30% increase in gathered volumes.
The average gathering rate paid by EQT production will continue to decline as Marcellus production continues to grow as a percentage of our total production mix. Specifically, the average revenue deduction paid by EQT production to EQT Midstream for gathering was %0.09 lower this quarter versus the same quarter last year, at $1/mcf equivalent.
Transmission revenues for the third quarter 2012 increased by $8 million or 45% versus 2011 and that results from capacity charges associated Equitrans expansion projects launching project including, Sunrise, which was completed in July 2012. 
Storage, marketing and other net revenues was down $7 million in the third quarter 2012 or $0.04 in earnings per share, primarily from unrealized losses on derivatives and inventory probably in this quarter. As has been mentioned before, the storage and marketing part of the Midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve and those have continued to deteriorate year-over-year.
Given current market conditions, we now estimate that full year 2012 net revenues in storage, marketing and other will total approximately $45 million. Operating expenses at Midstream were $5.6 million higher than the same quarter last year, consistent with the growth in the business.
To conclude, just a quick liquidity update. As a result of the slightly higher volume forecast, we also expect our operating cash flow for 2012 to slightly exceed $800 million. We closed the quarter with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion credit facility and have $639 million of cash on our balance sheet as of September 30th. So we remain in a great position from both a liquidity and a balance sheet standpoint.
And with that I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges.

We continue to focus on achieving our objective, maximizing shareholder value, via an overarching strategy of economically accelerating and a monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities, while living wit",1137,"Thank you, Phil. We continue to focus on achieving our objective, maximizing shareholder value, via an overarching strategy of economically accelerating and a monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities, while living within our means. The tactics continue to evolve somewhat, based upon market conditions and the fact that we are completing some of the tactical steps outlined previously.
We took three major steps, all related to our Midstream business, so far in the past two years with the sale of our only processing plant and our Big Sandy Pipeline in 2011, and our successful IPO of EQT Midstream partners mid-year 2012. We still have more work to do as we look forward to accelerating the development of our vast opportunity set.
We have two plays that we are not currently developing. Our CBM acreage representing about 250 Bcf of proved developed reserves but not much additional 3P value at current market prices and our huge Huron Play with one Tcfe of proved developed reserves and 7.7 Tcfe of 3P reserves. We will look to realize value from these two plays, but probably in different ways. It is most likely that we will eventually sell the CBM play outright since there is not much value in the undeveloped locations at anything close to current prices. To that end we did do some work to determine what potential buyers might be willing to pay for those assets.
For the time being the transaction market value is not high enough to want further pursuit of a cash transaction. We will revisit this issue as natural gas prices recover, thereby increasing the value of the PDPs. The Huron on the other hand has significant value in the undeveloped locations at the current strip. So we are more likely to try to find a way to capture some of that value by accessing another source of capital, through not EQT equity to reactive that play. Obviously this will require some imagination and may take a while but we’re in the early stages of examining the alternatives that generally involve EQT continuing as operator but using third party capital for development as EQT has developed some competencies in developing this somewhat distinctive play.
Unfortunately even though Huron development is economical at the current strip, it does not compete well with our alternative uses of capital, which is why we believe it makes sense to examine possible transactions. Regarding the main such alternative use of our capital, we continue to manage our Marcellus acreage position to allow for as much multi well pad development as possible as this is both the most economical and most environmentally sensitive approach.
In circumstances in which this approach is not practical, we are either looking a joint development or tactical sales of properties. To that end we are looking at the possibility of selling or swapping our 8600 acres in Tioga County, since it is neither large enough, nor close enough to our core development areas to rank very high in our investment priority list. Another source of relatively low-cost capital is EQT Midstream Partners, our MLP. Sale of Midstream assets to EQM, that is dropdowns offers a repeatable source of low-cost capital. This funding source help EQT accelerate development of our Marcellus position, which in turn will create new Midstream opportunities that add to the inventory of droppable Midstream assets.
As you recall conceptually overtime, we intend to fund EQT’s Midstream CapEx with the sales to EQM. As for specific timing, it is unlikely that we will executive a large drop that would require the issuance of new units, prior to July 2, 2013 when EQM would be considered a seasoned issuer which simplifies EQM’s process for raising equity capital, though what is possible that we would execute a small drop before then to give us a little experience with the process of valuing and accounting for a dropdown. We are currently working through the mechanics of dropdowns involving various Midstream assets.
Moving onto other operational matters, as we told you on the last call, MarkWest is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. Construction of this plant is still moving along according to the revised schedule and we still anticipate completion by year end. As you recall, this revised schedule calls for later completion than originally anticipated, but here have been no further revisions to the schedule since all last quarterly update.
As mentioned on the last call, EQT and MarkWest have also developed an interim solution using some existing and some new assets to provide EQT with some cryogenic processing until the originally contracted facilities are turned in line. This capacity, roughly equivalent to 35 million cubic feet per day, are a third of contractual capacity and the new plant was online for most of the third quarter. However, since this was all interruptible, we currently only have about 25-30 MMcfd of capacity. We have also committed to take 100 million cubic feet equivalent of incremental processing capacity on a planned expansion of this facility. So this represents incremental processing above and beyond the 120 MMcfe that we have in the first plant.
We are still working with MarkWest on the timing of this incremental volume. As you saw in this morning’s Press Release, we increased our production sales volume guidance. I mentioned in the last call, growth rates versus same quarter prior year can vary due to the inherent lumpiness of how we add volumes. This lumpiness is largely the result of a combination of pad drilling and the timing of infrastructure adds.
Last quarter we discussed a 10 well pad in Greene County that was being turned in line in July. As we expected we saw initial flow rates of a 100 million per day from this pad. Additionally, we have two pads with a combined total of 13 wells that are being turned in line currently and three more pads for a combined total of 15 wells that will begin being turned in line next year (ph). This is what gives us confidence to increase volume guidance for 2012 and to set that preliminary 2013 volume growth target of 30% versus that upwardly revised 2012 target.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash from operations and from future monetization. We look forward continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.
And with that I’ll turn the call back over to Pat Kane.

That does mean to your specific question about the Sunrise expansion and incidentally, this wouldn’t just be Sunrise. This will apply to any number of candidates for sales from EQT to EQM. To what extent if there is further investments to be made, do we make the investments at EQT and sell into EQM at probably a lower multiple on a higher cash flow, versus selling in before making the investment at a higher multiple off a lower cash flow and I think it's fair to say that that is going to be done on a case-by-case basis, there's no interest at the EQT level in selling assets to EQM on the cheap and we also don’t think that it's in the long term best interest of EQT, given our position at EQM to somehow try to get an overly inflated price either. So it will be a balance and it will be a tradeoff, and it's going to be particularly difficult as you’ve pointed to find that when there's expansion opportunities.

But as far as that goes I’m not sure that I had commented on any specific vehicle that we might use other than, it would be better if we thought that it gave us access to capital over a longer period of time as opposed to a capital that could only support the development for a short period of time.

So in that regard I wouldn’t say that the thought process has really changed versus the thought process that went into 2012 numbers, the 2011 numbers. Where it comes out specifically as far as the numbers is really where it’s hard to go to, but I don’t see that there is a particular need, given the capital we’ve already raised that you should be assuming that we would only be able to spend based on operating cash flow in 2013, because we’ve already been raising money from other sources.

This morning, EQT announced third quarter 2012 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share. That compares to EPS of $0.45 in the third quarter 2011, after the adjusting for the sale of Big Sandy. Operating cash flow was a $",1098,"Thanks Pat, and good morning, everyone. This morning, EQT announced third quarter 2012 earnings of $0.21 per diluted share. That compares to EPS of $0.45 in the third quarter 2011, after the adjusting for the sale of Big Sandy. Operating cash flow was a $176 million in our third quarter of 2012, compared to $191 million for the third quarter of 2011. And adjusted cash flow per share was a $1.18 in the current quarter, compared to a $1.28 in the third quarter of last year.
Our operational performance was outstanding again this quarter, with 33% higher production volumes, 30% higher gathering volumes and continued low per unit operating costs. However, as I’m sure you are aware, commodity prices in the recently completed quarter were significantly lower than they were last year, resulting in both lower operating income and cash flow.
This quarter, as Pat mentioned, was our third with an MLP. As you know EQT Midstream Partners complete its initial public offering in early July. The EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT results and we recorded a $4.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share deduction in the quarter for the portion that went to non-controlling interest unit holders to arrive at the net income to EQT shareholders.
While there is no gain on the accounting books as a result of the IPO, on the tax books we recognized a gain of approximately $110 million. That gain results in additional cash taxes for 2012 of approximately $13 million, as we were able to offset most of the tax obligation with our tax yields from intangible drilling cost deductions and tax depreciation.
Another non-operational variance from the norm this quarter was our effective tax rate of 24%. The lower effective tax rate was due to less income on our companies that pay state taxes, a tax benefit recorded in the third quarter to reflect the 2011 tax return that we recently filed and the impact of the EQT Midstream Partners. As we've mentioned, from a financial reporting standpoint, we consolidate 100% of EQM pretax income at EQT. However, we only report taxes on our 60% share. That has the effect of lowering the average effective tax rate.
Despite the quarterly rate, we do expect our full year effective tax rate to be around 38.5% after making adjustments at year end to reflect our increasing income contribution from Pennsylvania, which taxes at a higher rate than other states will operate.
Moving on to the segment results, starting with EQT production. Sales volumes continue to grow rapidly. The growth rate in the recently completed quarter, as we mentioned, was 33% over the third quarter of ’11. That growth rate was driven by sales from our Marcellus play, which contributed approximately 60% of the volumes in the quarter.
Marcellus volumes were 85% higher than the same quarter a year ago. However, as I mentioned, gas prices were lower in the quarter, consistent with lower NYMEX prices. At the corporate level EQT, received an average wellhead sales price of $4.04 per mcf equivalent, compared to $5.25 received in the same quarter last year. The realized price at EQT production was $2.85 per mcf equivalent this quarter, compared to $4.02 last year.
Even with more than 50% of our volumes hedged in 2012, EQT productions average realized price per Mcfe was 41% lower than the third quarter 2011. Produced Liquids accounted for 5% of the volumes in the quarter, and as we always remind you, we do not include ethane in this calculation, given that it's currently primarily sold as methane.
Total operating expenses at EQT production were higher quarter-over-quarter, mainly as a result of higher DD&A expense, which was driven by the 33% higher volumes and a higher DD&A rate in 2012. Our average DD&A rate was $1.54 per unit for the recent quarter and we estimate that it will be up a penny to approximately a $1.55 in the fourth quarter.
As a result of the impressive volume growth in the quarter, I'm looking at the well schedule to come online. As you saw, we are raising our 2012 sales volume estimate to 257 bcf equivalent. Furthermore, even though we are still completing our Development Plan for 2013, we are comfortable that our growth rate off of that revised 2012 estimate would be at least 335 bcf, or up 30% or more on an annual basis versus 2011. We will provide an update in December, when we announce our 2013 capital budget.
Moving on to Midstream results in the third quarter, operating incoming here was up 22%, again adjusted for the Big Sandy gain in 2011. The increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity based transmission charges. Net gathering revenues increased 22% to $77 million in the third quarter ‘12, primarily due to a 30% increase in gathered volumes.
The average gathering rate paid by EQT production will continue to decline as Marcellus production continues to grow as a percentage of our total production mix. Specifically, the average revenue deduction paid by EQT production to EQT Midstream for gathering was %0.09 lower this quarter versus the same quarter last year, at $1 per mcf equivalent.
Transmission revenues for the third quarter 2012 increased by $8 million or 45% versus 2011, and that results from capacity charges associated Equitrans expansion projects launching project including, Sunrise, which was completed in July 2012.
Storage, marketing and other net revenues was down $7 million in the third quarter 2012 or $0.04 in earnings per share, primarily from unrealized losses on derivatives and inventory in this quarter. As has been mentioned before, the storage and marketing part of the Midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve, and those have continued to deteriorate year-over-year.
Given current market conditions, we now estimate that full year 2012 net revenues in storage, marketing and other will total approximately $45 million. Operating expenses at Midstream were $5.6 million higher than the same quarter last year, consistent with the growth in the business.
To conclude, just a quick liquidity update. As a result of the slightly higher volume forecast, we also expect our operating cash flow for 2012 to slightly exceed $800 million. We closed the quarter with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion credit facility and have $639 million of cash on our balance sheet as of September 30th. So we remain in a great position from both a liquidity and a balance sheet standpoint.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges."

We continue to focus on achieving our objective, maximizing shareholder value, via an overarching strategy of economically accelerating and a monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities, while living wit",1136,"Thank you, Phil. We continue to focus on achieving our objective, maximizing shareholder value, via an overarching strategy of economically accelerating and a monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities, while living within our means. The tactics continue to evolve somewhat based upon market conditions and the fact that we are completing some of the tactical steps outlined previously.
We took 3 major steps, all related to our Midstream business, so far in the past 2 years, with the sale of our only processing plant and our Big Sandy Pipeline in 2011, and our successful IPO of EQT Midstream partners mid-year 2012. We still have more work to do as we look forward to accelerating the development of our vast opportunity set.
We have 2 plays that we are not currently developing. Our CBM acreage, representing about 250 Bcf of proved developed reserves but not much additional 3P value at current market prices, and our huge Huron Play, with one Tcfe of proved developed reserves and 7.7 Tcfe of 3P reserves. We will look to realize value from these 2 plays, but probably in different ways. It is most likely that we will eventually sell the CBM play outright since there is not much value in the undeveloped locations at anything close to current prices. To that end, we did do some work to determine what potential buyers might be willing to pay for those assets.
For the time being the transaction market value is not high enough to want further pursuit of a cash transaction. We will revisit this issue as natural gas prices recover, thereby increasing the value of the PDPs. The Huron, on the other hand, has significant value in the undeveloped locations at the current strip. So we are more likely to try to find a way to capture some of that value by accessing another source of capital, though not EQT equity, to reactive that play. Obviously this will require some imagination and may take a while but we’re in the early stages of examining the alternatives that generally involve EQT continuing as operator but using third party capital for development as EQT has developed some competencies in developing this somewhat distinctive play.
Unfortunately, even though Huron development is economical at the current strip, it does not compete well with our alternative uses of capital, which is why we believe it makes sense to examine possible transactions. Regarding the main such alternative use of our capital, we continue to manage our Marcellus acreage position to allow for as much multi-well pad development as possible, as this is both the most economical and most environmentally sensitive approach.
In circumstances in which this approach is not practical, we are either looking a joint development or tactical sales of properties. To that end, we are looking at the possibility of selling or swapping our 8600 acres in Tioga County, since it is neither large enough nor close enough to our core development areas to rank very high in our investment priority list. Another source of relatively low-cost capital is EQT Midstream Partners, our MLP. Sale of Midstream assets to EQM, that is dropdowns, offers a repeatable source of low-cost capital. This funding source help EQT accelerate development of our Marcellus position, which in turn will create new Midstream opportunities that add to the inventory of droppable Midstream assets.
As you recall, conceptually overtime, we intend to fund EQT’s Midstream CapEx with the sales to EQM. As for specific timing, it is unlikely that we will executive a large drop that would require the issuance of new units, prior to July 2, 2013, when EQM would be considered a seasoned issuer, which simplifies EQM’s process for raising equity capital, though it is possible that we would execute a small drop before then to give us a little experience with the process of valuing and accounting for a dropdown. We are currently working through the mechanics of dropdowns involving various Midstream assets.
Moving on to other operational matters, as we told you on the last call, MarkWest is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. Construction of this plant is still moving along according to the revised schedule and we still anticipate completion by year end. As you recall, this revised schedule calls for later completion than originally anticipated, but here have been no further revisions to the schedule since our last quarterly update.
As mentioned on the last call, EQT and MarkWest have also developed an interim solution using some existing and some new assets to provide EQT with some cryogenic processing until the originally contracted facilities are turned in line. This capacity, roughly equivalent to 35 million cubic feet per day, or 1/3 of contractual capacity on the new plant, was online for most of the third quarter. However, since this was all interruptible, we currently only have about 25-30 MMcfd of capacity. We have also committed to take 100 million cubic feet equivalent of incremental processing capacity on a planned expansion of this facility. So this represents incremental processing above and beyond the 120 MMcfe that we have in the first plant.
We are still working with MarkWest on the timing of this incremental volume. As you saw in this morning’s Press Release, we increased our production sales volume guidance. I mentioned in the last call, growth rates versus same quarter prior year can vary due to the inherent lumpiness of how we add volumes. This lumpiness is largely the result of a combination of pad drilling and the timing of infrastructure adds.
Last quarter we discussed a 10 well pad in Greene County that was being turned in line in July. As we expected we saw initial flow rates of a 100 million per day from this pad. Additionally, we have 2 pads with a combined total of 13 wells that are being turned in line currently, and 3 more pads for a combined total of 15 wells that will begin being turned in line next month. This is what gives us confidence to increase volume guidance for 2012 and to set that preliminary 2013 volume growth target of 30% versus that upwardly revised 2012 target.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash from operations and from future monetization. We look forward  to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.
And with that I’ll turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

That does mean, to your specific question about the Sunrise expansion, and incidentally, this wouldn’t just be Sunrise. This will apply to any number of candidates for sales from EQT to EQM. To what extent if there is further investments to be made, do we make the investments at EQT and sell into EQM at probably a lower multiple on a higher cash flow, versus selling in before making the investment at a higher multiple off a lower cash flow, and I think it's fair to say that, that is going to be done on a case-by-case basis.

That compares to EPS of $0.45 in the third quarter 2011, after the adjusting for the sale of Big Sandy. Operating cash flow was a $176 million in our third quarter of 2012, compared to $191 million for the third quarter of 2011. And adjusted cash flow per share was a $1.18 in the current quarter, compared to a $1.28 in the third quarter of last year.
Our operational performance was outstanding again this quarter, with 33% higher production volumes, 30% higher gathering volumes and continued low per unit operating costs. However, as I’m sure you are aware, commodity prices in the recently completed quarter were significantly lower than they were last year, resulting in both lower operating income and cash flow.
This quarter, as Pat mentioned, was our third with an MLP. As you know EQT Midstream Partners complete its initial public offering in early July. The EQT Midstream Partners results are consolidated in EQT results and we recorded a $4.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share deduction in the quarter for the portion that went to non-controlling interest unit holders to arrive at the net income to EQT shareholders.
While there is no gain on the accounting books as a result of the IPO, on the tax books we recognized a gain of approximately $110 million. That gain results in additional cash taxes for 2012 of approximately $13 million, as we were able to offset most of the tax obligation with our tax yields from intangible drilling cost deductions and tax depreciation.
Another non-operational variance from the norm this quarter was our effective tax rate of 24%. The lower effective tax rate was due to less income on our companies that pay state taxes, a tax benefit recorded in the third quarter to reflect the 2011 tax return that we recently filed and the impact of the EQT Midstream Partners. As we've mentioned, from a financial reporting standpoint, we consolidate 100% of EQM pretax income at EQT. However, we only report taxes on our 60% share. That has the effect of lowering the average effective tax rate.
Despite the quarterly rate, we do expect our full year effective tax rate to be around 38.5% after making adjustments at year end to reflect our increasing income contribution from Pennsylvania, which taxes at a higher rate than other states will operate.
Moving on to the segment results, starting with EQT production. Sales volumes continue to grow rapidly. The growth rate in the recently completed quarter, as we mentioned, was 33% over the third quarter of ’11. That growth rate was driven by sales from our Marcellus play, which contributed approximately 60% of the volumes in the quarter.
Marcellus volumes were 85% higher than the same quarter a year ago. However, as I mentioned, gas prices were lower in the quarter, consistent with lower NYMEX prices. At the corporate level EQT, received an average wellhead sales price of $4.04 per mcf equivalent, compared to $5.25 received in the same quarter last year. The realized price at EQT production was $2.85 per mcf equivalent this quarter, compared to $4.02 last year.
Even with more than 50% of our volumes hedged in 2012, EQT productions average realized price per Mcfe was 41% lower than the third quarter 2011. Produced Liquids accounted for 5% of the volumes in the quarter, and as we always remind you, we do not include ethane in this calculation, given that it's currently primarily sold as methane.
Total operating expenses at EQT production were higher quarter-over-quarter, mainly as a result of higher DD&A expense, which was driven by the 33% higher volumes and a higher DD&A rate in 2012. Our average DD&A rate was $1.54 per unit for the recent quarter and we estimate that it will be up a penny to approximately a $1.55 in the fourth quarter.
As a result of the impressive volume growth in the quarter, I'm looking at the well schedule to come online. As you saw, we are raising our 2012 sales volume estimate to 257 bcf equivalent. Furthermore, even though we are still completing our Development Plan for 2013, we are comfortable that our growth rate off of that revised 2012 estimate would be at least 335 bcf, or up 30% or more on an annual basis versus 2011. We will provide an update in December, when we announce our 2013 capital budget.
Moving on to Midstream results in the third quarter, operating incoming here was up 22%, again adjusted for the Big Sandy gain in 2011. The increase is consistent with the growth of gathered volumes and increased capacity based transmission charges. Net gathering revenues increased 22% to $77 million in the third quarter ‘12, primarily due to a 30% increase in gathered volumes.
The average gathering rate paid by EQT production will continue to decline as Marcellus production continues to grow as a percentage of our total production mix. Specifically, the average revenue deduction paid by EQT production to EQT Midstream for gathering was %0.09 lower this quarter versus the same quarter last year, at $1 per mcf equivalent.
Transmission revenues for the third quarter 2012 increased by $8 million or 45% versus 2011, and that results from capacity charges associated Equitrans expansion projects launching project including, Sunrise, which was completed in July 2012.
Storage, marketing and other net revenues was down $7 million in the third quarter 2012 or $0.04 in earnings per share, primarily from unrealized losses on derivatives and inventory in this quarter. As has been mentioned before, the storage and marketing part of the Midstream business relies on natural gas price volatility and seasonal spreads in the forward curve, and those have continued to deteriorate year-over-year.
Given current market conditions, we now estimate that full year 2012 net revenues in storage, marketing and other will total approximately $45 million. Operating expenses at Midstream were $5.6 million higher than the same quarter last year, consistent with the growth in the business.
To conclude, just a quick liquidity update. As a result of the slightly higher volume forecast, we also expect our operating cash flow for 2012 to slightly exceed $800 million. We closed the quarter with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion credit facility and have $639 million of cash on our balance sheet as of September 30th. So we remain in a great position from both a liquidity and a balance sheet standpoint.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Porges."
269924,145606002,370833,"EQT Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","EQT Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phil. We continue to focus on achieving our objective, maximizing shareholder value, via an overarching strategy of economically accelerating and a monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities, while living wit",1136,"Thank you, Phil. We continue to focus on achieving our objective, maximizing shareholder value, via an overarching strategy of economically accelerating and a monetization of our asset base and prudent pursuit of investment opportunities, while living within our means. The tactics continue to evolve somewhat based upon market conditions and the fact that we are completing some of the tactical steps outlined previously.
We took 3 major steps, all related to our Midstream business, so far in the past 2 years, with the sale of our only processing plant and our Big Sandy Pipeline in 2011, and our successful IPO of EQT Midstream partners mid-year 2012. We still have more work to do as we look forward to accelerating the development of our vast opportunity set.
We have 2 plays that we are not currently developing. Our CBM acreage, representing about 250 Bcf of proved developed reserves but not much additional 3P value at current market prices, and our huge Huron Play, with one Tcfe of proved developed reserves and 7.7 Tcfe of 3P reserves. We will look to realize value from these 2 plays, but probably in different ways. It is most likely that we will eventually sell the CBM play outright since there is not much value in the undeveloped locations at anything close to current prices. To that end, we did do some work to determine what potential buyers might be willing to pay for those assets.
For the time being the transaction market value is not high enough to want further pursuit of a cash transaction. We will revisit this issue as natural gas prices recover, thereby increasing the value of the PDPs. The Huron, on the other hand, has significant value in the undeveloped locations at the current strip. So we are more likely to try to find a way to capture some of that value by accessing another source of capital, though not EQT equity, to reactive that play. Obviously this will require some imagination and may take a while but we’re in the early stages of examining the alternatives that generally involve EQT continuing as operator but using third party capital for development as EQT has developed some competencies in developing this somewhat distinctive play.
Unfortunately, even though Huron development is economical at the current strip, it does not compete well with our alternative uses of capital, which is why we believe it makes sense to examine possible transactions. Regarding the main such alternative use of our capital, we continue to manage our Marcellus acreage position to allow for as much multi-well pad development as possible, as this is both the most economical and most environmentally sensitive approach.
In circumstances in which this approach is not practical, we are either looking a joint development or tactical sales of properties. To that end, we are looking at the possibility of selling or swapping our 8600 acres in Tioga County, since it is neither large enough nor close enough to our core development areas to rank very high in our investment priority list. Another source of relatively low-cost capital is EQT Midstream Partners, our MLP. Sale of Midstream assets to EQM, that is dropdowns, offers a repeatable source of low-cost capital. This funding source help EQT accelerate development of our Marcellus position, which in turn will create new Midstream opportunities that add to the inventory of droppable Midstream assets.
As you recall, conceptually overtime, we intend to fund EQT’s Midstream CapEx with the sales to EQM. As for specific timing, it is unlikely that we will executive a large drop that would require the issuance of new units, prior to July 2, 2013, when EQM would be considered a seasoned issuer, which simplifies EQM’s process for raising equity capital, though it is possible that we would execute a small drop before then to give us a little experience with the process of valuing and accounting for a dropdown. We are currently working through the mechanics of dropdowns involving various Midstream assets.
Moving on to other operational matters, as we told you on the last call, MarkWest is building a processing plant to serve our West Virginia wells. Construction of this plant is still moving along according to the revised schedule and we still anticipate completion by year end. As you recall, this revised schedule calls for later completion than originally anticipated, but here have been no further revisions to the schedule since our last quarterly update.
As mentioned on the last call, EQT and MarkWest have also developed an interim solution using some existing and some new assets to provide EQT with some cryogenic processing until the originally contracted facilities are turned in line. This capacity, roughly equivalent to 35 million cubic feet per day, or 1/3 of contractual capacity on the new plant, was online for most of the third quarter. However, since this was all interruptible, we currently only have about 25-30 MMcfd of capacity. We have also committed to take 100 million cubic feet equivalent of incremental processing capacity on a planned expansion of this facility. So this represents incremental processing above and beyond the 120 MMcfe that we have in the first plant.
We are still working with MarkWest on the timing of this incremental volume. As you saw in this morning’s Press Release, we increased our production sales volume guidance. I mentioned in the last call, growth rates versus same quarter prior year can vary due to the inherent lumpiness of how we add volumes. This lumpiness is largely the result of a combination of pad drilling and the timing of infrastructure adds.
Last quarter we discussed a 10 well pad in Greene County that was being turned in line in July. As we expected we saw initial flow rates of a 100 million per day from this pad. Additionally, we have 2 pads with a combined total of 13 wells that are being turned in line currently, and 3 more pads for a combined total of 15 wells that will begin being turned in line next month. This is what gives us confidence to increase volume guidance for 2012 and to set that preliminary 2013 volume growth target of 30% versus that upwardly revised 2012 target.
In summary, EQT is committed to increasing the value of our vast resource by accelerating the monetization of our reserves and other opportunities. We continue to be focused on earning the highest possible returns from our investments and are doing what we should to increase the value of your shares. We will stay disciplined and live within our means, investing our available cash from operations and from future monetization. We look forward  to continuing to execute on our commitment to our shareholders and appreciate your continued support.
And with that I’ll turn the call back over to Pat Kane."

That does mean, to your specific question about the Sunrise expansion, and incidentally, this wouldn’t just be Sunrise. This will apply to any number of candidates for sales from EQT to EQM. To what extent if there is further investments to be made, do we make the investments at EQT and sell into EQM at probably a lower multiple on a higher cash flow, versus selling in before making the investment at a higher multiple off a lower cash flow, and I think it's fair to say that, that is going to be done on a case-by-case basis. There’s no interest at the EQT level in selling assets to EQM on the cheap and we also don’t think that it's in the long- term best interest of EQT, given our position at EQM, to somehow try to get an overly inflated price either.

It’s because the Board hasn’t approved a budget yet. But the construct is that we would like to routinely, and this is part of the idea with EQM, is we would like to be able to continue to routinely invest, I don’t know, $300 million, $400 million, something like that or so more than what our internally generated cash flow would allow, but that’s just because we think that, that’s what optimal over time from a perspective of monetizing our asset and opportunities sets.
So in that regard I wouldn’t say that the thought process has really changed versus the thought process that went into 2012 numbers, the 2011 numbers. Where it comes out specifically as far as the numbers is really where it’s hard to go to, but I don’t see that there is a particular need, given the cash capital we’ve already raised, that you should be assuming that we would only be able to spend based on operating cash flow in 2013, because we’ve already been raising money from other sources. So how much do we have on the balance sheet now, as far as cash?"

And from my perspective, I certainly hope this is the way people at the company look at it.
It’s just an ongoing process. That’s not just a 2012 or 2013 process. We are going to be doing that for some period of time. We are going to be looking at which assets would be best. We know we are going to make the money by selling -- monetizing molecules. And to the extent that we are selling them, one molecule at a time versus in bunches, is really what we have to decide. And I think that’s the issue that we’re going to be facing strategically for a period of time, for a more than a couple of years probably."
