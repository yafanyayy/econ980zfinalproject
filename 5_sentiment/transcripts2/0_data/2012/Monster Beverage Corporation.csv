Based on Nielsen data for the convenience and gas channel, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, sales of Rehab are now more than double the sales of the main competitive noncarbonated energy drink. 
During the fourth quarter, we launched 3 line extensions through our successful Monster Rehab energy drink, namely Rojo Tea + Energy, Green Tea + Energy and ProTEAn + Energy. We are in the process of launching a further line extension in the Monster Rehab line namely Tea + Orangeades + Energy and also proceeding with our planned launch of Uber Monster Energy drinks in glass bottles during the first half 2012.

Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 31.1% to $389.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, from $297.5 million in the same period in 2010. And contribution margin increased 24.9% from $103.7 million to $129.6 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 5.1% to $20.1 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $21.2 million for the same period in 2010. However, the company achieved a positive contribution of approximately $750,000 in the 3 months ended December 31, 2011 for the Warehouse segment as compared to a negative contribution of almost $1 million in the comparable period in 2010. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 32.6% to $1,608,000,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, from $1,212,600,000 in the same period in 2010 and contribution margin increased 24.4% from $436.7 million to $543.2 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 4% to $94.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 compared with $91.3 million for the same period in 2010. And the Warehouse segment achieved a positive contribution margin of $4.3 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared to a negative contribution of almost $0.8 million in 2010.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 6% in 2010. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 12% in 2010. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in 2010. And gross sales internationally increased to 20% from 16% in the same period in 2010. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in 2010.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2011 amounted to $88.9 million compared to $66.4 million in the same quarter in 2010, and $116.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $381 million compared to $240.6 million in 2010. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to their customers overseas. 
Sales continued to progress well in Europe. Gross sales in EMEA, which is Europe, Middle East and South Africa were 46.1% higher in the fourth quarter than in the comparable period in 2010. And for the full year, gross sales in Europe were 87.5% higher than in 2010. Sales in Western Europe and in the United Kingdom, in particular, grew faster than in Central and Eastern Europe. And Western Europe is now operating profitably.
In South Africa, we made a change to our distribution partner and in the last quarter of 2011, sales improved substantially. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launch Monster Energy in Poland in February and are planning new additional launches in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in the first half of 2012. We are also planning additional launches in Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa, South America and Asia during the remainder of 2012. Both gross and net sales for the comparable 12-month period ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by blant purchases made in customers 2009 fourth quarter. If the sales attributable to the 2009 fourth quarter were being included in the 2010 first quarter in which the company previously estimated 4% to 6% of the 2009 fourth quarter growth sales, such sales would have the effect of increasing the sales achieved in the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 by approximately 1%. The buying had no effect on 2011 sales in which we are now reporting.
Sales of Peace Tea Iced Tea continue to meet our expectations. In 2011, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 37.1% over 2010. We're in the process of launching 3 new line extensions, namely Cranberry Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Tree Tea, which will replace the Celon Tea Unsweetened Tea and Green Tea variants -- Stock Green Tea variants -- sorry. 
We are continuing to build distribution for Worx Energy. In 2012, we intend to bring our advertising expenditure for Worx Energy into line with Worx sales levels. We plan to introduce an additional Extra Strength version later 2012. Gross profit margins achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 52.3% versus 51.6% in the comparable quarter in 2010. The increase in our overall growth margin percentage was largely due to a higher proportion of sales in the DSD segment of products in North America, which have a higher gross profit margin, increased sales of DSD products is compared to Warehouse products, product mix, which is partially offset by international sales where we achieved lower cost margins of that in North America and to a lesser extent to lower promotional allowances. We have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012, as well as a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar. 
In the light of the volatility of both commodities in world markets, we anticipate some increase in raw material costs in 2012. We do not believe that the current levels, raw material cost increases will have a material negative effect on our margins. 
Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter was a slightly higher than the same period in 2010. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.5% from 12.2% in the same period in 2010. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increases in commissions and royalty payments, premiums, advertising and sponsorship and endorsement costs in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter in 2010. The increased cost for sampling teams, as well as trade development personnel, particularly in Europe also contributed to the increase in selling expenses. We are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, Australia and South America. 
Such trade development programs supplement our distribution partners respective sales forces to service and merchandise small independent stores. We believe that such activities play an important role in the establishment and development of our brand overseas. The cost of products sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. 
General and administrative costs, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative cost was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses, and in particular, increased cost of stock-based compensation. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9% from 11.5% in 2010. Sponsorship and endorsement costs were approximately $30.6 million higher than in 2010 but were lower as a percentage of net sales. Selling expenses for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 was also higher than in 2010, primarily due to increased expenditures for advertising, which was largely for the Worx Energy Shots, trade development costs, commissions and royalties, premiums and merchandise displays, which was mainly coolers. 
In 2011, cost of goods as well as selling, general and administrative expenses in Western Europe were lower on a per case basis in local currencies than in 2010. In 2011, we invested extensively in Central and Eastern Europe and, more particularly, in newer markets in that region. Selling, general and administrative expenses in that region were higher on a per case basis in local currency in part due to lower case sales than planned. We are holding discussions with our distributor in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chain between us. We believe that such discussions combined with reduced operating costs per case will enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012 in Central and Eastern Europe.
We incurred higher promotional and marketing costs on a per case basis in Australia in 2011 implementing our strategy to increase market share, which was achieved. We are working with our distributor in Australia to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and have also taken steps to reduce our cost of goods and overall operating cost in Australia. We believe that these measures will enable us to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and South America. These operating losses negatively affected our reported income for the 2011 year and obviously, should be a bore in mind in our evaluating results. 
Our effective tax rate in the 2011 fourth quarter was 38.3% compared to 38.7% in the 2010 fourth quarter. The decrease in the 2011 fourth quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate, which was partially offset by an increase in the reserve for certain uncertain tax benefits. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, was 37.4% compared to 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in effective tax rate for the year was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate this year and establishment in 2010 of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary.
The decrease in the annual effective tax rate was also partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain uncertain tax benefits. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $359.3 million compared to $354.8 million at December 31, 2010. Short-term investments were $411.3 million compared to $244.6 million at December 31, 2010. Long-term investments decreased from $44.2 million at December 31, 2010 to $23.2 million. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $35.9 million. Trade accounts receivables are now presented on a gross basis as our promotional allowances to those customers the company does not allow net settlement such as our full-service distributors. We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances out to those customers that the company allows in its settlement on a net basis. This such basis, trade accounts receivable increased to $218.1 million from $166 million at December 31, 2010. Days outstanding for receivables consistent with the above treatment were 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 41.3 days at December 31, 2010. If trade accounts receivable had been presented on a net basis, days outstanding would have been 26.2 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 27.7 days at December 31, 2010.
In the future, the company would only reported days outstanding for receivables calculated on the basis consistent with the above new treatment. As sales outside the United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. Inventories increased to $155.6 million from $153.2 million at December 31, 2010. Average days of inventory was 72 days at December 31, 2011, which is lower than the 89 days of inventory at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $44.8 million originally it was $79.6 million at December 31, 2010, with unamortized cost bases of $35.9 million. During the 2011 fourth quarter, the company purchase approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $39.78 per share, pursuant to the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors in the March 2010. These purchases exhausted the availability under the 2/10 share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter the Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase plan for the repurchase about 250 million out of the company's shares no shares have a been purchase as yet under this authorization.
Gross sales in January 2012 were approximately 34% higher than in January 2011. We are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company. We caution again that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days of the week in which holidays fall at the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

And in the convenience and gas, basically in the convenience and gas channel, you take our leading green product, which is main product ourselves that were 180,the retail falls $118 million for the 13 weeks ending January 21, Rehab it, growing up to about $23.5 million.

We think that we are looking at making, relooking at the Italian market, there's lot of opportunities I think underrepresented in the Italian market. We have opportunities some markets are starting to grow nice to be. We think we have a lot of growth in markets like Spain, Germany and the U.K. where the brand is doing very, very nicely in France, for those matter those are pretty big markets. in central and Eastern Europe, we are looking at some additional markets, which are quite large. Poland is probably the second largest market in Central and Eastern Europe. And in fact if you exclude Russia, it's the largest market but certainly just after Russia and that is a very big market relation to some are smaller markets that we have going into. Hungary was a nice markets about the posted tax on energy drinks and anything with sugar. And that really has completely disrupted that market. So that is part of the challenges we had this year and and the fall off in the fourth quarter was the attributable to sales in that area was the attributable to that issue. But the check market is doing very nicely. So there are markets that are doing very nicely and we'll continue to grow. We think that we do have some expansion there. The Asian market, we are looking at some pretty nice sized market in Korea and Japan. There are a couple of smaller ones that I indicated, which will be our smaller markets. We are continuing to expand, we believe, that we have a lot of upside and the Brazilian market, particularly in the other markets in South America where we are we're pretty far advanced in having our products prove through their meeting the regulatory requirements and in having planning launch. We've reduced trade in Colombia very nicely and we are looking at Peru, Ecuador, Chile and Argentina. So we believe those will also come on stream in the foreseeable future. And those and each of these markets just basically have their own maturity as you get to a certain size in the market, you are able to actually profitably support the infrastructure we need in each market. The way we do business going into markets with a lot of support for sampling and for those sort of local marketing activities and so once we get over the initial comp, the market start becoming more profitable quite quickly and you know with adjust base in central and Eastern European end market we're hopeful that we will continue to get better results in those countries this year."

Java Monster was 17% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 21.3%. Java Monster sales and market share continues to show improvement and Java Monster is still the market leader in this space. 
We are pleased to report that sales of our new noncarbonated Monster Rehab Tea plus lemonade energy drink with electrolytes, which we launched in the first quarter of 2011 continues to accelerate, and this SKU continues to be one of our top-selling Monster products. Based on Nielsen data for the convenience and gas channel, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, sales of Rehab are now more than double the sales of the main competitive noncarbonated energy drink.
During the fourth quarter, we launched 3 line extensions through our successful Monster Rehab energy drink, namely Rojo Tea + Energy, Green Tea + Energy and ProTEAn + Energy. We're in the process of launching a further line extension in the Monster Rehab line namely Tea + Orangeades + Energy and also proceeding with our planned launch of Über Monster Energy drinks in glass bottles during the first half of 2012.
Monster is performing well in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended January 14, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%.

Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 31.1% to $389.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, from $297.5 million in the same period in 2010. And contribution margin increased 24.9% from $103.7 million to $129.6 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 5.1% to $20.1 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $21.2 million for the same period in 2010. However, the company achieved a positive contribution of approximately $750,000 in the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, for the Warehouse segment, as compared to a negative contribution of almost $1 million in the comparable period in 2010. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 32.6% to $1,608,300,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, from $1,212,600,000 in the same period in 2010, and contribution margin increased 24.4% from $436.7 million to $543.2 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 4% to $94.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $91.3 million for the same period in 2010. And the Warehouse segment achieved a positive contribution margin of $4.3 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared to a negative contribution of almost $0.8 million in 2010.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 6% in 2010. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 12% in 2010. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in 2010. And gross sales, internationally, increased to 20% from 16% in the same period in 2010. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in 2010.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2011 amounted to $88.9 million compared to $66.4 million in the same quarter in 2010, and $116.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $381 million compared to $240.6 million in 2010. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to their customers overseas. 
Sales continued to progress well in Europe. Gross sales in EMEA, which is Europe, Middle East and South Africa, were 46.1% higher in the fourth quarter than in the comparable period in 2010. And for the full year, gross sales in Europe were 87.5% higher than in 2010. Sales in Western Europe and in the United Kingdom, in particular, grew faster than in Central and Eastern Europe. And Western Europe is now operating profitably.
In South Africa, we made a change to our distribution partner, and in the last quarter of 2011, sales improved substantially. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launch Monster Energy in Poland in February and are planning new additional launches in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in the first half of 2012. We are also planning additional launches in Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Asia during the remainder of 2012. Both gross and net sales for the comparable 12-month period ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter. If the sales attributable to the 2009 fourth quarter buy were being included in the 2010 first quarter in which the company previously estimated 4% to 6% of the 2009 fourth quarter growth sales, such sales would have had the effect of increasing the sales achieved in the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 by approximately 1%. The buying had no effect on 2011 sales in which we are now reporting.
Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea continue to meet our expectations. In 2011, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 37.1% over 2010. We're in the process of launching 3 new line extensions, namely Cranberry Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Sweet Tea, which will replace the Celon Tea, Unsweetened Tea and Green Tea variants -- Dark Green Tea variants, sorry.
We are continuing to build distribution for Worx Energy. In 2012, we intend to bring our advertising expenditure for Worx Energy into line with Worx sales levels. We plan to introduce an additional extra strength version later 2012.
Gross profit margins achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 52.3% versus 51.6% in the comparable quarter in 2010. The increase in our overall gross margin percentage was largely due to a higher proportion of sales within the DSD segment of products in North America, which have a higher gross profit margin; increased sales of DSD products as compared to Warehouse products; product mix, which was partially offset by international sales where we achieved lower cost margin than in North America; and to a lesser extent to lower off-invoice and promotional allowances. We have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012, as well as a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar. In the light of the volatility of both commodities in world markets, we anticipate some increase in raw material costs in 2012. We do not believe that, at current levels, raw material cost increases will have a material negative effect on our margins.
Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter was a slightly higher than the same period in 2010. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.5% from 12.2% in the same period in 2010. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increases in commissions and royalty payments, premiums, advertising, and sponsorship and endorsement costs in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter in 2010. The increased cost for sampling teams, as well as trade development personnel, particularly in Europe, also contributed to the increase in selling expenses. We are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, Australia and South America. Such trade development programs supplement our distribution partners respective sales forces to service and merchandise small independent stores. We believe that such activities play an important role in the establishment and development of our brand overseas. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll cost.
General and administrative costs, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative cost was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses, and in particular, increased costs of stock-based compensation.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9% from 11.5% in 2010. Sponsorship and endorsement costs were approximately $13.6 million higher than in 2010, but were lower as a percentage of net sales. Selling expenses for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 was also higher than in 2010, primarily due to increased expenditures for advertising, which was largely for the Worx Energy Shots, trade development cost, commissions and royalties, premiums and merchandise displays which was mainly coolers. 
In 2011, cost of goods as well as selling, general and administrative expenses in Western Europe were lower on a per case basis in local currencies than in 2010. In 2011, we invested extensively in Central and Eastern Europe, and more particularly, in newer markets in that region. Selling, general and administrative expenses in that region were higher on a per case basis in local currency in part due to lower case sales than planned. We are holding discussions with our distributor in Central Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chain between us. We believe that such discussions, combined with reduced operating costs per case, will enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012, in Central and Eastern Europe.
We incurred higher promotional and marketing costs on a per case basis in Australia, in 2011, implementing our strategy to increase market share, which was achieved. We are working with our distributor in Australia to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and have also taken steps to reduce our cost of goods and overall operating cost in Australia. We believe that these measures will enable us to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and, South America. These operating losses negatively affected our reported income for the 2011 year, and obviously, should be bought in mind in our evaluating results.
Our effective tax rate in the 2011 fourth quarter was 38.3% compared to 38.7% in the 2010 fourth quarter. The decrease in the 2011 fourth quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate, which was partially offset by an increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, was 37.4% compared to 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate this year and the establishment, in 2010, of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. The decrease in the annual effective tax rate was also partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $359.3 million compared to $354.8 million at December 31, 2010. Short-term investments were $411.3 million compared to $244.6 million at December 31, 2010. Long-term investments decreased from $44.2 million at December 31, 2010 to $23.2 million. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $35.9 million. Trade account receivables are now presented on a gross basis, as our promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $218.1 million from $166 million at December 31, 2010. Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 41.3 days at December 31, 2010. If trade account receivables had been presented on a net basis, days outstanding would have been 26.2 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 27.7 days at December 31, 2010. In the future, the company will only report days outstanding for receivables calculated on a basis consistent with the above new treatment. As sales outside the United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries.
Inventories increased to $155.6 million from $153.2 million at December 31, 2010. Average days of inventory was 72 days at December 31, 2011, which is lower than the 89 days of inventory at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $44.8 million, originally it was $79.6 million at December 31, 2010, with an amortized cost basis of $35.9 million. During the 2011 fourth quarter, the company purchase approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $39.78 per share, pursuant to the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors in March 2010. These purchases exhausted the availability under the 2010 share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to $250 million out of the company's shares. No shares have been purchased, as yet, under this authorization.
Gross sales in January 2012 were approximately 34% higher than in January 2011. While we are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company, we caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days of the week in which holidays fall at the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.
I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

In Central and Eastern Europe, we are looking at some additional markets which are quite large. Poland is probably the second largest market in Central and Eastern Europe. And in fact if you exclude Russia, it's the largest market, but certainly just after Russia. And that is a very big market in relation to some of the other smaller markets that we have gone into. Hungary was a nice market but they imposed a tax on energy drinks and anything with sugar. And that really has completely disrupted that market. So that is part of the sort of challenges we had this year. And fall off in the fourth quarter was largely attributable to -- in sales in that area was attributable to that issue. But the Czech market is doing very nicely. So there are markets that are doing very nicely and will continue to grow. We think that we do have some expansion there. The Asian market, we are looking at some pretty nice sized market in Korea and Japan. There are a couple of the smaller ones, that I indicated, which will be our smaller markets.

And each of these markets just basically have their own maturity as you get to a certain size in the market, you're able to actually profitably support the infrastructure we need in each market. The way we do business going into markets with a lot of support for sampling and for those sort of local marketing activities. And so once we get over the initial hump, the markets start becoming more profitable quite quickly and you know we've just paid our dues in a lot of the Central and Eastern European end market we are hopeful that we will continue to get better results in those countries this year."

According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through January 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandises, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased 16.4% versus the same period a year ago.

Based on the Nielsen reports, Monster is continuing to close the gap with Red Bull in dollars, while in units, Monster is continuing to increase its lead over Red Bull.
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased 15.2% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 17% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 21.3%. Java Monster sales and market share continues to show improvement and Java Monster is still the market leader in this space. 
We are pleased to report that sales of our new noncarbonated Monster Rehab Tea plus lemonade energy drink with electrolytes, which we launched in the first quarter of 2011 continues to accelerate, and this SKU continues to be one of our top-selling Monster products. Based on Nielsen data for the convenience and gas channel, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, sales of Rehab are now more than double the sales of the main competitive noncarbonated energy drink.
During the fourth quarter, we launched 3 line extensions through our successful Monster Rehab energy drink, namely Rojo Tea + Energy, Green Tea + Energy and ProTEAn + Energy. We're in the process of launching a further line extension in the Monster Rehab line namely Tea + Orangeades + Energy and also proceeding with our planned launch of Über Monster Energy drinks in glass bottles during the first half of 2012.
Monster is performing well in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended January 14, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%. Monster sales increased 23% and our market share grew 2.3 points to 24.6% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 11% and it's market share decreased 0.2 points to 37.4% as compared to the same period last year over 2010. 
Rockstar sales increased 19%. Its market share increased by 0.9 points to 15%. According to Nielsen, sales in the energy drink category in Mexico grew 11.4% in December 2011 over December 2010. Sales of Monster Energy in Mexico, in December 2011, grew 21.1% over the same month in 2010, while sales of Red Bull were 12.1% lower. Monster's market share in Mexico, December 2011, increased by 2.8 points to 34.2% over the same period in 2010. This excludes Java Monster, bringing it closer to Red Bull's market share in Mexico, which dropped to 9.8 points to 36.8% over the same period.
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 31.1% to $389.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, from $297.5 million in the same period in 2010. And contribution margin increased 24.9% from $103.7 million to $129.6 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 5.1% to $20.1 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $21.2 million for the same period in 2010. However, the company achieved a positive contribution of approximately $750,000 in the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, for the Warehouse segment, as compared to a negative contribution of almost $1 million in the comparable period in 2010. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 32.6% to $1,608,300,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, from $1,212,600,000 in the same period in 2010, and contribution margin increased 24.4% from $436.7 million to $543.2 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 4% to $94.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $91.3 million for the same period in 2010. And the Warehouse segment achieved a positive contribution margin of $4.3 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared to a negative contribution of almost $0.8 million in 2010.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 6% in 2010. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 12% in 2010. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in 2010. And gross sales, internationally, increased to 20% from 16% in the same period in 2010. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in 2010.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2011 amounted to $88.9 million compared to $66.4 million in the same quarter in 2010, and $116.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $381 million compared to $240.6 million in 2010. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to their customers overseas. 
Sales continued to progress well in Europe. Gross sales in EMEA, which is Europe, Middle East and South Africa, were 46.1% higher in the fourth quarter than in the comparable period in 2010. And for the full year, gross sales in Europe were 87.5% higher than in 2010. Sales in Western Europe and in the United Kingdom, in particular, grew faster than in Central and Eastern Europe. And Western Europe is now operating profitably.
In South Africa, we made a change to our distribution partner, and in the last quarter of 2011, sales improved substantially. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launch Monster Energy in Poland in February and are planning new additional launches in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in the first half of 2012. We are also planning additional launches in Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Asia during the remainder of 2012. Both gross and net sales for the comparable 12-month period ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter. If the sales attributable to the 2009 fourth quarter buy were being included in the 2010 first quarter in which the company previously estimated 4% to 6% of the 2009 fourth quarter growth sales, such sales would have had the effect of increasing the sales achieved in the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 by approximately 1%. The buying had no effect on 2011 sales in which we are now reporting.
Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea continue to meet our expectations. In 2011, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 37.1% over 2010. We're in the process of launching 3 new line extensions, namely Cranberry Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Sweet Tea, which will replace the Celon Tea, Unsweetened Tea and Green Tea variants -- Dark Green Tea variants, sorry.
We are continuing to build distribution for Worx Energy. In 2012, we intend to bring our advertising expenditure for Worx Energy into line with Worx sales levels. We plan to introduce an additional extra strength version later 2012.
Gross profit margins achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 52.3% versus 51.6% in the comparable quarter in 2010. The increase in our overall gross margin percentage was largely due to a higher proportion of sales within the DSD segment of products in North America, which have a higher gross profit margin; increased sales of DSD products as compared to Warehouse products; product mix, which was partially offset by international sales where we achieved lower cost margin than in North America; and to a lesser extent to lower off-invoice and promotional allowances. We have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012, as well as a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar. In the light of the volatility of both commodities in world markets, we anticipate some increase in raw material costs in 2012. We do not believe that, at current levels, raw material cost increases will have a material negative effect on our margins.
Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter was a slightly higher than the same period in 2010. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.5% from 12.2% in the same period in 2010. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increases in commissions and royalty payments, premiums, advertising, and sponsorship and endorsement costs in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter in 2010. The increased cost for sampling teams, as well as trade development personnel, particularly in Europe, also contributed to the increase in selling expenses. We are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, Australia and South America. Such trade development programs supplement our distribution partners respective sales forces to service and merchandise small independent stores. We believe that such activities play an important role in the establishment and development of our brand overseas. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll cost.
General and administrative costs, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative cost was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses, and in particular, increased costs of stock-based compensation.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9% from 11.5% in 2010. Sponsorship and endorsement costs were approximately $13.6 million higher than in 2010, but were lower as a percentage of net sales. Selling expenses for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 was also higher than in 2010, primarily due to increased expenditures for advertising, which was largely for the Worx Energy Shots, trade development cost, commissions and royalties, premiums and merchandise displays which was mainly coolers. 
In 2011, cost of goods as well as selling, general and administrative expenses in Western Europe were lower on a per case basis in local currencies than in 2010. In 2011, we invested extensively in Central and Eastern Europe, and more particularly, in newer markets in that region. Selling, general and administrative expenses in that region were higher on a per case basis in local currency in part due to lower case sales than planned. We are holding discussions with our distributor in Central Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chain between us. We believe that such discussions, combined with reduced operating costs per case, will enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012, in Central and Eastern Europe.
We incurred higher promotional and marketing costs on a per case basis in Australia, in 2011, implementing our strategy to increase market share, which was achieved. We are working with our distributor in Australia to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and have also taken steps to reduce our cost of goods and overall operating cost in Australia. We believe that these measures will enable us to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and, South America. These operating losses negatively affected our reported income for the 2011 year, and obviously, should be bought in mind in our evaluating results.
Our effective tax rate in the 2011 fourth quarter was 38.3% compared to 38.7% in the 2010 fourth quarter. The decrease in the 2011 fourth quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate, which was partially offset by an increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, was 37.4% compared to 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate this year and the establishment, in 2010, of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. The decrease in the annual effective tax rate was also partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $359.3 million compared to $354.8 million at December 31, 2010. Short-term investments were $411.3 million compared to $244.6 million at December 31, 2010. Long-term investments decreased from $44.2 million at December 31, 2010 to $23.2 million. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $35.9 million. Trade account receivables are now presented on a gross basis, as our promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $218.1 million from $166 million at December 31, 2010. Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 41.3 days at December 31, 2010. If trade account receivables had been presented on a net basis, days outstanding would have been 26.2 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 27.7 days at December 31, 2010. In the future, the company will only report days outstanding for receivables calculated on a basis consistent with the above new treatment. As sales outside the United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries.
Inventories increased to $155.6 million from $153.2 million at December 31, 2010. Average days of inventory was 72 days at December 31, 2011, which is lower than the 89 days of inventory at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $44.8 million, originally it was $79.6 million at December 31, 2010, with an amortized cost basis of $35.9 million. During the 2011 fourth quarter, the company purchase approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $39.78 per share, pursuant to the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors in March 2010. These purchases exhausted the availability under the 2010 share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to $250 million out of the company's shares. No shares have been purchased, as yet, under this authorization.
Gross sales in January 2012 were approximately 34% higher than in January 2011. While we are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company, we caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days of the week in which holidays fall at the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period.
I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

We think we have a lot of growth left in markets like Spain, Germany and the U.K. where the brand is doing very, very nicely and in France, for that matter. Those are pretty big markets. In Central and Eastern Europe, we are looking at some additional markets which are quite large. Poland is probably the second largest market in Central and Eastern Europe. And in fact if you exclude Russia, it's the largest market, but certainly just after Russia. And that is a very big market in relation to some of the other smaller markets that we have gone into. Hungary was a nice market but they imposed a tax on energy drinks and anything with sugar. And that really has completely disrupted that market. So that is part of the sort of challenges we had this year. And fall off in the fourth quarter was largely attributable to -- in sales in that area was attributable to that issue. But the Czech market is doing very nicely. So there are markets that are doing very nicely and will continue to grow. We think that we do have some expansion there. The Asian market, we are looking at some pretty nice sized market in Korea and Japan. There are a couple of the smaller ones, that I indicated, which will be our smaller markets. And we're continuing to expand. We believe, that we have a lot of upside and the Brazilian market, particularly in the other markets in South America where we're at -- we're pretty far advanced in having our products approved through -- meeting the regulatory requirements and in having planning -- launches planned. We've already started trade in Colombia very nicely and we're looking at Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina. So we believe those will also come on stream in the foreseeable future. And each of these markets just basically have their own maturity as you get to a certain size in the market, you're able to actually profitably support the infrastructure we need in each market. The way we do business going into markets with a lot of support for sampling and for those sort of local marketing activities. And so once we get over the initial hump, the markets start becoming more profitable quite quickly and you know we've just paid our dues in a lot of the Central and Eastern European end market we are hopeful that we will continue to get better results in those countries this year."

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended January 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots, in dollars, improved to 30.3% against Red Bull's share of 32.3%, Rockstar's share of 9.7% and 5-Hour's share of 10.6%. Based on the Nielsen reports, Monster is continuing to close the gap with Red Bull in dollars, while in units, Monster is continuing to increase its lead over Red Bull.
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased 15.2% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 17% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 21.3%. Java Monster sales and market share continues to show improvement and Java Monster is still the market leader in this space. We are pleased to report that sales of our new noncarbonated Monster Rehab Tea plus lemonade energy drink with electrolytes, which we launched in the first quarter of 2011 continues to accelerate, and this SKU continues to be one of our top-selling Monster products. Based on Nielsen data for the convenience and gas channel, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, sales of Rehab are now more than double the sales of the main competitive noncarbonated energy drink. 
During the fourth quarter, we launched 3 line extensions through our successful Monster Rehab energy drink, namely Rojo Tea + Energy, Green Tea + Energy and ProTEAn + Energy. We're in the process of launching a further line extension in the Monster Rehab line namely Tea + Orangeades + Energy and also proceeding with our planned launch of Über Monster Energy drinks in glass bottles during the first half of 2012. Monster is performing well in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended January 14, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%. Monster sales increased 23% and our market share grew 2.3 points to 24.6% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 11% and its market share decreased 0.2 points to 37.4% as compared to the same period last year over 2010. Rockstar sales increased 19%. Its market share increased by 0.9 points to 15%. 
According to Nielsen, sales in the energy drink category in Mexico grew 11.4% in December 2011 over December 2010. Sales of Monster Energy in Mexico, in December 2011, grew 21.1% over the same month in 2010, while sales of Red Bull were 12.1% lower. Monster's market share in Mexico, December 2011, increased by 2.8 points to 34.2% over the same period in 2010. This excludes Java Monster, bringing it closer to Red Bull's market share in Mexico, which dropped to 9.8 points to 36.8% over the same period. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 31.1% to $389.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, from $297.5 million in the same period in 2010. And contribution margin increased 24.9% from $103.7 million to $129.6 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 5.1% to $20.1 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $21.2 million for the same period in 2010. However, the company achieved a positive contribution of approximately $750,000 in the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, for the Warehouse segment, as compared to a negative contribution of almost $1 million in the comparable period in 2010. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 32.6% to $1,608,300,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, from $1,212,600,000 in the same period in 2010, and contribution margin increased 24.4% from $436.7 million to $543.2 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 4% to $94.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $91.3 million for the same period in 2010. And the Warehouse segment achieved a positive contribution margin of $4.3 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared to a negative contribution of almost $0.8 million in 2010. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 6% in 2010. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 12% in 2010. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in 2010. And gross sales, internationally, increased to 20% from 16% in the same period in 2010. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in 2010.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2011 amounted to $88.9 million compared to $66.4 million in the same quarter in 2010, and $116.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $381 million compared to $240.6 million in 2010. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to their customers overseas. Sales continued to progress well in Europe. Gross sales in EMEA, which is Europe, Middle East and South Africa, were 46.1% higher in the fourth quarter than in the comparable period in 2010. And for the full year, gross sales in Europe were 87.5% higher than in 2010. Sales in Western Europe and in the United Kingdom, in particular, grew faster than in Central and Eastern Europe. And Western Europe is now operating profitably.
In South Africa, we made a change to our distribution partner, and in the last quarter of 2011, sales improved substantially. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launch Monster Energy in Poland in February and are planning new additional launches in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in the first half of 2012. We are also planning additional launches in Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Asia during the remainder of 2012. Both gross and net sales for the comparable 12-month period ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter. If the sales attributable to the 2009 fourth quarter buy were being included in the 2010 first quarter in which the company previously estimated 4% to 6% of the 2009 fourth quarter growth sales, such sales would have had the effect of increasing the sales achieved in the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 by approximately 1%. The buying had no effect on 2011 sales in which we are now reporting.
Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea continue to meet our expectations. In 2011, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 37.1% over 2010. We're in the process of launching 3 new line extensions, namely Cranberry Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Sweet Tea, which will replace the Celon Tea, Unsweetened Tea and Green Tea variants -- Dark Green Tea variants, sorry. We are continuing to build distribution for Worx Energy. In 2012, we intend to bring our advertising expenditure for Worx Energy into line with Worx sales levels. We plan to introduce an additional extra strength version later 2012.
Gross profit margins achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 52.3% versus 51.6% in the comparable quarter in 2010. The increase in our overall gross margin percentage was largely due to a higher proportion of sales within the DSD segment of products in North America, which have a higher gross profit margin; increased sales of DSD products as compared to Warehouse products; product mix, which was partially offset by international sales where we achieved lower gross margin than in North America; and to a lesser extent to lower off-invoice and promotional allowances. We have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012, as well as a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar. In the light of the volatility of both commodities in world markets, we anticipate some increase in raw material costs in 2012. We do not believe that, at current levels, raw material cost increases will have a material negative effect on our margins.
Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter was a slightly higher than the same period in 2010. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.5% from 12.2% in the same period in 2010. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increases in commissions and royalty payments, premiums, advertising, and sponsorship and endorsement costs in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter in 2010. The increased cost for sampling teams, as well as trade development personnel, particularly in Europe, also contributed to the increase in selling expenses.
 We are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, Australia and South America. Such trade development programs supplement our distribution partners respective sales forces to service and merchandise small independent stores. We believe that such activities play an important role in the establishment and development of our brand overseas. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll cost.
General and administrative costs, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative cost was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses, and in particular, increased costs of stock-based compensation. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9% from 11.5% in 2010. Sponsorship and endorsement costs were approximately $13.6 million higher than in 2010, but were lower as a percentage of net sales. Selling expenses for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 was also higher than in 2010, primarily due to increased expenditures for advertising, which was largely for the Worx Energy Shots, trade development costs, commissions and royalties, premiums and merchandise displays which was mainly coolers. 
In 2011, cost of goods as well as selling, general and administrative expenses in Western Europe were lower on a per case basis in local currencies than in 2010. In 2011, we invested extensively in Central and Eastern Europe, and more particularly, in newer markets in that region. Selling, general and administrative expenses in that region were higher on a per case basis in local currency in part due to lower case sales than planned. We are holding discussions with our distributor in Central Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chain between us. We believe that such discussions, combined with reduced operating costs per case, will enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012, in Central and Eastern Europe. We incurred higher promotional and marketing costs on a per case basis in Australia, in 2011, implementing our strategy to increase market share, which was achieved. We are working with our distributor in Australia to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and have also taken steps to reduce our cost of goods and overall operating cost in Australia. We believe that these measures will enable us to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012.
Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and, South America. These operating losses negatively affected our reported income for the 2011 year, and obviously, should be bore in mind in our evaluating results.
Our effective tax rate in the 2011 fourth quarter was 38.3% compared to 38.7% in the 2010 fourth quarter. The decrease in the 2011 fourth quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate, which was partially offset by an increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, was 37.4% compared to 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate this year and the establishment, in 2010, of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. The decrease in the annual effective tax rate was also partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $359.3 million compared to $354.8 million at December 31, 2010. Short-term investments were $411.3 million compared to $244.6 million at December 31, 2010. Long-term investments decreased from $44.2 million at December 31, 2010 to $23.2 million. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $35.9 million. Trade account receivables are now presented on a gross basis, as our promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $218.1 million from $166 million at December 31, 2010. Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 41.3 days at December 31, 2010. If trade account receivables had been presented on a net basis, days outstanding would have been 26.2 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 27.7 days at December 31, 2010. In the future, the company will only report days outstanding for receivables calculated on a basis consistent with the above new treatment. As sales outside the United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries.
Inventories increased to $155.6 million from $153.2 million at December 31, 2010. Average days of inventory was 72 days at December 31, 2011, which is lower than the 89 days of inventory at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $44.8 million, originally it was $79.6 million at December 31, 2010, with an amortized cost basis of $35.9 million. During the 2011 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $39.78 per share, pursuant to the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors in March 2010. These purchases exhausted the availability under the 2010 share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to $250 million out of the company's shares. No shares have been purchased, as yet, under this authorization.
Gross sales in January 2012 were approximately 34% higher than in January 2011. While we are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company, we caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days of the week in which holidays fall at the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. I would like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

In Japan, we've led to take on additional staff, and so we are gearing to do the same thing in South America. So we certainly have had an increase in staffing and we have taken on a new Senior Vice President, Don Blaustein, who was previously President of Heineken to head up our international operations in Asia and South America regions, and Lat-Am regions. He's come on board. But he won't have affected these figures because he's come on board only in the last few weeks. But we are obviously, looking to step up our personnel to basically be able to handle the increased expansion, the bigger volume that we're now dealing with as we continue to move forward."

But the gross margins are, as a general rule, not -- there are some exceptions, but as a general rule, will be less. But again, the impact that those additional markets will have on the company, we believe will be small. The issue, which we don't know a lot about is as we continue to expand, again, is what will happen to cost like the bigger cost that we have, our apple juice and sugar, which are quite big components, as we've indicated -- as indicated earlier. We've largely covered our aluminum can side. But we do have -- we've got a reasonable proportion of our juice and sugar cost all uncovered. So those may go up as we see the year. But we don't think that the increase -- there'll be an increase but we don't think it'll be material."

We think there's lot of opportunity. I think we're underrepresented in the Italian market. We have opportunity there. Some of the markets are starting to grow very nicely. We think we have a lot of growth left in markets like Spain, Germany and the U.K. where the brand is doing very, very nicely and in France, for that matter. Those are pretty big markets. In Central and Eastern Europe, we are looking at some additional markets which are quite large. Poland is probably the second largest market in Central and Eastern Europe. And in fact if you exclude Russia, it's the largest market, but certainly just after Russia. And that is a very big market in relation to some of the other smaller markets that we have gone into. Hungary was a nice market but they imposed a tax on energy drinks and anything with sugar. And that really has completely disrupted that market. So that is part of the sort of challenges we had this year. And the fall off in the fourth quarter was largely attributable to -- in sales in that area was attributable to that issue. But the Czech market is doing very nicely. So there are markets that are doing very nicely and will continue to grow. We think that we do have some expansion there. The Asian markets, we are looking at some pretty nice sized market in Korea and Japan. There are a couple of the smaller ones, that I indicated, which will be our smaller markets. And we're continuing to expand.
We believe, that we have a lot of upside and the Brazilian market, particularly in the other markets in South America where we're at -- we're pretty far advanced in having our products approved through -- meeting the regulatory requirements and in having planning -- launches planned. We've already started trade in Colombia very nicely and we're looking at Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina. So we believe those will also come on stream in the foreseeable future. And each of these markets just basically have their own maturity as you get to a certain size in the market, you're able to actually profitably support the infrastructure we need in these markets. The way we do business going into markets with a lot of support for sampling and for those sort of local marketing activities. And so once we get over the initial hump, the markets start becoming more profitable quite quickly and you know we've just paid our dues in a lot of the Central and Eastern European  markets and we are hopeful that we will continue to get better results in those countries this year."

The beverage industry generally appears to have improved in the first quarter of 2012 as evidenced by the positive results recently reported on by the major beverage companies. The consensus appears to be that the macroeconomic environment in the United States is improving, which is consistent with our experience in the first quarter. We are pleased to report yet again another record first quarter with gross sales up 26.9% to $517.3 million. Net sales up 27.5% to $454.6 million and operating income up 42.8% to $126.3 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 39.7% from $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2011 to $0.41 per share. 
According to the Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery drug and mass merchandisers excluding Wal-Mart, sales in the energy drink category, including shots, increased 17.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 26.2% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 20%, sales of Rockstar increased by 17.2% and sales of 5-Hour increased by 6.9%. Sales of Amp decreased 0.1%. Sales of NOS increased 10.2% off a lower base and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.9%. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended April 21, 2012, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 19% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 24.9% over last year while sales of Red Bull increased by 23.1% over last year. Rockstar was up 14.2% while 5-Hour was up 10%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars increased by 1.4 points over a year ago to 30.5% against Red Bull share of 32.4%, Rockstar share of 9.4% and 5-Hour share of 10.7%.
According to Nielsen in the 13 weeks ended April 21, 2012 for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased 22.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was up 33% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 27.2%. Sales of our new non-carbonated Monster Rehab D+ energy line the first SKU of which was launched in the first quarter of 2012 continues to accelerate. 
In the first quarter of 2012, we launched our SKU in the Monster Rehab line namely Tea + Orangeades + Energy, as well as our Über Monster Energy drinks in glass bottles.

According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended March 10, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%. Monster sales increased 12% and our market share increased 0.1 points to 24.5% while Red Bull sales increased 8% and its market share decreased 1.1 points to 36%. 
Rockstar sales increased 43% and its market share increased 3.7 points to 16.6%. We believe that Rockstar's numbers in this period in Canada was skewed due to the inclusion of sales of its Rockstar recovery line this year, which were not in last year's numbers and as well as due to promotions implemented by Rockstar in the first quarter of 2012.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended March 31, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada across all market channels grew 12.5%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 13.9%. Sales of Monster increased 17.4% and sales of Rockstar increased 20.2%.

Monster's market share in Mexico in March 2012 increased by 1.2 points to 35.7% over the same period last year, which includes Java Monster compared to Red Bull's share at 36.7 although sales of Monster in Mexico were 2.2% lower than last year versus sales of Red Bull, which were 22.9% lower. 
Net sales for the company DSD segment increased 28.8% to $431.2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, from $334.7 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 35.4% from $110.1 million to $149.1 million. Net sales for the company's warehouse segment increased 8% to $23.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, compared with $21.7 million for the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased $2.2 million in this quarter versus a loss of $0.3 million for the same quarter last year.
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 5% in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, the same as in 2011. Gross sales to full-service distributors represents 65% of sales, also the same as in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 19% from 18% in the same period of 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as 2011.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2012 amounted to $100.6 million compared to $72.8 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales of the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military customers overseas. 
Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2012 in dollars were 53.3% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum in market share in Europe. Western Europe continues to operate profitably and operating income improved over the same period last year. We are continuing with our expense strategy into new international markets. We launch Monster Energy in Poland in the first quarter of 2012 and retail sales of Monster Energy commenced in Hong Kong and Macau in April 2012 and in Japan and Ecuador earlier this week. 
We are planning to launch Monster in Chile, Peru, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan as well as additional countries overseas later in 2012 and in Argentina early in 2013. We're also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. Our plan launch of Monster in Korea in April was delayed due to product approval issues, which we are addressing. 
We believe that these issues will be resolved shortly and we will be able to proceed with the launch of Monster in Korea early in the second half of 2012. Sales of Peace Tea ready to drink iced tea continue to meet and indeed exceed our expectations. In the first quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 86.4% over the same period in 2011. We recently launched 3 new line extensions namely Cranberry Iced Tea, Pink Lemonade tea and Texas style sweet tea to replace certain SKUs that were soft. 
We are continuing to build distribution of sales for Worx Energy. Gross profit margins achieved in the first quarter of 2012 were 53.1% versus 52.1% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to increase operating efficiencies, product mix and a decrease in certain product costs. Gross margin achieved for international sales other than those sold from the United States were lower in the first quarter of 2012 than in the comparable quarter in 2011. 
Although we have covered a loss portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012 and a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar, we did experience some increases in raw material cost in the first quarter of 2012 and expect to continue to experience limited increases during the remainder of the year. However, we do not believe that if current levels increases in cost of raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. 
Distribution expense as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter were slightly higher than the same period in 2011. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 12.3% from 13.7% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising primarily for Worx and commissions which was partially offset by increases in sponsorships for cost of premiums and TDMs in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. 
As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and South America. Particularly through trade development programs to support our distributor partners perspective sales forces. To service and merchandise small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll cost.
General and administrative expenses although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and in particular increased cost of stock-based compensation. As previously reported, we are continuing to hold discussions with our distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably are looking to value chains in various countries between us. We believe that successful discussions combined with subdued operating cost per case should enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012 in Central and Eastern Europe. 
However, we have to date not been able to arrive at the tip of an agreement with this distribution partner. Beginning 2012 second quarter, we have managed to reduce certain operating costs in Australia and have limited our spend on commercial costs with our Australian distributor. As a result, we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012 and beyond.
Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $4.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and South America as compared to $3.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in which was attributable to Australia, Eastern Europe and our expansion markets. Our effective tax rate in the 2012 first quarter was 39.9% compared with 38% in the 2011 first quarter. The increase in the 2012 first quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of establishing a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary during the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, and tax rate differences between the different jurisdictions on certain intercompany charges. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $391.4 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $419.6 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprise the entirety of auction rate securities decreased from $23.2 million at December 31, 2011 to $21.9 million. Trade accounts receivables are now presented on a gross basis as our promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company does not allow net settlement such as our full-service distributors. 
We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $255.7 million from $218.1 million at December 31, 2011. Days outstanding for receivables consistent with the above treatment were 44.8 days at March 31, 2012 and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011 compared to 48.4 days at March 31, 2011. 
Sales outside United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales. Days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms of generally drawn to capitalize internationally with local practices in the respective countries. Inventories increased to $179.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 75.5 days at March 31, 2012, which is higher than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. 
At March 31, 2012, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $29.1 million, $44.8 million at December 31, 2011 with an amortized cost basis of $21.9 million. Gross sales in April 2012 were approximately 39% higher than in April 2011. This includes opening shipments through established inventory in Japan. Excluding Japan, sales are approximately 33% above last year. We're encouraged by the continuing a strong sales that have been experienced by the company. 
We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, deals the timing of promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
During the 2012 first quarter, the company did not repurchase any of its shares. I'd like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

Again on the Mexican numbers, we get our Nielsen and compare it really is one month -- month-to-month so March this year versus March last year. And again, those numbers tend to jump around a little bit depending on whether there are promotions by either the largest player and competitor to us, which is either Red Bull or ourselves. The market is very largely influenced by the outside chain. We have a very significant percentage share of the market and again by just doing a promotion whether it's Red Bull or us it really skews that market, literally can push us up or down. And they did have some text issues. They introduce a text on energy drinks that have a little bit of a dampening effect as to how you deal with it, we sort of reformulated our product that was last year and we sort of did see sort of a reasonably good increasing our sales. So this was just up and down like this in the last few months. It's down 5%, roughly, and we have actually increased share also our actually share the sales levels in margins are down. But again I think it can change from month to month depending on whether we implement a promotional program. It has a very big influence on those numbers. So the key for us is really more of the market share information and we think that the category will ultimately start to grow and show growth again later in the year."

There has always been a traditional energy type category in Japan for many many decades. They're usually little vials, 2.5 ounces, small glass bottles or other containers and that's been around for a long time. That category is probably bigger than 50 million case category. The question is how long will it take for the Japanese consumer to convert from traditional energy from modern energy and then how many you consumers who are not into that traditional energy category by having different products, different flavors, we believe that will help stimulate attention to the category and bring in new customers in Japan and there is a big market and we believe that can grow but we are in the area of in a moment because we think there's a lot of potential but it's going to take time to grow into that potential and then see what we can do. But those are the 2 sources we would hope to draw from in order to increase the base energy category and we hope to obviously then participates in that quite -- at a high sort of share. So we're hopeful but we really don't have statistics that I can give you that are reliable. It's absolutely different to Canada and Mexico. Those markets are very much closer to the U.S. In the beverage consumption pattern are closer to the U.S. whereas in Japan, it's much more traditional and a very different market."

The beverage industry generally appears to have improved in the first quarter of 2012, as evidenced by the positive results recently reported on by the major beverage companies. The consensus appears to be that the macroeconomic environment in the United States is improving, which is consistent with our experience in the first quarter. 
We are pleased to report yet again another record first quarter with gross sales up 26.9% to $517.3 million. Net sales up 27.5% to $454.6 million and operating income up 42.8% to $126.3 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 39.7% from $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2011 to $0.41 per share. 
According to the Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased 17.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 26.2% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 20%, sales of Rockstar increased by 17.2% and sales of 5-Hour increased by 6.9%. Sales of Amp decreased 0.1 of a percent. Sales of NOS increased 10.2% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.9%. 
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended April 21, 2012, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 19% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 24.9% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 23.1% over last year. Rockstar was up 14.2% while 5-Hour was up 10%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.4 points over a year ago to 30.5% against Red Bull's share of 32.4%, Rockstar's share of 9.4% and 5-Hour's share of 10.7%.
According to Nielsen in the 13 weeks ended April 21, 2012 for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, increased 22.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was up 23% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 27.2%. Sales of our new non-carbonated Monster Rehab tea + energy line, the first SKU of which was launched back in the first quarter of 2011, continues to accelerate. 
In the first quarter of 2012, we launched our first SKU in the Monster Rehab line namely tea + orangeade + energy, as well as our Übermonster energy drinks in glass bottles. 
Monster's market share and sales in Canada continued to improve. According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended March 10, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%. Monster sales increased 12% and our market share increased 0.1 points to 24.5%, while Red Bull sales increased 8% and it's market share decreased 1.1 points to 36%. 
Rockstar sales increased 43% and it's market share increased 3.7 points to 16.6%. We believe that Rockstar's numbers in this period in Canada was skewed due to the inclusion of sales of its Rockstar Recovery line this year, which were not in last year's numbers and as well as due to deep price promotions implemented by Rockstar in the first quarter of 2012.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended March 31, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada across all market channels grew 12.5%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 13.9%. Sales of Monster increased 17.4% and sales of Rockstar increased 20.2%.
According to Nielsen, sales of the energy drink category in Mexico, in March 2012, were 5.6% lower than in the same period last year. Monster's market share in Mexico, in March 2012, increased by 1.2 points to 35.7% over the same period last year, which includes Java Monster, compared to Red Bull's share at 36.7%, although sales of Monster in Mexico were 2.2% lower than last year versus sales of Red Bull, which were 22.9% lower. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 28.8% to $431.2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, from $334.7 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 35.4% from $110.1 million to $149.1 million. 
Net sales for the company's warehouse segment increased 8% to $23.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, compared with $21.7 million for the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased $2.2 million this quarter versus a loss of $0.3 million for the same quarter last year.
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 5% in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, the same as in 2011. Gross sales to full-service distributors represents 65% of sales, also the same as in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 19% from 18% in the same period of 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as 2011.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2012 amounted to $100.6 million compared to $72.8 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales were sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 53.3% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. Western Europe continues to operate profitably and operating income improved over the same period last year. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launch Monster Energy in Poland in the first quarter of 2012, and retail sales of Monster Energy commenced in Hong Kong and Macau in April 2012 and in Japan and Ecuador earlier this week. 
We are planning to launch Monster in Chile, Peru, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan, as well as additional countries overseas later in 2012 and in Argentina early in 2013. We're also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. 
Our planned launch of Monster in Korea in April was delayed due to product approval issues, which we are addressing. We believe that these issues will be resolved shortly and we will be able to proceed with the launch of Monster in Korea, early in the second half of 2012. 
Sales of Peace Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas, continue to meet and, indeed, exceed our expectations. In the first quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 86.4% over the same period in 2011. We recently launched 3 new line extensions, namely, Cranberry Iced Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Sweet Tea to replace certain SKUs that were soft. 
We are continuing to build distribution and sales for Worx Energy. 
Gross profit margins achieved in the first quarter of 2012 were 53.1% versus 52.1% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to increased operating efficiencies, product mix and the decrease in certain product costs. Gross margins achieved for international sales, other than those sold from the United States, were lower in the first quarter of 2012 than in the comparable quarter in 2011. 
Although we have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012 and a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar, we did experience some increases in raw material cost in the first quarter of 2012 and expect to continue to experience limited increases during the remainder of the year. However, we do not believe that if current levels increases in cost of raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. 
Distribution expense as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter were slightly higher than the same period in 2011. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 12.3% from 13.7% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising, primarily for Worx, and commissions, which was partially offset by increases in sponsorships for cost of premiums and GDMs in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. 
As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and South America, particularly, through trade development programs to support our distribution partners' respective sales forces, to service and merchandise to small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and training development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs.
General and administrative expenses, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and, in particular, increased cost of stock-based compensation. 
As previously reported, we are continuing to hold discussions with our distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chains in various countries between us. We believe that successful discussions combined with reduced operating cost per case should enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012, in Central and Eastern Europe. However, we have to date not been able to arrive at an acceptable agreement with this distribution partner. 
Beginning the 2012 second quarter, we have managed to reduce certain operating costs in Australia and have limited our spend on commercial costs with our Australian distributor. As a result, we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012 and beyond.
Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $4.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and South America, as compared to $3.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in which was attributable to Australia, Eastern Europe and our expansion markets. 
Our effective tax rate in the 2012 first quarter was 39.9% compared with 38% in the 2011 first quarter. The increase in the 2012 first quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of establishing a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary during the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, and tax rate differences between the different jurisdictions on certain intercompany charges. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $391.4 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $419.6 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprise the entirety of auction rate securities decreased from $23.2 million at December 31, 2011 to $21.9 million. Trade accounts receivables are now presented on a gross basis as our promotional allowances owed to those customers, that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. 
We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $255.7 million from $218.1 million at December 31, 2011. 
Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 44.8 days at March 31, 2012 and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011 compared to 48.4 days at March 31, 2011. 
As sales outside United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms of generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. 
Inventories increased to $179.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 75.5 days at March 31, 2012, which is higher than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. 
At March 31, 2012, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $29.1 million, $44.8 million at December 31, 2011 with an amortized cost basis of $21.9 million. 
Gross sales in April 2012 were approximately 39% higher than in April 2011. This includes opening shipments, through established inventory, in Japan. Excluding Japan, sales are approximately 53% above last year. We're encouraged by the continuing a strong sales that have been experienced by the company. 
We caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week for which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
During the 2012 first quarter, the company did not repurchase any of its shares. I'd like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

There is -- we're producing the products here so there's a long lead time to produce and ship it and have it examined, and checked and inspected and they're very, very -- it's a very pedantic, very slow exercise. So there was a large opening order sliced in order to ensure that sufficient inventory was on hand in Japan and available, with back-up inventory, et cetera. The other thing is that, in Japan, they are very efficient. Literally we sold, yesterday, for the first day, and we literally have 90% distribution in almost all of the convenience chains there, literally within the first day. That's something that, in the most efficient markets otherwise, we don't achieve in even 6 months. And so they really had a large opening inventory.

So the key for us is really more of the market share-ish information and we think that the category will ultimately start to grow or show growth again later in the year."

Apples and pears, in other parts of the world, with a whole different blind philosophy, and a different sortie. The category at the moment is thought to be about 2.5 million cases, maybe a little bigger, maybe 3 million cases,",337,"You really can't compare it. Apples and pears, in other parts of the world, with a whole different blind philosophy, and a different sortie. The category at the moment is thought to be about 2.5 million cases, maybe a little bigger, maybe 3 million cases, and it has been growing. But that's what I would define as the Western or modern energy category. There has always been an energy type category in Japan, a traditional energy, for many, many decades. They're usually little vials, 2.5 ounces, small glass bottles or other containers, flat containers and that's been around for a long time. That category is probably as big as a 50 million case category. The question is how long will it take for the Japanese consumer to be partially converted from traditional energy to modern energy, and then how many new consumers, who are not in the traditional energy category. Now can you actually -- by having different products, different flavors, we believe that will help stimulate attention to the category and bring in new consumers Japan. And then there is a big market and we believe that can grow but we're in the area of phasing at the moment because we -- we are in your growth spec, roughly but we think that there is a lot of potential but it's going to take time to grow into that potential and then see what we can do. But those are the 2 sources we would hope to draw from in order to increase the base energy category and we hope to obviously then participate in that quite -- at a high sort of share. So we're hopeful for it, but if we really don't have statistics that I can give you that are reliable. It's absolutely different to Canada and Mexico. Just the -- those markets are very much closer to the U.S. there. The beverage consumption patterns are closer to the U.S. whereas in Japan, it's much more traditional and a very different market."

The beverage industry generally appears to have improved in the first quarter of 2012, as evidenced by the positive results recently reported on by the major beverage companies. The consensus appears to be that the macroeconomic environment in the United States is improving, which is consistent with our experience in the first quarter. 
We are pleased to report yet again another record first quarter with gross sales up 26.9% to $517.3 million. Net sales up 27.5% to $454.6 million and operating income up 42.8% to $126.3 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 39.7% from $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2011 to $0.41 per share. 
According to the Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased 17.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 26.2% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 20%, sales of Rockstar increased by 17.2% and sales of 5-Hour increased by 6.9%. Sales of Amp decreased 0.1 of a percent. Sales of NOS increased 10.2% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.9%. 
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended April 21, 2012, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 19% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 24.9% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 23.1% over last year. Rockstar was up 14.2% while 5-Hour was up 10%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.4 points over a year ago to 30.5% against Red Bull's share of 32.4%, Rockstar's share of 9.4% and 5-Hour's share of 10.7%.
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended April 21, 2012 for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, increased 22.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was up 23% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 27.2%. Sales of our new non-carbonated Monster Rehab tea + energy line, the first SKU of which was launched back in the first quarter of 2011, continues to accelerate. 
In the first quarter of 2012, we launched our first SKU in the Monster Rehab line namely tea + orangeade + energy, as well as our Übermonster energy drinks in glass bottles. 
Monster's market share and sales in Canada continued to improve. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended March 10, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%. Monster sales increased 12% and our market share increased 0.1 points to 24.5%, while Red Bull sales increased 8% and it's market share decreased 1.1 points to 36%. 
Rockstar sales increased 43% and it's market share increased 3.7 points to 16.6%. We believe that Rockstar's numbers in this period in Canada was skewed due to the inclusion of sales of its Rockstar Recovery line this year, which were not in last year's numbers and as well as due to deep price promotions implemented by Rockstar in the first quarter of 2012.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended March 31, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada across all market channels grew 12.5%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 13.9%. Sales of Monster increased 17.4% and sales of Rockstar increased 20.2%.
According to Nielsen, sales of the energy drink category in Mexico, in March 2012, were 5.6% lower than in the same period last year. Monster's market share in Mexico, in March 2012, increased by 1.2 points to 35.7% over the same period last year, which includes Java Monster, compared to Red Bull's share at 36.7%, although sales of Monster in Mexico were 2.2% lower than last year versus sales of Red Bull, which were 22.9% lower. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 28.8% to $431.2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, from $334.7 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 35.4% from $110.1 million to $149.1 million. 
Net sales for the company's warehouse segment increased 8% to $23.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, compared with $21.7 million for the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased $2.2 million this quarter versus a loss of $0.3 million for the same quarter last year.
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 5% in 2011. Gross sales through club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, the same as in 2011. Gross sales to full-service distributors represents 65% of sales, also the same as in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 19% from 18% in the same period of 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as 2011.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2012 amounted to $100.6 million compared to $72.8 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales were sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 53.3% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. Western Europe continues to operate profitably and operating income improved over the same period last year. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Poland in the first quarter of 2012, and retail sales of Monster Energy commenced in Hong Kong and Macau in April 2012 and in Japan and Ecuador earlier this week. 
We are planning to launch Monster in Chile, Peru, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan, as well as additional countries overseas later in 2012 and in Argentina early in 2013. We're also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. 
Our planned launch of Monster in Korea in April was delayed due to product approval issues, which we are addressing. We believe that these issues will be resolved shortly and we will be able to proceed with the launch of Monster in Korea, early in the second half of 2012. 
Sales of Peace Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas, continue to meet and, indeed, exceed our expectations. In the first quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 86.4% over the same period in 2011. We recently launched 3 new line extensions, namely, Cranberry Iced Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Sweet Tea to replace certain SKUs that were soft. 
We are continuing to build distribution and sales for Worx Energy. 
Gross profit margins achieved in the first quarter of 2012 were 53.1% versus 52.1% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to increased operating efficiencies, product mix and the decrease in certain product costs. Gross margins achieved for international sales, other than those sold from the United States, were lower in the first quarter of 2012 than in the comparable quarter in 2011. 
Although we have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012 and a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar, we did experience some increases in raw material cost in the first quarter of 2012 and expect to continue to experience limited increases during the remainder of the year. However, we do not believe that if current levels increases in cost of raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. 
Distribution expense as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter were slightly higher than the same period in 2011. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 12.3% from 13.7% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising, primarily for Worx, and commissions, which was partially offset by increases in sponsorships, the cost of premiums and GDMs in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. 
As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and South America, particularly, through trade development programs to support our distribution partners' respective sales forces, to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and training development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs.
General and administrative expenses, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and, in particular, increased cost of stock-based compensation. 
As previously reported, we are continuing to hold discussions with our distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chains in various countries between us. We believe that successful discussions combined with reduced operating cost per case should enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012, in Central and Eastern Europe. However, we have to date not been able to arrive at an acceptable agreement with this distribution partner. 
Beginning the 2012 second quarter, we have managed to reduce certain operating costs in Australia and have limited our spend on commercial costs with our Australian distributor. As a result, we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012 and beyond.
Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $4.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and South America, as compared to $3.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in which was attributable to Australia, Eastern Europe and our expansion markets. 
Our effective tax rate in the 2012 first quarter was 39.9% compared with 38% in the 2011 first quarter. The increase in the 2012 first quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of establishing a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary during the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, and tax rate differences between the different jurisdictions on certain intercompany charges. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $391.4 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $419.6 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprise the entirety of auction rate securities decreased from $23.2 million at December 31, 2011 to $21.9 million. Trade accounts receivables are now presented on a gross basis as our promotional allowances owed to those customers, that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. 
We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $255.7 million from $218.1 million at December 31, 2011. 
Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 44.8 days at March 31, 2012 and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011 compared to 48.4 days at March 31, 2011. 
As sales outside United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. 
Inventories increased to $179.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 75.5 days at March 31, 2012, which is higher than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. 
At March 31, 2012, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $29.1 million, $44.8 million at December 31, 2011 with an amortized cost basis of $21.9 million. 
Gross sales in April 2012 were approximately 39% higher than in April 2011. This includes opening shipments, through established inventory, in Japan. Excluding Japan, sales are approximately 53% above last year. We're encouraged by the continuing a strong sales that have been experienced by the company. 
We caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week for which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
During the 2012 first quarter, the company did not repurchase any of its shares. I'd like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

There is -- we're producing the products here so there's a long lead time to produce and ship it and have it examined, and checked and inspected and they're very, very -- it's a very pedantic, very slow exercise. So there was a large opening order placed in order to ensure that sufficient inventory was on hand in Japan and available, with back-up inventory, et cetera. The other thing is that, in Japan, they are very efficient. Literally we sold, yesterday, for the first day, and we literally have 90% distribution in almost all of the convenience chains there, literally within the first day. That's something that, in the most efficient markets otherwise, we don't achieve in even 6 months. And so they really had a large opening inventory.

So the market here is a -- not a large market, but it is a nice market and we believe that it's capable of growing into a large market. And obviously we are excited about the Japanese market and the launch.

They have a very significant percentage share of the market and, again, by just doing a promotion whether it's Red Bull or us, in OXXO really skews that market, literally can push it up or down. And they did have some tax issues. They introduce a tax on energy drinks that have a little bit of a dampening effect as to how you deal with it, we sort of reformulated our product and that was last year and we sort of did see sort of a reasonably good increase in our sales. So this was just -- the category is just sort of it's been up and down like this in the last few months.

Apples and pears, in other parts of the world, with a whole different buying philosophy, and a different sortie [ph]. The category at the moment is thought to be about 2.5 million cases, maybe a little bigger, maybe 3 million cases, and it has been growing. But that's what I would define as the Western or modern energy category. There has always been an energy type category in Japan, a traditional energy, for many, many decades. They're usually little vials, 2.5 ounces, small glass bottles or other containers, flat containers and that's been around for a long time. That category is probably as big as a 50 million case category. The question is how long will it take for the Japanese consumer to be partially converted from traditional energy to modern energy, and then how many new consumers, who are not in the traditional energy category. Now can you actually -- by having different products, different flavors, we believe that will help stimulate attention to the category and bring in new consumers in Japan. And then there is a big market and we believe that can grow but we're in the area of guessing at the moment because we -- we only have those facts, roughly but we think that there is a lot of potential but it's going to take time to grow into that potential and then see what we can do. But those are the 2 sources we would hope to draw from in order to increase the base energy category and we hope to obviously then participate in that quite -- at a high sort of share. So we're hopeful for it, but if we really don't have statistics that I can give you that are reliable. It's absolutely different to Canada and Mexico. Just the -- those markets are very much closer to the U.S. there. The beverage consumption patterns are closer to the U.S. whereas in Japan, I think is a much more traditional and a very different market."

The beverage industry generally appears to have improved in the first quarter of 2012, as evidenced by the positive results recently reported on by the major beverage companies. The consensus appears to be that the macroeconomic environment in the United States is improving, which is consistent with our experience in the first quarter. 
We are pleased to report yet again another record first quarter with gross sales up 26.9% to $517.3 million. Net sales up 27.5% to $454.6 million and operating income up 42.8% to $126.3 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 39.7% from $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2011 to $0.41 per share. 
According to the Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased 17.6% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 26.2% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 20%, sales of Rockstar increased by 17.2% and sales of 5-Hour increased by 6.9%. Sales of Amp decreased 0.1 of a percent. Sales of NOS increased 10.2% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle decreased 0.9%. 
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 4 weeks ended April 21, 2012, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 19% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 24.9% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 23.1% over last year. Rockstar was up 14.2% while 5-Hour was up 10%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended April 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.4 points over a year ago to 30.5% against Red Bull's share of 32.4%, Rockstar's share of 9.4% and 5-Hour's share of 10.7%.
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended April 21, 2012 for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, increased 22.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was up 23% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 27.2%. Sales of our new non-carbonated Monster Rehab tea + energy line, the first SKU of which was launched back in the first quarter of 2011, continues to accelerate. 
In the first quarter of 2012, we launched our first SKU in the Monster Rehab line namely tea + orangeade + energy, as well as our Übermonster energy drinks in glass bottles. 
Monster's market share and sales in Canada continued to improve. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended March 10, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%. Monster sales increased 12% and our market share increased 0.1 points to 24.5%, while Red Bull sales increased 8% and its market share decreased 1.1 points to 36%. 
Rockstar sales increased 43% and its market share increased 3.7 points to 16.6%. We believe that Rockstar's numbers in this period in Canada was skewed due to the inclusion of sales of its Rockstar Recovery line this year, which were not in last year's numbers and as well as due to deep price promotions implemented by Rockstar in the first quarter of 2012.
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended March 31, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada across all market channels grew 12.5%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 13.9%. Sales of Monster increased 17.4% and sales of Rockstar increased 20.2%.
According to Nielsen, sales of the energy drink category in Mexico, in March 2012, were 5.6% lower than in the same period last year. Monster's market share in Mexico, in March 2012, increased by 1.2 points to 35.7% over the same period last year, which includes Java Monster, compared to Red Bull's share at 36.7%, although sales of Monster in Mexico were 2.2% lower than last year versus sales of Red Bull, which were 22.9% lower. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 28.8% to $431.2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, from $334.7 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 35.4% from $110.1 million to $149.1 million. 
Net sales for the company's warehouse segment increased 8% to $23.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, compared with $21.7 million for the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased $2.2 million this quarter versus a loss of $0.3 million for the same quarter last year.
For the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 5% in 2011. Gross sales through club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, the same as in 2011. Gross sales to full-service distributors represents 65% of sales, also the same as in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 19% from 18% in the same period of 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as 2011.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the first quarter of 2012 amounted to $100.6 million compared to $72.8 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales were sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 53.3% higher than in the same period last year. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. Western Europe continues to operate profitably and operating income improved over the same period last year. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Poland in the first quarter of 2012, and retail sales of Monster Energy commenced in Hong Kong and Macau in April 2012 and in Japan and Ecuador earlier this week. 
We are planning to launch Monster in Chile, Peru, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan, as well as additional countries overseas later in 2012 and in Argentina early in 2013. We're also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. 
Our planned launch of Monster in Korea in April was delayed due to product approval issues, which we are addressing. We believe that these issues will be resolved shortly and we will be able to proceed with the launch of Monster in Korea, early in the second half of 2012. 
Sales of Peace Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas, continue to meet and, indeed, exceed our expectations. In the first quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 86.4% over the same period in 2011. We recently launched 3 new line extensions, namely, Cranberry Iced Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Sweet Tea to replace certain SKUs that were soft. 
We are continuing to build distribution and sales for Worx Energy. 
Gross profit margins achieved in the first quarter of 2012 were 53.1% versus 52.1% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to increased operating efficiencies, product mix and the decrease in certain product costs. Gross margins achieved for international sales, other than those sold from the United States, were lower in the first quarter of 2012 than in the comparable quarter in 2011. 
Although we have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012 and a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar, we did experience some increases in raw material cost in the first quarter of 2012 and expect to continue to experience limited increases during the remainder of the year. However, we do not believe that if current levels increases in cost of raw materials will have a material negative effect on our margins. 
Distribution expense as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter were slightly higher than the same period in 2011. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 12.3% from 13.7% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising, primarily for Worx, and commissions, which was partially offset by increases in sponsorships, the cost of premiums and GDMs in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. 
As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and South America, particularly, through trade development programs to support our distribution partners' respective sales forces, to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and training development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs.
General and administrative expenses, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and, in particular, increased cost of stock-based compensation. 
As previously reported, we are continuing to hold discussions with our distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chains in various countries between us. We believe that successful discussions combined with reduced operating cost per case should enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012, in Central and Eastern Europe. However, we have to date not been able to arrive at an acceptable agreement with this distribution partner. 
Beginning the 2012 second quarter, we have managed to reduce certain operating costs in Australia and have limited our spend on commercial costs with our Australian distributor. As a result, we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012 and beyond.
Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $4.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and South America, as compared to $3.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in which was attributable to Australia, Eastern Europe and our expansion markets. 
Our effective tax rate in the 2012 first quarter was 39.9% compared with 38% in the 2011 first quarter. The increase in the 2012 first quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of establishing a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary during the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, and tax rate differences between the different jurisdictions on certain intercompany charges. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $391.4 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $419.6 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprise the entirety of auction rate securities decreased from $23.2 million at December 31, 2011 to $21.9 million. Trade accounts receivables are now presented on a gross basis as our promotional allowances owed to those customers, that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. 
We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $255.7 million from $218.1 million at December 31, 2011. 
Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 44.8 days at March 31, 2012 and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011 compared to 48.4 days at March 31, 2011. 
As sales outside United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. 
Inventories increased to $179.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 75.5 days at March 31, 2012, which is higher than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. 
At March 31, 2012, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $29.1 million, $44.8 million at December 31, 2011 with an amortized cost basis of $21.9 million. 
Gross sales in April 2012 were approximately 39% higher than in April 2011. This includes opening shipments, through established inventory, in Japan. Excluding Japan, sales are approximately 53% above last year. We're encouraged by the continuing a strong sales that have been experienced by the company. 
We caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week for which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
During the 2012 first quarter, the company did not repurchase any of its shares. I'd like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

There is -- we're producing the products here so there's a long lead time to produce and ship it and have it examined, and checked and inspected and they're very, very -- it's a very pedantic, very slow exercise. So there was a large opening order placed in order to ensure that sufficient inventory was on hand in Japan and available, with back-up inventory, et cetera. The other thing is that, in Japan, they are very efficient. Literally we sold, yesterday, for the first day, and we literally have 90% distribution in almost all of the convenience chains there, literally within the first day. That's something that, in the most efficient markets otherwise, we don't achieve in even 6 months. And so they really had a large opening inventory. Obviously, so the issue is how far till it'll turn to repeat orders and go forward. So the market here is a -- not a large market, but it is a nice market and we believe that it's capable of growing into a large market. And obviously we are excited about the Japanese market and the launch.

The market is very largely influenced by the OXXO chain. They have a very significant percentage share of the market and, again, by just doing a promotion whether it's Red Bull or us, in OXXO really skews that market, literally can push it up or down. And they did have some tax issues. They introduce a tax on energy drinks that have a little bit of a dampening effect as to how you deal with it, we sort of reformulated our product and that was last year and we sort of did see sort of a reasonably good increase in our sales. So this was just -- the category is just sort of it's been up and down like this in the last few months.

The category at the moment is thought to be about 2.5 million cases, maybe a little bigger, maybe 3 million cases, and it has been growing. But that's what I would define as the Western or modern energy category. There has always been an energy type category in Japan, a traditional energy, for many, many decades. They're usually little vials, 2.5 ounces, small glass bottles or other containers, flat containers and that's been around for a long time. That category is probably as big as a 50 million case category. The question is how long will it take for the Japanese consumer to be partially converted from traditional energy to modern energy, and then how many new consumers, who are not in the traditional energy category. Now can you actually -- by having different products, different flavors, we believe that will help stimulate attention to the category and bring in new consumers in Japan. And then there is a big market and we believe that can grow but we're in the area of guessing at the moment because we -- we only have those facts, roughly but we think that there is a lot of potential but it's going to take time to grow into that potential and then see what we can do. But those are the 2 sources we would hope to draw from in order to increase the base energy category and we hope to obviously then participate in that quite -- at a high sort of share. So we're hopeful for it, but if we really don't have statistics that I can give you that are reliable. It's absolutely different to Canada and Mexico. Just the -- those markets are very much closer to the U.S. there.

While the beverage industry, in general, experienced softness in second quarter sales, volumes in North America and Europe, the energy category in our principal markets in the United States grew in the high teens into second quarter, slightly lower than the gross rates of the energy category in the United States in the first quarter. 
Overall, the company had a good second quarter with record gross sales up 28.7% to $678.9 million. Net sales up 28.2% to $592.6 million and operating income up 28.1% to $169.8 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 31% from $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2011 to $0.59 per share. 
recently commenced reporting sales information for the United States market based on an expanded sample of outlets, which now includes Walmart; dollar stores, such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's; stores, excluding Costco. On this call, and in the future when we discuss the Nielsen reports for the United States for all outlets combined, the reports information contained therein will be based on this expanded sample. This will not affect the reports and information covering sales in the convenience and gas channel, the grocery and for drug channel which may from time to time be referred to individually. As this will be the first time that we referred to report based on the expanded sample, we will provide figures on both basis. 
According to Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through July 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, in the convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers on the expanded basis I just described, including Wal-Mart, Dollars Stores, stores and club stores, excluding Costco, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased 16.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 24.9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 19.3%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 7.2%, and sales of increased by 4.2%. Sales of put down 2.4%, increased 13.8% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle increased 6.5%. 
For comparative purposes according to the Nielsen reports, for the 13-week through July 21, 2012, on the previously reported basis for all outlets combined, namely convenience grocery, drug and mass merchandiser, excluding Walmart, sales in excluding Wal-Mart sales in dollars in the energy drink category including Shots increased 16.4% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 23.6% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 19.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 7.6% and sales of 5 hour increased by 6.2%. Sales of NOS down 2.2% and increased 13.2% off a low base in Full Throttle increased 6%. 
According to Nielsen reports for the full weeks ended July 21, 2012, sales of energy drink in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 12.5% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 20.2% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.2% over the comparable period last year. Rockstar was up 5.9%, while 5-Hour was up 0.7%. 
According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended July 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2 points over the comparable period a year ago to 31.5% against Red Bull shares of 34.5. Rockstar's share of 8.9 and 5-Hour share was 11.5%. 
According to Nielsen in the 13 weeks ended July 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased to 21.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 20.2% higher than in the comparable period last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 20.9%. Sales of our noncarbonated Monster Rehab tea + energy line according to Nielsen for the 13 weeks ended July 21, 2012, represented approximately 13% of the sales of all beverages sold in the convenience and U.S. channel. 
According to Nielsen in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended June 30, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%, Monster sales increased 11% and our market share was at 24.9% versus the comparable period last year. While Red Bull sales increased 7%, its market share decreased 1.3 points to 36.6. Rockstar sales increased 47% and its market share increased 3.9 points to 16%. Rockstar's numbers continue to be skewed by the inclusion of sales of its Rockstar Recovery line this year, which is already last year's number period, as well as continued ongoing deep price promotions implemented by Rockstar in 2012. 
According to Nielsen, the 4 weeks ended June 30, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 8% over this period. Sales of Red Bull increased 9% and Monster increased 9% while sales of Rockstar increased 14%. We believe that the Nielsen reports for sales of energy drink category including sales of Monster in Mexico are incomplete and are also inconsistent with our own sales of Monster to our distributor in Mexico in 2012. 
Sales of Monster through our distributor in México in the second quarter of 2012 were 45.6% higher than in the comparable period last year. And for the 6 months to June 30, 2012, were 32% higher year. Once we are satisfied in the Nielsen reports for Mexico are reliable and complete, we will resume reporting that information to you. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 13.1% to $568 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, from $436.7 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 30.1% from $150.5 million to $195.8 million. 
Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 3.4% to $24.6 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, compared with $25.5 million for the same period in 2011. The contribution margin increased 15.5% to $1.6 million in this quarter versus $1.4 million for the same period last year. 
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies, in which we conducted international business. We estimate that our net sales for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, were positively impacted by approximately 1% due to initial inventory purchase by distributor in Japan for the launch of the Monster energy brand to Japan during the second quarter of 2012. 
For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, down from 10% in the comparable period in 2011. 
Gross sales to full-service distributors represents 62% of sales, down from 64% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 19% in the same period in 2011. 
Other sales were 2% for the period compared to 3% in the comparable period in 2011. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the second quarter of 2012 amounted to $153.4 million compared to $102.6 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2012 in dollars were 51.6% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, net sales would've been 65.4% higher. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. Our European, Middle East and Africa and operations overall are now operating profitably, although the central and Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses. 
We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau and Slovenia in the second quarter of 2012. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in Chile, Peru, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan and divisional countries overseas later in 2012 and in Argentina early in 2013. We're also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. Our planned launch of Monster in Korea continues to be delayed due to product approval and legal issues, which have been ongoing and which we are continuing to address. Although the resolution of such issues is taking longer than we had initially anticipated, we believe that they will be resolved, and we are continuing with preparations for the launch of Monster in Korea in due course. 
Sales in Japan in the second quarter exceeded our expectations. Sales of Peace Tea ready to drink iced teas continue to meet and indeed exceed our expectations. In the second quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 62.3% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the second half of 2012. We are continuing to market but synergy. 
Gross profit margins achieved in the second quarter of 2012 were 51.8% versus 52.8% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales, production variances and product damages primarily in connection with Japan and Korea. 
Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were, in fact, slightly higher than in the comparable quarter in the prior year. Although, we had already covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012 as well as Apple juice and sugar, we increased Consequently, we do not believe that current levels any increases in the cost of raw materials will have a material effect on our margins for the remainder of 2012. 
Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter were comparable with the same period in 2011. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.6% from 12.9% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising primarily for works and point-of-sale and was partially offset by increases in sponsorships, trade development programs and the cost of merchandisers in the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, particularly through trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' respective sales forces and to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. 
General and administrative expenses increased 33.5% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and in particular, increased stock-based compensation expense, which was $7.1 million for the quarter compared to $4.1 million last year and $13.6 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012 compared to $7.9 million for the 6 months period last year. As previously reported, we are continuing to hold discussions with our distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chains in various countries between us. We have moved closer towards arriving at an agreement in this regard. While we are in the process of reducing our operating and promotional costs in Australia, certain promotional costs previously committed, and we expect that the effect of such will not start to result until the third quarter. We continue to will be able to achieve improved results in Australia in the second half of the year, although following such major will Australia during the second quarter of 2012. 
Brazil in the quarter, primarily due to delays incurred in obtaining customs of certain ingredients needed to produce our products and issues with our distributor, which we are addressing. 
For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.6 million from our operations in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and South America and Asia. This figure was, however, lower than the $5.8 million losses incurred for the same period last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the 2012 second quarter was 35.3% compared to 36.5% in the 2011 second quarter. The decrease in the 2012 second quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of an IRS order for earlier periods. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $419.2 million compared to $339.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $451.1 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased from $23 million -- $22.2 million at December 31, 2011, to $20.9 million. 
Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 40.7 days at June 30, 2012, and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 43.3 days at June 30 2011. Despite such reduction, as sales outside the United States continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, we expect that days outstanding for receivables will increase due to the different terms generally to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. Inventories increased to $199.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 62.7 days at June 30, 2012, which was lower than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. At June 30, 2012, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $28.3 million, was $44.8 million at December 31, 2011, with an amortized cost basis of $20.9 million. 
During the 2012 second quarter, the company did not repurchase any of its shares. Gross sales in July 2012 were approximately 5.3% higher than in July 2011. We are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company in North America, Western Europe and Japan. We caution again sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to, or regarded as indicative of, results for the full quarter or any future period. I'd like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

We just had general production issues. We also had some issues regarding just, which haven't been attributable to suppliers, but basically just shipping damages during shipping, leakage had seconder damages. So does the numbers of issues and challenges in the product in going into Japan where we launched, but we had some high product costs, and those are the things we're obviously winning and addressing. And what we have experienced that obviously the tolerance of the Japanese distributors and retailers is at a very different level to the U.S. And we did appreciate but they mean every expected one by one and if you have 3 cans which have leakers, out of the 1 million cans in America the local stores away. I mean, investigation of 200 people involved from all over the world and not trying to get to very, very analytical and very precise. And that has just caused some issues and that is one of the larger issues for that slight drop in the gross margins variance. If you look at the 6-month number, that difference is very much smaller. And then in the case of Korea, there was some issues where we had produced products and sent them to Korea, and we believe actually analyzed and corrected because they believed one of the energy drink around the world not in Korea. We took it out reported they came back to receive a what some ingredient We said it's not possible we took it out. We actually had done in the U.S. and as well as in Korea. We established without any doubt that there wasn't any of that ingredient. But the issue is it disrupted everything for 6 months. And so you had product damages and product ship to Korea and some of the concept back and some has been stored so the number of these issues one of the issues we had obviously also anticipated commencing selling in Korea and the revenues from that anticipated launch were also obviously not realized in the quarter. By those were the main issues regarding product and product damages and issues relating to production."

So what explains the deceleration in June? Was it comparison -- I mean what else is there, and can you talk a bit about how you think about the July number rebounding?"

We think some of that ongoing there will be some And then ultimately the idea is obviously for us, the intention is to produce locally, which will change that whole business model. But geographic mix, with the main portion. The damage cost that we've talked about, there was also some of it was reclassification of certain commissions, because some of our distributors as we're paying some commissions to, for example, Anheuser-Busch once they take over ownership of particular branch, they then become our customer. That particular commission is then basically instead of being below the line, deduction really goes into lowering cost of gross sales to net. So those things all had an impact on that 1% change in the gross profit. But many of them are not -- we hope, we don't think there will be ongoing and they will be rectified as we go forward will be sort of normalize more. Then with regard to other part of your question, I think there was a deceleration but a lot of that again is a single month. The work depends on the day, in which Fourth of July fell in selling to the Fourth of July I think I day shorter in the month. And what like that but there has been a little deceleration in the category. But the numbers are still very healthy as you can see from the numbers that we just discussed."

They are very conscious of any damage issues or defect issues and they look for simply don't have the same level of tolerance as we normally have, and we conduct business in the United States. But that being said, there's a learning curve both for us, and our hackers and how to ship products and how to make sure that it gets there less damage and how to, in certain cases, to use certain Packers who are little more precise in the way they actually pack the product and their measurements. But there are a number of things that happen at the same time. Some of them where actual can issues as opposed issues shipping issues. We believe that it will go down as we continue to get an going down already as we get more experience and as we fine-tune our ability to trade in those areas. The Korea issues was just not a remaking of generally our production as much. It was some issues just with labeling issues in Korea because through basically a new category that the category opened for energy drinks that contain Taurine and normal ingredients and sort of even dear we have to have a different source you can't use regular caffeine. And so we're sort of even officials to what the regulations are, and how they categorize our products and categorize different products. And so that's been stop/start and that was the experience of some of the competitive product been launched manufactured in the country have also got in and then ended up being taken off the shelves and having to be reimported and remanufactured. The big problem there was weeks ended up with another analysis of that was in our wasn't there. Established that absolutely conclusively. But takes a lot of time, and so we sort of re-gearing this product that's been sitting on the rep basis for months and having to reinspect and there whatever certain cost and pretty much those are the issues that we are going through at the moment. Again once we get going in Korea were don't believe that these problems will be ongoing slowly starting to get different SKUs approved now through the authorities now retesting them and agreeing that they don't contain any ingredients that shouldn't be in there, and so we all starting to reship and starting to reprepare for our launch in Korea. So we believe it will settle down but there has been really issues challenges we have actually faced in this quarter. But the market, their receptions I'll just add to the sales to Japan have really been very, very positive and that is -- that trend is continuing."

What we are trying to achieve, and we are having some issues about trying to find the right size cans and the right production plants, but once we get that we can overcome that plant to produce in Korea and in Japan as much of our requirements there as possible. And that will remove a lot of these issues. So that's not really a change. It's a question -- it's timing. We'll get there.

But like everything else this is a young and evolving category. And so some of the growth rates are you see spikes in it, you see some drop but generally the growth rates we're seeing in the Kerry over the past 12 to 15 months are much higher than the growth rates we saw probably the previous 15 to 24 months. So the category is still growing well when you look at the volumes in North America in CSDs and other products, which are flat to negative, the product, the category is healthy and the brand is basically continuing to take share even though we really have a lot of share. So it continues to overrule for the company and the brand and this is our main markets, so we're very encouraged by that. As we've indicated that European markets are really starting to get to a sort of level where they're actually starting to really kick in at a much better pace. The sort of the acceleration of said we are seeing in the U.K. and Spain and even Germany now is really starting to show. And so we are pretty positive about our prospects going forward for those markets. And we are dealing with the operational issues and challenges we have. But in the long term, we are very, very encouraged by the fact that the Asian markets are very receptive to our brand, to the taste. So we again believe that it is a journey but there's a good and insight. And thank you for your support.

While the beverage industry, in general, experienced softness in second quarter sales, volumes in North America and Europe, the energy category in our principal markets in the United States grew in the high teens in the second quarter, slightly lower than the gross rates of the energy category in the United States in the first quarter. 
Overall, the company had a good second quarter with record gross sales up 28.7% to $678.9 million. Net sales up 28.2% to $592.6 million and operating income up 28.1% to $169.8 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 31% from $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2011 to $0.59 per share. 
We offered a [ph] recently commenced reporting sales information for the United States market based on an expanded sample of outlets, which now includes Walmart; dollar stores, such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's; get to [ph] military stores and club stores namely Sam's and BJ's, but excluding Costco. On this call and in the future, when we discuss the Nielsen reports for the United States for all outlets combined, the reports and information contained therein will be based on this expanded sample. This will not affect the reports and information covering sales in the convenience and gas channel, the grocery and the drug channels which may, from time to time, be referred to individually. As this will be the first time that we referred to reports based on the expanded sample, we will provide figures on both basis. 
According to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, in  the convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on an expanded basis I just described, including Wal-Mart, dollar stores, direct [ph] military stores and club stores, but excluding Costco, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased 16.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 24.9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 19.3%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 7.2%, and sales of 5-Hour increased by 4.2%. Sales of Amp put down 2.4%, NOS increased 13.8% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle increased 6.5%. 
For comparative purposes, according to the Nielsen reports, for the 13-week through July 21, 2012, on the previously reported basis for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Walmart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including Shots increased 16.4% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 23.6% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 19.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 7.6% and sales of 5-Hour increased by 6.2%. Sales of Amp put down 2.2%, NOS increased 13.2% off a low base, and sales of Full Throttle increased 6%. 
According to Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended July 21, 2012, sales of energy drink in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 12.5% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 20.2% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.2% over the comparable period last year. Rockstar was up 5.9%, while 5-Hour was up 0.7%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2 points over the comparable period a year ago to 31.1% against Red Bull's share of 34.5%. Rockstar's share of 8.9% and 5-Hour share was 11.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended July 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, increased to 21.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 20.2% higher than in the comparable period last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 20.9%. Sales of our noncarbonated Monster Rehab tea + energy line, according to Nielsen for the 13 weeks ended July 21, 2012, represented approximately 13% of the sales of all Monster beverages sold in the convenience and gas channel. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 30, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%, Monster sales increased 11% and our market share was at 24.9% versus the same as in the  comparable period last year. While Red Bull sales increased 7%, its market share decreased 1.3 points to 36.6. Rockstar sales increased 47% and its market share increased 3.9 points to 16%. Rockstar's numbers continue to be skewed by the inclusion of sales of its Rockstar Recovery line this year, which is already in last year's numbers, or fourth in a period, as well as continued ongoing deep price promotions implemented by Rockstar in 2012. 
According to Nielsen, the 4 weeks ended June 30, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 8%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 9% and Monster increased 9%, while sales of Rockstar increased 14%. We believe that the Nielsen reports for sales of energy drink category including sales of Monster in Mexico are incomplete and are also inconsistent with our own sales of Monster to our distributor in Mexico in 2012. 
Sales of Monster through our distributor in México in the second quarter of 2012 were 45.6% higher than in the comparable period last year. And for the 6 months to June 30, 2012, were 32% higher. Once we are satisfied that the Nielsen reports for Mexico are reliable and complete, we will resume reporting that information to you. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 13.1% to 600 -- sorry, $568 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, from $436.7 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 30.1% from $150.5 million to $195.8 million. 
Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 3.4% to $24.6 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, compared with $25.5 million for the same period in 2011. The contribution margin increased 15.5% to $1.6 million in this quarter versus $1.4 million for the same quarter last year. 
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain  of our  international business. We estimate that our net sales for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012 were positively impacted by approximately 1% due to initial inventory purchase by a distributor in Japan for the launch of the Monster energy brand to Japan during the second quarter of 2012. 
For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, down from 10% in the comparable period in 2011. 
Gross sales to full-service distributors represents 62% of sales, down from 64% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 19% in the same period in 2011. 
Other sales were 2% for the period compared to 3% in the comparable period in 2011. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the second quarter of 2012 amounted to $153.4 million compared to $102.6 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 51.6% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such net sales would've been 65.4% higher.  Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. Our European, Middle East and Africa and operations, overall, are now operating profitably, although the Central and Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses. 
We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau and Slovenia in the second quarter of 2012. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in Chile, Peru, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan as well additional countries overseas later in 2012 and in Argentina early in 2013. We're also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. Our planned launch of Monster in Korea continues to be delayed due to product approval and label issues, which have been ongoing and which we are continuing to address. Although the resolution of such issues is taking longer than we had initially anticipated, we believe that they will be resolved, and we are continuing with preparations for the launch of Monster in Korea in due course. 
Sales in Japan in the second quarter exceeded our expectations. Sales of Peace Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas continue to meet and indeed exceed our expectations. In the second quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 62.3% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the second half of 2012. We are continuing to sell in market Worx Energy. 
Gross profit margins achieved in the second quarter of 2012 were 51.8% versus 52.8% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales, production variances and product damages, primarily in connection with Japan and Korea. 
Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were, in fact, slightly higher than in the comparable quarter in the prior year. Although, we had already covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012 as well as apple juice and sugar, we increased the imports and covered. Consequently, we do not believe that as current levels, any increases in the cost of raw materials will have a material effect on our margins for the remainder of 2012. 
Distribution expenses, as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter, were comparable with the same period in 2011. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 11.6% from 12.9% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising which is primarily Worx, and point-of-sale, and was partially offset by increases in sponsorships, trade development programs and the cost of merchandise displays in the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, particularly through trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' respective sales forces and to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. 
General and administrative expenses increased 33.5% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and in particular, increased stock-based compensation expense, which was $7.1 million for the quarter compared to $4.1 million last year, and $13.6 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012 compared to $7.9 million for the 6 months period last year. As previously reported, we have continued to hold discussions with our distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chains in various countries between us. We have moved closer towards arriving at an agreement in this regard. While we are in the process of reducing our operating and promotional costs in Australia, certain promotional costs were previously committed, and we expect that the effect of such dip  will not start to result until the third quarter. We continue to hope that we will be able to achieve improved results in Australia in the second half of the year, although following such major sales will lower in Australia during the second quarter of 2012. 
Sales were also low in Brazil in the quarter, primarily due to delays incurred in obtaining customs clearance for certain ingredients needed to produce our products and issues with our distributor, which we are addressing. 
For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.6 million from our operations in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and South America and Asia. This figure was, however, lower than the $5.8 million losses incurred for the same period last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the 2012 second quarter was 35.3% compared to 36.5% in the 2011 second quarter. The decrease in the 2012 second quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of an IRS ordered for earlier periods. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $419.2 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $451.1 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprise entirely of auction rate securities decreased from $23 million -- $23.2 million at December 31, 2011, to $20.9 million. 
Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 40.7 days at June 30, 2012, and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 43.3 days at June 30 2011. Despite such reduction, as sales outside the United States continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, we expect that days outstanding for receivables will increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance of local practices in their respective countries.  
Inventories increased to $199.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 62.7 days at June 30, 2012, which was lower than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. At June 30, 2012, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $28.3 million, was $44.8 million at December 31, 2011, with an amortized cost basis of $20.9 million. 
During the 2012 second quarter, the company did not repurchase any of its shares. Gross sales in July 2012 were approximately 25.3% higher than in July 2011. 
We are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company in North America, Western Europe and Japan. We caution again sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to, or regarded as indicative of, results for the full quarter or any future period. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

We just had general, some production issues. We also had some issues regarding just, which haven't been attributable to suppliers, but basically, just shipping -- damages during shipping, leakage [indiscernible] had second redamages. So there's just been numbers of issues and challenges in the product in going into Japan where we launched, but we've had some high product costs. And those are the things we're obviously, learning and addressing. And with what we've experienced is that the obviously, the tolerance of the Japanese distributors and retailers is at a very different level to the U.S. And whilst we did appreciate when we went in, but I mean, literally every can is inspected one by one. And if you have 3 cans which have leakers, out of 1 million cans in America, the local stores throws them away. I mean, here, there is an investigation with 200 people involved from all over the world and trying to get to the bottom of that [ph] very, very analytical and very precise. And that has just caused some issues. And that is one of the large issues for the slight drop in the gross margins variance. If you look at the 6-month number, that difference is very much smaller. And then in the case of Korea, there was some issues where we had produced products and sent them to Korea, and we believe, they actually analyzed that incorrectly because they believe it was 1 of the ingredient -- we have an energy drink around the world, it's not permitted in Korea. We took it out, they reported they came back to say on a test they felt that they found this ingredient. We said it's not possible. We took it out. We actually had Mastech [ph] test done in the U.S. and as well as in Korea. We've established, without any doubt that there wasn't any of that ingredient in the product. But the issue is it disrupted everything for 6 months. And so, you've had product damages of product or shipped to Korea, and some of them got shipped back and some has been stored. So there'd be a number of these issues. I mean, 1 of the issues we had obviously, often anticipated, commencing selling in Korea and the revenues from that anticipated launch were also obviously not realized in the quarter. But those were the main issues regarding product and product damages and's issues relating to production."

I mean, the amount makes up a large portion of the 1% change in the mix, and that is the geographic mix is, there were high costs of shipping and inspection cost relating to Japan, so margins on the Japanese business that we launched were very much lower. We think some of those will be ongoing, there will be some [indiscernible]. And then ultimately, the idea is obviously for us, the intention is to produce locally, which will change that whole business model. But geographic mix, with the main portion. The damages and cost that we've talked about, there was also some allowance or some of it was reclassification of certain commissions because some of our distributors, as we're paying some commissions to, for example, Anheuser-Busch, once they take over ownership over a particular branch, they then become our customer. That particular commission is then, basically, instead of being below the line, deduction really goes into lowering gross sales to net. So those things have all had an impact on that 1% change in the gross profit. But many of them are not -- we hope, we don't think they will be ongoing and they will be rectified. As we go forward, will be more of sort of normalize more. Then, with regard to other part of your question, I think there was a deceleration, but a lot of that again, is a single month. It depends on the day in which -- the Fourth of July fell and then you're selling or to the Fourth of July, there is, I think, a day shorter in the month and measures like that. But there has been a little deceleration in the category. But the numbers are still very healthy as you can see from the numbers that we just discussed."

Right from our distributor partner, right through to the retail chains. They are very conscious of any damage issues or defect issues and they look [ph] simply don't have the same level of tolerance as we normally have when we conduct business in the United States. And but that being said, there's a learning curve both for us, and our canners and packers and how to ship products and how to make sure that it gets there less damaged, and how to, in certain cases, to use certain packers who are a little more precise in the way they actually pack the product and their measurements. But there were a number of things that happened at the same time. And some of them where actual can issues as opposed to production issues. Some were shipping issues. We believe that it will go down as we continue to get -- and this is going down already, as we get more experience in this and as we fine-tune our ability to trade in those areas. The Korea issues was just not a remaking of generally, our production as much. It was some issues just with labeling issues in Korea. We've been going through, basically, a new category, that the category only opened for energy drinks that contain Taurine and the normal ingredients. And sort of even dear we have to have a different source you can't use regular caffeine. And so we're sort of, even there, we have to have a different caffeine stores. You can't use regular caffeine. And so we're sort of -- even the official bureau [ph] us to what their regulations are, and how do they categorize our products and how do they categorize different products of ours. And so, that's been stop/start and that was the experience of some of the competitive product that have been launched there that aren't manufactured in the country, have also got in and then ended up being taken off the shelves and having to be reimported and remanufactured. The big problem there was we actually, unfortunately, ended up with an analysis of -- a mistaken analysis of something that was in our product that wasn't there. We established that with absolute inconclusively. But it takes a lot of time, and so we're sort of re-gearing now because we're dealing with a product that's been sitting on the dock [ph] and bases for months and with having to reinspect them there are leakers, so we're incurring certain costs and pretty much dealt with those are the issues that we are going through at the moment. Again once we get going in Korea we don't believe that these problems will be ongoing. We are slowly starting to get different SKUs approved now through the authorities that are now retesting them and agreeing that they don't contain any ingredients that shouldn't be in there. And so we all starting to reship and starting to reprepare for our launch in Korea. So we believe it will settle down. But that has been really the issues -- the challenges we have actually faced in this quarter. But the market -- the receptions,  if I could just add too, the sales in Japan have really been very, very positive and that is -- that trend is continuing."

In the case of Brazil, we had a small distributor, and they just have struggled to get the resources in line to basically take advantage of the market to the extent that we believe, we should be able to achieve, is our fair share. And so, we are addressing that issue and that is taking some time, because it's a big country, Brazil, and we obviously want to make sure that how do we address it with staff, with people, with a whole different ways. Obviously we're looking to that as being a potentially large market in the future, and we are still confident we will be able to achieve that. In the case of Korea, that's just really deferred revenue. We think Korea is an exciting market. We think it will be very positive for Monster. We think that our margins will be -- hopefully, we think will be a little better there than we already in Japan, where adjusting a lot of cost of goods shipping to Japan, inspecting products, before they get released has been very costly. And we were hoping that just as we continue to settle down, those costs will reduce. What we are trying to achieve, and we are having some issues about trying to find the right size cans and the right production plants, but once we get that, we can overcome that. Our plan is to produce in Korea and in Japan, as much of our requirements there as possible. And that will remove a lot of these issues. So that's not really a change. It's a question of -- it's timing. We'll get there. It's going to take a bit longer. But we will get that, the expansion plans into Europe, and everywhere else are ongoing alongside. And they're continuing as planned. And those are the major markets, particularly, the U.K., Spain, Germany, they're all doing very well."

Just in closing, I'd like to sort of just relate back to the numbers where, I know we've had some issues, or looking at the issues on the growth and the category. But often, I think we get a little bit spoiled and carried away by some of the increased growth numbers that happen from time to time. But like everything else, this is a young and evolving category. And so, some of the growth rates are -- you see spikes in it and you see some drop holes, but generally, the growth rates that we're seeing and the carry over, the past 12 to 15 months are much higher than the growth rates we saw probably the previous 15 to 24 months. So the category is still growing well. When you look at the volumes in North America in CSDs and other products, which are flat to negative, the product, the category is healthy and the brand is basically continuing to take share even though we really have a lot of share. So it continues to overwell for the company and the brand and this is our main markets, so we're very encouraged by that. As we've indicated, the European markets are really starting to get to a sort of level where they're actually starting to really kick in at a much better pace. The sort of the acceleration of sales we are seeing in the U.K. and Spain and even Germany now is really starting to show. And so we are pretty positive about our prospects going forward for those markets. And we are dealing with the operational issues and challenges we have. But in the long term, we are very, very encouraged by the fact that the Asian markets are very receptive to our brand, to the taste. So we again, believe that it is a journey but there's a good in game insight. And thank you for your support. And we are just going to continue to put our heads down and continue to hopefully, continue to deliver what we believe to be very good results as we head on in this quarter. Thank you very much."

While the beverage industry, in general, experienced softness in second quarter sales volumes in North America and Europe, the energy category in our principal markets in the United States grew in the high teens in the second quarter, slightly lower than the growth rate of the energy category in the United States in the first quarter. 
Overall, the company had a good second quarter with record gross sales up 28.7% to $678.9 million. Net sales up 28.2% to $592.6 million and operating income up 28.1% to $169.8 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 31% from $0.45 per share in the second quarter of 2011 to $0.59 per share. 
We also recently commenced reporting sales information for the United States market based on an expanded sample of outlets, which now includes Walmart; dollar stores, such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's; DeCA military stores and club stores namely Sam's and BJ's, but excluding Costco. On this call and in the future, when we discuss the Nielsen reports for the United States for all outlets combined, the reports and information contained therein will be based on this expanded sample. This will not affect the reports and information covering sales in the convenience and gas channel, the grocery and or drug channels which may, from time to time, be referred to individually. As this will be the first time that we referred to reports based on the expanded sample, we will provide figures on both basis. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on an expanded basis I just described, including Wal-Mart, dollar stores, DeCA military stores and club stores, but excluding Costco, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased 16.5% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 24.9% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 19.3%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 7.2%, and sales of 5-Hour increased by 4.2%. Sales of Amp put down 2.4%, NOS increased 13.8% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle increased 6.5%. 
For comparative purposes, according to the Nielsen reports, for the 13-week through July 21, 2012, on the previously reported basis for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Walmart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased 16.4% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 23.6% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 19.8%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 7.6% and sales of 5-Hour increased by 6.2%. Sales of Amp were down 2.2%, NOS increased 13.2% off a low base, and sales of Full Throttle increased 6%. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended July 21, 2012, sales of energy drink in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 12.5% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 20.2% over the comparable period last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.2% over the comparable period last year. Rockstar was up 5.9%, while 5-Hour was up 0.7%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2 points over the comparable period a year ago to 31.1% against Red Bull's share of 34.5%. Rockstar's share of 8.9% and 5-Hour share was 11.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended July 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks, in dollars, increased to 21.7% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 20.2% higher than in the comparable period last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 20.9%. Sales of our noncarbonated Monster Rehab tea plus energy line, according to Nielsen for the 13 weeks ended July 21, 2012, represented approximately 13% of the sales of all Monster beverages sold in the convenience and gas channel. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 30, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%, Monster sales increased 11% and our market share was at 24.9% versus the same as in the  comparable period last year. While Red Bull sales increased 7%, its market share decreased 1.3 points to 36.6%. Rockstar sales increased 47% and its market share increased 3.9 points to 16%. Rockstar's numbers continue to be skewed by the inclusion of sales of its Rockstar Recovery line this year, which is already in last year's numbers, or fourth in a period, as well as continued ongoing deep price promotions implemented by Rockstar in 2012. 
According to Nielsen, the 4 weeks ended June 30, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 8%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 9% and Monster increased 9%, while sales of Rockstar increased 14%. We believe that the Nielsen reports for sales of energy drink category including sales of Monster in Mexico are incomplete and are also inconsistent with our own sales of Monster to our distributor in Mexico in 2012. 
Sales of Monster through our distributor in México in the second quarter of 2012 were 45.6% higher than in the comparable period last year. And for the 6 months to June 30, 2012, were 32% higher. Once we are satisfied that the Nielsen reports for Mexico are reliable and complete, we will resume reporting that information to you. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 30.1% to 600 -- sorry, $568 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, from $436.7 million in the same period in 2011. And contribution margin increased 30.1% from $150.5 million to $195.8 million. 
Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 3.4% to $24.6 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, compared with $25.5 million for the same period in 2011. The contribution margin increased 15.5% to $1.6 million in this quarter versus $1.4 million for the same quarter last year. 
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies in which we conduct certain  of our  international business. We estimate that our net sales for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012 were positively impacted by approximately 1% due to initial inventory purchase by a distributor in Japan for the launch of the Monster energy brand in Japan during the second quarter of 2012. 
For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, gross sales to retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 9% of sales, down from 10% in the comparable period in 2011. 
Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, down from 64% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 19% in the same period in 2011. 
Other sales were 2% for the period compared to 3% in the comparable period in 2011. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the second quarter of 2012 amounted to $153.4 million compared to $102.6 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the second quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 51.6% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such net sales would've been 65.4% higher.  Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. Our European, Middle East and Africa operations, overall, are now operating profitably, although the Central and Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses. 
We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau and Slovenia in the second quarter of 2012. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in Chile, Peru, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan as well additional countries overseas later in 2012 and in Argentina early in 2013. We're also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe later this year. Our planned launch of Monster in Korea continues to be delayed due to product approval and label issues, which have been ongoing and which we are continuing to address. Although the resolution of such issues is taking longer than we had initially anticipated, we believe that they will be resolved, and we are continuing with preparations for the launch of Monster in Korea in due course. 
Sales in Japan in the second quarter exceeded our expectations. Sales of Peace Tea, ready-to-drink iced teas continue to meet and indeed exceed our expectations. In the second quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 62.3% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the second half of 2012. We are continuing to sell in market Worx Energy. 
Gross profit margins achieved in the second quarter of 2012 were 51.8% versus 52.8% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales, production variances and product damages, primarily in connection with Japan and Korea. 
Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were, in fact, slightly higher than in the comparable quarter in the prior year. Although, we had already covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012 as well as apple juice and sugar, we increased the portion covered. Consequently, we do not believe that at current levels, any increases in the cost of raw materials will have a material effect on our margins for the remainder of 2012. 
Distribution expenses, as a percentage of net sales in the second quarter, were comparable with the same period in 2011. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 11.6% from 12.9% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising, which is primarily Worx, and point-of-sale, and was partially offset by increases in sponsorships, trade development programs and the cost of merchandise displays in the second quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, particularly through trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' respective sales forces and to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. 
General and administrative expenses increased 33.5% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses and in particular, increased stock-based compensation expense, which was $7.1 million for the quarter compared to $4.1 million last year, and $13.6 million for the 6 months ended June 30, 2012 compared to $7.9 million for the 6 months period last year. As previously reported, we have continued to hold discussions with our distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chains in various countries between us. We have moved closer towards arriving at an agreement in this regard. While we are in the process of reducing our operating and promotional costs in Australia, certain promotional costs were previously committed, and we expect that the effect of such dips will not start to result until the third quarter. We continue to hope that we will be able to achieve improved results in Australia in the second half of the year, although following such measures sales were lower in Australia during the second quarter of 2012. 
Sales were also low in Brazil in the quarter, primarily due to delays incurred in obtaining customs clearance for certain ingredients needed to produce our products and issues with our distributor, which we are addressing. 
For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.6 million from our operations in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and South America and Asia. This figure was, however, lower than the $5.8 million losses incurred for the same period last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the 2012 second quarter was 35.3% compared to 36.5% in the 2011 second quarter. The decrease in the 2012 second quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of an IRS audit for earlier periods. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $419.2 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. Short-term investments were $451.1 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities decreased  from $23 million -- $23.2 million at December 31, 2011, to $20.9 million. 
Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 40.7 days at June 30, 2012, and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 43.3 days at June 30 2011. Despite such reduction, as sales outside the United States continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, we expect that days outstanding for receivables will increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance of local practices in their respective countries.  
Inventories increased to $199.1 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 62.7 days at June 30, 2012, which was lower than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. At June 30, 2012, the company held auction-rate securities with a face value of $28.3 million, was $44.8 million at December 31, 2011, with an amortized cost basis of $20.9 million. 
During the 2012 second quarter, the company did not repurchase any of its shares. Gross sales in July 2012 were approximately 25.3% higher than in July 2011. 
We are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company in North America, Western Europe and Japan. We caution again sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall and the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to, or regarded as indicative of, results for the full quarter or any future period. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions. Thank you."

We have had different types of damage. There have some damages that are potentially reclaimable back from some of our can companies where you've had defects in cans. We've had some leakers, we've had some tab issues. We just had some general, some production issues. We also had some issues regarding just, which haven't been attributable to suppliers, but basically, just shipping -- damages during shipping, leakage which has had secondary damages. So there's just been numbers of issues and challenges in the product in going into Japan where we've launched, but we've had some high product costs. And those are the things we're obviously, learning and addressing. And with -- what we've experienced is that the obviously, the tolerance of the Japanese distributors and retailers is at a very different level to the U.S. And whilst we did appreciate that when we went in, but I mean, literally every can is inspected one by one. And if you have 3 cans which have leakers, out of 1 million cans in America, the local stores throws them away. I mean, here, there is an investigation with 200 people involved from all over the world in trying to get to the bottom of that -- very, very analytical and very precise. And that has just caused some issues. And that is one of the large issues for the slight drop in the gross margin variance. If you look at the 6-month numbers, that difference is very much smaller. And then in the case of Korea, there were some issues where we had produced products and sent in to Korea, and we believe they actually analyzed it incorrectly because they believed there was 1 of the ingredients -- we have in energy drink around the world, it's not permitted in Korea. We took it out. They reported -- they came back to say on a test they felt that they found this ingredient. We said it's not possible. We took it out. We actually had mass spec tests done in the U.S. and as well as in Korea. We've established, without any doubt that there wasn't any of that ingredient in the product. But the issue is it disrupted everything for 6 months. And so, you've had product damages because product got shipped to Korea, and some of them got shipped back and some has been stored. So there'd be a number of these issues. I mean, one of the issues we had obviously, often anticipated, commencing selling in Korea and the revenues from that anticipated launch were also obviously not realized in the quarter. But those were the main issues regarding product and product damages and's issues relating to production."

I mean, the amount makes up a large portion of the 1% change in the mix, and that is the geographic mix there's -- there were high costs of shipping and inspection cost relating to Japan, so our margins on the Japanese business that we launched were very much lower. We think some of those will be ongoing, there will be some recoupment. And then ultimately, the idea is obviously for us, the intention is to produce locally, which will change that whole business model. But geographic mix, with the main portion. The damages and costs that we've talked about, there was also some allowance or some of it was reclassification of certain commissions because some of our distributors, as we're paying some commissions to, for example, Anheuser-Busch, once they take over ownership of a particular branch, they then become our customer. That particular commission is then, basically, instead of being below the line, deduction really goes into lowering gross sales to net. So those things have all had an impact on that 1% change in the gross profit. But many of them are not -- we hope, we don't think they will be ongoing and they will be rectified. As we go forward, will be more of sort of normalized more. 
Then, with regard to other part of your question, I think there was a deceleration, but a lot of that again, is a single month. It depends on the day in which -- the Fourth of July fell and then you're selling or to the Fourth of July, there is, I think, a day shorter in the month and measures like that. But there has been a little deceleration in the category. But the numbers are still very healthy as you can see from the numbers that we just discussed."

Right from our distributor partner, right through to the retail chains. They are very conscious of any damage issues or defect issues and they literally simply do not have the same level of tolerance as we normally have when we conduct business in the United States. And but that being said, there's a learning curve both for us, and our canners and packers and how to ship products and how to make sure that it gets there less damaged, and how to, in certain cases, to use certain packers who are a little more precise in the way they actually pack the product and their measurements. But there were a number of things that happened at the same time. And some of them where in fact actual can issues as opposed to production issues. Some were shipping issues. We believe that it will go down as we continue to get -- and this is going down already, as we get more experience in this and as we fine tune our ability to trade in those areas. The Korea issues was just not a not of  a making of generally, of production as much. It was some issues just with labeling issues in Korea. We've been going through, basically, a new category, that the category only opened for energy drinks that contained taurine and the normal ingredients. And sort of even there we have to have a different source, you can't use regular caffeine. And so we're sort of, even the officials there  [indiscernible] as to what their regulations are, and how do they categorize our products and how do they categorize different products of ours. And so, that's been stop/start and that was the experience of some of the competitive products that have been launched there that aren't manufactured in the country, have also got in and then ended up being taken off the shelves and having to be reimported and remanufactured. The big problem there was we actually, unfortunately, ended up with an analysis of -- a mistaken analysis of something that was in our product that wasn't there. We established that with absolutely conclusively. But it takes a lot of time, and so we're sort of re-gearing now because we're dealing with a product that's been sitting on the docks there and places for months and with having to reinspect, and there are leakers, so we're incurring certain costs and pretty much dealt with those are the issues that we are going through at the moment. Again once we get going in Korea we don't believe that these problems will be ongoing. We are slowly starting to get different SKUs approved now through the authorities that are now retesting them and agreeing that they don't contain any ingredients that shouldn't be in there. And so we are starting to reship and starting to re-prepare for our launch in Korea. So we believe it will settle down. But those have been really the issues -- the challenges we have actually faced in this quarter. But the market -- the receptions, if I could just add too, the sales in Japan have really been very, very positive and that is -- that trend is continuing."

In the case of Brazil, we have a small distributor, and they just have struggled to get the resources in line to basically take advantage of the market to the extent that we believe we should be able to achieve as our fair share. And so, we are addressing that issue and that is taking some time, because it's a big country, Brazil, and we obviously want to make sure that however we address it with staff, with people, with a whole different ways. Obviously we're looking to that as being a potentially large market in the future, and we are still confident we will be able to achieve that. In the case of Korea, that's just really got deferred revenue. We think Korea is an exciting market. We think it will be very positive for Monster. We think that our margins will be -- hopefully, we think will be a little better there than we are in Japan, where it's just been a lot of cost of goods shipping to Japan, inspecting products, before they get released has been very costly. And we were hoping that just as we continue to settle down, those costs will reduce. What we are all trying to achieve, and we are having some issues about trying to find the right size cans and the right production plants, but once we get that, we can overcome that. Our plan is to produce in Korea and in Japan, as much of our requirements there as possible. And that will remove a lot of these issues. So that's not really a change. It's a question of -- it's timing, we'll get there. It's going to take a bit longer. But we will get there. The expansion plans into Europe, and everywhere else are ongoing along fine and they're continuing as planned. And those are the major markets, particularly, the U.K., Spain, Germany, they're all doing very well."

Just in closing, I'd like to sort of just relate back to the numbers where, I know we've had some issues, or looking at the issues on the growth and the category. But often, I think we get a little bit spoiled and carried away by some of the increased growth numbers that happen from time to time. But like everything else, this is a young and evolving category. And so, some of the growth rates are -- you see spikes in it and you see some drop-offs, but generally, the growth rates that we're seeing and the carry over, the past 12 to 15 months are much higher than the growth rates we saw probably the previous 15 to 24 months. So the category is still growing well. When you look at the volumes in North America in CSDs and other products, which are flat to negative, the product, the category is healthy and the brand is basically continuing to take share even though we really have a large share. So it continues to all do well for the company and the brand and this is our main markets, so we're very encouraged by that. As we've indicated, the European markets are really starting to get to a sort of level where they're actually starting to really kick in at a much better pace. The sort of -- the acceleration of sales we are seeing in the U.K. and Spain and even Germany now is really starting to show. And so we are pretty positive about our prospects going forward for those markets. And we are dealing with the operational issues and challenges we have. But in the long term, we are very, very encouraged by the fact that the Asian markets are very receptive to our brand, to the taste. So we again, believe that it is a journey but there's a good end game insight. And thank you for your support. And we are just going to continue to put our heads down and continue to hopefully, continue to deliver what we believe to be very good results as we head on in this quarter. Thank you very much."

I'm sure that you're aware that our company, as a result of certain litigation, regulatory requests and media reports had been a subject of discussion recently. I wanted to take this opportunity to briefly address those. 
First and foremost, we reiterate that our products are safe. More than 8 billion cans of Monster energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed in the United States and around the world since 2002. Additionally, tens of billions of energy drinks manufactured and distributed, not only by us but by other companies, have been sold and safely consumed worldwide for 25 years. We believe that consumers are justified, based on that long track record, in having confidence in the safety of our products. A principal area of attention relates to caffeine. Unfortunately, there has been some misinformation published recently regarding the caffeine content of Monster. 
So, let me give you the facts. Monster Energy drinks generally contain approximately 10 milligrams of caffeine per ounce from all sources. By comparison, the leading brands of coffeehouse brewed coffee, for example, Starbucks, contain on average in excess of 20 milligrams of caffeine per ounce. In other words, a 16-ounce can of Monster Energy contains about 1/2 the caffeine of a 16-ounce cup of coffee house brewed coffee. Even a 24-ounce can of Monster Energy, which contains about 240 milligrams of caffeine from all sources, has about 50% less caffeine than an average medium-sized, 16-ounce cup of coffee house brewed coffee. So again, our products are just as safe for consumers as a cup of coffee purchased at your favorite coffee house. Even an extra large size single-serving of a Mountain Dew fountain drink, which is readily available throughout America contains about 254 milligrams of caffeine. In addition, the amount of caffeine per ounce in other major energy drinks on the market is comparable to or higher than the amount in Monster. There is absolutely no basis for singling out Monster in this regard. 
Another area of recent media focus has been on the fact of the Monster Energy label dietary supplements rather than as fruits. In the case of Monster Energy drinks, this is red herring. Our products could be labeled and sold us foods if we chose to do so. As previously indicated, Monster Energy drinks including their ingredients it and labeling complied fully with all laws and regulations in the United States and in each of the more than 70 countries in which they are sold. All of the ingredients contained in our product at current labels are either FDA approved, food additives or are gross which stands for generally recognized and safe and therefore permissible for inclusion in an labeling as foods. As a result, with the Monster energy drinks are classified as dietary supplements or is a food, is a distinction without a difference. Either way the current ingredients none of which are secret or hidden are fully permissible as a food and a supplement. In other words, we are confident that if we chose to do so, we could recategorize Monster Energy drink as a food. Apart from minor changes in form, the labels of Monster Energy as a food will be almost precisely the same and contain the same details as currently appear on our cans. In fact, all of our main competitors' energy drinks with the label as foods or supplements contain similar if not substantially higher levels of caffeine than do our products. Furthermore, from the time Monster was launched more than 10 years ago, the labels on all Monster energy drinks have expressly stated that the product should be consumed responsibly and are not recommended for children, people to caffeine or pregnant women. 
Finally, there's also been recent focus on so-called adverse reports that are filed with the FDA. The FDA itself has stated quite clearly that adverse event reports about a product are not report issued by the FDA and do not themselves establish any causal link between a product and reported events. More specifically the fact is that the FDA has made it clear that it has not established any course of link between Monster Energy drinks and any of the handful of events reported in adverse event reports. These reports are received by the FDA over an eight-year period between 2004, 2012 so there are no new or sudden issues. The FDA has long been aware of these reports. It was aware of them including the report relating to the 14-year old girl whose family brought the lawsuits against Monster. When the agency stated publicly in August of this year that it monitors the product it regulates specifically including energy drinks by examining current scientific data, monitoring new ingredients added to products and investigating reports of adverse effects. The FDA stated its conclusion that the available evidence, and I quote ""does not indicate any new previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption."" In short there's not a information, which causally links Monster to these adverse events. And before any lawsuit, it refers to caffeine as alleging a fatality caused by Monster. Nor are we aware of a single instance anywhere in the world, in which Monster Energy drinks have caused any one's death. While, of course, we are saddened by the death of the 14-year-old girl whose family brought the little lawsuit against the company, the allegations in that lawsuit, claiming to the contrary are false and totally baseless and are not supported by either the science o r the facts. The autopsy report reveals that a caffeine blood level was not performed and the death was natural and associated with preexisting blood condition, which by itself increased to a risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. We will defend vigorously the lawsuit. 
I hope this clarifies some points that have been made -- that have been a subject to recent media reports and make clear our complete confidence in our products. We will, of course, provide an appropriate response to any regulatory or similar inquiry that we receive. The company can document the support legal basis by which its products are properly labeled and dietary supplements and also position adequate third-party scientific documentation to substantiate this safety. However, given the current litigation and pending regulatory request, I hope you understand that we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions you may have about our product in general or about third quarter results as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business, which I will turn to now.
Whle the beverage industry in general continued to experience softness in the third quarter sales volumes, the energy category in our principal markets, United States, continued to grow in the teens in the third quarter, although slightly lower than the growth rate of the energy category in the U.S. in the second quarter. Overall, the company had a good third quarter, with record third quarter gross sales, up 15.4% to $632.3 million. Net sales up 14.2% to $541.9 million. And operating income up 6.5% to $140.7 million. 
Our tax rate was higher this quarter at 39% versus 37.2% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 6.1% from $0.44 per share in the first quarter of 2011 to $0.47 per share. 
While we are pleased with the results we achieved this quarter, this can be described as the quarter of the proverbial thousand paper cuts with less robust growth for the quarter being due in part to this robust growth for the energy category as a whole in the U.S., together with less robust growth for Monster Energy in our U.S. market, particularly in the latter half of the quarter. 
Now with sales in Canada in the quarter largely due to a realignment by Coca-Cola Canada of their inventory levels, the strength of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies in our international markets, lower sales of Monster Energy extra strength nitrous technology energy drinks. This product line had been repositioned from 12-ounce cap cans to 12-ounce sleek flat-topped cans, and effective September we pricing for the extra strength line in line with our regular 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks. Lower sales of Worx Energy and also lower sales in our warehouse division. 
Nielsen recently commenced reporting sales information for the United States market based on an expanded sample of outlets, which now include Wal-Mart, dollar stores such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and military stores and drugs stores 90 cents and BJ's but excluding Costco. On this call and in the future, for the remainder of this year when we discuss the Nielsen reports for the United States for all outlets combined in the reporting information contained therein will be based on this expanded sample. This will not affect the reports and information covering sales in the convenience and gas channel, grocery and/or drug channels, which may from time to time be referred to individually. We will provide figures on both basis as we only began preparing to reports based on expanded sample earlier this year.
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 20, 2012 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on the expanded basis I just described, including Wal-Mart, dollar stores, DeCA military stores and club stores, but excluding Costco, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including Shots increased 13.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 19.5% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.6%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 10.8% and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 1.8%. 
Sales of Amp were down 8.9%, increased 13.2% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle increased 9.1%. 
For comparative purposes, according to Nielsen reports for the 13-week through October 20, 2012 on the previously reported basis for all outlets combined, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased 13% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 18.7% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.9%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 11.4%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 1.8%. Sales of Amp were down 10.4%, increased 11.1% off a low base, and sales of Full Throttle increased 6.9%. 
According to the Nielsen report for the 4 weeks ended October 20, 2012, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel in dollars increased by 10% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 19% over the comparable period last year, almost twice the growth of the energy drink category in convenience and gas, while sales of Red Bull increased by 12.6% over the same period. Rockstar was up 6.2%, while 5-Hour was down 8.4%. 
According to Nielsen for the 4 weeks ended October 20 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy Shots in dollars increased by 2.5 points over the comparable period a year ago to 33.5% against Red Bull's share of 33%, Rockstar's share of 8% and 5-Hour share of 10.5%. 
According to Nielsen in the 13 weeks ended October 20, 2012, all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased 19% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 23.3% higher than in the comparable period last year, and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 18%. Sales of our noncarbonated Monster rehab tea + energy line according to Nielsen for the 13 weeks ended October 20, 2012, represented approximately 13% of the sales of all Monster beverages sold in the convenience and gas channel. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 22, 2012, the energy drink category grew 5%. Monster sales increased 8% and our market share at 26% increased 0.7 points over the comparable period last year. While Red Bull sales increased 7% and its market share increased 0.9 points to 39.6. Rockstar sales increased 4%, and its market share decreased 0.1 point to 13.4 points -- 34.4%, sorry. 
According to Nielsen in the 4 weeks ended September 22, 2012, sales of energy drink in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 5%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 8% and sales of Monster increased 9%, while sales of Rockstar increased by 1%. Sales of Monster to our distributor in Mexico in the third quarter of 2012 were 46% higher than in the comparable period last year. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 15.5% to $516.3 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, from $447.1 million in the same period in 2011, and contribution margin increased 11.1% from $153.1 million to $170.1 million. 
Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 7% to $25.7 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, compared with $27.6 million for the same period in 2011. 
And contribution margin decreased to $0.04 -- sorry $0.4 million in this quarter versus $2.5 million for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower sales -- sorry it's $0.04 million in this quarter contribution margin, which is 40,000 versus $2.5 million in the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower sales and the impact of increased cost of Apple juice concentrate. 
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 2% for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies, in which we conduct certain of our international business. This had a negative impact of approximately $12 million on net sales. 
Sales were also negatively affected by lower sales to Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada Limited, our Canadian distributor, largely due to the realignment of inventory levels, lower sales of Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology line, which we repositioned from 12-ounce cap cans to 12-ounce flat top cans, as I indicated earlier, in which effective September 1, while in line with our regular 16-ounce drinks. 
Sales of Worx through lower and net sales of the warehouse division was 7% lower in the quarter than the comparable period last year from early to to lower sales of sodas and Apple juice which was partially offset by increased sales of Hubert's Lemonades. 
For the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, gross sales to retail, grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales for club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 11% in the comparable period in 2011. 
Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 2% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 21% in the same period in 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the third quarter of 2012 amounted to $144.7 million compared to $116.8 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the third quarter of 2012 in dollars were 42.6% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such net sales would have been 65.4% higher. Monster is continuing to gain momentum in market share in Europe. In particular in the U.K., Spain, Germany and the Benelux, Monster achieved substantial sales gains as well as substantially increased its market share. 
In the United Kingdom, according to Nielsen, Monster's market share now exceeds 10%. Our European and African operations overall are now operating profitably, particularly in South Africa, where we have made good strides in increasing distribution levels and sales. 
The Central Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses, although we are starting to see the benefits from certain strategic changes, which we are implementing. 
During the quarter, we launched Monster Ultra 0 and and 16-ounce cans and are in the process of launching 2 new products called blend and Mad Dog in 16-ounce cans. Blend was previously positioned as addition in a 550 mall sized receivable can. 
We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in the Philippines and Turkey in the third quarter of 2012 and in conjunction with the new distributor participated in an expanded launch in the Ukraine. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in Chile, Peru and Singapore in the next few months and in Argentina and Taiwan in 2013. We are also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe in 2013.
We believe that we've largely overcome product approval and label issues in Korea and anticipate commencing sales within the next few months. Additional positive news is that sales in Japan in the third quarter continued to exceed our expectations. However, we incurred damages of product losses in relation to the production and shipping of products for Korea and Japan which negatively affected our gross margins during the quarter. We are hopeful that the damages and product losses experience will be materially reduced in the future and all working towards local production. 
Sales of Peace Tea ready to drink iced teas continued to exceed our expectations. In the third quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 44.1% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the first quarter of 2013. 
We are continuing to sell in market Worx Energy shops, although we have experienced a substantial drop-off in sales. We have agreed to more favorable terms with our principal distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe, Coca-Cola, and are in the process of executing final signed distribution agreements with them to give effect to. 
Although it's been a long way to go, we achieved improved results in Australia in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2012 through a significant reduction in losses. We are in the midst of revaluating our strategy in Brazil as we have not been satisfied with Monster's results achieved there this year and have reached an advanced stage of negotiations with an alternative distributor. 
Gross profit margins achieved in the third quarter of 2012 were 50.5% versus 52.7% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, production variances and product damages primarily in Europe and Asia including production cost increases on us and the fact relating United Kingdom and increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were marginally lower than in the comparable quarter last year although in the United States, they were slightly higher. 
Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter were comparable with the same period in 2011. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.6% from 12.6% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising from early Worx and lower royalties and sales commissions paid to third parties other than customers. The decrease was partly offset by increases in sponsorships, trade development programs and other marketing costs in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the same quarter in 2011. 
As previously reported we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, particularly through trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners respective sales forces and to service the merchandise to small independent store channel. The cost of product something teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. These costs were substantially higher in Europe in the quarter as compared to the U.S. and last year. As distribution improves and the European markets mature, we reduction in these costs particularly as a percentage of sales. However, as we continue to enter new markets in Asia and South America, we intend to fund similar development programs to establish the Monster brand in those countries. 
General and administrative expenses increased 23.6% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses, and in particular increased stock-based compensation expense, which was $7.9 million for the quarter compared to $4.9 million last year and $21.6 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $12.9 million for the 9-month period last year. 
For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.5 million from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia. This figure was, however, lower than the $4.5 million losses incurred for the same period last year. 
I think the tax rate in the 2012 third quarter was 39% compared to 37.2% in the 2011 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of lower than expected tax benefits from the 2011 domestic production deduction, as well as an increase in nondeductible equity compensation. 
During the 2012 third quarter, the company purchased 6.9 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.99 per share for a total amount of $397.5 million, which excludes progress commissions. Subsequent to September 30, 2012, the company purchased an additional 1.9 million shares of its stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share, which exhausted the availability under the repurchase plan. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $283.1 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. 
Short-term investments was $307.7 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprise entirely of auction rate securities, decreased from $23.2 million at December 31 to $19.9 million. 
Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 41.3 days at September 30, 2012, and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 38.7 days at September 30, 2011. 
At sales outside of the U.S. continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales. We expect that days outstanding for receivables will increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance to local practices in their respective countries. 
Inventories increased to $193.9 million from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory was 65 days at September 30, 2012, which was lower than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. At September 30, 2012, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of 28 million, 44.8 million at December 31, 2011, with an amortized cost basis of 20.8 million. 
Gross sales in October 2012 were approximately 28% higher than in October 2011. We are encouraged by the strong sales that have been experienced by the company in North America, Western Europe and Japan. We caution again that sales in the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors and accordingly, should not be imputed to be or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize the numerous point that occurred to in the quarter. United States gross margins are healthy and up 2012 third quarter gross margins for North America were only nominally lower than in the comparable 2011 third quarter. We are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investment. Our European business is profitable and the losses we sustained internationally were reduced in the quarter compared to third quarter of last year. The U.S. deals in markets statistic shows Monster Energy is outpacing the category. Our market share in important convenience and gas channel in both units and dollars now exceed that of Red Bull. According to Nielsen, our market share in the United Kingdom has exceeded 10% for the first time. We have reached agreement with Coca-Cola Hellenic for more favorable terms for distribution of our Monster line in certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Monster sales in Japan are very encouraging and are exceeding our expectations. We are planning to launch Monster in Korea within the next few months and as we have largely overcome the product label issues that we experienced Korean product earlier this year. Gross sales in 2012 -- in October 2012 were approximately 28% higher than in October 2011, and we have demonstrated that our products are safe and are properly labeled and that the caffeine content in the Monster energy drink at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce is less than 1/2 the milligrams per ounce of caffeine contained in the Starbucks brewed coffee. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

We launched in Japan in a sleek can, a 55 sleek can and there isn't -- we only have refined a sleek can available in Japan, so we have been working with can companies to have the manufacturer mold to actually be able to supply us with a sleek can because the alternative is we'll go to something like a 400, but it's a very stubby can and we just didn't feel that was right for the brand. So getting the right product produced in the right cans in those 2 countries has been a challenge, but we are actively working on doing so, because we obviously we appreciate that it will remove the shipping damages and risks inherent in shipping as well as the shipping cost. And with the markets, but obviously what happens is when you start the market to make the investments and it will require some capital investment from us to do so as well with the can companies and/or some of the packing companies in Japan. But until we saw the sales velocities and the viability of packing locally, it just didn't make sense to have those costs incurred upfront and then try and launch and find out right away whether product was or wasn't viable philosophy. Based on the velocity we now see, it's been very positive but the problem is they've been higher cost higher damages with that higher velocity. But as we accelerated our plan to go to local production, and we are working on it. We also just have some price increases in the U.K. from our pack. we have some price variances in some damages. We had some losses there was a number of changes that took place in some countries for regulatory reasons, and we ended up with some inventory excess, which you obviously trying to work through and to sell elsewhere.

We believe that we will be able to get this more under control as we continue to gain more experience in shipping and understanding Japanese requirements. But got to a point where literally every case had to be disassembled, examined  can by can and being repacked, and that's why the cost became very high. And as a result, our margins very little, but we were pregnant, we were launching, and we needed to go to continue and the resulted we've been able to establish our brand very strongly and very solidly in the Japanese market, but it certainly has been very costly for us for all of these different regions. But as we go forward, we hope that we will avoid damages, we're hoping we'll avoid having to continue these very costly labor in manual inspections to satisfy our Japanese customer and then retailers in Japan for our quality standards, which are just very, very setting compared to the standards normally acceptable in the U.S."

And as a result, we continue to quite heavily in trade development personnel, sales personnel, something in order to make sure the product becomes established in each of these. although Europe again is not one country like America. Each country has to be dealt with individually, different languages, different sales teams, different support in order to get your brand. And even though the countries are small, you really have to support your brand. And that becomes until you get to a sort of at least a minimum level of sales in that things will start kicking in. Because we've got some really good shares in small countries, but it is costly. In countries like Lithuania and Latvia, we're up to 15% market shares, but when you look at it actual terms, it's very small so to support that and get their product established there has been expensive. But it is starting to get -- kicking to its own. We've got very nice shares in certain of the markets like Greece, Bulgaria, some of the smaller markets in the Eastern. But there are others that our stores sort -- we're still trying to get out of the blocks. So while we are continuing to see some good change from losses to profits in those countries, they will continue to improve. We're also obviously looking at trying to be a little more strict with our marketing spend to support the brands with a lot of the international properties of that restarting in order to give the brand international credibility. We are trying to avoid obviously increasing that spend so that we actually end up with a spent it is going the right way which happened for the last 2 years, and so now we believe that going forward we will be able to start showing better bottom line profit going out coming out of Europe."

I'm sure that you're aware that our company, as a result of certain litigation, regulatory requests and media reports, had been a subject of discussion recently. I wanted to take this opportunity to briefly address this. 
First and foremost, we reiterate that our products are safe. More than 8 billion cans of Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed in the United States and around the world since 2002. Additionally, tens of billions of energy drinks manufactured and distributed, not only by us but by other companies, have been sold and safely consumed worldwide for 25 years. We believe that consumers are justified, based on that long track record, in having confidence in the safety of our products. A principal area of attention relates to caffeine. Unfortunately, there has been some misinformation published recently regarding the caffeine content of Monster. 
So, let me give you the facts. Monster Energy drinks generally contain approximately 10 milligrams of caffeine per ounce from all sources. By comparison, the leading brands of coffee house brewed coffee, for example, Starbucks, contain on average, in excess of 20 milligrams of caffeine per ounce. In other words, a 16-ounce can of Monster Energy contains about 1/2 the caffeine of a 16-ounce cup of coffee house brewed coffee. Even a 24-ounce can of Monster Energy, which contains about 240 milligrams of caffeine from all sources, has about 30% less caffeine than an average, medium-sized, 16-ounce cup of coffee house brewed coffee. So again, our products are just as safe for consumers as a cup of coffee purchased at your favorite coffee house. Even an extra large sized single-serving of a Mountain Dew fountain drink, which is readily available throughout America contains about 234 milligrams of caffeine. In addition, the amount of caffeine per ounce in other major energy drinks on the market is comparable to or higher than the amount in Monster. There is absolutely no basis for singling out Monster in this regard. 
Another area of recent media focus has been on the fact of the Monster Energy drinks are labeled as dietary supplements rather than as foods. In the case of Monster Energy drinks, this is red herring. Our products could be labeled and sold as foods if we chose to do so. As previously indicated, Monster Energy drinks, including their ingredients and labeling, comply fully with all laws and regulations in the United States, and in each of the more than 70 countries in which they are sold. All of the ingredients contained in our products at current levels are either FDA approved food additives, or are GRAS, which stands for Generally Recognized As Safe, and are therefore permissible for inclusion in and labeling as foods. As a result, whether Monster Energy drinks are classified as dietary supplements or as a food, is a distinction without a difference. Either way, the current ingredients, none of which are secret or hidden, are fully permissible as a food and a supplement. In other words, we are confident that if we chose to do so, we could recategorize Monster Energy drinks as a food. Apart from minor changes in form, the labels of Monster Energy as a food would be almost precisely the same, and contain the same details as currently appear on our cans. In fact, all of our main competitors' energy drinks whether labeled as foods or supplements, contain similar if not substantially higher levels of caffeine than do our products. Furthermore, from the time Monster was launched more than 10 years ago, the labels on all Monster Energy drinks have expressly stated that the product should be consumed responsibly, and are not recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine or pregnant women. 
Finally, there's also been recent focus on so-called adverse event reports that are filed with the FDA. The FDA itself has stated quite clearly that adverse event reports about a product are not reports issued by the FDA, and do not themselves establish any causal link between a product and the reported event. More specifically, the fact is that the FDA has made it clear that it has not established any causal link between Monster Energy drinks and any of the handful of events reported in adverse event reports. These reports were received by the FDA over an eight-year period between 2004 and 2012, so there are no new or sudden issues. The FDA has long been aware of these reports. It was aware of them including the report relating to the 14-year old girl whose family brought the lawsuit against Monster. When the agency stated publicly in August of this year that it monitors the products it regulates, specifically including energy drinks by examining current scientific data, monitoring new ingredients added to products and investigating reports of adverse effects, the FDA stated its conclusion that the available evidence, and I quote ""does not indicate any new, previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption."" In short, there is not a shred of information, which causally links Monster to these adverse events. And the Fournier lawsuit, it refers to caffeine as received, alleging a fatality caused by Monster. Nor are we aware of a single instance anywhere in the world, in which Monster Energy drinks have caused anyone's death. While, of course, we are saddened by the death of the 14-year-old girl whose family brought the lawsuit against the company, the allegations in that lawsuit, claiming to the contrary are false and totally baseless, and are not supported by either the science or the facts. The autopsy report reveals that a caffeine blood level was not performed, and that her death was natural and associated with a preexisting heart condition, which by itself increased her risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. We will defend vigorously the lawsuit. 
I hope this clarifies some points that have been made -- that have been a subject to recent media reports and makes clear our complete confidence in our products. We will, of course, provide an appropriate response to any regulatory or similar inquiry that we receive. The company can document and support the legal basis by which its products are properly labeled as dietary supplements and also position the adequate third-party scientific documentation to substantiate their safety. However, given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, I hope you understand that we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions you may have about our products in general or about third quarter results as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business, which I will turn to now.
While the beverage industry in general continued to experience softness in the third quarter sales volumes, the Energy category in our principal market, the United States, continued to grow in the teens in the third quarter, although slightly lower than the growth rate of the Energy category in the U.S. in the second quarter. Overall, the company had a good third quarter, with record third quarter gross sales, up 15.4% to $632.3 million. Net sales up 14.2% to $541.9 million. And operating income up 6.5% to $140.7 million. 
Our tax rate was higher this quarter at 39% versus 37.2% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 6.1% from $0.44 per share in the third quarter of 2011 to $0.47 per share. 
While we are pleased with the result we achieved this quarter, this can be described as the quarter of the proverbial thousand paper cuts, with less robust growth for the quarter being due in part to this robust growth for the Energy category as a whole in the U.S., together with less robust growth for Monster Energy in our U.S. market, particularly in the latter half of the quarter. 
Lower sales in Canada in the quarter largely due to a realignment by Coca-Cola Canada of their inventory levels, the strength of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies in our international markets, lower sales of Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology energy drinks. This product line had been repositioned from 12-ounce cap cans to 12-ounce sleek, flat-topped cans, and effective September we lowered pricing for the Extra Strength line in line with our regular 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks. Lower sales of Worx Energy shots and also lower sales in our warehouse division. 
Nielsen recently commenced reporting sales information for the United States market based on an expanded sample of outlets, which now includes Wal-Mart, dollar stores such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's,  DeCA military stores and club stores, 90 Cents and BJ's, but excluding Costco. On this call and in the future, for the remainder of this year, when we discuss the Nielsen reports for the United States for all outlets combined and the reporting information contained therein, will be based on this expanded sample. This will not affect the reports and information covering the sales in the convenience and gas channel, grocery and/or drug channels, which may, from time to time, be referred to individually. We will provide figures on both basis as we only began preparing to reports based on the expanded sample earlier this year.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through October 20, 2012 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on the expanded basis I just described, including Wal-Mart, dollar stores, DeCA military stores and club stores, but excluding Costco, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased 13.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 19.5% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.6%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 10.8% and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 1.8%. 
Sales of Amp were down 8.9%, NOS increased 13.2% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle increased 9.1%. 
For comparative purposes, according to Nielsen reports for the 13-week through October 20, 2012 on the previously reported basis for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased 13% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 18.7% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.9%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 11.4%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 1.8%. Sales of Amp were down 10.4%, NOS increased 11.1% off a low base, and sales of Full Throttle increased 6.9%. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended October 20, 2012, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 10% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 19% over the comparable period last year, almost twice the growth of the energy drink category in convenience and gas, while sales of Red Bull increased by 12.6% over the same period. Rockstar was up 6.2%, while 5-Hour was down 8.4%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 20 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2.5 points over the comparable period a year ago, to 33.5% against Red Bull's share of 33%, Rockstar's share of 8% and 5-Hour's share of 10.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended October 20, 2012, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased 19% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 23.3% higher than in the comparable period last year, and Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 18%. Sales of our noncarbonated Monster Rehab tea + energy line, according to Nielsen, for the 13 weeks ended October 20, 2012, represented approximately 13% of the sales of all Monster beverages sold in the convenience and gas channel. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 22, 2012, the energy drink category grew 5%. Monster sales increased 8% and our market share at 26% increased 0.7 points over the comparable period last year, while Red Bull sales increased 7% and its market share increased 0.9 points to 39.6. Rockstar sales increased 4%, and its market share decreased 0.1 point to 13.4 points -- 34.4%, sorry. 
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended September 22, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 5%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 8% and sales of Monster increased 9%, while sales of Rockstar increased by 1%. Sales of Monster to our distributor in Mexico in the third quarter of 2012, were 46% higher than in the comparable period last year. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 15.5% to $516.3 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, from $447.1 million in the same period in 2011, and contribution margin increased 11.1%, from $153.1 million to $170.1 million. 
Net sales for the company's warehouse segments decreased 7% to $25.7 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, compared with $27.6 million for the same period in 2011. 
And contribution margin decreased to $0.04 -- sorry $0.4 million in this quarter, versus $2.5 million for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower sales -- sorry, my -- it's misquoted -- it's $0.04 million in this quarter contribution margin, which is $40,000 versus $2.5 million in -- for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower sales and the impact of increased costs of apple juice concentrate. 
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 2% for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies, in which we conduct certain of our international business. This had a negative impact of approximately $12 million on net sales. 
Sales were also negatively affected by lower sales to Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada Limited, our Canadian distributor, largely due to their realignment of inventory levels, lower sales of Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology line, which we repositioned from 12-ounce cap cans to 12-ounce sleek, flat-topped cans, as I indicated earlier, in which effective September 1, were partly in line with our regular 16-ounce drinks. 
Sales of Worx through lower and net sales of the warehouse division was 7% lower in the quarter than in the comparable period last year from early -- due to lower sales of sodas and apple juice, which was partially offset by increased sales of Hubert's Lemonades. 
For the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, gross sales to retail, grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 11% in the comparable period in 2011. 
Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 21% in the same period in 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in the comparable period 2011. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the third quarter of 2012 amounted to $144.7 million compared to $116.8 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the third quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 42.6% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such net sales would have been 65.4% higher. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. In particular in the U.K., Spain, Germany and the Benelux, Monster achieved substantial sales gains as well as substantially increased its market share. 
In the United Kingdom, according to Nielsen, Monster's market share now exceeds 10%. Our European and African operations overall are now operating profitably, particularly in South Africa, where we have made good strides in increasing distribution levels and sales. 
The Central Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses, although we are starting to see the benefits from certain strategic changes, which we are implementing. 
During the quarter, we launched Monster Ultra Zero and Cuba Lima in 16-ounce cans and are in the process of launching 2 new DUB products called Baller's Blend and Mad Dog in 16-ounce cans. Baller's Blend was previously positioned as DUB edition in a 550-ml sized resealable can. 
We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in the Philippines and Turkey in the third quarter of 2012, and in conjunction with a new distributor participated in an expanded launch in the Ukraine. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in Chile, Peru and Singapore in the next few months, and in Argentina and Taiwan in 2013. We are also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe in 2013.
We believe that we've largely overcome product approval and label issues in Korea, and anticipate commencing sales within the next few months. Additional positive news is that sales in Japan in the third quarter continued to exceed our expectations. However, we incurred damages of product losses in relation to the production and shipping of products for Korea and Japan, which negatively affected our gross margins during the quarter. We are hopeful that the damages and product losses experienced will be materially reduced in the future and are working towards local production. 
Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced teas continued to exceed our expectations. In the third quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 44.1% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the first quarter of 2013. 
We are continuing to sell in the market Worx Energy shots, although we have experienced a substantial drop-off in sales. We have agreed to more favorable terms with our principal distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe, Coca-Cola Hellenic, and are in the process of executing final signed distribution agreements with them to give effect there too. 
Although we still have a long way to go, we achieved improved results in Australia in the third quarter, as compared to the second quarter of 2012, through a significant reduction in losses. We are in the midst of revaluating our strategy in Brazil, as we have not been satisfied with Monster's results achieved there this year, and have reached an advanced stage of negotiations with an alternative distributor. 
Gross profit margins achieved in the third quarter of 2012 were 50.5% versus 52.7% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, production variances and product damages, primarily in Europe and Asia, including production cost increases passed on to us by our factory in the United Kingdom, and increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were marginally lower than in the comparable quarter last year, although in the United States, they were slightly higher. 
Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter were comparable with the same period in 2011. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.6% from 12.6% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising from early Worx, and lower royalties and sales commissions paid to third parties other than customers. The decrease was partly offset by increases in sponsorships, trade development programs and other marketing costs in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to the same quarter in 2011. 
As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, particularly through trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' respective sales forces and to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. These costs were substantially higher in Europe in the quarter, as compared to the U.S. and last year. As distribution improves and the European markets mature, we envisage a reduction in these costs, particularly as a percentage of sales. However, as we continue to enter new markets in Asia and South America, we intend to fund similar trade development programs to establish the Monster brand in those countries. 
General and administrative expenses increased 23.6% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses, and in particular, increased stock-based compensation expense, which was $7.9 million for the quarter compared to $4.9 million last year, and $21.6 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $12.9 million for the 9-month period last year. 
For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.5 million from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia. This figure was, however, lower than the $4.5 million losses incurred for the same period last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the 2012 third quarter was 39% compared to 37.2% in the 2011 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of lower than expected tax benefits from the 2011 domestic production deduction, as well as an increase in nondeductible equity compensation. 
During the 2012 third quarter, the company purchased 6.9 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.99 per share, for a total amount of $397.5 million, which excludes brokers' commissions. Subsequent to September 30, 2012, the company purchased an additional 1.9 million shares of its stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share, which exhausted the availability under the repurchase plan. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $283.1 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. 
Short-term investments were $307.7 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities, decreased from $23.2 million at December 31 to $19.9 million. 
Days outstanding for trade accounts receivables were 41.3 days at September 30, 2012, and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 38.7 days at September 30, 2011. 
As sales outside the U.S. continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, we expect that days outstanding for receivables will increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally, in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. 
Inventories increased to $193.9 million, from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory were 65 days at September 30, 2012, which was lower than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. At September 30, 2012, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $28 million, $44.8 million at December 31, 2011, with an amortized cost basis of $20.8 million. 
Gross sales in October 2012 were approximately 28% higher than in October 2011. We are encouraged by the strong sales that have been experienced by the company in North America, Western Europe and Japan. We caution again that sales in a the single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, and accordingly, should not be imputed to be or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize the numerous volatile points that occurred during the quarter. The United States gross margins are healthy, and our 2012 third quarter gross margins for North America were only nominally lower than in the comparable 2011 third quarter. We are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investment. Our European business is profitable and the losses we sustained internationally were reduced in the quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. The U.S. Nielsen market statistic shows Monster Energy is outpacing the category. Our market share in the important convenience and gas channel in both units and dollars now exceeds that of Red Bull. According to Nielsen, our market share in the United Kingdom has exceeded 10% for the first time. We have reached agreements with Coca-Cola Hellenic for more favorable terms for distribution of our Monster line in certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Monster sales in Japan are very encouraging, and are exceeding our expectations. We are planning to launch Monster Energy in Korea within the next few months, and as we have largely overcome the product approval and label issues that we experienced with our Korean products earlier this year. Gross sales in 2012 -- in October 2012 were approximately 28% higher than in October 2011, and we have demonstrated that our products are safe, are properly labeled and that the caffeine content in the Monster Energy drink at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce, is less than 1/2 the milligrams per ounce of caffeine contained in a Starbucks brewed coffee. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And we are working towards that at the moment. We launched in Japan in a sleek can, a 3 -- a 55-ml sleek can and we, there isn't -- we haven't been able to find a sleek can available in Japan, so we have been working with can companies to have their manufacturer mold to actually be able to supply us with a sleek can, because the alternative is, we'll go to -- we should go to something like a 400, but it's a very stubby can, and we just didn't feel that was right for the brand. So we've -- the -- getting the right product produced in the right cans in those 2 countries has been a challenge, but we are actively working on doing so, because we obviously, we appreciate that it will remove the shipping damages and risks inherent in shipping as well as the shipping cost. And with the markets, but obviously what happens is, when you start a market, to make the investments and it will require some capital investments from us to do so as well, with the can companies and/or some of the packing companies in Japan. But until we saw the sales velocities and the viability of packing locally, it just didn't make sense to have those costs incurred upfront, and then try and launch, and we'll find out later whether product was or wasn't viable in its velocity. Based on the velocity we now see, it's been very positive, but the problem is it -- there've been higher costs of higher damages with that higher velocity. But as we accelerated our plan to go to local production, and we are working on it. We also just have some price increases in the U.K., from our backyard. We had some price variances and some damages. Here again, we had some losses, there was a number of changes that took place in some countries for regulatory reasons, and we ended up with some inventory excesses, which we're obviously trying to work through and to sell elsewhere. But we think we'll be able to work through that, so that it will more normalize more going forward as we continue to establish the brand and the company internationally."

I've given you a pretty smooth channel net our sales are basically going year-on-year, that's the increase in the channel. Ordering patterns from our customers are what they are. It depends on timing of promotions, timing of orders. And so, I can't put any more color on it other than to say that, you look at the sales going through, and you've got to look at -- I know that everybody works off and looks at quarters, but at the end of the day, you also have to look at an annual base, which I think gives everybody a fair and a more balanced view of the direction of the company, the brand, the sales, et cetera.

So there were, literally, were whole lot of issues that were gained, just continued to face us in shipping these large distances. And it's just -- it's something that is just difficult to ship full cans under pressure from the U.S. to Japan. We believe that we will be able to get this more under control as we continue to gain more experience in shipping and understanding Japanese requirements. But it got to a point where literally every case was -- had to be disassembled, examined  can by can and being repacked, and that's where the costs became very high. And as a result, our margins very little, but we were there, we were pregnant, we were launching, and we needed to go, to continue and the result is, we've been able to establish our brand very strongly and very solidly in the Japanese market, but it certainly has been very costly for us, for all of these different regions. But as we go forward, we hope that we will avoid the damages, we're hoping we'll avoid having to continue these very costly labor and then manual inspections to satisfy the -- our Japanese customer and then retailers in Japan for our quality standards, which are just very, very exacting for us, compared to the standards normally acceptable in the U.S."

But we have -- we've still got a lot of individual countries where we were at the very early stages of developing the brand. And as a result, we continue to invest quite heavily in trade development personnel, sales personnel, sampling, in order to make sure the product becomes established in each of these countries. Although they're -- Europe, again, it's not one country like America. I mean, each country has to be dealt with individually, different languages, different sales teams, different support, in order to get your brand. And even though the countries are small, you really have to support your brand. And that becomes costly, until you get to a sort of a -- at least a minimum level of sales in that country, and then things will start kicking in. Because we've got some really good shares in small countries, but it is costly. In countries like Lithuania and Latvia, we're up to 15% market shares, but when you look at it actual taste terms, it's very small, so to support that and get the product established there, is -- has been expensive. But it is starting to get -- kick into its own. We've got very nice shares in certain of the markets like Greece, Bulgaria, some of those smaller markets in the Eastern block. But then there are others that our stores sort of -- we just -- still trying to get out of the blocks. So while we are continuing to see some good change from losses to profits in those countries, they will continue to improve. We're also obviously looking at trying to be a little more strict with our marketing spend to support the brands, we've -- a lot of the international properties that we started with in order to give the brand international credibility. We are trying to avoid, obviously, increasing that spend so that we actually end up with a spend per case lower. It is going the right way, it's happened for the last 2 years, and so now, we believe that going forward, we will be able to start showing better bottom line profit going out of -- coming out of Europe."

I'm sure that you're aware that our company, as a result of certain litigation, regulatory requests and media reports, has been a subject of discussion recently. I wanted to take this opportunity to briefly address this. 
First and foremost, we reiterate that our products are safe. More than 8 billion cans of Monster Energy drinks have been sold and safely consumed in the United States and around the world since 2002. Additionally, tens of billions of energy drinks manufactured and distributed, not only by us but by other companies, have been sold and safely consumed worldwide for 25 years. We believe that consumers are justified, based on that long track record, in having confidence in the safety of our products. A principal area of attention relates to caffeine. Unfortunately, there has been some misinformation published recently regarding the caffeine content of Monster. 
So let me give you the facts. Monster Energy drinks generally contain approximately 10 milligrams of caffeine per ounce from all sources. By comparison, the leading brands of coffee house brewed coffee, for example, Starbucks, contain on average in excess of 20 milligrams of caffeine per ounce. In other words, a 16-ounce can of Monster Energy contains about 1/2 the caffeine of a 16-ounce cup of coffee house brewed coffee. Even a 24-ounce can of Monster Energy, which contains about 240 milligrams of caffeine from all sources, has about 30% less caffeine than an average, medium-sized, 16-ounce cup of coffee house brewed coffee. So again, our products are just as safe for consumers as a cup of coffee purchased at your favorite coffee house. 
Even an extra large sized single-serving of a Mountain Dew fountain drink, which is readily available throughout America contains about 234 milligrams of caffeine. In addition, the amount of caffeine per ounce in other major energy drinks on the market is comparable to or higher than the amount in Monster. There is absolutely no basis for singling out Monster in this regard. 
Another area of recent media focus has been on the fact that Monster Energy drinks are labeled as dietary supplements rather than as foods. In the case of Monster Energy drinks, this is a red herring. Our products could be labeled and sold as foods if we chose to do so. As previously indicated, Monster Energy drinks, including their ingredients and labeling, comply fully with all laws and regulations in the United States, and in each of the more than 70 countries in which they are sold. All of the ingredients contained in our products at current levels are either FDA approved food additives, or are GRAS, which stands for Generally Recognized As Safe, and are therefore permissible for inclusion in and labeling as foods. 
As a result, whether Monster Energy drinks are classified as dietary supplements or as a food, is a distinction without a difference. Either way, the current ingredients, none of which are secret or hidden, are fully permissible as a food and a supplement. In other words, we are confident that if we chose to do so, we could recategorize Monster Energy drinks as a food. Apart from minor changes in form, the labels of Monster Energy as a food would be almost precisely the same, and contain the same details as currently appear on our cans. 
In fact, all of our main competitors' energy drinks whether labeled as foods or supplements, contain similar if not substantially higher levels of caffeine than do our products. Furthermore, from the time Monster was launched more than 10 years ago, the labels on all Monster Energy drinks have expressly stated that the product should be consumed responsibly, and are not recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine or pregnant women. 
Finally, there's also been recent focus on so-called adverse event reports that are filed with the FDA. The FDA itself has stated quite clearly that adverse event reports about a product are not reports issued by the FDA, and do not themselves establish any causal link between a product and the reported event. 
More specifically, the fact is that the FDA has made it clear that it has not established any causal link between Monster Energy drinks and any of the handful of events reported in adverse event reports. These reports were received by the FDA over an 8-year period between 2004 and 2012, so there are no new or sudden issues. The FDA has long been aware of these reports. It was aware of them including the report relating to the 14-year old girl whose family brought the lawsuit against Monster. When the agency stated publicly in August of this year that it monitors the products it regulates, specifically including energy drinks by examining current scientific data, monitoring new ingredients added to products and investigating reports of adverse effects, the FDA stated its conclusion that the available evidence, and I quote ""does not indicate any new, previously unknown risks associated with caffeine consumption."" In short, there is not a shred of information which causally links Monster to these adverse events. 
And the Fournier lawsuit is the first the company has received alleging a fatality caused by Monster. Nor are we aware of a single instance anywhere in the world, in which Monster Energy drinks have caused anyone's death. While, of course, we are saddened by the death of the 14-year-old girl whose family brought the lawsuit against the company, the allegations in that lawsuit claiming to the contrary are false and totally baseless, and are not supported by either the science or the facts. The autopsy report reveals that a caffeine blood level was not performed, and that her death was natural and associated with a preexisting heart condition, which by itself increased her risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. We will defend vigorously the lawsuit. 
I hope this clarifies some points that have been made -- that have been a subject of recent media reports and makes clear our complete confidence in our products. We will, of course, provide an appropriate response to any regulatory or similar inquiry that we receive. The company can document and support the legal basis by which its products are properly labeled as dietary supplements and also position adequate third-party scientific documentation to substantiate their safety. 
However, given the current litigation and pending regulatory requests, I hope you understand that we will refrain from answering questions or commenting further on these specific subjects. We are happy, of course, to answer questions you may have about our products in general or about third quarter results as best we can after we have concluded our discussion on the business, which I will turn to now.
While the beverage industry in general continued to experience softness in the third quarter sales volumes, the Energy category in our principal market, the United States, continued to grow in the teens in the third quarter, although slightly lower than the growth rate of the Energy category in the U.S. in the second quarter. Overall, the company had a good third quarter, with record third quarter gross sales, up 15.4% to $632.3 million, net sales up 14.2% to $541.9 million, and operating income up 6.5% to $140.7 million. 
Our tax rate was higher this quarter at 39% versus 37.2% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share increased 6.1% from $0.44 per share in the third quarter of 2011 to $0.47 per share. 
While we are pleased with the result we achieved this quarter, this can be described as the quarter of the proverbial thousand paper cuts, with less robust growth for the quarter being due in part to this robust growth for the Energy category as a whole in the U.S., together with less robust growth for Monster Energy in our U.S. market, particularly in the latter half of the quarter. 
Lower sales in Canada in the quarter largely due to a realignment by Coca-Cola Canada of their inventory levels, the strength of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies in our international markets, lower sales of Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology energy drinks. This product line had been repositioned from 12-ounce cap cans to 12-ounce sleek, flat-topped cans, and effective September, we lowered pricing for the Extra Strength line in line with our regular 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks. Lower sales of Worx Energy shots and also lower sales in our warehouse division. 
Nielsen recently commenced reporting sales information for the United States market based on an expanded sample of outlets, which now includes Wal-Mart, dollar stores such as Family Dollar, Dollar General and Fred's, DeCA military stores and club stores, 90 Cents [ph] and BJ's, but excluding Costco. On this call and in the future, for the remainder of this year, when we discuss the Nielsen reports for the United States for all outlets combined and the reported information contained therein, will be based on this expanded sample. 
This will not affect the reports and information governing sales in the convenience and gas channel, grocery and/or drug channels, which may, from time to time, be referred to individually. We will provide figures on both basis as we only began referring to reports based on the expanded sample earlier this year.
According to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through October 20, 2012 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, on the expanded basis I just described, including Wal-Mart, dollar stores, DeCA military stores and club stores, but excluding Costco, sales in dollars in the energy drink category including shots increased 13.3% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 19.5% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.6%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 10.8% and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 1.8%. 
Sales of Amp were down 8.9%, NOS increased 13.2% off a low base and sales of Full Throttle increased 9.1%. 
For comparative purposes, according to Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 20, 2012 on a previously reported basis for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including shots, increased 13% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 18.7% in the 13-week period, while sales of Red Bull increased by 16.9%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 11.4%, and sales of 5-Hour decreased by 1.8%. Sales of Amp were down 10.4%, NOS increased 11.1% off a low base, and sales of Full Throttle increased 6.9%. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 4 weeks ended October 20, 2012, sales of energy drinks in the convenience and gas channel, in dollars, increased by 10% over the comparable 4-week period in 2011. Sales of Monster increased by 19% over the comparable period last year, almost twice the growth of the energy drink category in convenience and gas, while sales of Red Bull increased by 12.6% over the same period. Rockstar was up 6.2%, while 5-Hour was down 8.4%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended October 20 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 2.5 points over the comparable period a year ago, to 33.5% against Red Bull's share of 33%, Rockstar's share of 8% and 5-Hour's share of 10.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended October 20, 2012, for all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased 19% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 23.3% higher than in the comparable period last year, and Starbucks Double Shot Energy was up 18%. Sales of our noncarbonated Monster Rehab tea + energy line, according to Nielsen, for the 13 weeks ended October 20, 2012, represented approximately 13% of the sales of all Monster beverages sold in the convenience and gas channel. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended September 22, 2012, the energy drink category grew 5%. Monster sales increased 8% and our market share at 26% increased 0.7 points over the comparable period last year, while Red Bull sales increased 7% and its market share increased 0.9 points to 39.6. Rockstar sales increased 4%, and its market share decreased 0.1 point to 13.4 points -- 34.4%, sorry. 
According to Nielsen, in the 4 weeks ended September 22, 2012, sales of energy drinks in Canada for the convenience and gas channel grew 5%. Over this period, sales of Red Bull increased 8% and sales of Monster increased 9%, while sales of Rockstar increased by 1%. Sales of Monster to our distributor in Mexico in the third quarter of 2012 were 46% higher than in the comparable period last year. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 15.5% to $516.3 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, from $447.1 million in the same period in 2011, and contribution margin increased 11.1%, from $153.1 million to $170.1 million. 
Net sales for the company's warehouse segment decreased 7% to $25.7 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, compared with $27.6 million for the same period in 2011. 
And contribution margin decreased to $0.04 -- sorry $0.4 million in this quarter, versus $2.5 million for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower sales -- sorry, my -- it's misquoted -- it's $0.04 million in this quarter contribution margin, which is $40,000 versus $2.5 million in -- for the same quarter last year, largely as a result of lower sales and the impact of increased costs of apple juice concentrate. 
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 2% for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, which was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain local currencies, in which we conduct certain of our international business. This had a negative impact of approximately $12 million on net sales. 
Sales were also negatively affected by lower sales to Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada Limited, our Canadian distributor, largely due to their realignment of inventory levels, lower sales of Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology line, which we repositioned from 12-ounce capped cans to 12-ounce sleek, flat-topped cans, as I indicated earlier, in which effective September 1, were crossed in line with our regular 16-ounce drinks. 
Sales of Worx were also lower and net sales of the warehouse division were 7% lower in the quarter than in the comparable period last year primarily due to lower sales of sodas and apple juice, which was partially offset by increased sales of Hubert's Lemonades. 
For the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, gross sales to retail, grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 3% of gross sales, down from 4% in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 11% in the comparable period in 2011. 
Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 62% of sales, the same as in the comparable period in 2011. Gross sales internationally increased to 23% from 21% in the same period in 2011. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in the comparable period 2011. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the third quarter of 2012 amounted to $144.7 million compared to $116.8 million in the same quarter in 2011. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the third quarter of 2012, in dollars, were 42.6% higher than in the same period last year. Excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar, such net sales would have been 65.4% higher. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and market share in Europe. In particular in the U.K., Spain, Germany and the Benelux, Monster achieved substantial sales gains as well as substantially increased its market share. 
In the United Kingdom, according to Nielsen, Monster's market share now exceeds 10%. Our European and African operations overall are now operating profitably, particularly in South Africa, where we have made good strides in increasing distribution levels and sales. 
The Central and Eastern European region is still incurring operating losses, although we are starting to see the benefit from certain strategic changes, which we are implementing. 
During the quarter, we launched Monster Ultra Zero and Cuba Lima in 16-ounce cans and are in the process of launching 2 new DUB products called Baller's Blend and Mad Dog in 16-ounce cans. Baller's Blend was previously positioned as DUB edition in a 550-ml sized resealable can. 
We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launched Monster Energy in the Philippines and Turkey in the third quarter of 2012, and in conjunction with a new distributor, participated in an expanded launch in the Ukraine. We are continuing with our plans to launch Monster in Chile, Peru and Singapore in the next few months, and in Argentina and Taiwan in 2013. We are also planning to launch Monster in additional countries in Central and Eastern Europe in 2013.
We believe that we've largely overcome product approval and label issues in Korea, and anticipate commencing sales there within the next few months. Additional positive news is that sales in Japan in the third quarter continued to exceed our expectations. However, we incurred damages of product losses in relation to the production and shipping of products for Korea and Japan, which negatively affected our gross margins during the quarter. We are hopeful that the damages and product losses experienced will be materially reduced in the future and are working towards local production. 
Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced teas continued to exceed our expectations. In the third quarter of 2012, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 44.1% over the same period in 2011. We are continuing with our plan to introduce additional packages and container sizes for the Peace Tea brand during the first quarter of 2013. 
We are continuing to sell in the market Worx Energy shots, although we have experienced a substantial drop-off in sales. We have agreed to more favorable terms with our principal distribution partner in Central and Eastern Europe, Coca-Cola Hellenic, and are in the process of executing final signed distribution agreements with them to give effect there too. 
Although we still have a long way to go, we achieved improved results in Australia in the third quarter, as compared to the second quarter of 2012, through a significant reduction in losses. We are in the midst of revaluating our strategy in Brazil, as we have not been satisfied with Monster's results achieved there this year, and have reached an advanced stage of negotiations with an alternative distributor. 
Gross profit margins achieved in the third quarter of 2012 were 50.5% versus 52.7% in the comparable quarter in 2011. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to geographic mix, production variances and product damages, primarily in Europe and Asia, including production cost increases passed on to us by our factory in the United Kingdom, and increased promotional and other allowances as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit margins achieved in North America overall were marginally lower than in the comparable quarter last year, although in the United States, they were slightly higher. 
Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter were comparable with the same period in 2011. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.6% from 12.6% in the same period in 2011. The decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreases in advertising from early Worx, and lower royalties and sales commissions paid to third parties other than customers. The decrease was partly offset by increases in sponsorships, trade development programs and other marketing costs in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to the same quarter in 2011. 
As previously reported, we are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, Asia and South America, particularly through trade development programs to supplement our distribution partners' respective sales forces and to service and merchandise the small independent store channel. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll costs. These costs were substantially higher in Europe in the quarter as compared to the U.S. and last year. As distribution improves and the European markets mature, we envisage a reduction in these costs, particularly as a percentage of sales. However, as we continue to enter new markets in Asia and South America, we intend to fund similar trade development programs to establish the Monster brand in those countries. 
General and administrative expenses increased 23.6% in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses, and in particular, increased stock-based compensation expense, which was $7.9 million for the quarter compared to $4.9 million last year, and $21.6 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $12.9 million for the 9-month period last year. 
For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $2.5 million from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, South America and Asia. This figure was, however, lower than the $4.5 million losses incurred for the same period last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the 2012 third quarter was 39% compared to 37.2% in the 2011 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of lower than expected tax benefits from the 2011 domestic production deduction, as well as an increase in nondeductible equity compensation. 
During the 2012 third quarter, the company purchased 6.9 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.99 per share, for a total amount of $397.5 million, which excludes brokers' commissions. Subsequent to September 30, 2012, the company purchased an additional 1.9 million shares of its stock at an average purchase price of $54.99 per share, which exhausted the availability under the repurchase plan. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $283.1 million compared to $359.3 million at December 31, 2011. 
Short-term investments were $307.7 million compared to $411.3 million at December 31, 2011. Long-term investments comprised entirely of auction rate securities, decreased from $23.2 million at December 31 to $19.9 million. 
Days outstanding for trade accounts receivable were 41.3 days at September 30, 2012, and 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 38.7 days at September 30, 2011. 
As sales outside the U.S. continued to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, we expect that days outstanding for receivables will increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally, in accordance with local practices in their respective countries. 
Inventories increased to $193.9 million, from $155.6 million at December 31, 2011. Average days of inventory were 65 days at September 30, 2012, which was lower than the 71.6 days of inventory at December 31, 2011. At September 30, 2012, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $28 million, $44.8 million at December 31, 2011, with an amortized cost basis of $20.8 million. 
Gross sales in October 2012 were approximately 28% higher than in October 2011. We are encouraged by the strong sales that have been experienced by the company in North America, Western Europe and Japan. We caution again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, and accordingly, should not be imputed to be or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize the numerous positive points that occurred during the quarter. The United States gross margins are healthy, and our 2012 third quarter gross margins for North America were only nominally lower than in the comparable 2011 third quarter. We are satisfied with the performance of our international expansion and investment. Our European business is profitable and the losses we sustained internationally were reduced in the quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. The U.S. Nielsen market statistic shows Monster Energy is outpacing the category. Our market share in the important convenience and gas channel in both units and dollars now exceeds that of Red Bull. 
According to Nielsen, our market share in the United Kingdom has exceeded 10% for the first time. We have reached agreements with Coca-Cola Hellenic for more favorable terms for distribution of our Monster line in certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Monster sales in Japan are very encouraging, and are exceeding our expectations. We are planning to launch Monster Energy in Korea within the next few months, and as we have largely overcome the product approval and label issues that we experienced with our Korean products earlier this year. Gross sales in 2012 -- in October 2012 were approximately 28% higher than in October 2011, and we have demonstrated that our products are safe, are properly labeled and that the caffeine content in a Monster Energy drink at approximately 10 milligrams per ounce, is less than 1/2 the milligrams per ounce of caffeine contained in a Starbucks brewed coffee. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you."

And we are working towards that at the moment. We launched in Japan in a sleek can, a 3 -- a 55-ml sleek can and we, there isn't -- we haven't been able to find a sleek can available in Japan, so we have been working with can companies to have their manufacturer mold to actually be able to supply us with a sleek can, because the alternative is, we'll go to -- we have to go to something like a 400, but it's a very stubby can, and we just didn't feel that was right for the brand. So we've -- the -- getting the right product produced in the right cans in those 2 countries has been a challenge, but we are actively working on doing so, because we obviously, we appreciate that it will remove the shipping damages and risks inherent in shipping as well as the shipping cost. And with the markets, but obviously what happens is, when you start a market, to make the investments and it will require some capital investments from us to do so as well, with the can companies and/or some of the packing companies in Japan. But until we saw the sales velocities and the viability of packing locally, it just didn't make sense to have those costs incurred upfront, and then try and launch, and we'll find out later whether your product was or wasn't viable in its velocity. Based on the velocity we're now seeing, it's been very positive, but the problem is it -- there've been higher costs of higher damages with that higher velocity. But it has accelerated our plan to go to local production, and we are working on it. We also did have some price increases in the U.K., from our packer. And we had some price variances and some damages. Here again, we had some losses, there was a number of changes that took place in some countries for regulatory reasons, and we ended up with some inventory excesses, which we're obviously trying to work through and to sell elsewhere. But we think we'll be able to work through that, so that it will more normalize more going forward as we continue to establish the brand and the company internationally."

That gives you a pretty smooth channel -- that's how sales are basically going year-on-year, that's the increase in the channel. Ordering patterns from our customers are what they are. It depends on timing of promotions, timing of orders. And so, I can't put any more color on it other than to say that, you look at the sales going through, and you've got to look at -- I know that everybody works off and looks at quarters, but at the end of the day, you also have to look at an annual base, which I think gives everybody a fairer and a more balanced view of the direction of the company, the brand, the sales, et cetera.

So there were, literally, were a whole lot of issues that again, just continued to face us in shipping these large distances. And it's just -- it's something that it's just difficult to ship full cans under pressure from the U.S. to Japan. We believe that we will be able to get this more under control as we continue to gain more experience in shipping and understanding Japanese requirements. But it got to a point where literally every case was -- had to be disassembled, examined can by can and then repacked, and that's where the costs became very high. And as a result, our margins very little, but we were there, we were pregnant, we were launching, and we needed to go, to continue and the result is, we've been able to establish our brand very strongly and very solidly in the Japanese market, but it certainly has been very costly for us, for all of these different regions. But as we go forward, we hope that we will avoid the damages, we're hoping we'll avoid having to continue these very costly labor and then manual inspections to satisfy the -- our Japanese customer and then retailers in Japan for our quality standards, which are just very, very exacting for us, compared to the standards normally acceptable in the U.S."

I think it had a nice increase in bottom line, and they are continuing to improve the effectiveness in Europe. But we have -- we've still got a lot of individual countries where we were at the very early stages of developing the brand. And as a result, we continue to invest quite heavily in trade development personnel, sales personnel, sampling, in order to make sure the product becomes established in each of these countries. Although they're -- Europe, again, it's not one country like America. I mean, each country has to be dealt with individually, different languages, different sales teams, different support, in order to get your brand. And even though the countries are small, you really have to support your brand. And that becomes costly, until you get to a sort of a -- at least a minimum level of sales in that country, and then things will start kicking in. Because we've got some really good shares in small countries, but it is costly. In countries like Lithuania and Latvia, we're up to 15% market shares, but when you look at it actual case terms, it's very small, so to support that and get the product established there, it has been expensive. But it is starting to get -- kick into its own. We've got very nice shares in certain of the markets like Greece, Bulgaria, some of those smaller markets in the Eastern block. But then there are others that are still sort of -- we just -- still trying to get out of the blocks. So while we are continuing to see some good change from losses to profits in those countries, they will continue to improve. We're also obviously looking at trying to be a little more strict with our marketing spend to support the brands, we've -- a lot of the international properties that we started with in order to give the brand international credibility. We are trying to avoid, obviously, increasing that spend so that we actually end up with a spend per case lower. It is going the right way, it's happened for the last 2 years, and so now, we believe that going forward, we will be able to start showing better bottom line profit going out of -- coming out of Europe."

Based on the Nielsen reports, Monster is continuing to close the gap with Red Bull in dollars, while in units, Monster is continuing to increase its lead over Red Bull.
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased 15.2% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 17% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 21.3%. Java Monster sales and market share continues to show improvement and Java Monster is still the market leader in this space. We are pleased to report that sales of our new noncarbonated Monster Rehab Tea plus lemonade energy drink with electrolytes, which we launched in the first quarter of 2011 continues to accelerate, and this SKU continues to be one of our top-selling Monster products. Based on Nielsen data for the convenience and gas channel, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, sales of Rehab are now more than double the sales of the main competitive noncarbonated energy drink. 
During the fourth quarter, we launched 3 line extensions through our successful Monster Rehab energy drink, namely Rojo Tea + Energy, Green Tea + Energy and ProTEAn + Energy. We're in the process of launching a further line extension in the Monster Rehab line namely Tea + Orangeades + Energy and also proceeding with our planned launch of Uber Monster Energy drinks in glass bottles during the first half of 2012. Monster is performing well in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended January 14, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%. Monster sales increased 23% and our market share grew 2.3 points to 24.6% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 11% and its market share decreased 0.2 points to 37.4% as compared to the same period last year over 2010. Rockstar sales increased 19%. Its market share increased by 0.9 points to 15%. 
According to Nielsen, sales in the energy drink category in Mexico grew 11.4% in December 2011 over December 2010. Sales of Monster Energy in Mexico, in December 2011, grew 21.1% over the same month in 2010, while sales of Red Bull were 12.1% lower. Monster's market share in Mexico, December 2011, increased by 2.8 points to 34.2% over the same period in 2010. This excludes Java Monster, bringing it closer to Red Bull's market share in Mexico, which dropped to 9.8 points to 36.8% over the same period. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 31.1% to $389.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, from $297.5 million in the same period in 2010. And contribution margin increased 24.9% from $103.7 million to $129.6 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 5.1% to $20.1 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $21.2 million for the same period in 2010. However, the company achieved a positive contribution of approximately $750,000 in the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, for the Warehouse segment, as compared to a negative contribution of almost $1 million in the comparable period in 2010. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 32.6% to $1,608,300,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, from $1,212,600,000 in the same period in 2010, and contribution margin increased 24.4% from $436.7 million to $543.2 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 4% to $94.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $91.3 million for the same period in 2010. And the Warehouse segment achieved a positive contribution margin of $4.3 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared to a negative contribution of almost $0.8 million in 2010. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 6% in 2010. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 12% in 2010. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in 2010. And gross sales, internationally, increased to 20% from 16% in the same period in 2010. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in 2010.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2011 amounted to $88.9 million compared to $66.4 million in the same quarter in 2010, and $116.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $381 million compared to $240.6 million in 2010. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to their customers overseas. Sales continued to progress well in Europe. Gross sales in EMEA, which is Europe, Middle East and South Africa, were 46.1% higher in the fourth quarter than in the comparable period in 2010. And for the full year, gross sales in Europe were 87.5% higher than in 2010. Sales in Western Europe and in the United Kingdom, in particular, grew faster than in Central and Eastern Europe. And Western Europe is now operating profitably.
In South Africa, we made a change to our distribution partner, and in the last quarter of 2011, sales improved substantially. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launch Monster Energy in Poland in February and are planning new additional launches in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in the first half of 2012. We are also planning additional launches in Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Asia during the remainder of 2012. Both gross and net sales for the comparable 12-month period ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter. If the sales attributable to the 2009 fourth quarter buy were being included in the 2010 first quarter in which the company previously estimated 4% to 6% of the 2009 fourth quarter growth sales, such sales would have had the effect of increasing the sales achieved in the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 by approximately 1%. The buying had no effect on 2011 sales in which we are now reporting.
Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea continue to meet our expectations. In 2011, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 37.1% over 2010. We're in the process of launching 3 new line extensions, namely Cranberry Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Sweet Tea, which will replace the Ceylon Tea, Unsweetened Tea and Green Tea variants -- Dark Green Tea variants, sorry. We are continuing to build distribution for Worx Energy. In 2012, we intend to bring our advertising expenditure for Worx Energy into line with Worx sales levels. We plan to introduce an additional extra strength version later 2012.
Gross profit margins achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 52.3% versus 51.6% in the comparable quarter in 2010. The increase in our overall gross margin percentage was largely due to a higher proportion of sales within the DSD segment of products in North America, which have a higher gross profit margin; increased sales of DSD products as compared to Warehouse products; product mix, which was partially offset by international sales where we achieved lower gross margin than in North America; and to a lesser extent to lower off-invoice and promotional allowances. We have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012, as well as a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar. In the light of the volatility of both commodities in world markets, we anticipate some increase in raw material costs in 2012. We do not believe that, at current levels, raw material cost increases will have a material negative effect on our margins.
Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter was a slightly higher than the same period in 2010. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.5% from 12.2% in the same period in 2010. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increases in commissions and royalty payments, premiums, advertising, and sponsorship and endorsement costs in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter in 2010. The increased cost for sampling teams, as well as trade development personnel, particularly in Europe, also contributed to the increase in selling expenses.
We are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, Australia and South America. Such trade development programs supplement our distribution partners respective sales forces to service and merchandise small independent stores. We believe that such activities play an important role in the establishment and development of our brand overseas. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll cost.
General and administrative costs, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative cost was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses, and in particular, increased costs of stock-based compensation. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9% from 11.5% in 2010. Sponsorship and endorsement costs were approximately $13.6 million higher than in 2010, but were lower as a percentage of net sales. Selling expenses for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 was also higher than in 2010 primarily due to increased expenditures for advertising, which was largely for the Worx Energy Shots, trade development costs, commissions and royalties, premiums and merchandise displays which was mainly coolers. 
In 2011, cost of goods as well as selling, general and administrative expenses in Western Europe were lower on a per case basis in local currencies than in 2010. In 2011, we invested extensively in Central and Eastern Europe, and more particularly, in newer markets in that region. Selling, general and administrative expenses in that region were higher on a per case basis in local currency in part due to lower case sales than planned. We are holding discussions with our distributor in Central Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chain between us. We believe that such discussions, combined with reduced operating costs per case, will enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012, in Central and Eastern Europe. We incurred higher promotional and marketing costs on a per case basis in Australia, in 2011, implementing our strategy to increase market share, which was achieved. We are working with our distributor in Australia to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and have also taken steps to reduce our cost of goods and overall operating cost in Australia. We believe that these measures will enable us to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012.
Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and, South America. These operating losses negatively affected our reported income for the 2011 year, and obviously, should be bore in mind in our evaluating results.
Our effective tax rate in the 2011 fourth quarter was 38.3% compared to 38.7% in the 2010 fourth quarter. The decrease in the 2011 fourth quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate, which was partially offset by an increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, was 37.4% compared to 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate this year and the establishment, in 2010, of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. The decrease in the annual effective tax rate was also partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $359.3 million compared to $354.8 million at December 31, 2010. Short-term investments were $411.3 million compared to $244.6 million at December 31, 2010. Long-term investments decreased from $44.2 million at December 31, 2010 to $23.2 million. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $35.9 million. Trade account receivables are now presented on a gross basis, as our promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $218.1 million from $166 million at December 31, 2010. Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 41.3 days at December 31, 2010. If trade account receivables had been presented on a net basis, days outstanding would have been 26.2 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 27.7 days at December 31, 2010. In the future, the company will only report days outstanding for receivables calculated on a basis consistent with the above new treatment. As sales outside the United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries.
Inventories increased to $155.6 million from $153.2 million at December 31, 2010. Average days of inventory was 72 days at December 31, 2011, which is lower than the 89 days of inventory at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $44.8 million, originally it was $79.6 million at December 31, 2010, with an amortized cost basis of $35.9 million. During the 2011 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $39.78 per share, pursuant to the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors in March 2010. These purchases exhausted the availability under the 2010 share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to $250 million out of the company's shares. No shares have been purchased, as yet, under this authorization.
Gross sales in January 2012 were approximately 34% higher than in January 2011. While we are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company, we caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days of the week in which holidays fall at the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. I would like to open the floor to questions. 
Thank you."

So we certainly have had an increase in staffing and we have taken on a new Senior Vice President, Don Blaustein, who was previously President of Heineken to head up our international operations in Asia and South America regions, and Lat-Am regions. He's come on board. But he won't have affected these figures because he's come on board only in the last few weeks.

But the gross margins are, as a general rule, not -- there are some exceptions, but as a general rule, will be less. But again, the impact that those additional markets will have on the company, we believe will be small. The issue, which we don't know a lot about is as we continue to expand, again, is what will happen to cost like the bigger cost that we have, our apple juice and sugar, which are quite big components, as we've indicated -- as indicated earlier. We've largely covered our aluminum can side. But we do have -- we've got a reasonable proportion of our juice and sugar cost all uncovered. So those may go up as we see the year.

We think there's lot of opportunity. I think we're underrepresented in the Italian market. We have opportunity there. Some of the markets are starting to grow very nicely. We think we have a lot of growth left in markets like Spain, Germany and the U.K. where the brand is doing very, very nicely and in France, for that matter. Those are pretty big markets. In Central and Eastern Europe, we are looking at some additional markets which are quite large. Poland is probably the second largest market in Central and Eastern Europe. And in fact if you exclude Russia, it's the largest market, but certainly just after Russia. And that is a very big market in relation to some of the other smaller markets that we have gone into. Hungary was a nice market but they imposed a tax on energy drinks and anything with sugar. And that really has completely disrupted that market. So that is part of the sort of challenges we had this year. And the fall off in the fourth quarter was largely attributable to -- in sales in that area was attributable to that issue. But the Czech market is doing very nicely. So there are markets that are doing very nicely and will continue to grow. We think that we do have some expansion there. The Asian markets, we are looking at some pretty nice sized market in Korea and Japan. There are a couple of the smaller ones, that I indicated, which will be our smaller markets. And we're continuing to expand.
We believe, that we have a lot of upside and the Brazilian market, particularly in the other markets in South America where we're at -- we're pretty far advanced in having our products approved through -- meeting the regulatory requirements and in having planning -- launches planned. We've already started trade in Colombia very nicely and we're looking at Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina. So we believe those will also come on stream in the foreseeable future. And each of these markets just basically have their own maturity as you get to a certain size in the market, you're able to actually profitably support the infrastructure we need in these markets. The way we do business going into markets with a lot of support for sampling and for those sort of local marketing activities. And so once we get over the initial hump, the markets start becoming more profitable quite quickly and you know we've just paid our dues in a lot of the Central and Eastern European  markets and we are hopeful that we will continue to get better results in those countries this year."

Record net sales up 28.7% to $410 million and diluted earnings per share increasing 32.6% to $0.35 per share from $0.26 a share in the same quarter of 2010.

According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through January 21, 2012, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, excluding Wal-Mart, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including Shots, increased 16.4% versus the same period a year ago. Sales of Monster grew 23.6% in the 13-week period while sales of Red Bull increased by 18.7%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 19.1% and sales of 5-Hour increased by 14.3%. Sales of Amp decreased 7.2%.

Sales of Monster increased by 26.9% over last year, while sales of Red Bull increased by 18.1% over last year. Rockstar was up 18.6% while 5-Hour was up 9.9%. Amp was down 7%.

According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended January 21, 2012, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel including energy shots, in dollars, improved to 30.3% against Red Bull's share of 32.3%, Rockstar's share of 9.7% and 5-Hour's share of 10.6%. Based on the Nielsen reports, Monster is continuing to close the gap with Red Bull in dollars, while in units, Monster is continuing to increase its lead over Red Bull.
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, all outlets combined, sales of energy plus coffee drinks in dollars increased 15.2% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 17% higher than last year and Starbucks Double Shot energy was up 21.3%. Java Monster sales and market share continues to show improvement and Java Monster is still the market leader in this space. We are pleased to report that sales of our new noncarbonated Monster Rehab Tea plus lemonade energy drink with electrolytes, which we launched in the first quarter of 2011 continues to accelerate, and this SKU continues to be one of our top-selling Monster products. Based on Nielsen data for the convenience and gas channel, in the 13 weeks ended January 21, 2012, sales of Rehab are now more than double the sales of the main competitive noncarbonated energy drink. 
During the fourth quarter, we launched 3 line extensions through our successful Monster Rehab energy drink, namely Rojo Tea + Energy, Green Tea + Energy and ProTEAn + Energy. We're in the process of launching a further line extension in the Monster Rehab line namely Tea + Orangeades + Energy and also proceeding with our planned launch of Uber Monster Energy drinks in glass bottles during the first half of 2012. Monster is performing well in Canada. According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada for the 12 weeks ended January 14, 2012, the energy drink category grew 11%. Monster sales increased 23% and our market share grew 2.3 points to 24.6% over the same period last year. Red Bull sales increased 11% and its market share decreased 0.2 points to 37.4% as compared to the same period last year over 2010. Rockstar sales increased 19%.

According to Nielsen, sales in the energy drink category in Mexico grew 11.4% in December 2011 over December 2010. Sales of Monster Energy in Mexico, in December 2011, grew 21.1% over the same month in 2010, while sales of Red Bull were 12.1% lower. Monster's market share in Mexico, December 2011, increased by 2.8 points to 34.2% over the same period in 2010. This excludes Java Monster, bringing it closer to Red Bull's market share in Mexico, which dropped to 9.8 points to 36.8% over the same period. Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 31.1% to $389.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, from $297.5 million in the same period in 2010. And contribution margin increased 24.9% from $103.7 million to $129.6 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment decreased 5.1% to $20.1 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $21.2 million for the same period in 2010. However, the company achieved a positive contribution of approximately $750,000 in the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, for the Warehouse segment, as compared to a negative contribution of almost $1 million in the comparable period in 2010. 
Net sales for the company's DSD segment increased 32.6% to $1,608,300,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, from $1,212,600,000 in the same period in 2010, and contribution margin increased 24.4% from $436.7 million to $543.2 million. Net sales for the company's Warehouse segment increased 4% to $94.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared with $91.3 million for the same period in 2010. And the Warehouse segment achieved a positive contribution margin of $4.3 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, compared to a negative contribution of almost $0.8 million in 2010. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, gross sales to retail groceries, specialty chains and wholesalers represented 4% of gross sales, down from 6% in 2010. Gross sales to club stores, drug chains and mass merchandisers represented 10% of sales, down from 12% in 2010. Gross sales to full-service distributors represented 64% of sales, the same as in 2010. And gross sales, internationally, increased to 20% from 16% in the same period in 2010. Other sales were 2% for the period, the same as in 2010.
Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the fourth quarter of 2011 amounted to $88.9 million compared to $66.4 million in the same quarter in 2010, and $116.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Gross sales to customers outside the United States in the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $381 million compared to $240.6 million in 2010. Included in such sales are sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to their customers overseas. Sales continued to progress well in Europe. Gross sales in EMEA, which is Europe, Middle East and South Africa, were 46.1% higher in the fourth quarter than in the comparable period in 2010. And for the full year, gross sales in Europe were 87.5% higher than in 2010. Sales in Western Europe and in the United Kingdom, in particular, grew faster than in Central and Eastern Europe. And Western Europe is now operating profitably.
In South Africa, we made a change to our distribution partner, and in the last quarter of 2011, sales improved substantially. We are continuing with our expansion strategy into new international markets. We launch Monster Energy in Poland in February and are planning new additional launches in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in the first half of 2012. We are also planning additional launches in Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Asia during the remainder of 2012. Both gross and net sales for the comparable 12-month period ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by advanced purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter. If the sales attributable to the 2009 fourth quarter buy were being included in the 2010 first quarter in which the company previously estimated 4% to 6% of the 2009 fourth quarter growth sales, such sales would have had the effect of increasing the sales achieved in the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 by approximately 1%. The buying had no effect on 2011 sales in which we are now reporting.
Sales of Peace Tea ready-to-drink iced tea continue to meet our expectations. In 2011, gross sales of Peace Tea increased 37.1% over 2010. We're in the process of launching 3 new line extensions, namely Cranberry Tea, Pink Lemonade + Tea and Texas Style Sweet Tea, which will replace the Ceylon Tea, Unsweetened Tea and Green Tea variants -- Dark Green Tea variants, sorry. We are continuing to build distribution for Worx Energy. In 2012, we intend to bring our advertising expenditure for Worx Energy into line with Worx sales levels. We plan to introduce an additional extra strength version later 2012.
Gross profit margins achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 52.3% versus 51.6% in the comparable quarter in 2010. The increase in our overall gross margin percentage was largely due to a higher proportion of sales within the DSD segment of products in North America, which have a higher gross profit margin; increased sales of DSD products as compared to Warehouse products; product mix, which was partially offset by international sales where we achieved lower gross margin than in North America; and to a lesser extent to lower off-invoice and promotional allowances. We have covered a large portion of our anticipated requirements for aluminum cans in 2012, as well as a portion of our anticipated requirements for apple juice and sugar. In the light of the volatility of both commodities in world markets, we anticipate some increase in raw material costs in 2012. We do not believe that, at current levels, raw material cost increases will have a material negative effect on our margins.
Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter was a slightly higher than the same period in 2010. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.5% from 12.2% in the same period in 2010. The increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to increases in commissions and royalty payments, premiums, advertising, and sponsorship and endorsement costs in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter in 2010. The increased cost for sampling teams, as well as trade development personnel, particularly in Europe, also contributed to the increase in selling expenses.
We are continuing to invest in the Monster brand internationally, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, Australia and South America. Such trade development programs supplement our distribution partners respective sales forces to service and merchandise small independent stores. We believe that such activities play an important role in the establishment and development of our brand overseas. The cost of product sampling teams and trade development personnel are included as part of our selling expenses and do not form part of our payroll cost.
General and administrative costs, although higher in dollars, decreased marginally as a percentage of net sales in the quarter. The increase in general and administrative cost was primarily attributable to increased payroll expenses, and in particular, increased costs of stock-based compensation. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.9% from 11.5% in 2010. Sponsorship and endorsement costs were approximately $13.6 million higher than in 2010, but were lower as a percentage of net sales. Selling expenses for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 was also higher than in 2010 primarily due to increased expenditures for advertising, which was largely for the Worx Energy Shots, trade development costs, commissions and royalties, premiums and merchandise displays which was mainly coolers. 
In 2011, cost of goods as well as selling, general and administrative expenses in Western Europe were lower on a per case basis in local currencies than in 2010. In 2011, we invested extensively in Central and Eastern Europe, and more particularly, in newer markets in that region. Selling, general and administrative expenses in that region were higher on a per case basis in local currency in part due to lower case sales than planned. We are holding discussions with our distributor in Central Eastern Europe to more equitably allocate the value chain between us. We believe that such discussions, combined with reduced operating costs per case, will enable us to achieve improved operating results in 2012, in Central and Eastern Europe. We incurred higher promotional and marketing costs on a per case basis in Australia, in 2011, implementing our strategy to increase market share, which was achieved. We are working with our distributor in Australia to increase their contribution towards promotional costs going forward and have also taken steps to reduce our cost of goods and overall operating cost in Australia. We believe that these measures will enable us to achieve improved results in Australia in 2012.
Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from our operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and, South America. These operating losses negatively affected our reported income for the 2011 year, and obviously, should be bore in mind in our evaluating results.
Our effective tax rate in the 2011 fourth quarter was 38.3% compared to 38.7% in the 2010 fourth quarter. The decrease in the 2011 fourth quarter effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate, which was partially offset by an increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, was 37.4% compared to 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate this year and the establishment, in 2010, of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. The decrease in the annual effective tax rate was also partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain, uncertain tax benefits.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $359.3 million compared to $354.8 million at December 31, 2010. Short-term investments were $411.3 million compared to $244.6 million at December 31, 2010. Long-term investments decreased from $44.2 million at December 31, 2010 to $23.2 million. Included in short and long-term investments are auction rate securities of $35.9 million. Trade account receivables are now presented on a gross basis, as our promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company does not allow net settlement, such as our full-service distributors. We continue to present that portion of the promotional allowances owed to those customers that the company allows net settlement on a net basis. On such basis, trade account receivables increased to $218.1 million from $166 million at December 31, 2010. Days outstanding for receivables, consistent with the above treatment, were 42.4 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 41.3 days at December 31, 2010. If trade account receivables had been presented on a net basis, days outstanding would have been 26.2 days at December 31, 2011, compared to 27.7 days at December 31, 2010. In the future, the company will only report days outstanding for receivables calculated on a basis consistent with the above new treatment. As sales outside the United States continue to increase as a proportion of our overall sales, days outstanding for receivables are expected to increase due to the different terms generally granted to customers internationally in accordance with local practices in their respective countries.
Inventories increased to $155.6 million from $153.2 million at December 31, 2010. Average days of inventory was 72 days at December 31, 2011, which is lower than the 89 days of inventory at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the company held auction rate securities with a face value of $44.8 million, originally it was $79.6 million at December 31, 2010, with an amortized cost basis of $35.9 million. During the 2011 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $39.78 per share, pursuant to the share repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors in March 2010. These purchases exhausted the availability under the 2010 share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to $250 million out of the company's shares. No shares have been purchased, as yet, under this authorization.
Gross sales in January 2012 were approximately 34% higher than in January 2011. While we are encouraged by the continuing strong sales that have been experienced by the company, we caution, again, that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days of the week in which holidays fall at the timing of promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. I would like to open the floor to questions. 
Thank you."

We think we have a lot of growth left in markets like Spain, Germany and the U.K. where the brand is doing very, very nicely and in France, for that matter. Those are pretty big markets. In Central and Eastern Europe, we are looking at some additional markets which are quite large. Poland is probably the second largest market in Central and Eastern Europe. And in fact if you exclude Russia, it's the largest market, but certainly just after Russia. And that is a very big market in relation to some of the other smaller markets that we have gone into. Hungary was a nice market but they imposed a tax on energy drinks and anything with sugar. And that really has completely disrupted that market. So that is part of the sort of challenges we had this year. And the fall off in the fourth quarter was largely attributable to -- in sales in that area was attributable to that issue. But the Czech market is doing very nicely. So there are markets that are doing very nicely and will continue to grow. We think that we do have some expansion there. The Asian markets, we are looking at some pretty nice sized market in Korea and Japan. There are a couple of the smaller ones, that I indicated, which will be our smaller markets. And we're continuing to expand.
We believe, that we have a lot of upside and the Brazilian market, particularly in the other markets in South America where we're at -- we're pretty far advanced in having our products approved through -- meeting the regulatory requirements and in having planning -- launches planned. We've already started trade in Colombia very nicely and we're looking at Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina. So we believe those will also come on stream in the foreseeable future. And each of these markets just basically have their own maturity as you get to a certain size in the market, you're able to actually profitably support the infrastructure we need in these markets. The way we do business going into markets with a lot of support for sampling and for those sort of local marketing activities. And so once we get over the initial hump, the markets start becoming more profitable quite quickly and you know we've just paid our dues in a lot of the Central and Eastern European  markets and we are hopeful that we will continue to get better results in those countries this year."

But thanks very much for taking the time to attend the call. We're pretty excited by the results that we've continued to be able to achieve with the brand, the continued expansion of the brand, increase of sales and profitability in the U.S. and North American markets. And the overseas markets have taken a little bit of time to get going but they are starting to put into place now. We are seeing some really nice increases in market share and results coming out of Western Europe. And so we are pretty encouraged by that factor. You just got to have a bit of patience. Things don't happen in a day. But we really are excited, going forward, by the gross sales that we've achieved in January. And I'll repeat that we are very, very encouraged by our Rehab brand. The whole line is going very well. It's been very well received by buyers and customers, as well as the consumer feedback we've heard is very, very positive for that line. So we're looking forward to having a good year this year and thank you for your support. Thank you."
