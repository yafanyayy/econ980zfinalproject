Our GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter were $2.72 per share on a diluted basis, despite the persistent challenging economic environment. Excluding some unusual items, EPS was $2.54, which is 7% up versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Our free cash flow is also strong, generating just shy of $0.5 billion. The exact number is $4.98 billion for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $4 billion, led by 8% growth in C3ISR, which partially offset headwinds in our other segments. We ended the year with sales of $15.2 billion, which is a 3% decrease when compared to 2010. 
Orders were 3.2 billion for the quarter and 14.8 billion for 2011, which resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.97 for the year. Our funded backlog was $10.7 billion at year end.
Overall, we returned over $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2011 through share repurchases and dividends, representing an increase overall of 13% in cash returned versus in 2010. And I'll note that since inception of our share repurchase plan, we have repurchased about 45 million shares or roughly 1/3 of our outstanding stock with about 13 million of those shares coming in 2011 alone. 
Our commitment to value and responsible deployment of cash extends our investment in technology and innovation despite the budget downturn, I read those remain a priority for us. We will continue in invest our cash in R&D and activities to expand our business space.
Looking at the business segments. ISR had strong performance showing solid growth on healthy customer demand. Our AM&M contract logistics support business performed well with recent competitive wins, a steadily increasing backlog and a growing market share. The difficult budget environment and lower JCA volume for AM&M were partially offset by CLS services were particularly for the armies C12 aerial Surveillance aircraft. Our Electro-Optical infrared integrated sensors business experienced increased volume within the Electronic Systems segment. The troop withdrawal from Iraq and the drawdown in Afghanistan resulted in program declines that continued to impact our services business. As I said at the onset of the call, L-3 has been able to demonstrate consistently strong program performance defined in part by operating more efficiently and anticipating our customer needs with innovative products and services.
That performance was recognized by the customer when our army fleet support unit received the 2011 Material Readiness award from the Army Aviation Association of America. This prestigious honor is awarded to a defense contractor that has made an outstanding contributions to the material readiness of army aviation. And given the upcoming recovery, that has is very happy going into 2012.
We continue to look closely at our operations to ensure that they align well with our production requirements and help us achieve maximum efficiencies. This involves making sure that our businesses are sized appropriately and are focused upon on delivering for our customers. We continued to integrate and consolidate our businesses with backhaul in mind. 
We're also concentrating on adding new capabilities that expand our product lines and broaden our customer base. In 2011, our fire businesses contributed about $160 million to our net sales. A good example of our strategy to add capability and broaden our base is the recently-announced acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical, which develops and manufactures specialized equipment such as submarine, photonic systems and periscopes, ship fire control systems, visual landing aids and ground EO and sensing systems. KEO also expands our base in the EO/IR market and strengthen our position as a mission-critical sensor systems provider.
KEO is a market leader and positioned in very high priority areas in the DoD budget, including the Virginia class submarine. It also creates a variety of technical synergies and pull through opportunities for us that enhance our offerings in situational awareness our customers. And KEO demonstrates how we successfully execute our cetacean strategy of carefully and selectively considering opportunities for excellent value and provide a good fit IR with our current mix of businesses. 
As you know, we've announced the acquisition in December. We expect it to close over the next couple of weeks. And again, KEO is a market leader in its space and when next combined with our existing EO/IR business, you can imagine some of the synergies we will see from the technology standpoint and the broadening of our portfolio products and customers. So really, it's a nice fit. We are excited about getting that close in the next couple of weeks.
With regards to M&A in general, we're going to continue the strategy of being vigilant and disciplined in seeking out opportunities that contribute to our growth and help us drive customer advances and expand our market positions. We've been very sensitive that the pricing on acquisitions that we want to be absolutely sure that we're going to be delivering shareholder value when we go forward.
Internationally, there are opportunities for L-3 including foreign military sales. We're already doing very well in certain regions. We have a wide range of products, both commercial and military, that are procured by international customers. This includes airborne ISR and centers, Aviation Security equipment, commercial shipbuilding, aviation products, sonar systems and unmanned and optionally piloted aircraft. We'll continue to look to expand internationally in areas that leads our strengths.
Regarding on an update on the Engility spinoff, we are proceeding on schedule. The management team and board are being assembled, and we anticipate IRS approval soon for the tax-free status of the spend. We expect the transaction to be completed by midyear around June 30. We believe in Engility's prospects going forward, independent of OCI constraints and with the streamlined operating structure to enhance its competitiveness. 
The remaining service businesses -- business which we're calling NSS or National Security solution have opportunities in areas where we have effective distribution channels in place. 
This allows us that for customers' end-to-end capabilities from sensors and products that securely move the data to processing systems that allowed the fire or government agency to use the data more effectively. The actions we're taking with Engility and NSS demonstrate our strategy of focusing on our core strengths in areas that align well with our customer priorities. Regarding the budget, as we're all aware, the President will submit his budget on February 13. 
Last week, Secretary Pineda provided some guidance on the budgeting process. He emphasized that the military will be smaller and leaner while remaining agile and technologically advanced. He also outlined a focus on operations in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. He stressed protecting and prioritizing investment in key technologies including fiber capabilities, special operations forces, missile defense and countering weapons of mass destruction. The new defense budget will produce about $260 billion of savings over the next 5 years. And the Pentagon feels that a further around the cuts will inflict severe damage to our National Security for generations to come. And that it continues to support a scenario that does not sacrifice military readiness and the administration of firms and commitment to maintaining military superiority with a leaner force structure.
The administration, as well as senior leaders in both the House and Senate are working hard to avoid take the station in favor of a recently robust DoD budget. 
The important message here is that we will continue to see the savings achieved by DoD's initiatives invested in many of our core strengths such as C3ISR, EO/IR systems, special operations and intelligence support and counterterrorism. And will benefit such programs as the Virginia class submarine, combat ship and amphibious ships, as well as a bit in recent maintenance on aircraft helicopters and aircraft carriers.  We believed L-3 size and Engility are assets in this environment in responding to customers need, particularly in light with the DoD's new direction of focusing on more quick strike global actions and less on protracted ground works.
We'll continue to monitor the situation closely as it evolves over the coming months, and we'll provide you updates on our quarterly calls as we normally would. In terms of some of the significant milestones and awards during the quarter, we just shared with you a few of them. In C3ISR, we continue to see follow-on orders for well over 6, which provides real-time battlefield communications between ground forces, ships, aircraft and UASS. We received contracts in support of sustainment repayment programs from both global Hawk and Preditor. We receive follow-on order for additional ships and equipment for the Virginia class subs, or program mentioned by Secretary Pineda as the DoD priority.
We received additional funding for upgrades and logistics works on existing Project Liberty aircraft, demonstrating our across the segment capability, with sensors and Communication Systems from Electronic Systems and C3ISR businesses and in service platform system support provided by AM&M.
We received funding for capability enhancements to our Spider, small manned ISR aircraft for government and the national military and civilian use. That's a new product that was introduced in 2011, about midyear. It's gotten a lot of attention on the international stage as an affordable ready off-the-shelf platform that customers can try before they fly. And we are expecting to get some traction or orders in 2012. 
For AM&M, we continue to see good performance on our army fleet support contract logistics service and SFS contracts. And we received orders for administration and integration projects from OEMs such as Bombardier. With respect to the Joint Cargo Aircraft as you know it, we're not anticipating any additional orders from the Air Force. 
Internationally, Australia is currently considering FMS purchase of 10 aircraft-s. But consistent with our prior guidance, we think we have IT pegged correctly. We're not anticipating any additional orders from the Air Force.
With regard to Electronic Systems. Our Link Simulation and Training division want to re-compete for the U.S. Air Force F-16 Training System. We continue to receive strong orders for WestCam sensors, including systems for the armies aerostat initiative or EMARSS and helicopter programs as well, warrior systems product received order from the Army under the storm TI program on airport Security. The ProVision ATD system has strong international interest, including an order from Ireland recently. Our upgrade of increasing systems in the field to the image-free automated protection configuration is proceeding well. And we received an order from, that's in Canada for checked baggage systems.
We have orders from SATCOM equipment including the FSMS sell of the systems to the Iraqi MoD and a competitive win to provide the satellite control system for the next satellite constellation. And partnership with Lufthansa, an airport operator freight port, we have successfully demonstrated back in December our green taxing technology, which does not require the use of aircraft engines while taxiing, thus reducing fuel usage and resulting emissions. Now not only does it not require the engines but you might imagine, it doesn't require any of the pushback equipment either. So these are using hub-mounted motors that L-3 has developed to move an entire airplane around the airport including pushback from the runway. While it's still early stages, I would tell you that this a good example of transitioning some of our technology to green energy and commercial applications. Now it's a long way to get the production, but we had a very good start with this successful demo because it was quite a technological feat to move an airplane given the weight with a small hub-mounted motor.
We also received orders for submarine equipment from the Turkish Navy and we're selected as the sonar supplier to Indonesia. In addition, we received a number of international orders for our sonars. In services, we received competitive win to continue our work providing C4I systems integration operational work for Spyware. We continue to make good progress on classified programs, including receiving customer accolades for excellence in operations and engineering support. We also continue to receive contracts in support of the DOI program, which is formally known as Linguist.
With regard to capital allocation and acquisitions, our commitment to shareholder value has been consistent in terms of our focus on being disciplined in how we deploy our cash. During the quarter, we used the cash flow to repurchase 158 million of common stock and paid dividends of $45 million for the quarter, resulting in about 1.15 of cash returned to shareholders in 2011, 13% over the comparable amount in the comparable mix in 2010 of buybacks and dividends. 
Our commitment to capital allocation also focuses on M&A. And at the same time, we remain committed to preserving our investment grade credit ratings. We'll continue to aggressively pursue value patient using our existing strategy of addressing customer priorities, managing costs to enhance competitiveness and grow earnings and balance capital deployment.
I'm going to turn it over to Ralph to go through some of the numbers in the fourth quarter and as 2012 guidance, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. So Ralph, take it away."

As Mike said, I'll add some comments about the fourth quarter results and talk about our 2012 guidance update. On the fourth quarter, our GAAP earnings share were $2.72. We had 2 unusual items affecting the quarterly results. First, we had a gain of $78 million or $0.77 of EPS related to the resolution of prior-year tax contingencies. And secondly, we had recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $57 million or $0.49. Now most of that charge was for a little impairment at our Marine Services business, a small business in Electronic Systems segment that was due to a decline in its projected operations and cash flows. for these unusual items, the 2011 fourth quarter results were generally in line with our outlook. 
EPS was about $0.10 higher than we expected. And what happened there was higher segment operating margin, lower taxes, lower interest expense and shares outstanding combined to offset declining sales and drive the growth in EPS.
Fourth quarter sales were $4 billion and $15 million, down 5.6% versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Sales were lower than we expected by about $140 million, with most of the actual versus guidance difference in the Electronic Systems segment.
I characterized the lower sales as endemic of the slowing and now declining U.S. defense budget, coupled with a shorter cycle major of a lot of our businesses.
Segment operating margin improved 20 basis points to 11% versus the fourth quarter of last year. And that was 50 basis points higher than we expected. And what happened there was we had an improvement in our sales mix while with higher products versus services sales plus a more favorable product sales mix. The individual segment results are covered in the earnings release.
Free cash flow was very robust at $438 million, up 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year, bringing free cash flow for the full year to a very healthy $1.3 billion.
Before I move onto the 2011 -- or sorry, 2012 guidance update, I want to add 1 point about the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge. As you know, L-3 has a large goodwill asset balance. And depending on how events unfold the next 12 to 24 months around the U.S. Defense budget, especially the outcome of the BCA sequester, it's conceivable that we can have additional impairments. And we'll monitor the situation as the events unfold over the next year or 2.
Moving on to the guidance update for 2012. It's unchanged although on a consolidated places for the initial guidance that we provided at our Investor Conference in December 6. Consolidated 2012 sales guidance is $14.4 billion to $14.6 billion, which is a decline of 4% to 5% versus 2011. At the midpoint, we expect the sales to decline of about $670 million with about $0.5 billion of that relating to the U.S. Military drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the 2012 segment guidance midpoints, we expect a 19% decline in Government Services. Sales for the other 3 segments net to about flat, with growth of 2% for C3ISR, flat sales at aircraft monetization maintenance and 2% decline for Electronic Systems.
The guidance does not include the electrooptical business acquisition that we announced on December 13. We expect to complete the acquisition sometime next month as Mike indicated, and that's when we'll include it in our guidance.
For the year ending December 31, 2012, we expect the KEO business to generate sales of about $165 million, with EBITDA of about $27 million. And that's before expected synergies, transaction expenses and purchase accounting adjustments. We believe that's an excellent acquisition and we look forward to adding it to L-3.
The consolidated operating margin guidance for next year is 2.1% declining 70 basis points versus 2011. Higher pension expenses this quarter is 30 basis point reduction. The rest of the margin decline is a combination of lower sales. product sales, mix changes, pricing pressure and OSB initiatives with the largest impacts affecting the Government Services segment.
We'll continue to aggressively manage core structures and our businesses and try to deliver better margin for 2012.
Free cash flow is expected to be about $1,170,000,000, declining versus 2011 due to lower operating income and higher income tax payments. And finally, taking a look at the first quarter, we expect sales to be somewhere between $3.4 billion and $3.5 million, with EPS of $1.85 to $1.90 per share and free cash flow of about $100 million. The operating margin in the first quarter should be in the mid-9% range.
The book-to-bill for the first quarter should be close to 0.95, and we expect the full year book-to-bill to be slightly less than 1.0. That concludes my comments. And we'll go to the Q&A now."

I said there's a possibility that the increase could be larger than it's been in the past. but I think over the last several years, we've increased annual run rate by about $0.20 a share. But that's a discussion that we'll have with our board. The general sentiment though is that our deployment is balanced between repurchases which leaves us the flexibility to be opportunistic in acquisitions when they come up. And of course, continue the dividend and purchase plan. We're very aggressive this year because of the weakness in the stock price and the great cash flow that we've been enjoying.

It's a better price that's certainly lower than it would have been a year ago and reflects market conditions. I think that the pullbacks as we've said of the prior year, meaning 2010, didn't recur to the same extent as in 2011, which indicate to me anyway that there's more realism in the expectations of sellers. Typically, January is a slow month going into the year, but there's an acceleration of deals that happened as companies complete the year-end exercises. And we see a steady supply of descriptive memorandum. I guess we call them memorandum of companies. I can tell you last year, there was no shortage. I know that we went through about 100 deals. We probably went to indications of interest on about half of them. But as you know, we closed maybe 2 with Kollmorgen being obviously the larger one and something that was very small. So being selective is kind of key here and it's not only getting companies at the right price. But there's a lot less room given where the budget is and the growth prospects right now. So you need to be very cognizant of your environment and what the prospect are, which we think we do well. And again, we're going to continue to be diligent in what we see and we're certainly interested in adding to our market-leading businesses. Where in the Kollmorgen case, we have a technology that is complementary to what we do in our EO/IR business, but it brings a different product set, a different platform set and different customer set to us and we can really lever the technology in creating more and better products. And that's what we're going to do. There's going to be more to come."

First of all, I think that the strength of our cash flow has been pretty much consistent throughout most of the company history. We have always been a strong generator of cash. What's driving the earnings of course is how we're deploying that cash, not only with the repurchase program, but also with accretive acquisitions and the fact that we've refinanced a good portion of our debt and lowered our interest charges consistently over the past 2 or 3 years or so. So in my experience, in history in this industry is that as volume declines, the working capital that we have invested in a particular program will liquidate and will keep the cash flow strong. And I go back to managing through the declines that went on in the early-to-mid '90s, and that was the effect that we saw, as working capital was liquidity, more cash gets generated. Candidly, I thought that will be in a place where our cash flow was lower because we're investing it in the new facilities and technologies because the top line's growing and I think we'll all agree we'd be happier. But it does give us a natural push in this environment that whether these declines that we're confident as long as we manage our programs, they'll take on undaunted risks, which we don't plan on. That we will be able to maintain the consistent cash flow generation that we have and be able to use the deployment of that cash to mature that bottom line and keep it modestly growing.

But yes I mean the margins are very directly with the level of commodity type services you're getting. It's directly a function of we see a competition where you have 12 to 15 companies show up, you have 1 where there's 3, depending on what the work to be done is. So there is clearly more margin compression in areas we have more competitors. If you wanted my perspective on that phenomenon as a cycle, what we've seen over the past cycles is that when that happens, you get companies that invariably will win on price that are not qualified to do the work or just really don't have the experience. And so, I caught a pendulum on the fact that we're all the way on the technical capability the right now. That I would expect to transition back to something more normal over years. And unfortunately, once a customer has a couple of bad experiences with contracts that aren't capable of doing the work, they're just qualifying them on price only. We've already experienced a pretty good drop in the composite margins in services to date. So of course, the question is how much more is there to go. Well I think after the Engility spinoff, the more stable Engility has experienced the drop more or has been meeting in terms of the volume of drop more than the rest of our services business. In terms of L-3's guidance just for example, our 2012 guidance is about 10.1% of the midpoint on margins post Engility, but you've taken up 40 basis points.

You may recall I said that we expect about half of our sales for 2012 to come out of funded backlog. Another 41% to come out of follow-on business and the rest will be re-competes and new business. So if you look at Electronic Systems, there's probably about 55% coming out of funded backlog. So a little more than the company average, but it tells you that this is a large amount of follow-on work to be booked to make the full year sales, and that's typically what's been. And that introduces the risk around short cycle. So in the past, when the budget was growing year-after-year, the short cycle nature of the business tended to help us because funds just seem to be more -- just seem to pop up when you wouldn't expect them and it costs upside on a follow on basis. Now in the declining budget situation, you have the inverse happening where there's more risk with respect to the follow-on work and that can be just due to some of the things that you talked about earlier today, some hesitation on the part of procurement officials concerning future budget levels. There's been some reprogramming that's happened in the past few years as the budgets have gotten tighter and is likely to continue and that's what creates the short cycle risk on the follow-on orders that we're seeing Electronic Systems and frankly, in other segments as well. So sooner or later, the cycle catches up to other businesses short or long, I'll just leave you with that thought."

There's no major structural issues I see within the company where we're just in the business that we are not going to be positioned and continue to be leaving players in the new world order of defense spending. And finally, I think watch this year is going to be the disconnect between the budget that's been passed and the fact that sequestration has been triggered and how Congress and the DoD get that reconciled and corrected. We'll keep our eye under the course because that's going to affect planning for 2013 and beyond. Given the statements that have been made though by both the Office of the President as well as the Pentagon and the members of Congress, there seems to be some unison -- and the military leadership by the way that the structure for the U.S. Armed Forces needs to be not hallowed out and have the technology edge that it enjoys today.

Our GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter were $2.72 per share on a diluted basis, despite the persistent challenging economic environment. Excluding some unusual items, EPS was $2.54, which is 7% up versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Our free cash flow is also strong, generating just shy of $0.5 billion. The exact number was $4.98 billion for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $4 billion, led by 8% growth in C^3ISR, which partially offset headwinds in our other segments. We ended the year with sales of $15.2 billion, which is a 3% decrease when compared to 2010. 
Orders were 3.2 billion for the quarter and 14.8 billion for 2011, which resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.97 for the year. Our funded backlog was $10.7 billion at year end.
Overall, we returned over $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2011 through share repurchases and dividends, representing an increase overall of 13% in cash returned versus 2010. And I'll note that since inception of our share repurchase plan, we have repurchased about 45 million shares or roughly 1/3 of our outstanding stock with about 13 million of those shares coming in 2011 alone. 
Our commitment to value and responsible deployment of cash extends our investment in technology and innovation despite the budget downturn, i-red does remain a priority for us. We will continue to invest our cash in R&D and other activities to expand our business space.
Looking at the business segments. ISR had strong performance, showing solid growth on healthy customer demand. Our AM&M contract logistics support business performed well with recent competitive wins, a steadily increasing backlog and a growing market share. A difficult budget environment and lower JCA volume for AM&M were partially offset by CLS services work particularly for the army's C12 aerial surveillance aircraft. Our Electro-Optical infrared integrated sensors business experienced increased volume within the Electronic Systems segment. The troop withdrawal from Iraq and the drawdown in Afghanistan resulted in program declines that continue to impact our services business. As I said at the onset of the call, L-3's been able to demonstrate consistently strong program performance defined in part by operating more efficiently and anticipating our customer needs with innovative products and services.
That performance was recognized by the customer when our army fleet support unit received the 2011 Materiel Readiness award from the Army Aviation Association of America. This prestigious honor is awarded to a defense contractor that has made an outstanding contributions to the materiel readiness of army aviation. And given the upcoming recompete, that has us very happy going into 2012.
We continue to look closely at our operations to ensure that they align well with our production requirements and help us achieve maximum efficiencies. This involves making sure that our businesses are sized appropriately and are focused upon delivering for our customers. We continue to integrate and consolidate our businesses with that goal in mind. 
We're also concentrating on adding new capabilities that expand our product lines and broaden our customer base. In 2011, our acquired businesses contributed about $160 million to our net sales. A good example of our strategy to add capability and broaden our base is the recently-announced acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical, which develops and manufactures specialized equipment such as submarine photonic systems and periscopes, ship fire control systems, visual landing aids and ground EO and sensor queuing systems. KEO also expands our base in the EO/IR market and strengthens our position as a mission-critical sensor systems provider.
KEO is a market leader and positioned in very high priority areas in the DoD budget, including the Virginia class submarine. It also creates a variety of technical synergies and pull through opportunities for us that enhance our offerings and situational awareness our customers. And KEO demonstrates how we successfully execute our acquisition strategy of thoughtfully and selectively considering opportunities that offer excellent value and provide a good fit with our current mix of businesses. 
Now as you know, we've announced the acquisition in December. We expect it to close over the next couple of weeks. And again, KEO is a market leader in its space and when that's combined with our existing EO/IR business, you can imagine some of the synergies we're going to see from the technology standpoint and the broadening of our portfolio products and customers. So it really is a nice fit, and we are excited about getting that close in the next couple of weeks.
With regards to M&A in general, we're going to continue the strategy of being vigilant and disciplined in seeking out opportunities that contribute to our growth and help us drive customer advances and expand our market positions. We've been very sensitive to pricing on acquisitions that we want to be absolutely sure that we're going to be delivering shareholder value when we go forward.
Internationally, there are opportunities for L-3, including foreign military sales. We're already doing very well in certain regions. We have a wide range of products, both commercial and military, that are procured by international customers. This includes airborne ISR and sensors, Aviation Security equipment, commercial shipbuilding, aviation products, sonar systems and unmanned and optionally piloted aircraft. We'll continue to look to expand internationally in areas that play to our strengths.
Regarding an update on the Engility spinoff, we're proceeding on schedule. The management team and board are being assembled, and we anticipate IRS approval soon for the tax-free status of the spin. We expect the transaction to be completed by midyear around June 30. We believe in Engility's prospects going forward, independent of OCI constraints and with a streamlined operating structure to enhance its competitiveness. 
The remaining service businesses -- business which we're calling NSS or National Security Solutions have opportunities in areas where we have effective distribution channels in place. 
This allows us to offer customers end-to-end capabilities, from sensors and products that securely move the data, to processing systems that allow the war fighter or government agencies to use the data more effectively. The action we're taking with Engility and NSS demonstrate our strategy of focusing on our core strengths in areas that align well with our customer priorities. Regarding the budget, as we're all aware, the President will submit his budget on February 13. 
Last week, Secretary Pineda provided some guidance on the budgeting process. He emphasized that the military will be smaller and leaner while remaining agile flexible and technologically advanced. He also outlined a focus on operations in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. He stressed protecting and prioritizing investments in key technologies including cyber capabilities, special operations forces, missile defense and countering weapons of mass destruction. The new defense budget will produce about $260 billion in savings over the next 5 years. And the Pentagon feels that a further round of cuts will inflict severe damage to our National Security for generations to come. Pineda continues to support a scenario that does not sacrifice military readiness and the administration affirms a commitment to maintaining military superiority with a leaner core structure.
The administration, as well as senior leaders in both the House and Senate are working hard to avoid sequestration in favor of a reasonably robust DoD budget. 
The important message here is that we will continue to see the savings achieved by DoD's initiatives invested in many of our core strengths, such as C^3ISR, EO/IR systems, special operations and intelligence support and counterterrorism. And will benefit such programs as the Virginia class submarine, Littoral combat ship and amphibious ships, as well as upgrades and reset maintenance on aircraft, helicopters and aircraft carriers.  We believed L-3's size and agility are assets in this environment in responding to customer needs, particularly in light with the DoD's new direction of focusing on more quick strike force global actions and less on protracted ground wars.
We'll continue to monitor this situation closely as it unfolds over the coming months, and we'll provide you updates on our quarterly calls as we normally would. In terms of some of the significant milestones and awards during the quarter, we'll just share with you a few of them. In C^3ISR, we continue to see follow-on orders for ROVER 6, which provides real-time battlefield communications between ground forces, ships, aircraft and UASs. We received contracts in support of sustainment programs for both Global Hawk and Predator. We received follow-on order for additional ships set equipment for the Virginia class subs, a program mentioned by Secretary Pineda as a DoD priority.
We received additional funding for upgrades and logistics work on existing Project Liberty aircraft, demonstrating our cross-business segment capability, with sensors and Communication Systems from Electronic Systems and C^3ISR businesses and in service platform systems support provided by AM&M.
We'll receive funding for capability enhancements to our SPDR, small manned ISR aircraft for government and national military and civilian use. That's a new product that was introduced in 2011, about midyear. It's gotten a lot of attention on the international stage as an affordable, ready off-the-shelf platform that customers can try before they fly. And we are expected to get some traction on orders in 2012. 
For AM&M, we continue to see good performance on our army fleet support contract logistics service and SFS contracts. And we received orders for car [ph] missionization and integration projects from OEMs such as Bombardier. With respect to C-27J, or the Joint Cargo Aircraft as you know it, we're not anticipating any additional orders from the Air Force. 
Internationally, Australia is currently considering an FMS purchase of 10 aircraft. But consistent with our prior guidance, we think we have it pegged correctly, we're not anticipating any additional orders from the Air Force.
With regard to Electronic Systems. Our Link Simulation and Training division want to recompete for the U.S. Air Force's F-16 Training System. We continue to receive strong orders for WestCam sensors, including systems for the army's aerostat initiative or PTDS, EMARSS and helicopter programs as well, Warrior Systems Products received order from the Army under the Storm PI program. On airport security, the ProVision ATD system has strong international interest, including an order from Ireland recently. Our upgrade of existing systems in the field to the image-free automated threat detection configuration is proceeding well. And we received an order from CAFSA, that's in Canada, for checked baggage systems.
We had orders for SATCOM equipment including the NFMS sale of VSAT systems to the Iraqi MoD and a competitive win to provide the satellite control system for the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation. In partnership with Lufthansa and airport operator Freight Port we have successfully demonstrated back in December our green taxing technology, which does not require the use of aircraft engines while taxiing, thus reducing fuel usage and resulting emissions. Now, not only does it not require the engines, but you might imagine, it doesn't require any of the pushback equipment either. So these are using hub-mounted Magnet Motors that L-3 has developed to move an entire airplane around the airport including pushback from the runway. While it's in its early stages, I would tell you that this a good example of transitioning some of our technology to ""green energy"" in commercial applications. Now, it's a long way to get to production, but we had a very good start with this successful demo because it was quite a technological feat to move an airplane given the weight with a small hub-mounted Magnet Motor.
We also received orders for submarine equipment from the Turkish Navy and we're selected as a sonar supplier to Indonesia. In addition, we received a number of international orders for our HELRAS sonars. In Services, we received a competitive win to continue our work providing C4I systems integration operational work for SPAWAR. We continued to make good progress on classified programs, including receiving customer accolades for excellence in operations and engineering support. We also continue to receive contracts in support of the DLITE program, which was formally known as Linguist.
With regard to capital allocation and acquisitions, our commitment to shareholder value has been consistent in terms of our focus on being disciplined in how we deploy our cash. During the quarter, we used the cash flow to repurchase 158 million of common stock and paid dividends of $45 million for the quarter, resulting in about $1.15 of cash returned to shareholders in 2011, 13% over the comparable amount in the comparable mix in 2010 of buybacks and dividends. 
Our commitment to capital allocation also focuses on M&A. And at the same time, we remain committed to preserving our investment grade credit ratings. We'll continue to aggressively pursue value creation using our existing strategy of addressing customer priorities, managing costs to enhance competitiveness and grow earnings and balance capital deployment.
I'm going to turn it over to Ralph to go through some of the numbers in the fourth quarter and his 2012 guidance, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. So Ralph, take it away."

As Mike said, I'll add some comments about the fourth quarter results and talk about our 2012 guidance update. On the fourth quarter, our GAAP earnings per share were $2.72. We had 2 unusual items affecting the quarter",808,"Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning. As Mike said, I'll add some comments about the fourth quarter results and talk about our 2012 guidance update. On the fourth quarter, our GAAP earnings per share were $2.72. We had 2 unusual items affecting the quarterly results. First, we had a gain of $78 million or $0.77 of EPS related to the resolution of prior-year tax contingencies. And secondly, we had recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $57 million or $0.49. Now most of that charge was for the -- a goodwill impairment at our Marine Services business, a small business in Electronic Systems segment that was due to a decline in its projected operations and cash flows. Except for these unusual items, the 2011 fourth quarter results were generally in line with our outlook. 
EPS was about $0.10 higher than we expected. And what happened there was higher segment operating margin, lower taxes, lower interest expense and shares outstanding combined to offset declining sales and drive the growth in EPS.
Fourth quarter sales were $4 billion and $15 million, down 5.6% versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Those sales were lower than we expected by about $140 million, with most of the actual versus guidance difference in the Electronic Systems segment.
I characterized the lower sales as endemic of the slowing and now declining U.S. defense budget, coupled with a shorter cycle major of a lot of our businesses.
Segment operating margin improved 20 basis points to 11% versus the fourth quarter of last year. And that was 50 basis points higher than we expected. And what happened there was we had an improvement in our sales mix while with higher products versus services sales plus a more favorable product sales mix. The individual segment results are covered in the earnings release.
Free cash flow was very robust at $438 million, up 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year, bringing free cash flow for the full year to a very healthy $1.3 billion.
Before I move on to the 2011 -- or sorry, 2012 guidance update, I want to add 1 point about the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge. As you know, L-3 has a large goodwill asset balance. And depending on how events unfold the next 12 to 24 months around the U.S. Defense budget, especially the outcome of the BCA sequester, it's conceivable that we can have additional goodwill impairments. And we'll monitor the situation as events unfold over the next year or 2.
Moving on to the guidance update for 2012. It's unchanged, both on a consolidated and segmented basis, from our initial guidance that we provided at our Investor Conference on December 6. Consolidated 2012 sales guidance is $14.4 billion to $14.6 billion, which is a decline of 4% to 5% versus 2011. At the midpoint, we expect a sales decline of about $670 million, with about $0.5 billion of that relating to the U.S. Military drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the 2012 segment guidance midpoints, we expect a 19% decline in Government Services. Sales for the other 3 segments net to about flat, with growth of 2% for C^3ISR, flat sales at aircraft modernization maintenance and 2% decline for Electronic Systems.
The guidance does not include the Kollmorgen Electro-Optical business acquisition that we announced on December 13. We expect to complete that acquisition sometime next month as Mike indicated, and that's when we'll include it in our guidance.
For the year ending December 31, 2012, we expect the KEO business to generate sales of about $165 million, with EBITDA of about $27 million. And that's before expected synergies, transaction expenses and purchase accounting adjustments. And we believe that's an excellent acquisition and we look forward to adding it to L-3.
The consolidated operating margin guidance for next year is 10.1%, declining 70 basis points versus 2011. Higher pension expense is causing a 30 basis point reduction. The rest of the margin decline is a combination of lower sales, product sales, mix changes, pricing pressure and OSB initiatives with the largest impacts affecting the Government Services segment.
We'll continue to aggressively manage our core structures and our businesses and try to deliver better margin for 2012.
Free cash flow is expected to be about $1,170,000,000, declining versus 2011 due to lower operating income and higher income tax payments. And finally, taking a look at the first quarter, now we expect sales to be somewhere between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, with EPS of $1.85 to $1.90 per share and free cash flow of about $100 million. The operating margin in the first quarter should be in the mid-9% range.
The book-to-bill for the first quarter should be close to 0.95, and we expect the full year book-to-bill to be slightly less than 1.0. That concludes my comments. And we'll go to the Q&A now."

We saw some reduced funding on WIN-T, and the common to move products and our Marine power systems business areas we saw some slips on some tow to rate [ph] work for the U.S. Navy going into 2012.

I said there's a possibility that the increase could be larger than it's been in the past. But I think over the last several years, we've increased the annual run rate by about $0.20 a share. But that's a discussion that we'll have with our board. I -- the general sentiment though is that our deployment is fairly balanced between repurchases, which leave us the flexibility to be opportunistic in acquisitions when they come up. And of course, continue the dividend and the repurchase plan. It was very -- we're very aggressive this year because of the weakness in the stock price and the great cash flow that we've been enjoying. And I expect more of the same. The Engility spinoff is going to obviously have an impact on our recurring cash flow. There'll be a drop because the cash is going to go with Engility. And there'll be a dividend that we expect to receive that we anticipate to use to bring some of the leverage down and maintain the investment grade rating.

It's at a price that's certainly lower than it would have been a year ago and reflects market conditions. I think that the pullbacks or the failed auctions, as we've said of the prior year, meaning 2010, didn't recur to the same extent in 2011, which indicate to me anyway that there's a -- some more realism in the expectations of sellers. Typically, January is a slow month going into the year, but there's an acceleration of deals that happen as companies complete their year-end exercises. And we see a steady supply of descriptive memorandum. I guess we call them offering memorandum if they come out on companies. I can tell you last year, there was no shortage. I know that we went through about 100 deals. We probably went to indications of interest on about half of them. But as you know, we closed maybe 2, with Kollmorgen being obviously the larger one and something that was very small. So being selective is kind of key here and it's not only getting companies at the right price. But there's a lot less room for error, given where the budget is and the growth prospects right now. So you need to be very cognizant of your environment and what the prospects are, so which we think we do well. And again, we're going to continue to be diligent in what we see and we're certainly interested in adding to our market-leading businesses. Where, like in the Kollmorgen case, we have a technology that is complementary to what we do in our EO/IR business, but it brings a different product set, a different platform set and different customer set to us and we can really lever the technology in creating more and better products. And that's what we're going to continue to do. So there's going to be more to come."

No, first of all, I think that the strength of our cash flow has been pretty much consistent throughout most of the company's history. We have always been a strong generator of cash. What's driving the earnings, of course, is how we're deploying that cash, not only with the repurchase program, but also with accretive acquisitions and the fact that we've refinanced a good portion of our debt and lowered our interest charges consistently over the past 2 or 3 years or so. So in my experience, in history in this industry is that as volume declines, the working capital that we have invested in a particular program will liquidate and will keep the cash flow strong. And I go back to managing through the declines that went on in the early-to-mid '90s, and that was the effect that you saw, as working capital was liquidated, more cash gets generated. Candidly, I'd rather be in a place where our cash flow was lower because we're investing it in new facilities and technologies because the top line's growing, and I think we would all agree we'd be happier. But it does give us a natural cushion in this environment, that whether these declines that we're confident that as long as we manage our programs, and don't take on unbounded risks, which we don't plan on. That we will be able to maintain the consistent cash flow generation that we have and be able to use the deployment of that cash to buttress that bottom line and keep it modestly growing.

The other lesson learned in the '90s is where defense companies got off the reservation and went into things like space communications and whatnot, it was not a happy story. So I -- instead of saying out of the defense space, I would rather focus you on what things we can do in L-3 to move our portfolio that's more in those segments of defense that are growing, or in areas of adjacency. I referenced the green taxi or green taxi earlier in this conversation or where things that if it's IT and healthcare for example, which by way, I don't mean that to mean I'm planning anything in that space. I'm just using it as an example. Or things where -- we can take the technology that we are comfortable with and bring it to a broader marketplace and that could be other customers within the DoD or intel intercommunity within the federal government or in the commercial space, in certain areas of commercial space, certainly more the industrial areas and not the consumer products areas because we're not built to those kind of distribution channels. And those are the areas that we focus on and I advanced to all our group presidents to come in with ideas for expanding their market applications. And some of it could be using EO/IR or sensor technology for things like agriculture or domestic security means like guarding critical infrastructure pipelines, et cetera. So I mean we are committed to staying very close to home in terms of our core areas and not wandering too far outside our areas of expertise. But we have a treasure trove of technology here. And I think with a little bit of innovation and imagination, they are applicable outside into a broader marketplace."

But, yes, I mean the margins are very directly with the level of type -- commodity type services you're bidding. It's directly a function of we see a competition where you have 12 to 15 companies show up, you have 1 where there's 3, depending on what the work to be done is. So there is clearly more margin compression in areas we have more competitors. If you wanted my perspective on that phenomenon as a cycle, what we've seen over the past cycles is that when that happens, you get companies that invariably will win on price that are not qualified to do the work, or just really don't have the experience. And I -- so, I call it the pendulum effect and we're all the way at the price trumps technical capability right now. That I would expect to transition back to something more normal over years. And unfortunately, once a customer has a couple of bad experiences with contractors that aren't capable of doing the work, where they're just qualifying them on price only. I -- we've already experienced a pretty good drop in the composite margins in services to date. So the question is how much more is there to go. Well I think after the Engility spinoff, they'll be more stable. Engility has experienced the drop more or has been leading in terms of the volume of drop more than the rest of our services business. In terms of L-3's guidance, just for example, our 2012 guidance is about 10.1% of the midpoint on margins post Engility, but you've taken up 40 basis points. You can see where the bulk of that weakness has been happening. In terms of win rate, Ralph, what could you add on the win rates?"

And you may recall I said that we expect about half of our sales for 2012 to come out of funded backlog. Another 41% to come out of follow-on business and then the rest will be recompetes and new business. So if you look at Electronic Systems, there's probably about 55% coming out of funded backlog. So a little more than the company average, but it tells you that there's a large amount of follow-on work to be booked to make the full year sales, and that's typically where it's been. And that introduces the risks around short cycle. So in the past, when the budget was growing year-after-year, the short cycle nature of the business tended to help us because funds just seem to be more -- they just seem to pop up when you wouldn't expect them and just to cause upside on the follow on business. Now in the declining budget situation, you have the inverse happening, where there's more risk with respect to the follow-on work and that could be just due to some of the things that we talked about earlier today, some hesitation on the part of procurement officials concerning future budget levels. There's been some reprogramming that's happened the past few years as the budgets have gotten tighter. That's likely to continue, and that's what creates the short cycle risks on the follow-on orders that we're seeing in Electronic Systems and frankly, in our other segments as well. So sooner or later, the cycle catches up to all businesses, short and long. I'll just leave you with that thought."

I know we're running a little bit over.

We'll keep our eye on the course because that's going to affect planning for 2013 and beyond. Given the statements that have been made though by both the Office of the President as well as the Pentagon and leading members of Congress, there seems to be some unison -- and the military leadership by the way, that the structure for the U.S. Armed Forces needs to be not hallowed out and have the technology edge that it enjoys today.

Our GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter were $2.72 per share on a diluted basis, despite the persistent challenging economic environment. Excluding some unusual items, EPS was $2.54, which is 7% up versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Our free cash flow is also strong, generating just shy of $0.5 billion. The exact number was $498 million for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $4 billion, led by 8% growth in C^3ISR, which partially offset headwinds in our other segments. We ended the year with sales of $15.2 billion, which is a 3% decrease when compared to 2010. 
Orders were $3.2 billion for the quarter and $14.8 billion for 2011, which resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.97 for the year. Our funded backlog was $10.7 billion at year end.
Overall, we returned over $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2011 through share repurchases and dividends, representing an increase overall of 13% in cash returned versus 2010. And I'll note that since inception of our share repurchase plan, we have repurchased about 45 million shares or roughly 1/3 of our outstanding stock with about 13 million of those shares coming in 2011 alone. 
Our commitment to value and responsible deployment of cash extends to our investment in technology and innovation despite the budget downturn, I-red does remain a priority for us. We will continue to invest our cash in R&D and other activities to expand our business space.
Looking at the business segments. ISR had strong performance, showing solid growth on healthy customer demand. Our AM&M contract logistics support business performed well with recent competitive wins, a steadily increasing backlog and a growing market share. A difficult budget environment and lower JCA volume for AM&M were partially offset by CLS services work particularly for the army's C12 aerial surveillance aircraft. Our Electro-Optical infrared integrated sensors business experienced increased volume within the Electronic Systems segment. The troop withdrawal from Iraq and the drawdown in Afghanistan resulted in program declines that continue to impact our services business. As I said at the onset of the call, L-3's been able to demonstrate consistently strong program performance defined in part by operating more efficiently and anticipating our customer needs with innovative products and services.
That performance was recognized by the customer when our army fleet support unit received the 2011 Materiel Readiness Award from the Army Aviation Association of America. This prestigious honor is awarded to a defense contractor that has made an outstanding contributions to the material readiness of army aviation. And given the upcoming recompete, that has us very happy going into 2012.
We continue to look closely at our operations to ensure that they align well with our production requirements and help us achieve maximum efficiencies. This involves making sure that our businesses are sized appropriately and are focused upon delivering for our customers. We continue to integrate and consolidate our businesses with that goal in mind. 
We're also concentrating on adding new capabilities that expand our product lines and broaden our customer base. In 2011, our acquired businesses contributed about $160 million to our net sales. A good example of our strategy to add capability and broaden our base is the recently announced acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical, which develops and manufactures specialized equipment such as submarine photonic systems and periscopes, ship fire control systems, visual landing aids and ground EO and sensor queuing systems. KEO also expands our base in the EO/IR market and strengthens our position as a mission-critical sensor systems provider.
KEO is a market leader and positioned in very high priority areas in the DoD budget, including the Virginia class submarine. It also creates a variety of technical synergies and pull through opportunities for us that enhance our offerings and situational awareness for our customers. And KEO demonstrates how we successfully execute our acquisition strategy of thoughtfully and selectively considering opportunities that offer excellent value and provide a good fit with our current mix of businesses. 
Now as you know, we've announced the acquisition in December. We expect it to close over the next couple of weeks. And again, KEO is a market leader in its space and when that's combined with our existing EO/IR business, you can imagine some of the synergies we're going to see from the technology standpoint and the broadening of our portfolio products and customers. So it really is a nice fit, and we are excited about getting that closed in the next couple of weeks.
With regards to M&A in general, we're going to continue the strategy of being vigilant and disciplined in seeking out opportunities that contribute to our growth and help us drive customer advances and expand our market positions. We've been very sensitive to pricing on acquisitions. We want to be absolutely sure that we're going to be delivering shareholder value when we go forward.
Internationally, there are opportunities for L-3, including foreign military sales. We're already doing very well in certain regions. We have a wide range of products, both commercial and military, that are procured by international customers. This includes airborne ISR and sensors, Aviation Security equipment, commercial shipbuilding, aviation products, sonar systems and unmanned and optionally piloted aircraft. We'll continue to look to expand internationally in areas that play to our strengths.
Regarding an update on the Engility spinoff, we're proceeding on schedule. The management team and board are being assembled, and we anticipate IRS approval soon for the tax-free status of the spin. We expect the transaction to be completed by midyear around June 30. We believe in Engility's prospects going forward, independent of OCI constraints and with a streamlined operating structure to enhance its competitiveness. 
The remaining service businesses -- business which we're calling NSS or National Security Solutions have opportunities in areas where we have effective distribution channels in place. 
This allows us to offer customers end-to-end capabilities, from sensors and products that securely move the data, to processing systems that allow the war fighter or government agencies to use the data more effectively. The action we're taking with Engility and NSS demonstrate our strategy of focusing on our core strengths in areas that align well with our customer priorities. Regarding the budget, as we're all aware, the President will submit his budget on February 13. 
Last week, Secretary Pineda provided some guidance on the budgeting process. He emphasized that the military will be smaller and leaner while remaining agile flexible and technologically advanced. He also outlined a focus on operations in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. He stressed protecting and prioritizing investments in key technologies including cyber capabilities, special operations forces, missile defense and countering weapons of mass destruction. The new defense budget will produce about $260 billion in savings over the next 5 years. And the Pentagon feels that a further round of cuts would inflict severe damage to our National Security for generations to come. Pineda continues to support a scenario that does not sacrifice military readiness and the administration affirms a commitment to maintaining military superiority with a leaner core structure.
The administration, as well as senior leaders in both the House and Senate are working hard to avoid sequestration in favor of a reasonably robust DoD budget. 
The important message here is that we will continue to see the savings achieved by DoD's initiatives invested in many of our core strengths, such as C^3ISR, EO/IR systems, special operations and intelligence support and counterterrorism. And will benefit such programs as the Virginia class submarine, littoral combat ship and amphibious ships, as well as upgrades and reset maintenance on aircraft, helicopters and aircraft carriers. We believe L-3's size and agility are assets in this environment in responding to customer needs, particularly in light of the DoD's new direction of focusing on more quick strike force global actions and less on protracted ground wars.
We'll continue to monitor the situation closely as it unfolds over the coming months, and we'll provide you updates on our quarterly calls as we normally would. In terms of some of the significant milestones and awards during the quarter, let me just share with you a few of them. In C^3ISR, we continue to see follow-on orders for ROVER 6, which provides real-time battlefield communications between ground forces, ships, aircraft and UASs. We received contracts in support of sustainment programs for both Global Hawk and Predator. We received follow-on order for additional ship set equipment for the Virginia class sub, a program mentioned by Secretary Panetta as a DoD priority.
We received additional funding for upgrades and logistics work on existing Project Liberty aircraft, demonstrating our cross-business segment capability, with sensors and Communication Systems from Electronic Systems and C^3ISR businesses and in-service platform systems support provided by AM&M.
We'll receive funding for capability enhancements to our SPDR, small manned ISR aircraft for government and international military and civilian use. That's a new product that was introduced in 2011, about midyear. It's gotten a lot of attention on the international stage as an affordable, ready off-the-shelf platform that customers can try before they fly. And we are expected to get some traction on orders in 2012. 
For AM&M, we continue to see good performance on our army fleet support contract logistics service and SFS contracts. And we received orders for work on missionization and integration projects from OEMs such as Bombardier. With respect to C-27J, or the Joint Cargo Aircraft as you know it, we're not anticipating any additional orders from the Air Force. 
Internationally, Australia is currently considering an FMS purchase of 10 aircraft. But consistent with our prior guidance, we think we have it pegged correctly and we're not anticipating any additional orders from the Air Force.
With regard to Electronic Systems. Our Link Simulation and Training division want to recompete for the U.S. Air Force's F-16 Training System. We continue to receive strong orders for WestCam sensors, including systems for the army's aerostat initiative or PTDS, EMARSS and helicopter programs as well, Warrior Systems Products received an order from the Army under the Storm PI program. On airport security, the ProVision ATD system has strong international interest, including an order from Ireland recently. Our upgrade of existing systems in the field to the image-free automated threat detection configuration is proceeding well. And we received an order from CAFSA, that's in Canada, for checked baggage systems.
We had orders for SATCOM equipment including the NFMS sale of VSAT systems to the Iraqi MoD and a competitive win to provide the satellite control system for the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation. In partnership with Lufthansa and airport operator Freight Port we have successfully demonstrated back in December our green taxiing technology, which does not require the use of aircraft engines while taxiing, thus reducing fuel usage and resulting emissions. Now, not only does it not require the engines, but you might imagine, it doesn't require any of the pushback equipment either. So these are using hub-mounted Magnet Motors that L-3 has developed to move an entire airplane around the airport including pushback from the runway. While it's in its early stages, I would tell you that this a good example of transitioning some of our technology to ""green energy"" in commercial applications. Now, it's a long way to get to production, but we had a very good start with this successful demo because it was quite a technological feat to move an airplane given the weight with a small hub-mounted Magnet Motor.
We also received orders for submarine equipment from the Turkish Navy and we're selected as a sonar supplier to Indonesia. In addition, we received a number of international orders for our HELRAS sonars. In Services, we received a competitive win to continue our work providing C4I integration operational work for SPAWAR. We continued to make good progress on classified programs, including receiving customer accolades for excellence in operations and engineering support. We also continue to receive contracts in support of the DLITE program, which was formerly known as Linguist.
With regard to capital allocation and acquisitions, our commitment to shareholder value has been consistent in terms of our focus on being disciplined in how we deploy our cash. During the quarter, we used the cash flow to repurchase 158 million of common stock and paid dividends of $45 million for the quarter, resulting in about $1.15 of cash returned to shareholders in 2011, 13% over the comparable amount in the comparable mix in 2010 of buybacks and dividends. 
Our commitment to capital allocation also focuses on M&A. And at the same time, we remain committed to preserving our investment grade credit ratings.

I'm going to turn it over to Ralph to go through some of the numbers in the fourth quarter and his 2012 guidance, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. So Ralph, take it away."

As Mike said, I'll add some comments about the fourth quarter results and talk about our 2012 guidance update. On the fourth quarter, our GAAP earnings per share were $2.72. We had 2 unusual items affecting the quarter",808,"Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning. As Mike said, I'll add some comments about the fourth quarter results and talk about our 2012 guidance update. On the fourth quarter, our GAAP earnings per share were $2.72. We had 2 unusual items affecting the quarterly results. First, we had a gain of $78 million or $0.77 of EPS related to the resolution of prior-year tax contingencies. And secondly, we had recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $57 million or $0.49. Now most of that charge was for the -- a goodwill impairment at our Marine Services business, a small business in Electronic Systems segment that was due to a decline in its projected operations and cash flows. Except for these unusual items, the 2011 fourth quarter results were generally in line with our outlook. 
EPS was about $0.10 higher than we expected. And what happened there was higher segment operating margin, lower taxes, lower interest expense and shares outstanding combined to offset declining sales and drive the growth in EPS.
Fourth quarter sales were $4 billion and $15 million, down 5.6% versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Those sales were lower than we expected by about $140 million, with most of the actual versus guidance difference in the Electronic Systems segment.
I characterized the lower sales as endemic of the slowing and now declining U.S. defense budget, coupled with the shorter cycle nature of a lot of our businesses.
Segment operating margin improved 20 basis points to 11% versus the fourth quarter of last year. And that was 50 basis points higher than we expected. And what happened there was we had an improvement in our sales mix while with higher products versus services sales plus a more favorable product sales mix. The individual segment results are covered in the earnings release.
Free cash flow was very robust at $438 million, up 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year, bringing free cash flow for the full year to a very healthy $1.3 billion.
Before I move on to the 2011 -- or sorry, 2012 guidance update, I want to add one point about the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge. As you know, L-3 has a large goodwill asset balance. And depending on how events unfold the next 12 to 24 months around the U.S. Defense budget, especially the outcome of the BCA sequester, it's conceivable that we could have additional goodwill impairments. And we'll monitor the situation as events unfold over the next year or 2.
Moving on to the guidance update for 2012. It's unchanged, both on a consolidated and segment basis, from our initial guidance that we provided at our Investor Conference on December 6. Consolidated 2012 sales guidance is $14.4 billion to $14.6 billion, which is a decline of 4% to 5% versus 2011. At the midpoint, we expect a sales decline of about $670 million, with about $0.5 billion of that relating to the U.S. Military drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the 2012 segment guidance midpoints, we expect a 19% decline in Government Services. Sales for the other 3 segments net to about flat, with growth of 2% for C^3ISR, flat sales at aircraft modernization maintenance and 2% decline for Electronic Systems.
The guidance does not include the Kollmorgen Electro-Optical business acquisition that we announced on December 13. We expect to complete that acquisition sometime next month as Mike indicated, and that's when we'll include it in our guidance.
For the year ending December 31, 2012, we expect the KEO business to generate sales of about $165 million, with EBITDA of about $27 million. And that's before expected synergies, transaction expenses and purchase accounting adjustments. And we believe that's an excellent acquisition and we look forward to adding it to L-3.
The consolidated operating margin guidance for next year is 10.1%, declining 70 basis points versus 2011. Higher pension expense is causing a 30 basis point reduction. The rest of the margin decline is a combination of lower sales, product sales mix changes, pricing pressure and OSD [ph] initiatives with the largest impacts affecting the Government Services segment.
We'll continue to aggressively manage our cost structures and our businesses and try to deliver better margin for 2012.
Free cash flow is expected to be about $1,170,000,000, declining versus 2011 due to lower operating income and higher income tax payments. And finally, taking a look at the first quarter, we expect sales to be somewhere between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, with EPS of $1.85 to $1.90 per share and free cash flow of about $100 million. The operating margin in the first quarter should be in the mid-9% range.
The book-to-bill for the first quarter should be close to 0.95, and we expect the full year book-to-bill to be slightly less than 1.0. That concludes my comments. And we'll go to the Q&A now."

I said there's a possibility that the increase could be larger than it's been in the past. But I think over the last several years, we've increased the annual run rate by about $0.20 a share. But that's a discussion that we'll have with our board. The general sentiment though is that our deployment is fairly balanced between repurchases, which leave us the flexibility to be opportunistic in acquisitions when they come up. And of course, continue the dividend and the recent purchase plan was very -- we were very aggressive this year because of the weakness in the stock price and the great cash flow that we've been enjoying. And I expect more of the same. The Engility spinoff is going to obviously have an impact on our recurring cash flow. There'll be a drop because the cash is going to go with Engility. And there'll be a dividend that we expect to receive that we anticipate to use to bring some of the leverage down and maintain the investment grade rating.

It's at a price that's certainly lower than it would have been a year ago and reflects market conditions. I think that the pullbacks or the failed auctions, as we've said of the prior year, meaning 2010, didn't recur to the same extent in 2011, which indicate to me anyway that there's a -- some more realism in the expectations of sellers. Typically, January is a slow month going into the year, but there's an acceleration of deals that happen as companies complete their year-end exercises. And we see a steady supply of descriptive memorandum. I guess we’d call them offering memorandum if they come out on companies. I can tell you last year, there was no shortage. I know that we went through about 100 deals. We probably went to indications of interest on about half of them. But as you know, we closed maybe 2, with Kollmorgen being obviously the larger one and something that was very small. So being selective is kind of key here and it's not only getting companies at the right price. But there's a lot less room for error, given where the budget is and the growth prospects right now. So you need to be very cognizant of your environment and what the prospects are, so which we think we do well. And again, we're going to continue to be diligent in what we see and we're certainly interested in adding to our market-leading businesses. Where, like in the Kollmorgen case, we have a technology that is complementary to what we do in our EO/IR business, but it brings a different product set, a different platform set and a different customer set to us and we can really lever the technology in creating more and better products. And that's what we're going to continue to do. So there's going to be more to come."

In fact, we've booked several things, the airport security equipment activity, is -- while competitive, it's all real. I mean those, they go forward with. Some of the longer-term areas where we're working, I believe are real, but I think that's a longer sales cycle than the ones I just mentioned, would be tank upgrades in Saudi Arabia and in Bahrain and potentially Oman, as well as some of the AM&M work regarding head of state airplanes that typically are coming out of the Middle East, where we expect to induct the first 747-800 in Waco to do a conversion, and we being the first on that platform will widen that market. It's going to be a popular plane to be upgrading given its size. So that's kind of the flavor of it.

I said it's conservative in the context of what we've experienced the last couple of years. So I think it's the correct appropriate sales guidance. If you look at 2012 compared to 2011, we had some headwinds in 2011 that we're not going to have in 2012, SOFSA's the biggest example of that. Plus the decline in JCA revenue is greater in '11 than it is in '12. So that's going to help to offset some of the other declining trends that we're experiencing in 2012. With respect to the major recompetitions and the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment, and that's really the only segment in 2012 that has any major recompetes and I define a major recompete as one that does and has sales in excess of $100 million per year. And I -- we explained at the Investor Conference that we think we adequately factored what could happen on those 2 recompetitions and to our sales guidance. And it's also mitigated by the fact that when those new contracts would begin, with the larger one being Fort Rucker, it doesn't happen until October 1."

No, first of all, I think that the strength of our cash flow has been pretty much consistent throughout most of the company's history. We have always been a strong generator of cash. What's driving the earnings, of course, is how we're deploying that cash, not only with the repurchase program, but also with accretive acquisitions and the fact that we've refinanced a good portion of our debt and lowered our interest charges consistently over the past 2 or 3 years or so. So in my experience, in history in this industry is that as volume declines, the working capital that we have invested in a particular program will liquidate and will keep the cash flow strong. And I go back to managing through the declines that went on in the early-to-mid '90s, and that was the effect that you saw, as working capital was liquidated, more cash gets generated. Candidly, I'd rather be in a place where our cash flow was lower because we're investing it in new facilities and technologies because the top line's growing, and I think we would all agree we'd be happier. But it does give us a natural cushion in this environment, that where there are these declines that we're confident that as long as we manage our programs, and don't take on unbounded risks, which we don't plan on, that we will be able to maintain the consistent cash flow generation that we have and be able to use the deployment of that cash to buttress that bottom line and keep it modestly growing.

I referenced the green taxi earlier in this conversation or things that if it's IT and healthcare for example, which by way, I don't mean that to mean I'm planning anything in that space. I'm just using it as an example. Or things where -- we can take the technology that we are comfortable with and bring it to a broader marketplace and that could be other customers within the DoD or intel intercommunity, within the federal government or in the commercial space, in certain areas of commercial space, generally the more industrial areas and not the consumer products areas because we're not built for those kind of distribution channels. And those are the areas that we focus on and I’ve asked all our group presidents to come in with ideas for expanding their market applications. And some of it could be using EO/IR or sensor technology for things like agriculture or domestic security means like guarding critical infrastructure pipelines, et cetera. So I mean we are committed to staying very close to home in terms of our core areas and not wandering too far outside our areas of expertise. But we have a treasure trove of technology here.

It's directly a function of we see a competition where you have 12 to 15 companies show up, you have one where there's 3, depending on what the work to be done is. So there is clearly more margin compression in areas where you have more competitors. If you wanted my perspective on that phenomenon as a cycle, what we've seen over the past cycles is that when that happens, you get companies that invariably will win on price that are not qualified to do the work, or just really don't have the experience. And I -- so, I call it the pendulum effect and we're all the way at the price trumps technical capability right now. That I would expect to transition back to something more normal over years, unfortunately once a customer has a couple of bad experiences with contractors that aren't capable of doing the work, where they're just qualifying them on price only. We've already experienced a pretty good drop in the composite margins in services to date. So the question is how much more is there to go. Well I think after the Engility spinoff, they'll be more stable. Engility has experienced the drop more or has been leading in terms of the volume of drop more than the rest of our services business. In terms of L-3's guidance, just for example, our 2012 guidance is about 10.1% of the midpoint on margins post Engility, but you've taken up 40 basis points.

And you may recall I said that we expect about half of our sales for 2012 to come out of funded backlog. Another 41% to come out of follow-on business and then the rest will be recompetes and new business. So if you look at Electronic Systems, there's probably about 55% coming out of funded backlog. So a little more than the company average, but it tells you that there's a large amount of follow-on work to be booked to make the full year sales, and that's typically where it's been. And that introduces the risks around short cycle. So in the past, when the budget was growing year-after-year, the short cycle nature of the business tended to help us because funds just seem to be more -- they just seem to pop up when you wouldn't expect them and that used to cause upside on the follow-on business. Now in the declining budget situation, you have the inverse happening, where there's more risk with respect to the follow-on work and that could be just due to some of the things that we talked about earlier today, some hesitation on the part of procurement officials concerning future budget levels. There's been some reprogramming that's happened the past few years as the budgets have gotten tighter. That's likely to continue, and that's what creates the short cycle risk on the follow-on orders that we're seeing in Electronic Systems and frankly, in our other segments as well. So sooner or later, the cycle catches up to all businesses, short and long. I'll just leave you with that thought."

The exact number was $498 million for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $4 billion, led by 8% growth in C^3ISR, which partially offset headwinds in our other segments. We ended the year with sales of $15.2 billion, which is a 3% decrease when compared to 2010. 
Orders were $3.2 billion for the quarter and $14.8 billion for 2011, which resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.97 for the year. Our funded backlog was $10.7 billion at year end.
Overall, we returned over $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2011 through share repurchases and dividends, representing an increase overall of 13% in cash returned versus 2010. And I'll note that since inception of our share repurchase plan, we have repurchased about 45 million shares or roughly 1/3 of our outstanding stock with about 13 million of those shares coming in 2011 alone. 
Our commitment to value and responsible deployment of cash extends to our investment in technology and innovation despite the budget downturn, I-red does remain a priority for us. We will continue to invest our cash in R&D and other activities to expand our business space.
Looking at the business segments. ISR had strong performance, showing solid growth on healthy customer demand. Our AM&M contract logistics support business performed well with recent competitive wins, a steadily increasing backlog and a growing market share. A difficult budget environment and lower JCA volume for AM&M were partially offset by CLS services work particularly for the army's C12 aerial surveillance aircraft. Our Electro-Optical infrared integrated sensors business experienced increased volume within the Electronic Systems segment. The troop withdrawal from Iraq and the drawdown in Afghanistan resulted in program declines that continue to impact our services business. As I said at the onset of the call, L-3's been able to demonstrate consistently strong program performance defined in part by operating more efficiently and anticipating our customer needs with innovative products and services.
That performance was recognized by the customer when our army fleet support unit received the 2011 Materiel Readiness Award from the Army Aviation Association of America. This prestigious honor is awarded to a defense contractor that has made an outstanding contributions to the material readiness of army aviation. And given the upcoming recompete, that has us very happy going into 2012.
We continue to look closely at our operations to ensure that they align well with our production requirements and help us achieve maximum efficiencies. This involves making sure that our businesses are sized appropriately and are focused upon delivering for our customers. We continue to integrate and consolidate our businesses with that goal in mind. 
We're also concentrating on adding new capabilities that expand our product lines and broaden our customer base. In 2011, our acquired businesses contributed about $160 million to our net sales. A good example of our strategy to add capability and broaden our base is the recently announced acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical, which develops and manufactures specialized equipment such as submarine photonic systems and periscopes, ship fire control systems, visual landing aids and ground EO and sensor queuing systems. KEO also expands our base in the EO/IR market and strengthens our position as a mission-critical sensor systems provider.
KEO is a market leader and positioned in very high priority areas in the DoD budget, including the Virginia class submarine. It also creates a variety of technical synergies and pull through opportunities for us that enhance our offerings and situational awareness for our customers. And KEO demonstrates how we successfully execute our acquisition strategy of thoughtfully and selectively considering opportunities that offer excellent value and provide a good fit with our current mix of businesses. 
Now as you know, we've announced the acquisition in December. We expect it to close over the next couple of weeks. And again, KEO is a market leader in its space and when that's combined with our existing EO/IR business, you can imagine some of the synergies we're going to see from the technology standpoint and the broadening of our portfolio products and customers. So it really is a nice fit, and we are excited about getting that closed in the next couple of weeks.
With regards to M&A in general, we're going to continue the strategy of being vigilant and disciplined in seeking out opportunities that contribute to our growth and help us drive customer advances and expand our market positions. We've been very sensitive to pricing on acquisitions. We want to be absolutely sure that we're going to be delivering shareholder value when we go forward.
Internationally, there are opportunities for L-3, including foreign military sales. We're already doing very well in certain regions. We have a wide range of products, both commercial and military, that are procured by international customers. This includes airborne ISR and sensors, Aviation Security equipment, commercial shipbuilding, aviation products, sonar systems and unmanned and optionally piloted aircraft. We'll continue to look to expand internationally in areas that play to our strengths.
Regarding an update on the Engility spinoff, we're proceeding on schedule. The management team and board are being assembled, and we anticipate IRS approval soon for the tax-free status of the spin. We expect the transaction to be completed by midyear around June 30. We believe in Engility's prospects going forward, independent of OCI constraints and with a streamlined operating structure to enhance its competitiveness. 
The remaining service businesses -- business which we're calling NSS or National Security Solutions have opportunities in areas where we have effective distribution channels in place. 
This allows us to offer customers end-to-end capabilities, from sensors and products that securely move the data, to processing systems that allow the war fighter or government agencies to use the data more effectively. The action we're taking with Engility and NSS demonstrate our strategy of focusing on our core strengths in areas that align well with our customer priorities. Regarding the budget, as we're all aware, the President will submit his budget on February 13. 
Last week, Secretary Pineda provided some guidance on the budgeting process. He emphasized that the military will be smaller and leaner while remaining agile flexible and technologically advanced. He also outlined a focus on operations in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. He stressed protecting and prioritizing investments in key technologies including cyber capabilities, special operations forces, missile defense and countering weapons of mass destruction. The new defense budget will produce about $260 billion in savings over the next 5 years. And the Pentagon feels that a further round of cuts would inflict severe damage to our National Security for generations to come. Pineda continues to support a scenario that does not sacrifice military readiness and the administration affirms a commitment to maintaining military superiority with a leaner core structure.
The administration, as well as senior leaders in both the House and Senate are working hard to avoid sequestration in favor of a reasonably robust DoD budget. 
The important message here is that we will continue to see the savings achieved by DoD's initiatives invested in many of our core strengths, such as C^3ISR, EO/IR systems, special operations and intelligence support and counterterrorism. And will benefit such programs as the Virginia class submarine, littoral combat ship and amphibious ships, as well as upgrades and reset maintenance on aircraft, helicopters and aircraft carriers. We believe L-3's size and agility are assets in this environment in responding to customer needs, particularly in light of the DoD's new direction of focusing on more quick strike force global actions and less on protracted ground wars.
We'll continue to monitor the situation closely as it unfolds over the coming months, and we'll provide you updates on our quarterly calls as we normally would. In terms of some of the significant milestones and awards during the quarter, let me just share with you a few of them. In C^3ISR, we continue to see follow-on orders for ROVER 6, which provides real-time battlefield communications between ground forces, ships, aircraft and UASs. We received contracts in support of sustainment programs for both Global Hawk and Predator. We received follow-on order for additional ship set equipment for the Virginia class sub, a program mentioned by Secretary Panetta as a DoD priority.
We received additional funding for upgrades and logistics work on existing Project Liberty aircraft, demonstrating our cross-business segment capability, with sensors and Communication Systems from Electronic Systems and C^3ISR businesses and in-service platform systems support provided by AM&M.
We'll receive funding for capability enhancements to our SPDR, small manned ISR aircraft for government and international military and civilian use. That's a new product that was introduced in 2011, about midyear. It's gotten a lot of attention on the international stage as an affordable, ready off-the-shelf platform that customers can try before they fly. And we are expected to get some traction on orders in 2012. 
For AM&M, we continue to see good performance on our army fleet support contract logistics service and SFS contracts. And we received orders for work on missionization and integration projects from OEMs such as Bombardier. With respect to C-27J, or the Joint Cargo Aircraft as you know it, we're not anticipating any additional orders from the Air Force. 
Internationally, Australia is currently considering an FMS purchase of 10 aircraft. But consistent with our prior guidance, we think we have it pegged correctly and we're not anticipating any additional orders from the Air Force.
With regard to Electronic Systems. Our Link Simulation and Training division want to recompete for the U.S. Air Force's F-16 Training System. We continue to receive strong orders for WestCam sensors, including systems for the army's aerostat initiative or PTDS, EMARSS and helicopter programs as well, Warrior Systems Products received an order from the Army under the Storm PI program. On airport security, the ProVision ATD system has strong international interest, including an order from Ireland recently. Our upgrade of existing systems in the field to the image-free automated threat detection configuration is proceeding well. And we received an order from CAFSA, that's in Canada, for checked baggage systems.
We had orders for SATCOM equipment including the NFMS sale of VSAT systems to the Iraqi MoD and a competitive win to provide the satellite control system for the Iridium NEXT satellite constellation. In partnership with Lufthansa and airport operator Freight Port we have successfully demonstrated back in December our green taxiing technology, which does not require the use of aircraft engines while taxiing, thus reducing fuel usage and resulting emissions. Now, not only does it not require the engines, but you might imagine, it doesn't require any of the pushback equipment either. So these are using hub-mounted Magnet Motors that L-3 has developed to move an entire airplane around the airport including pushback from the runway. While it's in its early stages, I would tell you that this a good example of transitioning some of our technology to ""green energy"" in commercial applications. Now, it's a long way to get to production, but we had a very good start with this successful demo because it was quite a technological feat to move an airplane given the weight with a small hub-mounted Magnet Motor.
We also received orders for submarine equipment from the Turkish Navy and we're selected as a sonar supplier to Indonesia. In addition, we received a number of international orders for our HELRAS sonars. In Services, we received a competitive win to continue our work providing C4I integration operational work for SPAWAR. We continued to make good progress on classified programs, including receiving customer accolades for excellence in operations and engineering support. We also continue to receive contracts in support of the DLITE program, which was formerly known as Linguist.
With regard to capital allocation and acquisitions, our commitment to shareholder value has been consistent in terms of our focus on being disciplined in how we deploy our cash. During the quarter, we used the cash flow to repurchase 158 million of common stock and paid dividends of $45 million for the quarter, resulting in about $1.15 of cash returned to shareholders in 2011, 13% over the comparable amount in the comparable mix in 2010 of buybacks and dividends. 
Our commitment to capital allocation also focuses on M&A. And at the same time, we remain committed to preserving our investment grade credit ratings. We'll continue to aggressively pursue value creation using our existing strategy of addressing customer priorities, managing costs to enhance competitiveness and grow earnings and balance capital deployment.
I'm going to turn it over to Ralph to go through some of the numbers in the fourth quarter and his 2012 guidance, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. So Ralph, take it away."
93538,146126007,213389,"L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2012",2012-01-31,"Earnings Calls","L3 Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning. As Mike said, I'll add some comments about the fourth quarter results and talk about our 2012 guidance update. On the fourth quarter, our GAAP earnings per share were $2.72. We had 2 unusual items affecting the quarter",808,"Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning. As Mike said, I'll add some comments about the fourth quarter results and talk about our 2012 guidance update. On the fourth quarter, our GAAP earnings per share were $2.72. We had 2 unusual items affecting the quarterly results. First, we had a gain of $78 million or $0.77 of EPS related to the resolution of prior-year tax contingencies. And secondly, we had recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $57 million or $0.49. Now most of that charge was for the -- a goodwill impairment at our Marine Services business, a small business in Electronic Systems segment that was due to a decline in its projected operations and cash flows. Except for these unusual items, the 2011 fourth quarter results were generally in line with our outlook. 
EPS was about $0.10 higher than we expected. And what happened there was higher segment operating margin, lower taxes, lower interest expense and shares outstanding combined to offset declining sales and drive the growth in EPS.
Fourth quarter sales were $4 billion and $15 million, down 5.6% versus the 2010 fourth quarter. Those sales were lower than we expected by about $140 million, with most of the actual versus guidance difference in the Electronic Systems segment.
I characterized the lower sales as endemic of the slowing and now declining U.S. defense budget, coupled with the shorter cycle nature of a lot of our businesses.
Segment operating margin improved 20 basis points to 11% versus the fourth quarter of last year. And that was 50 basis points higher than we expected. And what happened there was we had an improvement in our sales mix while with higher products versus services sales plus a more favorable product sales mix. The individual segment results are covered in the earnings release.
Free cash flow was very robust at $438 million, up 10% versus the fourth quarter of last year, bringing free cash flow for the full year to a very healthy $1.3 billion.
Before I move on to the 2011 -- or sorry, 2012 guidance update, I want to add one point about the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge. As you know, L-3 has a large goodwill asset balance. And depending on how events unfold the next 12 to 24 months around the U.S. Defense budget, especially the outcome of the BCA sequester, it's conceivable that we could have additional goodwill impairments. And we'll monitor the situation as events unfold over the next year or 2.
Moving on to the guidance update for 2012. It's unchanged, both on a consolidated and segment basis, from our initial guidance that we provided at our Investor Conference on December 6. Consolidated 2012 sales guidance is $14.4 billion to $14.6 billion, which is a decline of 4% to 5% versus 2011. At the midpoint, we expect a sales decline of about $670 million, with about $0.5 billion of that relating to the U.S. Military drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the 2012 segment guidance midpoints, we expect a 19% decline in Government Services. Sales for the other 3 segments net to about flat, with growth of 2% for C^3ISR, flat sales at aircraft modernization maintenance and 2% decline for Electronic Systems.
The guidance does not include the Kollmorgen Electro-Optical business acquisition that we announced on December 13. We expect to complete that acquisition sometime next month as Mike indicated, and that's when we'll include it in our guidance.
For the year ending December 31, 2012, we expect the KEO business to generate sales of about $165 million, with EBITDA of about $27 million. And that's before expected synergies, transaction expenses and purchase accounting adjustments. And we believe that's an excellent acquisition and we look forward to adding it to L-3.
The consolidated operating margin guidance for next year is 10.1%, declining 70 basis points versus 2011. Higher pension expense is causing a 30 basis point reduction. The rest of the margin decline is a combination of lower sales, product sales mix changes, pricing pressure and OSD [ph] initiatives with the largest impacts affecting the Government Services segment.
We'll continue to aggressively manage our cost structures and our businesses and try to deliver better margin for 2012.
Free cash flow is expected to be about $1,170,000,000, declining versus 2011 due to lower operating income and higher income tax payments. And finally, taking a look at the first quarter, we expect sales to be somewhere between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, with EPS of $1.85 to $1.90 per share and free cash flow of about $100 million. The operating margin in the first quarter should be in the mid-9% range.
The book-to-bill for the first quarter should be close to 0.95, and we expect the full year book-to-bill to be slightly less than 1.0. That concludes my comments. And we'll go to the Q&A now."

I said there's a possibility that the increase could be larger than it's been in the past. But I think over the last several years, we've increased the annual run rate by about $0.20 a share. But that's a discussion that we'll have with our board. The general sentiment though is that our deployment is fairly balanced between repurchases, which leave us the flexibility to be opportunistic in acquisitions when they come up. And of course, continue the dividend and the recent purchase plan was very -- we were very aggressive this year because of the weakness in the stock price and the great cash flow that we've been enjoying. And I expect more of the same. The Engility spinoff is going to obviously have an impact on our recurring cash flow. There'll be a drop because the cash is going to go with Engility. And there'll be a dividend that we expect to receive that we anticipate to use to bring some of the leverage down and maintain the investment grade rating.

It's at a price that's certainly lower than it would have been a year ago and reflects market conditions. I think that the pullbacks or the failed auctions, as we've said of the prior year, meaning 2010, didn't recur to the same extent in 2011, which indicate to me anyway that there's a -- some more realism in the expectations of sellers. Typically, January is a slow month going into the year, but there's an acceleration of deals that happen as companies complete their year-end exercises. And we see a steady supply of descriptive memorandum. I guess we’d call them offering memorandum if they come out on companies. I can tell you last year, there was no shortage. I know that we went through about 100 deals. We probably went to indications of interest on about half of them. But as you know, we closed maybe 2, with Kollmorgen being obviously the larger one and something that was very small. So being selective is kind of key here and it's not only getting companies at the right price. But there's a lot less room for error, given where the budget is and the growth prospects right now. So you need to be very cognizant of your environment and what the prospects are, so which we think we do well. And again, we're going to continue to be diligent in what we see and we're certainly interested in adding to our market-leading businesses. Where, like in the Kollmorgen case, we have a technology that is complementary to what we do in our EO/IR business, but it brings a different product set, a different platform set and a different customer set to us and we can really lever the technology in creating more and better products. And that's what we're going to continue to do. So there's going to be more to come."

Some of the longer-term areas where we're working, I believe are real, but I think that's a longer sales cycle than the ones I just mentioned, would be tank upgrades in Saudi Arabia and in Bahrain and potentially Oman, as well as some of the AM&M work regarding head of state airplanes that typically are coming out of the Middle East, where we expect to induct the first 747-800 in Waco to do a conversion, and we being the first on that platform will widen that market.

Plus the decline in JCA revenue is greater in '11 than it is in '12. So that's going to help to offset some of the other declining trends that we're experiencing in 2012.

No, first of all, I think that the strength of our cash flow has been pretty much consistent throughout most of the company's history. We have always been a strong generator of cash. What's driving the earnings, of course, is how we're deploying that cash, not only with the repurchase program, but also with accretive acquisitions and the fact that we've refinanced a good portion of our debt and lowered our interest charges consistently over the past 2 or 3 years or so. So in my experience, in history in this industry is that as volume declines, the working capital that we have invested in a particular program will liquidate and will keep the cash flow strong. And I go back to managing through the declines that went on in the early-to-mid '90s, and that was the effect that you saw, as working capital was liquidated, more cash gets generated. Candidly, I'd rather be in a place where our cash flow was lower because we're investing it in new facilities and technologies because the top line's growing, and I think we would all agree we'd be happier. But it does give us a natural cushion in this environment, that where there are these declines that we're confident that as long as we manage our programs, and don't take on unbounded risks, which we don't plan on, that we will be able to maintain the consistent cash flow generation that we have and be able to use the deployment of that cash to buttress that bottom line and keep it modestly growing.

So there is clearly more margin compression in areas where you have more competitors. If you wanted my perspective on that phenomenon as a cycle, what we've seen over the past cycles is that when that happens, you get companies that invariably will win on price that are not qualified to do the work, or just really don't have the experience. And I -- so, I call it the pendulum effect and we're all the way at the price trumps technical capability right now. That I would expect to transition back to something more normal over years, unfortunately once a customer has a couple of bad experiences with contractors that aren't capable of doing the work, where they're just qualifying them on price only. We've already experienced a pretty good drop in the composite margins in services to date. So the question is how much more is there to go. Well I think after the Engility spinoff, they'll be more stable. Engility has experienced the drop more or has been leading in terms of the volume of drop more than the rest of our services business. In terms of L-3's guidance, just for example, our 2012 guidance is about 10.1% of the midpoint on margins post Engility, but you've taken up 40 basis points.

And you may recall I said that we expect about half of our sales for 2012 to come out of funded backlog. Another 41% to come out of follow-on business and then the rest will be recompetes and new business. So if you look at Electronic Systems, there's probably about 55% coming out of funded backlog. So a little more than the company average, but it tells you that there's a large amount of follow-on work to be booked to make the full year sales, and that's typically where it's been. And that introduces the risks around short cycle. So in the past, when the budget was growing year-after-year, the short cycle nature of the business tended to help us because funds just seem to be more -- they just seem to pop up when you wouldn't expect them and that used to cause upside on the follow-on business. Now in the declining budget situation, you have the inverse happening, where there's more risk with respect to the follow-on work and that could be just due to some of the things that we talked about earlier today, some hesitation on the part of procurement officials concerning future budget levels. There's been some reprogramming that's happened the past few years as the budgets have gotten tighter. That's likely to continue, and that's what creates the short cycle risk on the follow-on orders that we're seeing in Electronic Systems and frankly, in our other segments as well. So sooner or later, the cycle catches up to all businesses, short and long. I'll just leave you with that thought."

We feel confident given where the DoD came out over the last couple of weeks on their priorities and choices that L-3 is positioned well. While not immune from declines in the budget, there's no major structural issues I see within the company where we're just in business areas that are not going to be positioned to continue to be leading players in the new world order of defense spending. And finally, I think the thing to watch this year is going to be the disconnect between the budget that's been passed and the fact that sequestration has been triggered and how Congress and the DoD get that reconciled and corrected. We'll keep our eye on it, of course, because that's going to affect planning for 2013 and beyond. Given the statements that have been made though by both the Office of the President as well as the Pentagon and leading members of Congress, there seems to be some unison -- and the military leadership by the way, that the structure for the U.S. Armed Forces needs to be not hollowed out and have the technology edge that it enjoys today.

Thanks for joining us. We started the year with a strong first quarter, overall. And as always I wanted to thank the 60,000 men and women of L-3 for just a tremendous job in the first quarter and their focus and excellent program execution. 
We saw a very strong orders combined with new awards, recompetes and follow-on business that drove the results this quarter. Internal funded orders were $4.1 billion, which generated a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14 and resulting in a backlog at March 31 of $11.4 billion. 
Net sales were $3.6 billion, which were up just -- essentially flat with the 2011 first quarter with diluted earnings per share of $2.01, up from $1.85 in last year's first quarter, that's about a 9% increase. 
The C3ISR business continued to lead with very strong performance, an increase in sales of about 16% compared to last year's first quarter. Driving the growth there were increased volumes for airborne ISR, logistics support and fleet management services for our DoD customers, as well as new business for international airborne ISR platforms. 
Recent competitive wins helped us deliver solid sales in the AM&M segment in the contract logistics support business area and an acquisition resulted in modest growth for Electronic Systems. Offsetting the sales performance were headwinds from the continued challenging defense environment where the largest empires was felt in the Government Services area. We continue to focus on growing and integrating businesses generating maximum efficiencies from operations that are aligned with both customer and production requirements. 
As a key aspect, a key aspect of our strategy is our disciplined approach to acquisitions where we continue to enhance our core business extending our addressable markets and strengthening our technology capabilities. 
In February, we completed the acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical, KEO. It's a good addition to L-3's integrated Sensor Systems business with technologies that provides situational awareness and enhance our existing products including infrared images, targeting systems and ISR sensors and laser range finders. Also we recently announced an agreement to acquire Thales' civil aircraft training and simulation business. With an installed base of over 540 simulators and a global customer base, this business complements the linked simulation business and will extend our addressable markets with a full range of total training systems solutions for both military and now commercial customers globally. We expect the Thales transaction to be completed this summer. 
We also completed an acquisition of a small company in the shipboard Electronic Control Systems called Mapco. It folds in well with our business unit, which designs customized high-end systems for the crew ship industry and mega yachts. Each of these acquisitions is a great example of our disciplined strategy of pursuing acquisition candidates that expand our markets, product offerings, technologies, and our customer base and deliver compelling valuations. 
The Engility spinoff, I just wanted to give you a brief update. In February 9, we received the private letter ruling from the IRS that supports the tax-free spinoff for L3 and its shareholders. On March 29, we filed our 410 registration statement with the SEC and are in the review process now. We're currently expected to complete the transaction on schedule by the end of June. Of course, the ultimate timing is subject to certain conditions and approvals, including completion of the SEC review. We are all looking forward to launching Engility and the opportunities for our National Security Solutions business that will bring L-3 as we sharpen our focus on building our evaluated products and solutions business. 
In terms of the budget, the final DoD budget continues to be unclear at this point. And as of today, Congress has no consensus plans to prevent the sequestration from becoming effective in early 2013. We're looking at just about the perfect storm later this year given the election, the probability that there'll have to be another increase to the debt ceiling and, of course, the sequestration trigger There's a lot of things moving around and that does disrupt the visibility that we used to having in this business, notwithstanding our backlog and our outlook is pretty stable, and we feel good about the year. 
Secretary Panetta and others in government industry have been very vocal about the devastating effects of this would have a national security and military readiness. We heard many times on the hill and also at the Pentagon that the sequestration will not likely happen. However, there's no indication of any build and, of course, it will not happen at this point, so we remain guarded on our review. 
The uncertainty, of course, creates a risk for the industrial base, including development and workforce issues. We understand that Secretary Panetta and others are committed to working with the lawmakers on both sides of the isles to avoid the sequestration without compromising U.S. Military superiority. 
The DoD is focused on communicating new priorities for the future with the focus on nimble, quick strike global military capability. Attention would begin to ship away from the Middle East and towards the Asia-Pacific region. This will require ISR assets, a strong naval presence and upgraded maritime systems and additional special operations forces and unmanned systems. And so we remain optimistic in our outlook in the DoD's emphasis on areas where L-3 has a strong base. 
Our focus on these and other key priority areas where we have world-class expertise and leadership positions is going to be key. 
In terms of the orders, significant orders and milestones for the quarter, let me just share some of them. In C3ISR, we continue to receive orders related to Project Liberty for ISR integration work. We also received additional orders for our battlefield intrusion systems for use by U.S. Army Infantry Platoon and military police units. 
In our Electronic Systems, we continue to receive strong orders from the DoD and law enforcement for WESCAM's MX Series of sensor systems. We captured 2 contracts for services like extension programs for the U.S. Navy's Landing Craft Air Cushion. This will support both East and West Coast projects. 
Our new KEO business unit was awarded a modification for product systems for installation on SSN-788 and 789 submarines. We received an additional order for binocular and night vision devices use by the U.S. Special Operations Command. We received an order for checked baggage system in Thailand. We continue to receive orders for our Cheetah SATCOM systems. So really across-the-board, we're seeing pretty robust activity in many of our key areas. 
In AM&M, we received 2 new VIP/Head of State aircraft design and MoD contracts for international customers, and we're also manufacturing an assembly cabins on the CH-47 helicopter. In services, including National Security Solutions, we received additional task orders under the SITEC program. We're also partnering with the advanced research laboratories at MIT and the University of Maryland for technology research and complex computing. And that's a terrific way for us to leverage our R&D investments and develop the next generation technologies that we hope will further drive our business growth in that area. 
In terms of capital allocation, we always have been disciplined to how we deploy capital to create value for shareholders. The quarter, we repurchased $138 million of common stock. We also paid dividends of $49 million. That back in February our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11% to $0.50 a share, quarterly $2 for the year. This dividend marks our eighth consecutive increase and reflects our commitment to shareholder value. We'll continue to pursue market leadership in the business by anticipating evolving needs of our customers, continuing our investment in growth areas and maximizing operational efficiencies, which is becoming increasingly important in the current environment. The innovation and program excellence combined with strong operating performance and disciplined capital allocation, we believe, will be what will drive shareholder growth for us going forward. I'm going to turn it over to Ralph to discuss the numbers in a little more detail, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Ralph?"

I'd add some commons about the first quarter results and our 2012 guidance update. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.1, up 9% versus the 2011 first quarter, we expected driven by higher sales in margin. First quarter sales of $3,588,000,000 were almost flat compared to 2011 first quarter and higher than we expected by about $100 million mostly for better performance in C3ISR plus $26 million for the Kollmorgen acquisition in Electronic Systems, and that was not in our guidance that we have provided into January. 
Some other important first quarter sales statistics are that commercial sales grew 13% to $387 million. And sales, excluding Engility, grew 3%. Segment operating margin declined 70 basis points to 10.1% from 2012 first quarter versus last year's first quarter, but margin was also higher than we expected mainly due to some better performance in Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance. We also have very strong orders for the first quarter, which Mike talked about called $4.1 billion, and were about $800 million higher than we expected from the first quarter. Three competitively won international contracts upside items in our 2012 plan added about $300 million of orders with $240 million of it in the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment and $60 million in Electronic Systems. Additionally, we received about $0.5 billion of orders earlier than we expected mostly in the Government Services and Electronic Systems segments. The segment quarter-over-quarter results and trends are covered in the earnings release. 
Moving on to the 2012 guidance update. We increased it primarily for the KEO business, which we acquired in February 6. Sales guidance was raised $150 million and the new range is now $14,550,000,000 to $14,750,000,000, which is a decrease of between 3% and 4% versus 2011. Excluding could Engility that we expect to spinoff the summer expect sales to be about 1% below 2011. 
At the segment level Electronic Systems sales guidance was increased $215 million, with approximately $150 million for the KEO acquisition and another $100 million for the realignment of our U.K. TRL business from C3ISR Electronic Systems. So operationally, there was no reduction to 2012 C3ISR segment sales guidance. You'll also notice that our first quarter sales growth in C3ISR at 16% is significantly higher than the 2% full year midpoint guidance growth versus 2011. The C3ISR higher growth rate for the first quarter was due to timing items and an easier quarter-over-quarter comparison. That said, we do have a few new opportunities in the classified ISR area depending on when and if they happen provide upside to the segment guidance for this year. 
Government Services and Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segments sales guidance was unchanged. With respect to the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment, you may recall that L-3's 2 largest contract recompetitions for this year are in that segment. They are the contract Southwest Asia Task Order and the Army Aviation Fort Rucker Maintenance contract. While the size of these 2 recompetes varies, based on the start dates of the new contracts, each contain about $100 million of sales to 2012. I also previously explained that our segment sales guidance was appropriately factored for those 2 recompetitions. The update on them is that in March, we lost the Task Order and the Fort Rucker is in source selection expected to be awarded by the end of July. 
The other Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance update is that Platform Systems is performing very well, highlighted by those 2 international contract wins in the first quarter. So our current assessment for this segment is even if we were to lose the Fort Rucker recompetition, and we don't expect that we will, but even if we did, we should be able to maintain our segment guidance range for Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance. 
Consolidated 2012 margin guidance remains at 10.1%. Excluding Engility, we expect that the margin will be about 10.3%. I also want to explain some important points about our operating income trends. 
While our margin and operating income are declining this year and also decreased last year, the majority of that decrease is occurring in our service businesses, both in the Government Services segment and in the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance Logistics Support. Higher pension expense is also lowering 2012 margin by about 30 basis points. Beginning next year, these operating income headwinds should abate because our services sales will be a smaller portion on a lot of basis of our total sales due to the contract recompetition attrition that we experienced and the impending Engility spinoff. Service margins should also bottom in 2012. And pension expense should be a tailwind for 2013. 
Additionally, we'd take a look at our products business margins, they have not been bolstered by cumulative catch-up of contract accounting adjustments because of the short or early cycle nature of our business plus the fact that were not a Platform OEM, as well as our business model. So we don't have to depend on recurrent cumulative catch-ups to maintain margins. 
Free cash flow guidance is now $1,180,000,000 and continues to be very robust. If you look at our free cash flow on a per-share basis, we expect that for the full year 2012, it'll be about $12 per share with Engility, and without Engility, it's about $10.80 per share. 
Finally, taking a look at the second quarter outlook, we expect sales between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion; earnings per share of between $2 and $2.05; free cash flow in the low $200 million range; and operating margin should to be in the low 10% range. The book-to-bill ratio for the second quarter should be about 0.90, and we know expect the full year book-to-bill to be about 1.0. That concludes my comments. Thank you, and we'll go to the Q&A now."

And I said we're going to try to move that need a little bit and give a little more balance in there. We think we will be this year is that mix should be more like 75%-25%, so 75% U.S. Government, 25% commercial. And I think given the current environment we are in, we will continue to lean that way to acquire companies where there are used technologies just like this Thales acquisition maybe 35%. It's kind of a gradual process. We're not going to do a single transaction, it's going to dynamically changes commercial company that's types of things because we have very strong proprietary positions in many of our DoD markets whether it's data links or airborne ISR or sensors, et cetera. But it's a gradual process of shifting of that portfolio and waiting it a little bit more heavily specially out of services into more proprietary defense solutions and into dual-use technology where we can get a piece of the fast-growing commercial marketplaces. The us about the Thales acquisitions. It was a perfect example of this strategy and those incredibly well with the Link business. The Thales Training and Simulation business is the #2 global manufacturer of several flight simulation equipment. They have been installed base of about 540 simulators globally, of which 353 of them are full-flight simulators. 67 different customer since 1990 also provider for the Thales Military Training and Simulation business and they have a training center, a pilot training center in Thailand. The installed base really runs the full gamut of platforms. They have just about are to the commercial world what we are to the military world we have just about fast jet the heavens and liter for just about every commercial airplane whether it's A320s, 350s, 380s and for Boeing 737, 777, 87, the Thales military side, the A400, the MRTT, et cetera. So it's very broad customer base really has as excited as to what we can create both our link business in Thales. The bring to link a full-motion platform that we had been buying for all products, and we bring to them the outstanding display graphics, high definition systems and other proprietary database systems that we have. And we think you put it together, you got a tremendous business with lots of opportunities. That's where we are."

One positive would be to try to get all fonts obligated by September 30 possible paperwork manpower customers on the plus. On the minus, the sequestration equates to approximately where this is done about 8% of every single line item in the budget as I understand the mechanics of it. At the same time, the President has come out and said that they're going release to the Pentagon to allocate that, so it doesn't hurt the manpower, if you will, which place to go, which will be what pretty hard even measure how much we're talking about in fiscal '13 and how fast customers are going to be able to reflect these cuts and actual contracts. So we have a sense for the areas we are could be get more than others. And ""no"" case, for example, do we see any business units that are in jeopardy of shutting down or anything, and we have a pretty diverse book of business and quantities could drop in certain areas, but we think that again we don't have to deal with some of the bigger issues like large marching our needs and factory or facility issues. So that all the other factors of this year such as the election and negotiation on the debt ceiling but is legislation will be needed to stop the sequestration which I don't think happen before the election and after the election you have that November to January period that he also may not see anything happening. So difficult call for both us and our customers as to exactly how to prepare for it other than to just take every day us to work period is going to be."

Thanks for joining us. We started the year with a strong first quarter, overall.

Thanks for joining us. We started the year with a strong first quarter, overall. And as always I wanted to thank the 60,000 men and women of L-3 for just a tremendous job in the first quarter and their focus and excellent program execution. 
We saw very strong orders combined with new awards, recompetes and follow-on business that drove the results this quarter. Internal funded orders were $4.1 billion, which generated a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14 and resulting in a backlog at March 31 of $11.4 billion. 
Net sales were $3.6 billion, which were up -- essentially flat with the 2011 first quarter with our diluted earnings per share of $2.01, up from $1.85 in last year's first quarter, that's about a 9% increase. 
The C3ISR business continued to lead with very strong performance, an increase in sales of about 16% compared to last year's first quarter. Driving the growth there were increased volumes for airborne ISR, logistics support and fleet management services for our DoD customers, as well as new business for international airborne ISR platforms. 
Recent competitive wins helped us deliver solid sales in the AM&M segments, in the Contractor Logistics Support business area and an acquisition resulted in modest growth for Electronic Systems. Offsetting the sales performance were headwinds from the continued challenging defense environment where the largest impact was felt in the Government Services area. We continue to focus on growing and integrating businesses, generating maximum efficiencies from operations that are aligned with both customer and production requirements. 
As always the key aspect -- a key aspect of our strategy is our disciplined approach to acquisitions, where we continue to enhance our core business extending our addressable markets and strengthening our technology capabilities. 
In February, we completed the acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical, KEO. It's a great addition to L-3's integrated Sensor Systems business with technologies that provides situational awareness and enhance our existing products including infrared images, targeting systems and ISR sensors and laser range finders. Also we recently announced an agreement to acquire Thales' civil aircraft training and simulation business. With an installed base of over 540 simulators and a global customer base, this business complements the linked simulation business and will extend our addressable markets with a full range of total training systems solutions for both military and, now, commercial customers globally. We expect the Thales transaction to be completed this summer. 
We also completed an acquisition of a small company in the shipboard electronic control systems area called MAPCO. It folds in well with our [indiscernible] business unit, which designs customized high-end systems for the cruise ship industry and mega yachts. Each of these acquisitions is a great example of our disciplined strategy of pursuing acquisition candidates that expand our markets, product offerings, technologies, and our customer base and deliver compelling valuations. 
The Engility spinoff, I just wanted to give you a brief update. In February 9, we received the private letter ruling from the IRS that supports the tax-free spinoff for L-3 and its shareholders. On March 29, we filed our 410 registration statement with the SEC and are in the review process now. We're currently expected to complete the transaction on schedule by the end of June. Of course, the ultimate timing is subject to certain conditions and approvals, including completion of the SEC review. We are all looking forward to launching Engility and the opportunities for our National Security Solutions business that will bring L-3 as we sharpen our focus on building our value-added products and solutions business. 
In terms of the budget, the final DoD budget continues to be unclear at this point. And as of today, Congress has no consensus plan to prevent the sequestration from becoming effective in early 2013. We're looking at just about a perfect storm later this year given the election, the probability that there'll have to be another increase to the debt ceiling and, of course, the sequestration trigger. There's a lot of things moving around and that does disrupt the visibility that we used to having in this business, notwithstanding our backlog and our outlook is pretty stable, and we feel good about the year. 
Secretary Panetta and others in government and industry have been very vocal about the devastating effects this would have a national security and military readiness. We heard many times on the hill and also at the Pentagon that the sequestration will not likely happen. However, there's no indication of any build and, of course, it will not happen at this point, so we remain guarded on our view. 
The uncertainty, of course, creates a risk for the industrial base, including development and workforce issues. We understand that Secretary Panetta and others are committed to working with the lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to avoid the sequestration without compromising U.S. Military superiority. 
The DoD is focused on communicating new priorities for the future with the focus on nimble, quick strike global military capability. Attention would begin to shift away from the Middle East and towards the Asia-Pacific region. This will require ISR assets, a strong naval presence and upgraded maritime systems and additional special operations forces and unmanned systems. And so we remain optimistic in our outlook in the DoD's emphasis on areas where L-3 has a strong base. 
Our focus on these and other key priority areas where we have world-class expertise and leadership positions is going to be key. 
In terms of the orders, significant orders and milestones, for the quarter, let me just share some of them. In C3ISR, we continue to receive orders related to Project Liberty for ISR integration work. We also received additional orders for our Battlefield Anti-Intrusion Systems for use by U.S. Army Infantry Platoons and military police units. 
In our Electronic Systems, we continue to receive strong orders from the DoD and law enforcement for WESCAM's MX-Series of sensor systems. We captured 2 contracts for Service Life Extension programs for the U.S. Navy's Landing Craft Air Cushion. This will support both East and West Coast projects. 
Our new KEO business unit was awarded a modification for 2 photonics mast systems for installation on SSN 788 and 789 submarines. We received an additional order for binocular night vision devices for use by the U.S. Special Operations Command. We received an order for checked baggage system in Thailand. We continue to receive orders for our Cheetah SATCOM systems. So really across-the-board, we're seeing pretty robust activity in many of our key areas. 
In AM&M, we received 2 new VIP/Head of State aircraft design and MOD contracts for international customers, and we're also manufacturing and assembling cabins on the CH-47 helicopter. In services, including National Security Solutions, we received additional test orders under the SITEC program. We're also partnering with the advanced research laboratories at MIT and the University of Maryland for technology research in complex computing. And that's a terrific way for us to leverage our R&D investments and develop the next generation technologies that we hope will further drive our business growth in that area. 
In terms of capital allocation, we always have been disciplined to how we deploy capital to create value for shareholders. The quarter, we repurchased $138 million of common stock. We also paid dividends of $49 million. Back in February our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11% to $0.50 a share, quarterly, $2 for the year. This dividend marks our eighth consecutive increase and reflects our commitment to shareholder value. 
We'll continue to pursue market leadership in the business by anticipating evolving needs of our customers, continuing our investment in growth areas and maximizing operational efficiencies, which is becoming increasingly important in the current environment. Innovation and program excellence combined with strong operating performance and disciplined capital allocation, we believe, will be what will drive shareholder growth for us going forward. 
I'm going to turn it over to Ralph to discuss the numbers in a little more detail, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Go ahead, Ralph?"

I'll add some comments about the first quarter results and our 2012 guidance update. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.1, up 9% versus the 2011 first quarter, and better than we expected driven by higher sales",982,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I'll add some comments about the first quarter results and our 2012 guidance update. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.1, up 9% versus the 2011 first quarter, and better than we expected driven by higher sales in margin. First quarter sales of $3,588,000,000 were almost flat compared to the 2011 first quarter and higher than we expected by about $100 million mostly for better performance in C3ISR plus $26 million for the Kollmorgen acquisition in Electronic Systems, and that was not in our guidance that we have provided into January. 
Some other important first quarter sales statistics are that commercial sales grew 13% to $387 million. And sales, excluding Engility, grew 3%. Segment operating margin declined 70 basis points to 10.1% from 2012 first quarter versus last year's first quarter, but margin was also higher than we expected mainly due to some better performance in Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance. We also have very strong orders for the first quarter, which Mike talked about. They called $4.1 billion, and were about $800 million higher than we expected from the first quarter. Three competitively won international contracts that will upside items in our 2012 plan added about $300 million of orders with $240 million of it in the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment and $60 million in Electronic Systems. Additionally, we received about $0.5 billion of orders earlier than we expected mostly in the Government Services and Electronic Systems segments. The segment quarter-over-quarter results and trends are covered in the earnings release. 
Moving on to the 2012 guidance update. We increased it primarily for the KEO business, which we acquired on February 6. Sales guidance was raised $150 million and the new range is now $14,550,000,000 to $14,750,000,000, which is a decrease of between 3% and 4% versus 2011. Excluding Engility that we expect to spinoff this summer, we expect sales to be about 1% below 2011. 
At the segment level, Electronic Systems sales guidance was increased $250 million, with approximately $150 million for the KEO acquisition and another $100 million for the realignment of our U.K. TRL business from C3ISR Electronic Systems. So operationally, there was no reduction to 2012 C3ISR segment sales guidance. You'll also notice that our first quarter sales growth in C3ISR at 16% is significantly higher than the 2% full year midpoint guidance growth versus 2011. The C3ISR higher growth rate for the first quarter was due to timing items and an easier quarter-over-quarter comparison. That said, we do have a few new opportunities in the classified ISR area, which depending on when and if they happen, provide upside to the segment guidance for this year. 
Government Services and Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment sales guidance was unchanged. With respect to the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment, you may recall that L-3's 2 largest contract recompetitions for this year are in that segment. They are the contract field teams Southwest Asia Task Order and the Army Aviation Fort Rucker Maintenance contract. While the size of these 2 recompetes varies, based on start dates of the new contracts, each contain about $100 million of sales risk to 2012. I also previously explained that our segment sales guidance was appropriately factored for those 2 recompetitions. The update on them is that in March, we lost the Southwest Asia Task Order and the Fort Rucker contract is in source selection expected to be awarded by the end of July. 
The other Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance update is that Platform Systems is performing very well, highlighted by those 2 international contract wins in the first quarter. So our current assessment for this segment is -- and even if we were to lose the Fort Rucker recompetition, and we don't expect that we will, but even if we did, we should be able to maintain our segment guidance range for Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance. 
Consolidated 2012 margin guidance remains at 10.1%. Excluding Engility, we expect that the margin will be about 10.3%. I also want to explain some important points about our operating income trends. 
While our margin and operating income are declining this year and also decreased last year, the majority of that decrease is occurring in our service businesses, both in the Government Services segment and in the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance Logistics Support. Higher pension expense is also lowering 2012 margin by about 30 basis points. Beginning next year, these operating income headwinds should abate because our services sales will be a smaller portion on a relative basis of our total sales due to the contract recompetition attrition that we've experienced and the impending Engility spinoff. Service margins should also bottom in 2012. And pension expense should be a tailwind for 2013. 
Additionally, we'd take a look at our products business margins, they have not been bolstered by cumulative catch-up of contract accounting adjustments because of the short or early cycle nature of our business plus the fact that were not a Platform OEM, as well as our merchant business model. So we don't have to depend on recurrent cumulative catch-ups to maintain margins. 
Free cash flow guidance is now $1,180,000,000 and continues to be very robust. If you look at our free cash flow on a per-share basis, we expect that for the full year 2012, it'll be about $12 per share with Engility, and without Engility, it's about $10.80 per share. 
Finally, taking a look at the second quarter outlook, we expect sales between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion; earnings per share, between $2 and $2.05; free cash flow in the low $200 million range; and operating margin should to be in the low 10% range. The book-to-bill ratio for the second quarter should be about 0.90, and we now expect the full year book-to-bill to be about 1.0. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you, and we'll go to the Q&A now."

And additionally, we had some better contract performance in Platform Systems, and we had a sales price adjustment on a logistics support services contract, which helped the margin in the first quarter. As we move throughout the year, the margins on the CLS business become more challenging. So that's essentially what's happening there. And as things continue to go well, like they went in the first quarter, we'll up the guidance for margins later on in that segment. But right now I think they're appropriate, maintaining them on what they were in the last guidance update."

For many years, the mix had been 85% U.S. Government, of which 75% was DoD and 10% was other agencies, state, the intel and home and security and the balance, the other 15%, was international and commercial. And I had said, we're going to try to move that needle a little bit and get a little more balance in there. Where we think we'll be this year is that mix should be more like 75%, 25%, so 75% U.S. Government, 25% commercial. And I think given the current environment we're in, we will continue to lean that way to acquire companies where there are dual-use technologies just like this Thales acquisition, where maybe 35%. It's kind of a gradual process. We are not going to do a single transaction that's going to dynamically change us into a commercial company that's not the types of things we're picking up, because we have very strong proprietary positions in many of our DoD markets whether it's data links or airborne ISR or sensors, et cetera. But it's a gradual process of shifting of that portfolio and waiting it a little bit more heavily specially out of services into more proprietary defense solutions and into dual-use technology where we can get a piece of the faster-growing commercial marketplaces. You asked about the Thales acquisitions. It was a perfect example of this type strategy and it goes incredibly well with the Link business. The Thales Training and Simulation business is the #2 global manufacturer of civil flight simulation equipment. They have an installed base of about 540 simulators globally, of which 353 of them are full-flight simulators. 67 different customer since 1990. They're also a provider for the Thales Military Training and Simulation business and they have a training center, a pilot training center, in Thailand. The installed base really runs the full gamut of platforms. They have just about -- they are to the commercial world what we are to the military world, where I could say we have just about simulator for every fast jet. They have a simulator for just about every commercial airplane whether it's A320s, 330s, 350s, 380s and for Boeing the 737, 777, 87, the Thales military side, the A400, the MRTT, et cetera. So it's very broad customer base really has us excited as to what we can create with both our Link business in Thales. They bring to Link a full-motion platform that we had been buying for all products, and we bring to them the outstanding display graphics, high definition systems and other proprietary database systems that we have. And we think when you put it together, you got a tremendous business with lots of opportunities. That's where we are."

This maybe the bottoming this year looking out -- they came down heavy the last 2 years, came down hard in the last 2 years.

And there's a flip side to that, is that we start going after other people's programs, other company's programs that have been broken into pieces, and we're winning some of those. The last 2 years have seen this take out a substantial amount of cost since all these competition and recompetitions are becoming price shootouts, just low price wins in every touch. And I think there's a pendulum effect here to. Eventually you get to a point where there's low price all the time model plus it worked, because it doesn't work and we know this historically.

We expect that it's going to close sometime the middle of this summer. So it's likely to add about $70 million or so to our full year sales guidance when it closes. The margins are presently low single digit. That includes -- there's some purchase accounting around the tangible amortization. But the business has a healthy improving margin trend the next few years that we've talked about earlier. And on top of that, we expect this business to comfortably grow in the mid single-digit range the next few years. And if it does better, it will be closer towards the high single-digit range. So between the growing top line and the improving margins there, it's going to be -- it should be a nice addition to the Electronic Systems segment. Also the purchase price was about $130 million when you convert to U.S. dollars. And we also were able to favorably structure that acquisition substantially, all of the [ph] asset purchase for income tax purposes. So there's a nice tax shield there and depending how you MPV the tax shield, it's worth about $20 million. So net-net the economic price is more like $110 million us, which makes the EBITDA multiple, even 2012 very attractive at around 8x and it gets lower as the business grows the next few years."

One positive would be to try to get all fronts obligated by September 30 as fast as possible if it comes [ph] paperwork manpower as you were [ph] customers. So that would be on the plus. On the minus, the sequestration equates to approximately where this is done about 8% of every single line item in the budget, as I understand the mechanics of it. At the same time, the President has come out and said that they were going to give relief to the Pentagon to allocate that, so it doesn't hurt the manpower, if you will, which leaves at only one other place to go, which would be [ph] side. So it's pretty hard even measure how much we're talking about in fiscal '13 and how fast customers are going to be able to reflect these cuts in actual contracts. So we have a sense for the areas we are that could be hit more than others. And in no case, for example, do we see any business units that are in jeopardy of shutting down or anything, and we have a pretty diverse book of business and quantities could drop in certain areas, but we think that, again, we don't have to deal with some of the bigger issues like large marching armies and factory or facility issues. And thrown in all the other factors of this year such as the election and another negotiation on the debt ceiling and legislation will be needed to stop the sequestration, which I don't think is likely to happen before the election, and then after the election you have that November to January period that you also may not see anything happening. So it's a difficult call for both us and our customers as to exactly how to prepare for it other than to just stay current every day as to what the current state of affairs is going to be."

I mean that's not a business that we're interested in doing for 1%, it's simply not.

I will tell you that George was sitting here that there'll be an occasion when this happens and you're going to get a contractor that's going to not be able to execute when they lowball something, either they'll default [ph] on it or the work will not get done and the customer default [ph] they'll have to negotiate a higher price. And we're watching this one with particular interest because as the recompete transitions, as of the program transitions, the same workforce has to transition to the contractor and accept the much lower compensation package.

It's going to be interesting. We're watching it very carefully."

And the business has also been adversely affected the last couple of years or so from the LFD [ph] initiatives with the government trying to stretch as its budget dollar, and they've been breaking up single award contracts into multiple award contracts and, frankly, we've had some large single award contracts that have been targeted and broken up. But once we get past this year, there isn't much other large contracts like that, that we have. So I see us having less exposure in that regard. And then the budgets still look like they call for some reduction plus the efficiency initiatives, which are not going away. So we could have some more declines of the top line, but it's not going to be anywhere near we're experiencing in 2012.

And then beyond that, barring any disruptions in the capital markets, our pension expense should continue to gradually decline because we froze our defined benefit plans to new hires in 2007. So gradually as the active employees will have pensions as they begin to retire, we should have a commensurate reduction in our pension expense. So I guess discount rates could go lower, but I don't know how much low they can go. If discount rates or the interest rate environment up ticks, the pension expense and liabilities from the pension are very levered to interest rates. So that, that could cause an even more rapid decline in expense, and I'm not factoring in that into the $15 million, $25 million that I gave you."

And as always I wanted to thank the 60,000 men and women of L-3 for just a tremendous job in the first quarter and their focus and excellent program execution. 
We saw very strong orders combined with new awards, recompetes and follow-on business that drove the results this quarter. Internal funded orders were $4.1 billion, which generated a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14 and resulting in a backlog at March 31 of $11.4 billion. 
Net sales were $3.6 billion, which were up -- essentially flat with the 2011 first quarter with our diluted earnings per share of $2.01, up from $1.85 in last year's first quarter, that's about a 9% increase. 
The C3ISR business continued to lead with very strong performance, an increase in sales of about 16% compared to last year's first quarter. Driving the growth there were increased volumes for airborne ISR, logistics support and fleet management services for our DoD customers, as well as new business for international airborne ISR platforms. 
Recent competitive wins helped us deliver solid sales in the AM&M segments, in the Contractor Logistics Support business area and an acquisition resulted in modest growth for Electronic Systems. Offsetting the sales performance were headwinds from the continued challenging defense environment where the largest impact was felt in the Government Services area. We continue to focus on growing and integrating our businesses, generating maximum efficiencies from operations that are aligned with both customer and production requirements. 
As always the key aspect -- a key aspect of our strategy is our disciplined approach to acquisitions, where we continue to enhance our core business extending our addressable markets and strengthening our technology capabilities. 
In February, we completed the acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical, KEO. It's a great addition to L-3's integrated Sensor Systems business with technologies that provide situational awareness and enhance our existing products including infrared images, targeting systems and ISR sensors and laser range finders. Also we recently announced an agreement to acquire Thales' civil aircraft training and simulation business. With an installed base of over 540 simulators and a global customer base, this business complements the linked simulation business and will extend our addressable markets with a full range of total training systems solutions for both military and, now, commercial customers globally. We expect the Thales transaction to be completed this summer. 
We also completed an acquisition of a small company in the shipboard electronic control systems area called MAPCO. It folds in well with our [indiscernible] business unit, which designs customized high-end systems for the cruise ship industry and mega yachts. Each of these acquisitions is a great example of our disciplined strategy of pursuing acquisition candidates that expand our markets, product offerings, technologies, and our customer base and there were compelling valuations. 
The Engility spinoff, I just wanted to give you a brief update. In February 9, we received the private letter ruling from the IRS that supports the tax-free spinoff for L-3 and its shareholders. On March 29, we filed our Form 10 registration statement with the SEC and are in the review process now. We're currently expected to complete the transaction on schedule by the end of June. Of course, the ultimate timing is subject to certain conditions and approvals, including completion of the SEC review. We are all looking forward to launching Engility and the opportunities for our National Security Solutions business that will bring L-3 as we sharpen our focus on building our value-added products and solutions business. 
In terms of the budget, the final DoD budget continues to be unclear at this point. And as of today, Congress has no consensus plan to prevent the sequestration from becoming effective in early 2013. We're looking at just about a perfect storm later this year given the election, the probability that there'll have to be another increase to the debt ceiling and, of course, the sequestration trigger. There's a lot of things moving around and that does disrupt the visibility that we're used to having in this business, notwithstanding our backlog and our outlook is pretty stable, and we feel good about the year. 
Secretary Panetta and others in government and industry have been very vocal about the devastating effects this would have on national security and military readiness. We heard many times on the hill and also at the Pentagon that the sequestration will not likely happen. However, there's no indication of any bill that will force it to not happen at this point, so we remain guarded on our view. 
The uncertainty, of course, creates risk for the industrial base, including development and workforce issues. We understand that Secretary Panetta and others are committed to working with the lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to avoid the sequestration without compromising U.S. Military superiority. 
The DoD is focused on communicating new priorities for the future with the focus on nimble, quick strike global military capability. Attention would begin to shift away from the Middle East and towards the Asia-Pacific region. This will require ISR assets, a strong naval presence and upgraded maritime systems and additional special operations forces and unmanned systems. And so we remain optimistic in our outlook in the DoD's emphasis on areas where L-3 has a strong base. 
Our focus on these and other key priority areas where we have world-class expertise and leadership positions is going to be key. 
In terms of the orders, significant orders and milestones, for the quarter, let me just share some of them. In C3ISR, we continue to receive orders related to Project Liberty for ISR integration work. We also received additional orders for our Battlefield Anti-Intrusion Systems for use by U.S. Army Infantry Platoons and military police units. 
In our Electronic Systems, we continue to receive strong orders from the DoD and law enforcement for WESCAM's MX-Series of sensor systems. We captured 2 contracts for Service Life Extension programs for the U.S. Navy's Landing Craft Air Cushion. This will support both East and West Coast projects. 
Our new KEO business unit was awarded a modification for 2 photonics mast systems for installation on SSN 788 and 789 submarines. We received an additional order for binocular night vision devices for use by the U.S. Special Operations Command. We received an order for checked baggage systems in Thailand. We continue to receive orders for our Cheetah SATCOM systems. So really across-the-board, we're seeing pretty robust activity in many of our key areas. 
In AM&M, we received 2 new VIP/Head of State aircraft design and MOD contracts for international customers, and we're also manufacturing and assembling cabins on the CH-47 helicopter. In services, including National Security Solutions, we received additional task orders under the SITEC program. We're also partnering with the advanced research laboratories at MIT and the University of Maryland for technology research in complex computing. And that's a terrific way for us to leverage our R&D investments and develop the next generation technologies that we hope will further drive our business growth in that area. 
In terms of capital allocation, we always have been disciplined to how we deploy capital to create value for shareholders. The quarter, we repurchased $138 million of common stock. We also paid dividends of $49 million. Back in February our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11% to $0.50 a share, quarterly, $2 for the year. This dividend marks our eighth consecutive increase and reflects our commitment to shareholder value. 
We'll continue to pursue market leadership in the business by anticipating evolving needs of our customers, continuing our investment in growth areas and maximizing operational efficiencies, which is becoming increasingly important in the current environment. Innovation and program excellence combined with strong operating performance and disciplined capital allocation, we believe, will be what will drive shareholder growth for us -- share growth going forward. 
I'm going to turn it over to Ralph to discuss the numbers in a little more detail, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Go ahead, Ralph?"

I'll add some comments about the first quarter results and our 2012 guidance update. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.1, up 9% versus the 2011 first quarter, and better than we expected driven by higher sales",984,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I'll add some comments about the first quarter results and our 2012 guidance update. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.1, up 9% versus the 2011 first quarter, and better than we expected driven by higher sales in margin. First quarter sales of $3,588,000,000 were almost flat compared to the 2011 first quarter and higher than we expected by about $100 million mostly for better performance in C3ISR plus $26 million for the Kollmorgen acquisition in Electronic Systems, and that was not in our guidance that we had provided into January. 
Some other important first quarter sales statistics are that commercial sales grew 13% to $387 million. And sales, excluding Engility, grew 3%. Segment operating margin declined 70 basis points to 10.1% from 2012 first quarter versus last year's first quarter, but margin was also higher than we expected mainly due to some better performance in Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance. We also have very strong orders for the first quarter, which Mike talked about. They totaled $4.1 billion, and were about $800 million higher than we expected for the first quarter. Three competitively won new  international contracts that will upside items in our 2012 plan added about $300 million of orders with $240 million of it in the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment and $60 million in Electronic Systems. Additionally, we received about $0.5 billion of orders earlier than we expected mostly in the Government Services and Electronic Systems segments. The segment quarter-over-quarter results and trends are covered in the earnings release. 
Moving on to the 2012 guidance update. We increased it primarily for the KEO business, which we acquired on February 6. Sales guidance was raised $150 million and the new range is now $14,550,000,000 to $14,750,000,000, which is a decrease of between 3% and 4% versus 2011. Excluding Engility that we expect to spinoff this summer, we expect sales to be about 1% below 2011. 
At the segment level, Electronic Systems sales guidance was increased $250 million, with approximately $150 million for the KEO acquisition and another $100 million for the realignment of our U.K. TRL business from C3ISR Electronic Systems. So operationally, there was no reduction to 2012 C3ISR segment sales guidance. You'll also notice that our first quarter sales growth in C3ISR at 16% is significantly higher than the 2% full year midpoint guidance growth versus 2011. The C3ISR higher growth rate for the first quarter was due to timing items and an easier quarter-over-quarter comparison. That said, we do have a few new opportunities in the classified ISR area, which depending on when and if they happen, provide upside to the segment guidance for this year. 
Government Services and Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment sales guidance was unchanged. With respect to the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance segment, you may recall that L-3's 2 largest contract recompetitions for this year are in that segment. They are the contract field teams Southwest Asia Task Order and the Army Aviation Fort Rucker Maintenance contract. While the size of these 2 recompetes varies, based on the start dates of the new contracts, each contain about $100 million of sales risk to 2012. I also previously explained that our segment sales guidance was appropriately factored for those 2 recompetitions. The update on them is that in March, we lost the Southwest Asia Task Order and the Fort Rucker contract is in source selection expected to be awarded by the end of July. 
The other Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance update is that Platform Systems is performing very well, highlighted by those 2 international contract wins in the first quarter. So our current assessment for this segment is -- that even if we were to lose the Fort Rucker recompetition, and we don't expect that we will, but even if we did, we should be able to maintain our segment guidance range for Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance. 
Consolidated 2012 margin guidance remains at 10.1%. Excluding Engility, we expect that the margin will be about 10.3%. I also want to explain some important points about our operating income trends. 
While our margin and operating income are declining this year and also decreased last year, the majority of that decrease is occurring in our service businesses, both in the Government Services segment and in the Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance Logistics Support. Higher pension expense is also lowering 2012 margin by about 30 basis points. Beginning next year, these operating income headwinds should abate because our services sales will be a smaller portion on a relative basis of our total sales due to the contract recompetition attrition that we've experienced and the impending Engility spinoff. Service margins should also bottom in 2012. And pension expense should be a tailwind for 2013. 
Additionally, when you take a look at our products business margins, they have not been bolstered by cumulative catch-up of contract accounting adjustments because of the short or early cycle nature of our business plus the fact that were not a Platform OEM, as well as our merchant business model. So we don't have to depend on recurrent cumulative catch-ups to maintain margins. 
Free cash flow guidance is now $1,180,000,000 and continues to be very robust. If you look at our free cash flow on a per-share basis, we expect that for the full year 2012, it'll be about $12 per share with Engility, and without Engility, it's about $10.80 per share. 
Finally, taking a look at the second quarter outlook, we expect sales between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion; earnings per share, between $2 and $2.05; free cash flow in the low $200 million range; and operating margin should be in the low 10% range. The book-to-bill ratio for the second quarter should be about 0.90, and we now expect the full year book-to-bill to be about 1.0. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you, and we'll go to the Q&A now."

And additionally, we had some better contract performance in Platform Systems, and we had a sales price adjustment on a logistics support services contract, which helped the margin in the first quarter. As we move throughout the year, the margins on the CLS business become more challenging. So that's essentially what's happening there. And if things continue to go well, like they went in the first quarter, we'll up the guidance for margins later on in the year in that segment. But right now I think they're appropriate, maintaining them on what they were in the last guidance update."

For many years, the mix had been 85% U.S. Government, of which 75% was DoD and 10% was other agencies, state, the intel and Homeland Security and the balance, the other 15%, was international and commercial. And I had said, we're going to try to move that needle a little bit and get a little more balance in there. Where we think we'll be this year is that mix should be more like 75%, 25%, so 75% U.S. Government, 25% commercial. And I think given the current environment we're in, we will continue to lean that way to acquire companies where there are dual-use technologies just like this Thales acquisition, where maybe 35%. It's kind of a gradual process. We are not going to do a single transaction that's going to dynamically change us into a commercial company that's not the types of things we're picking up, because we have very strong proprietary positions in many of our DoD markets whether it's data links or airborne ISR or sensors, et cetera. But it's a gradual process of shifting that portfolio and weighting it a little bit more heavily especially out of services into more proprietary defense solutions and into dual-use technology where we can get a piece of the faster-growing commercial marketplaces. You asked about the Thales acquisition. It was a perfect example of this type strategy and it goes incredibly well with the Link business. The Thales Training and Simulation business is the #2 global manufacturer of civil flight simulation equipment. They have an installed base of about 540 simulators globally, of which 353 of them are full-flight simulators. 67 [indiscernible] customers since 1990. They're also a provider to the Thales Military Training and Simulation business and they have a training center, a pilot training center, in Thailand. The installed base really runs the full gamut of platforms. They have just about -- they are to the commercial world what we are to the military world, where I could say we have just about a simulator for every fast jet. They have a simulator for just about every commercial airplane whether it's A320s, 330s, 350s, 380s and for Boeing the 737, 777, 87, the Thales military side, the A400, the MRTT, et cetera. So it's very broad customer base really has us excited as to what we can create with both our Link business in Thales. They bring to Link the full-motion platform that we had been buying for all products, and we bring to them the outstanding display graphics, high definition systems and other proprietary database systems that we have. And we think when you put it together, you got a tremendous business with lots of opportunities. That's where we are."

And there's a flip side to that, is that we start going after other people's programs, other company's programs that have been broken into pieces, and we're winning some of those. The last 2 years have seen us take out a substantial amount of cost since all these competition -- recompetitions and recompetitions are becoming price shootouts, just low price wins in every [indiscernible].

We expect that it's going to close sometime the middle of this summer. So it's likely to add about $70 million or so to our full year sales guidance when it closes. The margins are presently low single digit. That includes -- there's some purchase accounting around the tangible amortization. But the business has a healthy improving margin trend the next few years that we talked about earlier. And on top of that, we expect this business to comfortably grow in the mid single-digit range the next few years. And if it does better, it will be closer towards the high single-digit range. So between the growing top line and the improving margins there, it's going to be -- it should be a nice addition to the Electronic Systems segment. Also the purchase price was about $130 million when you convert to U.S. dollars. And we also were able to favorably structure that acquisition substantially, all of it as an asset purchase for income tax purposes. So there's a nice tax shield there and depending how you MPV the tax shield, it's worth about $20 million. So net-net the economic price is more like $110 million, which makes the EBITDA multiple, even in 2012 very attractive at around 8x and it gets lower as the business grows the next few years."

One positive would be to try to get all funds obligated by September 30 as fast as possible. It becomes a paperwork manpower as you are [indiscernible] customers. So that would be on the plus. On the minus, the sequestration equates to approximately, way this is done, about 8% of every single line item in the budget, as I understand the mechanics of it. At the same time, the President has come out and said that they were going to give relief to the Pentagon to allocate that, so it doesn't hurt the manpower, if you will, which leaves it only one other place to go, which would be contractor side. So it's pretty hard even measure how much we're talking about in fiscal '13 and how fast customers are going to be able to reflect these cuts in actual contracts. So we have a sense for the areas we are that could be hit more than others. And in no case, for example, do we see any business units that are in jeopardy of shutting down or anything, and we have a pretty diverse book of business and quantities could drop in certain areas, but we think that, again, we don't have to deal with some of the bigger issues like large marching armies and factory or facility issues. And throw in all the other factors of this year such as the election and another negotiation on the debt ceiling and legislation will be needed to stop the sequestration, which I don't think is likely to happen before the election, and then after the election you have that November to January period that you also may not see anything happening. So it's a difficult call for both us and our customers as to exactly how to prepare for it other than to just stay current every day as to what the current state of affairs is going to be."

And we're watching this one with particular interest because as the recompete transitions, as the program transitions, the same workforce has to transition to the new contractor and accept a much lower compensation package. So it's going to be really interesting to see how this is exactly done given the low price that was bid for this work.

So having said that, my gut is that it's bottoming this year but you have the sequestration well caught out there and services are a nice target to go after, but let me let Ralph give you some more color there as well."

So certainly, in 2012, we're seeing a very sharp decline in our top line in government services, and it's more pronounced in Engility business and that's, frankly, because they have or had more exposure to the drawdown from Iraq. And now the beginning of the drawdown from Afghanistan. So going into next year, we think there'll be less drawdown exposures, certainly for L-3 x Engility. And the business has also been adversely affected the last couple of years or so from the OSD  initiatives with the government trying to stretch its budget dollar, and they've been breaking up single award contracts into multiple award contracts and, frankly, we've had some large single award contracts that have been targeted and broken up. But once we get past this year, there isn't much other large contracts like that, that we have. So I see us having less exposure in that regard. And then the budgets still look like they call for some reduction plus the efficiency initiatives, which are not going away. So we could have some more declines of the top line, but it's not going to be anywhere near what we're experiencing in 2012. So that's my view and, by nature, a little more conservative than Mike's, which is what it should be for a CFO versus a CEO."

That didn't happen. And so it didn't happen in any material respect. And there's also a big bow wave of reset, taking the equipment that's been used in a theater and resetting it to its state before it was used in theater, that's not budgeted nor has that happened yet. So those had always been natural offsets that we had expected, and I think they'll happen at some point but they're not happening today."

So I think we're going to have to get a little bit closer in terms of exactly what we are staring at in terms of 2013, unless you have some very, very motivated sellers that are willing to accept a buyer's assessment of what it's going to be.

And then beyond that, barring any disruptions in the capital markets, our pension expense should continue to gradually decline because we froze our defined benefit plans to new hires in 2007. So gradually as the active employees without pensions begin to retire, we should have a commensurate reduction in our pension expense. So I guess discount rates could go lower, but I don't know how much low they can go. If discount rates or the interest rate environment up ticks, the pension expense and liabilities from the pension are very levered to interest rates. So that, that could cause an even more rapid decline in expense, and I'm not factoring in -- that into the $15 million, $25 million that I gave you."

And rather than create 2 cities within L-3, it was easier to set it up as its own separate company. When you go back to the factor the Linguist and jobs of the world, again, this part of the contracting environment, sometimes changes are going to happen regardless of past performance and regardless of price because it's just the customers like change sometimes in those areas. And they're almost being told to change rapidly. We think we'll have another bite at the apple someday on jobs. With Linguist, no. The last bid on Linguist -- which program was that called. Do you know the name of it? The DLITE program. Again, you would have to bid that so low that it was a piece of business that was not for us.

As you've seen in the release, we had a good second quarter, which was led by strong orders that were up 4% from last year's second quarter. We want to thank our dedicated employees and management team across the company who did a really good job. As you know, the environment continues to challenge our industry. We are responding to those challenges by creating new ways of improving operational efficiencies and tightening our focus on products and services that directly address customer priorities. 
We ended the quarter with a solid funded backlog of $11.7 billion. We had net sales of $3.6 billion, which was a 6% decrease from last year's second quarter with most of that decrease coming from Government Services. Diluted earnings per share were $2.08, which was an 8% decrease compared again with the second quarter of '11, which was $2.26 but excluding certain items, notably tax gain last year and some of the spin-off expenses for Engility this year, the EPS declined about $0.02 or 1% versus last year second quarter. Free cash flow was $223 million for the quarter and our book-to-bill ratio is 1.1. 
We completed the previously announced spin-off of Engility, which positions both Engility and L-3 to better focus on their respective core competencies and pursue business opportunities that play to their strengths as well. Along with continuing to focus on program performance and follow-through, we continued to invest in R&D that's aimed at creating reliable and affordable solutions targeted at specific customer needs. In our business segments, C^3ISR continued its strong performance. In spite of slow contracting environment, we saw 4% increase quarter-over-quarter and net sales to $862 million. This was part -- due mainly to stronger demand from the DoD for airborne ISR, logistics support complete management services as well as higher demand from foreign military customers for airborne ISR systems. Net sales in the Electronic Systems segment decreased by 3% compared to last year second quarter, due in part to reduced Army requirements for certain products and to contracts that are nearing completion. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our sensor systems business related to the morgan acquisition and our microwave business, which had increased deliveries of SATCOM systems which included the power devices as well. 
Net sales in the AM&M segment were down about 3% compared to last year's second quarter, and that was primarily due to lower volume on the Joint Cargo Aircraft program. In terms of services, net sales declined by 20%, mostly reflecting lower demand for services due to the Iraq drawdown and U.S. Government budget reductions, which partially offset competitive U.S. Army training contract win. 
In terms of M&A, we continue to closely monitor the landscape for opportunities that may present themselves, both as a result of pressures brought in the industry and those that just want to cash out brought about by the prolonged and challenging economic environment we find ourselves in. I'd like to reiterate that the strategy in pursuing these opportunities remains unchanged. We continue to be thoughtful and disciplined our approach, targeting companies that will help us grow our market positions or add new customers, strengthen our competitive profile while providing good return for shareholders. 
In terms of the Engility spin-off, as I mentioned, it was completed on July 17 and Engility is now an independent publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker symbol of EGL. The spin-off demonstrates our execution strategy that is built on situational awareness and a strong sense of customer priorities. This spin-off opens up exciting opportunities for Engility as it will not be subject to the OCI issues we have and will be able to pursue business that is outside our areas of strategic focus. 
At the same time, our national security solutions business will focus on cyber security, high-performance computing, encryption and IT support, all high-priority areas at the DoD and many of the intel agencies. In terms of the DoD budget, I guess everybody is focused on sequestration. As you know, the Budget Control Act set the process in motion that will occur, and we'll be looking at significant across-the-board program reductions on January 2 of 2013, unless Congress acts to change or modify it. At this point, there's not enough clarity to know if or how such cuts would be implemented. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates cuts under sequestration to non-doD domestic accounts at about 8%. sequester provisions could cut the fiscal '13 investment and O&M accounts another 12% compared to what's included in the DoD budget request for '13. So we think it's about a 12% reduction assuming everything we know now. Whatever the final numbers turn out to be, however, the sequestration will have -- undoubtedly a negative impact that could be significant on the industry, and we're working to ensure that our message is reaching the leadership in Washington. Along with the other CEOs in the industry, we urge Congress to find a alternative way to resolve their budget concerns. The defense industry is united with the common goal of preserving fiscal responsibility without jeopardizing national security. We're looking to get more defining guidance on how sequestration will apply in order for us to do a more complete assessment of the full impact. We're continuing to monitor the situation closely and to plan for how best to moderate the impact. 
We're also aligning our businesses for the new reality. At L-3, our business strategies to focus on growing DoD priority areas such as C^3ISR, EO/IR systems, cyber security, weapon system, sustainment and counterterrorism. These are areas that of course we are all have strong -- we have strong positions in all these areas. 
In terms of some significant awards and milestones, let me just cover a couple of them. In the ISR segment, we were competitively selected for the South Korea P3 upgrade work, and that's for an additional 7 aircraft. We also received both follow-on orders for Rover and additional funding for logistics work on Project Liberty, as well as for the mission and sustainment on a variety of non-C^3ISR aircraft. In Electronic Systems, we are a member of the winning team led by Textron for the U.S. Navy ship-to-shore connector programs, a new program, which is always good in this environment and we're anxious to get started. We received a production award for about $50 million for the Army's Enhanced Night Vision Goggle program. We're also selected by SOCOM for known as to provide Special Operations Forces with global technical satcom capability. This is $0.5 billion IDIQ contract that has a 5-year period of performance. We're also awarded a $69 million contract for a U.S. Navy total rate system support facility. We received a order totaling about $30 million from the TSA for our image free Provision ATD advance personnel screening system. These are being deployed in U.S. airports right now, and we received an award to supply M935 to the Marine Corps. 
In AM&M, we recently announced that we won the recompete for rotary-wing aircraft maintenance and logistics at Fort Rucker, Alabama which is a recompete win that includes 1-year base period and 4 1-year options with an estimated contract value of about $2 billion. We also received an FMS order for 10 C-27J aircraft for Australia. 
National security solutions, we are prime contractor on the $5.6 billion Solutions for Intelligence II multi-award IDIQ contract, which is also a recompetition win. This contract provides the professional support services to the intelligence analysis mission, fighters, defense planner an policy makers. We've been awarded a contract to create the benefits management system for the Veterans Administration and provide health care information technology services to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. We will also provide intelligence support services for the U.S. Special Operations Command. 
In terms of our capital allocation and acquisition, activities, mirroring our disciplined and thoughtful M&A strategy, we continue to take a prudent approach to deploying capital in order to maximize value for our shareholders. A key component of this strategy is returning cash to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased $177 million of our common stock and paid $49 million in dividends. We continue to believe that the most effective method of long-term capital allocation is a balanced program of share repurchases, dividends and a disciplined and focused approach to M&A as evidenced by our pending strategic acquisition of the civil aircraft simulation business. This strategy will continue to drive our performance in the current uncertain economic environment.
Ralph is going to go into the numbers and give you some more details on it, and we'd be happy to take your questions. Go ahead, Ralph."

I'll comment on some items about second quarter results, primarily focusing on our results L-3 excluding Engility, and I'll also review the 2012 guidance update. First of all, the second quarter is the last quarter tha",797,"Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I'll comment on some items about second quarter results, primarily focusing on our results L-3 excluding Engility, and I'll also review the 2012 guidance update. First of all, the second quarter is the last quarter that we'll report our results from continuing operations including Engility. Beginning in third quarter, Engility will be consolidated and presented as a discontinued operations with the same for prior periods. In Table E contained in today's earnings release, we provided the continuing operations results on a pro forma basis for the second quarter and the first half of this year as well. 
The second quarter, sales, operating margin, EPS and cash flow were in line with our expectations. Orders were better than expected, driven by several awards including the Australian C-27J 10 aircraft awards, which is not included in our prior guidance and those awards drove a book-to-bill ratio excluding Engility at 1.13x. And this compares favorably to a book to bill for last year, excluding Engility, of 0.98. The strong orders also increased our backlog, which is up 11% versus the end of 2011 excluding Engility. Most of the backlog increase is from our international new business wins in the first half of 2012. 
Diluted earnings per share excluding Engility was $1.92 in the second quarter, a 3% decrease compared to the second quarter of last year. The EPS results demonstrate our continued strong cash flow and disciplined capital deployment. It shows that they're able to offset the impact of EPS from lower sales and margins as well as the headwinds that we had from $0.11 tax gain in the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter sales excluding Engility were $3,143,000,000 and down 3% versus second quarter of 2011 with most of that reduction coming in the NSS segment. Operating margin excluding Engility declined 10 basis points to 10.6% versus 10.5% from a year ago, and most of that decline was due to higher pension expense of $7 million for the second quarter of this year.
As Mike said, we also had very strong orders. They totaled $3.9 billion, again with most of the upside coming in the business area within aircraft modernization and maintenance. rest of the second quarter results and trends are covered in the earnings release. 
With respect to the 2012 guidance update, after then removing the Engility business that we spun off, our consolidated guidance was unchanged from the April 26 guidance update. The 2012 guidance of diluted EPS from continuing operations, which includes -- or I'm sorry excludes the Engility results is $7.70 to $7.85, unchanged from when we first introduced it on June 26, and it includes a $0.05 debt retirement charge that we'll record in the third quarter for $250 million of debt that we are paying in part from the proceeds of Engility spin-off. At the midpoint, our EPS guidance is about 1% lower than it was for 2011. Sales guidance excluding Engility remained at $12,950,000,000 to $13,150,000,000, which is about 1% decrease versus 2011. At the segment level, we also made no changes to our segment sales guidance for 2012.  Consolidated margin is now expected to be 10.3%, expected to decline by about 70 basis points from last year with the higher pension expense causing a 30 basis point reduction. 
In today's segment guidance update, we raised Electronic Systems margin and lowered C^3ISR margin, both primarily for sales mix changes. 
Our free cash flow guidance from continuing operations is $1,045,000,000 and it continues to be very robust and is about approximately $10.75 per share. With the weak competition win and the Engility spin-off, I believe that we have dramatically improved visibility in our cash flow by minimizing downtime risks related to the services businesses. 
With respect to capital structure, we ended June with $481 million of cash and as we previously disclosed, we'll use the net proceeds from Engility spin-off of approximately $325 million to repay $250 million of debt, which is actually happening today where  we're -- redeeming some of our subordinated notes and the remaining $75 million, we'll use for share repurchases in the second half of this year. And that brings our full year expectation for share repurchase to about $875 million. 
Finally, taking a look at the third quarter, we expect sales, and this excludes Engility, to be somewhere between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion, earnings per share between $1.80 and $1.85, which includes that $0.05 debt retirement charge. Free cash flow should be in the $250 million to $300 million range, and operating margin in the low 10% range. We expect the third quarter book-to-bill ratio to be about 0.9 and the full year book-to-bill ratio to now exceed 1.0. 
That concludes my comments and we'll begin the Q&A. Thank you."

We're in the late stages of getting the Spider aircraft qualified for export and we are hopeful that, that will start to take off either at the end of this year or early next year and perhaps get to a place where we would have steady production and delivery schedule. But again, that order book hasn't started yet because we're still getting it qualified for export. On electronics, we have a number of new products, particularly in soldier systems with just about every single next-gen night vision program they have won.

In terms of moving the portfolio, again, as you know, we're lightening up on services with the Engility spin and adding our commercial business through the Thales acquisition. It's moving the needle more from being 85% of U.S. government dependent and 15% commercial and international to closer to 75-25 model for this year. And I would expect, given our strategy, that trend to continue. However, how fast that deal is moving is dependent on a number of factors.

Number two, we've been looking across the company because as you may know in this space, there's really fusion going on between cyber, IT services, communications, encryption and other things that as you can tell are going to draw from more of the product side of the house. So part of the goal there would be to get a competitive advantage where we can, by including some of our proprietary products and solutions as adjuncts to service business and to drive more penetration. It's a good sized market, so we can grow. In some cases, it's growing like cyber or counterterrorism support and things like that. In some places, it's a market story for us where we -- have plenty of room to grow vis-à-vis market share. And the margins, I recognize, are lower by a handful than our composit. And we're also focused on those opportunities where the margins are more consistent with our corporate goals of double-digit margins.

As drafted, the sequestration is very prescriptive and that it's fixed percentage across all line items. So you can do the math that way. And we can apply it every government contract we have and make certain assumptions and which would result in essentially a decrease of about 10% to 12%, dependence -- depending on different mixes and things like that. And of course taking up commercial and international business, so it becomes a less number on the total. However, I don't think that's the end space because I think what would -- the second step once you apply the reductions would be a significant amount of reprogramming work that gets done. And the numbers that spread because some things can't get zeroed out and some things might get cut entirely. And that's the step in the process that we really don't know that well. But I can tell you the following is that we are not on other than 27J, which is already been terminated. We are in any platforms that are really subject to as kind being terminated that would be material event for us. We just got reawarded our biggest program, which is Fort Rucker. So we got pretty comfortable there. So in terms of  we have a lot of content on a lot of things, no single item being that material, I would say that we should end up no worse than the composite of 10% or 12% and probably significantly better in some areas like ISR, like the sensor portions of Electronic Systems. We still see the security business being robust due to international demand. We see NSS because of the areas of focus in cyber counterterrorism security, IP has legs, notwithstanding the environment. So I can only look with some guarded optimism here. Not everybody is going to be -- nobody is going to be unaffected. We're going to get affected. We can't possibly tell you we're immune to this because we're not. But I think it will be somewhat moderated by the way we're positioned."

So the second quarter in terms of our orders and execution was a good 1, and so is the first half, and we look forward to continuing solid performance for the rest of the year. We continue to work to strengthen and extend our leadership positions in the markets we serve. However, when you do recognize or anticipating challenging budget environment going forward, our employees are most enforced asset. Our talented workforce and strong leadership team continues to drive our results show with outstanding execution, and I believe everybody is focused on maintaining that in the second half. And finally, our flexibility and we believe are key competitive discriminators to help us develop innovative solutions that meet and exceed requirements for our customers. We are doing very well across the board on executing, and we believe that will make us a contract of choice in our areas of expertise. So enjoy the rest of this summer and we look forward to talking to you in the end of October. Bye-bye."

Thanks for joining us. As you've seen in the release, we had a good second quarter, which was led by strong orders that were up 4% from last year's second quarter.

As you've seen in the release, we had a good second quarter, which was led by strong orders that were up 4% from last year's second quarter. We wish to thank our dedicated employees and management team across the companies for really a good job. As you know, the environment continues to challenge our industry. We are responding to those challenges by creating new ways of improving operational efficiencies and tightening our focus on products and services that directly address customer priorities. 
We ended the quarter with a solid funded backlog of $11.7 billion. We had net sales of $3.6 billion, which was a 6% decrease from last year's second quarter with most of that decrease coming from Government Services. Diluted earnings per share were $2.08, which was an 8% decrease compared again with the second quarter of '11, which was $2.26, but excluding certain items, notably a tax gain last year and some of the spin-off expenses for Engility this year, the EPS declined about $0.02 or 1% versus last year second quarter. Free cash flow was $223 million for the quarter and our book-to-bill ratio is 1.10. 
We completed the previously announced spin-off of Engility, which positions both Engility and L-3 to better focus on their respective core competencies and pursue business opportunities that play to their strengths as well. Along with continuing to focus on program performance and follow-through, we continued to invest in R&D that's aimed at creating reliable and affordable solutions targeted at specific customer needs. In our business segments, C^3ISR continued its strong performance despite a slow contracting environment. We saw 4% increase quarter-over-quarter and net sales to $862 million. This was part -- due mainly to stronger demand from the DoD for airborne ISR, logistics support and fleet management services, as well as higher demand from foreign military customers for airborne ISR systems. Net sales in the Electronic Systems segment decreased by 3% compared to last year's second quarter, due in part to reduced army requirements for certain products and to contracts that are nearing completion. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our sensor systems business related to the Kollmorgen acquisition and in our microwave business, which had increased deliveries of SATCOM systems, which included the power devices as well. 
Net sales in the AM&M segment were down about 3% compared to last year's second quarter, and that was primarily due to lower volume on the Joint Cargo Aircraft program. In terms of services, net sales declined by 20%, mostly reflecting lower demand for services due to the Iraq drawdown and U.S. Government budget reductions, which partially offset a competitive U.S. army training contract win. 
In terms of M&A, we continue to closely monitor the landscape for opportunities that may present themselves, both as a result of pressures throughout the industry and sell us that just want to cash out, brought about by the prolonged and challenging economic environment we find ourselves in. I'd like to reiterate that the strategy in pursuing these opportunities remains unchanged. We continue to be thoughtful and disciplined in our approach, targeting companies that will help us grow our market positions or add new customers, strengthen our competitive profile while providing a good return for shareholders. 
In terms of the Engility spin-off, as I mentioned, it was completed on July 17, and Engility is now an independent publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol of EGL. The spin-off demonstrates our execution strategy that is built on situational awareness and a strong sense of customer priorities. This spin-off opens up exciting opportunities for Engility as it will not be subject to the OCI issues we have and we'll be able to pursue business that is outside of our areas of strategic focus. 
At the same time, our National Security Solutions business will focus on cyber security, high-performance computing, encryption and IT support, all high-priority areas at the DoD and many of the Intel agencies. In terms of the DoD budget, I guess everybody is focused on sequestration. As you know, the Budget Control Act set the process in motion that will occur, and we'll be looking at significant across-the-board program reductions on January 2, 2013, unless Congress acts to change or modify it. At this point, there's not enough clarity to know if or how such cuts will be implemented. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates cuts under sequestration to non-DoD domestic accounts at about 8%. The sequestered provisions could cut the fiscal '13 investment and O&M accounts another 12% compared to what's included in the DoD budget request for '13. So we think it's about a 12% reduction assuming everything we know now. Whatever the final numbers turn out to be, however, the sequestration will have undoubtedly, a negative impact that could be significant on the industry, and we're working to ensure that our message is reaching the leadership in Washington. Along with the other CEOs in the industry, we urge Congress to find an alternative way to resolve their budget concerns. The defense industry is united with the common goal of preserving fiscal responsibility without jeopardizing national security. We're looking to get more defining guidance on how sequestration will apply in order for us to do a more complete assessment of the full impact. We're continuing to monitor the situation closely and to plan for how best to moderate the impact. 
We're also aligning our businesses for the new reality. At L-3, our business strategy is to focus on growing DoD-priority areas such as C^3ISR, EO/IR systems, cyber security, weapons systems, sustainment and counterterrorism. These are areas that, of course, we or all have strong -- we have strong positions in all these areas. 
In terms of some significant awards and milestones, let me just cover a couple of them. In the ISR segment, we were competitively selected for the South Korea P-3 upgrade work, and that's for an additional 7 aircraft. We also received multiple follow-on orders for ROVER and additional funding for logistics work on Project Liberty, as well as for the missionization and sustainment on a variety of other ISR aircraft. In Electronic Systems, we are a member of the winning team led by Textron for the U.S. Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector programs, a new program, which is always good in this environment and we're anxious to get started. We received a production award for about $50 million for the Army's Enhanced Night Vision Goggle program. We're also selected by SOCOM for what's known as SDN light [ph] to provide Special Operations Forces with global tactical SATCOM capability. This is a $0.5 billion IDIQ contract that has a 5-year period of performance. We're also awarded a $69 million contract for a U.S. Navy total rate system support facility. We received the new order totaling about $30 million from the TSA for our image-free ProVision ATD advanced personnel screening system. These are being deployed in U.S. airports right now, and we received an award to supply M935 fuses to the Marine Corps. 
In AM&M, we recently announced that we won the recompete for rotary-wing aircraft maintenance and logistics at Fort Rucker, Alabama, which is a recompete win that includes a 1-year base period and 4 1-year options with an estimated contract value of about $2 billion. We also received an FMS order for 10 C-27J aircraft for Australia. 
National security solutions, we are a prime contractor on the $5.6 billion Solutions for Intelligence II, multi-award IDIQ contract, which is also a recompetition win. This contract provides the professional support services to the intelligence analysis mission, walk fighters, defense planners and policymakers. We've been awarded a contract to create a benefits management system for the Veterans Administration and provide healthcare information technology services to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. We will also provide intelligence support services for the U.S. Special Operations Command. 
In terms of our capital allocation and acquisition, activities, mirroring our disciplined and thoughtful M&A strategy, we continue to take a prudent approach to deploying capital in order to maximize value for our shareholders. A key component of this strategy is returning cash to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased $177 million of our common stock and paid $49 million in dividends. We continue to believe that the most effective method of long-term capital allocation is a balanced program of share repurchases, dividends and a disciplined and focused approach to M&A as evidenced by a pending strategic acquisition of the Thales Civil Aircraft Simulation business. This strategy will continue to drive our performance in the current uncertain economic environment.
Ralph's going to go over the numbers and give you some more details on it. And then we'd be happy to take your questions. Go ahead, Ralph."

I'll comment on some items about the second quarter results, primarily focusing on results for L-3 excluding Engility, and I'll also review the 2012 guidance update. First of all, the second quarter is the last quarter",808,"Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I'll comment on some items about the second quarter results, primarily focusing on results for L-3 excluding Engility, and I'll also review the 2012 guidance update. First of all, the second quarter is the last quarter that we'll report our results from continuing operations including Engility. Beginning in the third quarter, Engility will be deconsolidated and presented as a discontinued operation with the same for all the prior periods. In Table E contained in today's earnings release, we provided the continuing operation results on a pro forma basis for the second quarter and the first half of this year as well. 
The second quarter sales, operating margin, EPS and cash flow were in line with our expectations. Orders were better than we expected, driven by several awards including the Australian C-27J 10 aircraft award, which was not included in our prior guidance. And those awards drove a book-to-bill ratio, excluding Engility, at 1.13x. And this compares favorably to a book-to-bill for last year, excluding Engility, of 0.98. The strong orders also increased our backlog, which is up 11% versus the end of 2011, excluding Engility. Most of the backlog increase is from our international new business wins in the first half of 2012. 
Diluted earnings per share, excluding Engility, was $1.92 in the second quarter, a 3% decrease compared to the second quarter of last year. The EPS results demonstrate our continued strong cash flow and disciplined capital deployment. It shows that they're able to offset the impact of EPS from lower sales and margins, as well as the headwind that we had for an $0.11 tax gain in the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter sales, excluding Engility, were $3,143,000,000 and down 3% versus the second quarter of 2011, with most of that reduction coming in the NSS segment. Operating margin, excluding Engility, declined 10 basis points to 10.6% versus 10.5% from a year ago. And most of that decline was due to higher pension expense of $7 million for the second quarter of this year.
As Mike said, we also had very strong orders. They totaled $3.9 billion, again with most of the upside coming in the platform systems business area within aircraft modernization and maintenance. The rest of the second quarter results and trends are covered in the earnings release. 
With respect to the 2012 guidance update of then removing the Engility business that we spun off, our consolidated guidance was unchanged from the April 26 guidance update. The 2012 guidance for diluted EPS from continuing operations, which includes -- or I'm sorry, excludes the Engility pre-spin results is $7.70 to $7.85, unchanged from when we first introduced it on June 26, and it includes a $0.05 debt retirement charge that we'll record in the third quarter for $250 million of debt that we're repaying, with part of the proceeds from the Engility spin-off. At the midpoint, our EPS guidance is about 1% lower than it was for 2011. Sales guidance, excluding Engility, remains at $12,950,000,000 to $13,150,000,000, which is about a 1% decrease versus 2011. At the segment level, we also made no changes to our segment sales guidance for 2012. Consolidated margin is now expected to be 10.3%, expected to decline by about 70 basis points from last year with the higher pension expense causing a 30 basis point reduction. 
In today's segment guidance update, we raised Electronic Systems margin and lowered C^3ISR margin, both primarily for sales mix changes. 
Our free cash flow guidance from continuing operations is $1,045,000,000, and it continues to be very robust and is about approximately $10.75 per share. With the weak competition win and the Engility spin-off, I believe that we have dramatically improved visibility in our cash flow by minimizing downside risks related to the services businesses. 
With respect to the capital structure, we ended June with $481 million of cash. And as we previously disclosed, we'll use the net proceeds from Engility spin-off of approximately $325 million to repay $250 million of debt, which is actually happening today. We're redeeming some of our 6-3/8% subordinated notes and the remaining $75 million, we'll use for share repurchases in the second half of this year. And that brings our full year expectation for share repurchase to about $875 million. 
Finally, and taking a look at the third quarter, we expect sales, and this excludes Engility, to be somewhere between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion, earnings per share between $1.80 and $1.85, which includes that $0.05 debt retirement charge. Free cash flow should be in the $250 million to $300 million range, and operating margin in the low 10% range. We expect the third quarter book-to-bill ratio to be about 0.9 and the full year book-to-bill ratio to now exceed 1.0. 
That concludes my comments and we'll begin the Q&A. Thank you."

But again, that order book hasn't started yet because we're still getting it qualified for export. In Electronics, we have a number of new products, particularly in Soldier Systems with just about every single Next-Gen night vision program they have won. But again, these are new production programs and they're just in the early stages again we started. So we're hopeful that we're at a place where some of these new opportunities will be available to offset some things that might decline if we end up with a 12%-ish type cuts that could occur next year. And we're just trying to keep the balanced view on the marketplace and developing things where we are highly confident that there's a customer demand right now."

In terms of moving the portfolio, again as you know, lightening up on services with the Engility spin and adding a commercial business through the Thales acquisition is moving the needle more from being 85% of U.S. government-dependent, 15% commercial and international to closer to 75-25 model for this year. And I would expect, given our strategy, that trend to continue. However, how fast that needle's moving is dependent on a number of factors. One is finding suitable acquisition candidates; and two is going to be how much we're able to sustain our position on our defense programs, given the budget issue that we're facing as well.

As drafted, the sequestration is very prescriptive and that it's a fixed percentage across all line items. So you can do the math that way and we can apply it to every government contract we have and make certain assumptions and which would result in essentially a decrease of about 10% to 12% depending on different mixes and things like that. And of course taking up commercial and international business, so it becomes a less number on the total. However, I don't think that's the end space because I think what would -- the second step, once you'd apply the reductions, would be a significant amount of reprogramming request that gets done and getting numbers, get respread because some things can't get zeroed out and some things might get cut entirely. And that's the step in the process that we really don't know that well. But I can tell you the following is that we are not on other than the C-27J, which has already been terminated. We aren't at any platforms that are really subject to as a prime being terminated that would be a material event for us. We just got reawarded our biggest program, which is Fort Rucker, so felt pretty comfortable there. So in terms of -- we have a lot of content on a lot of things, but no single item being that material, I would say that it should -- we should end up no worse than the composite of 10% or 12% and probably significantly better in some areas like ISR, like the sensor portions of Electronic Systems. We still see the airport security business being robust due to international demand. We see [ph] with NSS because of the areas of focus in cyber counterterrorism security. IP has legs notwithstanding the environment. So I can only look to you some guarded optimism here. Not everybody is going to be -- nobody is going to be unaffected. We're going to get affected.

There seems to be some interest domestically now in moving forward on cargo. It's going to become -- it is an increasing area of focus. We have leading products in that space and we are continually looking at investing and broadening our capabilities. We believe we have some of the best products in the world in this space. In terms of the shipbuilding electronics, Electronic Systems for the shipbuilding industry if you will, the things we'd look at in that space would be filling the white space in our bridge to propel our control systems, health and welfare over the ship, things that allow owners and operators to more efficiently man and operate a ship, technologies that allow maintenance to be more performance-based rather than timing-to-build base, which is a significant cost improvement. Anything seems to get interest that is not only a technology improvement, yes, more bells and whistles, but also can drive an owner, operator's costs lower. And that has always been the focus in that space. And again, that's -- those are the things we're looking at."

As you've seen in the release, we had a good second quarter, which was led by strong orders that were up 4% from last year's second quarter. We wish to thank our dedicated employees and management team across the companies for really a good job. As you know, the environment continues to challenge our industry. We are responding to those challenges by creating new ways of improving operational efficiencies and tightening our focus on products and services that directly address customer priorities. 
We ended the quarter with a solid funded backlog of $11.7 billion. We had net sales of $3.6 billion, which was a 6% decrease from last year's second quarter with most of that decrease coming from Government Services. Diluted earnings per share were $2.08, which was an 8% decrease compared again with the second quarter of '11, which was $2.26, but excluding certain items, notably a tax gain last year and some of the spin-off expenses for Engility this year, the EPS declined about $0.02 or 1% versus last year's second quarter. Free cash flow was $223 million for the quarter and our book-to-bill ratio is 1.10 [ph] . 
We completed the previously announced spin-off of Engility, which positions both Engility and L-3 to better focus on their respective core competencies and pursue business opportunities that play to their strengths as well. Along with continuing to focus on program performance and follow-through, we continue to invest in R&D that's aimed at creating reliable and affordable solutions targeted at specific customer needs. In our business segments, C^3ISR continued its strong performance despite a slow contracting environment. We saw a 4% increase quarter-over-quarter and net sales to $862 million. This was part -- due mainly to stronger demand from the DoD for airborne ISR, logistics support and fleet management services, as well as higher demand from foreign military customers for airborne ISR systems. Net sales in the Electronic Systems segment decreased by 3% compared to last year's second quarter, due in part to reduced army requirements for certain products and to contracts that are nearing completion. This decrease was partially offset by growth in our sensor systems business related to the Kollmorgen acquisition and in our microwave business, which had increased deliveries of SATCOM systems, which included the power devices as well. 
Net sales in the AM&M segment were down about 3% compared to last year's second quarter, and that was primarily due to lower volume on the Joint Cargo Aircraft program. In terms of services, net sales declined by 20%, mostly reflecting lower demand for services due to the Iraq drawdown and U.S. Government budget reductions, which partially offset a competitive U.S. army training contract win. 
In terms of M&A, we continue to closely monitor the landscape for opportunities that may present themselves, both as a result of pressures throughout the industry and sellers that just want to cash out, brought about by the prolonged and challenging economic environment we find ourselves in. I'd like to reiterate that the strategy in pursuing these opportunities remains unchanged. We continue to be thoughtful and disciplined in our approach, targeting companies that will help us grow our market positions or add new customers, strengthen our competitive profile while providing a good return for shareholders. 
In terms of the Engility spin-off, as I mentioned, it was completed on July 17, and Engility is now an independent publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol of EGL. The spin-off demonstrates our execution strategy that is built on situational awareness and a strong sense of customer priorities. The spin-off opens up exciting opportunities for Engility as it will not be subject to the OCI issues we have and it will be able to pursue business that is outside of our areas of strategic focus. 
At the same time, our National Security Solutions business will focus on cyber security, high-performance computing, encryption and IT support, all high-priority areas at the DoD and many of the Intel agencies. In terms of the DoD budget, I guess everybody is focused on sequestration. As you know, the Budget Control Act set the process in motion that will occur, and we'll be looking at significant across-the-board program reductions on January 2, 2013, unless Congress acts to change or modify it. At this point, there's not enough clarity to know if or how such cuts will be implemented. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates cuts under sequestration to non-DoD domestic accounts at about 8%. The sequestered provisions could cut the fiscal '13 investment and O&M accounts another 12% compared to what's included in the DoD budget request for '13. So we think it's about a 12% reduction assuming everything we know now. Whatever the final numbers turn out to be, however, the sequestration will have undoubtedly, a negative impact that could be significant on the industry, and we're working to ensure that our message is reaching the leadership in Washington. Along with the other CEOs in the industry, we urged Congress to find an alternative way to resolve their budget concerns. The defense industry is united with the common goal of preserving fiscal responsibility without jeopardizing national security. We're looking to get more defining guidance on how sequestration will apply in order for us to do a more complete assessment of the full impact. We're continuing to monitor the situation closely and to plan for how best to moderate the impact. 
We're also aligning our businesses for the new reality. At L-3, our business strategy is to focus on growing DoD-priority areas such as C^3ISR, EO/IR systems, cyber security, weapons systems, sustainment and counterterrorism. These are areas that, of course, we or all have strong -- we have strong positions in all these areas. 
In terms of some significant awards and milestones, let me just cover a couple of them. In the ISR segment, we were competitively selected for the South Korea P-3 upgrade work, and that's for an additional 7 aircraft. We also received multiple follow-on orders for ROVER and additional funding for logistics work on Project Liberty, as well as for the missionization and sustainment on a variety of other ISR aircraft. In Electronic Systems, we are a member of the winning team led by Textron for the U.S. Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector programs, a new program, which is always good in this environment and we're anxious to get started. We received a production award for about $50 million for the Army's Enhanced Night Vision Goggle program. We're also selected by SOCOM for what's known as SDN lite to provide Special Operations Forces with global tactical SATCOM capability. This is a $0.5 billion IDIQ contract that has a 5-year period of performance. We're also awarded a $69 million contract for a U.S. Navy total [ph] rate system support facility. We received the new order totaling about $30 million from the TSA for our image-free ProVision ATD advanced personnel screening system. These are being deployed in U.S. airports right now, and we received an award to supply M935 fuses to the Marine Corps. 
In AM&M, we recently announced that we won the recompete for rotary-wing aircraft maintenance and logistics at Fort Rucker, Alabama, which is a recompete win that includes a 1-year base period and 4 1-year options with an estimated contract value of about $2 billion. We also received an FMS order for 10 C-27J aircraft for Australia. 
National security solutions, we are a prime contractor on the $5.6 billion Solutions for Intelligence II, multi-award IDIQ contract, which is also a recompetition win. This contract provides the professional support services to the intelligence analysis mission, warfighters, defense planners and policymakers. We've been awarded a contract to create a benefits management system for the Veterans Administration and provide healthcare information technology services to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. We will also provide intelligence support services for the U.S. Special Operations Command. 
In terms of our capital allocation and acquisition, activities, mirroring our disciplined and thoughtful M&A strategy, we continue to take a prudent approach to deploying capital in order to maximize value for our shareholders. A key component of this strategy is returning cash to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased $177 million of our common stock and paid $49 million in dividends. We continue to believe that the most effective method of long-term capital allocation is a balanced program of share repurchases, dividends and a disciplined and focused approach to M&A as evidenced by a pending strategic acquisition of the Thales Civil Aircraft Simulation business. This strategy will continue to drive our performance in the current uncertain economic environment.
Ralph's going to go over the numbers and give you some more details on it. And then we'd be happy to take your questions. Go ahead, Ralph."

I'll comment on some items about the second quarter results, primarily focusing on results for L-3 excluding Engility, and I'll also review the 2012 guidance update. First of all, the second quarter is the last quarter",809,"Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I'll comment on some items about the second quarter results, primarily focusing on results for L-3 excluding Engility, and I'll also review the 2012 guidance update. First of all, the second quarter is the last quarter that we'll report our results from continuing operations including Engility. Beginning in the third quarter, Engility will be deconsolidated and presented as a discontinued operation with the same for all the prior periods. In Table E contained in today's earnings release, we provided the continuing operation results on a pro forma basis for the second quarter and the first half of this year as well. 
The second quarter sales, operating margin, EPS and cash flow were in line with our expectations. Orders were better than we expected, driven by several awards including the Australian C-27J 10 aircraft award, which was not included in our prior guidance. And those awards drove a book-to-bill ratio, excluding Engility, at 1.13x. And this compares favorably to a book-to-bill for last year, excluding Engility, of 0.98. The strong orders also increased our backlog, which is up 11% versus the end of 2011, excluding Engility. Most of the backlog increase is from our international new business wins in the first half of 2012. 
Diluted earnings per share, excluding Engility, was $1.92 in the second quarter, a 3% decrease compared to the second quarter of last year. The EPS results demonstrate our continued strong cash flow and disciplined capital deployment. It shows that they're able to offset the impact of EPS from lower sales and margins, as well as headwinds that we had for an $0.11 tax gain in the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter sales, excluding Engility, were $3,143,000,000 and down 3% versus the second quarter of 2011, with most of that reduction coming in the NSS segment. Operating margin, excluding Engility, declined 10 basis points to 10.6% versus 10.5% from a year ago. And most of that decline was due to higher pension expense of $7 million for the second quarter of this year.
As Mike said, we also had very strong orders. They totaled $3.9 billion, again with most of the upside coming in the platform systems business area within aircraft modernization and maintenance. The rest of the second quarter results and trends are covered in the earnings release. 
With respect to the 2012 guidance update of then removing the Engility business that was spun off, our consolidated guidance was unchanged from the April 26 guidance update. The 2012 guidance for diluted EPS from continuing operations, which includes -- or I'm sorry, excludes the Engility pre-spin results is $7.70 to $7.85, unchanged from when we first introduced it on June 26, and it includes a $0.05 debt retirement charge that we'll record in the third quarter for $250 million of debt that we're repaying, with part of the proceeds from the Engility spin-off. At the midpoint, our EPS guidance is about 1% lower than it was for 2011. Sales guidance, excluding Engility, remains at $12,950,000,000 to $13,150,000,000, which is about a 1% decrease versus 2011. At the segment level, we also made no changes to our segment sales guidance for 2012. Consolidated margin is now expected to be 10.3%, expected to decline by about 70 basis points from last year with the higher pension expense causing a 30 basis point reduction. 
In today's segment guidance update, we raised Electronic Systems margin and we lowered C^3ISR margin, both primarily for sales mix changes. 
Our free cash flow guidance from continuing operations is $1,045,000,000, and it continues to be very robust and is about approximately $10.75 per share. With the recent competition win and the Engility spin-off, I believe that we have dramatically improved visibility in our cash flow by minimizing downside risks related to the services businesses. 
With respect to the capital structure, we ended June with $481 million of cash. And as we previously disclosed, we'll use the net proceeds from the Engility spin-off of approximately $325 million to repay $250 million of debt, which is actually happening today. We're redeeming some of our 6-3/8% subordinated notes and the remaining $75 million, we'll use for share repurchases in the second half of this year. And that brings our full year expectation for share repurchases to about $875 million. 
Finally, and taking a look at the third quarter, we expect sales, and this excludes Engility, to be somewhere between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion, earnings per share between $1.80 and $1.85, which includes that $0.05 debt retirement charge. Free cash flow should be in the $250 million to $300 million range, and operating margin in the low 10% range. We expect the third quarter book-to-bill ratio to be about 0.9 and the full year book-to-bill ratio to now exceed 1.0. 
That concludes my comments and we'll begin the Q&A. Thank you."

And we are hopeful that, that will start to take off either at the end of this year or early next year, and perhaps get to a place where we would have steady production and delivery schedule. But again, that order book hasn't started yet because we're still getting it qualified for export. In Electronics, we have a number of new products, particularly in Soldier Systems with just about every single Next-Gen night vision program they have won. But again, these are new production programs and they're just in the early stages again we started.

And I would expect, given our strategy, that trend to continue. However, how fast that needle's moving is dependent on a number of factors.

As drafted, the sequestration is very prescriptive in that it's a fixed percentage across all line items. So you can do the math that way and we can apply it to every government contract we have and make certain assumptions and which would result in essentially a decrease of about 10% to 12% depending on different mixes and things like that. And of course taking out the commercial and international business, so it becomes a less number on the total. However, I don't think that's the end space because I think what would -- the second step, once you'd apply the reductions, would be a significant amount of reprogramming request that gets done and numbers get respread because some things can't get zeroed out and some things might get cut entirely. And that's the step in the process that we really don't know that well. But I can tell you the following, is that we are not on other than the C-27J, which has already been terminated. We aren't on any platforms that are really subject to, as a prime, being terminated that would be a material event for us. We just got reawarded our biggest program, which is Fort Rucker, so feel pretty comfortable there. So in terms of -- we have a lot of content on a lot of things, but no single item being that material, I would say that it should -- we should end up no worse than the composite of 10% or 12% and probably significantly better in some areas like ISR, like the sensor portions of Electronic Systems. We still see the airport security business being robust due to international demand. We see -- we believe NSS because of the areas of focus in cyber counterterrorism security IP has legs, notwithstanding the environment. So I can only offer you some guarded optimism here. Not everybody is going to be -- nobody is going to be unaffected. We're going to get affected. But I can't possibly tell you we're immune to this because of the mix issue we're not. But I think it'll be somewhat moderated by the way we're positioned."

The airport security is still I'd say, mid-single digit growth rates. We -- our system has become a standard in the EU where they have decided that they will only use the millimeter wave technology. There's a lot of growth in the build-out of the airports in the Middle East and Asia, which all need the equipment more and more airports -- more and more countries rather, have been embracing our image-free millimeter wave technology as the standard. The shipbuilding, on the other hand, the weak euro has been reducing some of the sales, shipbuilding sales. The commercial space there, it's not -- it's a little lumpy. And so on some full carriers, container ships, et cetera, there still seems to be a excess capacity in the marketplace. However, if it's cruise ships or royal services ships, there's again, a steady stream but not, I wouldn't call it robust, of new building. It's a competitive space but we have a pretty comprehensive product portfolio. So that is also I would say -- we're dealing with the segment here, so the segment is kind of flattish. But you have some again, low single-digit growth on commercial; offset by some decline in the U.S. government for the segment. So those areas are both growing. And I think overall in the quarter, we probably have, across the company in all our commercial international segments, around a 7% or 8% growth. So that area of the business is growing."

There seems to be some interest domestically now in moving forward on cargo. It's going to become -- it is an increasing area of focus. We have leading products in that space and we are continually looking at investing and broadening our capabilities. We believe we have some of the best products in the world in this space. In terms of the shipbuilding electronics, electronic systems for the shipbuilding industry if you will, the things we'd look at in that space would be filling the white space in our bridge-to-propeller control systems, health and welfare of the ship, things that allow owners and operators to more efficiently man and operate a ship, technologies that allow maintenance to be more performance-based rather than timing-to-build base, which is a significant cost improvement.

And that has always been the focus in that space. And again, that's -- those are the things we're looking at."

As you know, we rescheduled this earnings call from Tuesday due to the hurricane and the aftermath of this devastating storm. We hope that everyone, our investors and analysts and their families are safe. We have many employees who were impacted by the storm and are thoughts are with them. 
Just judging by the headcount this morning on the call, it's about 1/3 of what we normally get, so I gather there is continuing issues across the community. 
We had a solid third quarter. We performed well in our core areas across the company. We continue to execute well on our strategy of staying agile and adaptable and remain focus on growing market share and increasing our value for the shareholders. We achieved this by delivering cost-effective solutions and maintaining our excellent customer relationships across all our business lines. Our employees and management team are doing an outstanding job of increasing efficiencies, encouraging collaboration, of course, the business and increasing market share in several areas, at all times, performing with excellence integrity and accountability. 
Net sales for the quarter were $3.3 billion. That's down slightly from the third quarter of last year. We had diluted earnings per share from continuing ops of $1.98, compared to $2.02 for the same period last year. We reported funded orders of $3.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 for the quarter. Our book-to-bill for the 9 months ended September 30 was a very strong 1.09, however. Funded backlog at the end of the quarter was $11 billion. That's up 11% compared to the beginning of the year. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $309 million. Regarding the Engility business, which was spun off back in July on third quarter and year-to-date results, for all comparative periods reflect Engility as discontinued operations. 
We used a portion of the $325 million cash distribution from the spin-off to retire $250 million of debt. We plan to use the remainder to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock. 
We also continue to evaluate our business portfolio and have been expanding offerings on a commercial and international business areas. 
During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of the commercial aircraft simulation business of Thales Group, which we now call Link U.K. I had the opportunity to visit the business last month in the U.K. I met with many of the employees there. All I can say is it is a terrific acquisition for L-3. 
For our business segments. Electronic Systems sales for the quarter were up slightly due to increased sales in Microwave products for both military and commercial applications; sensor systems from our acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical and Link U.K. We also had some declines in our Marine & Power Systems business due to lower demand for commercial shipboard Electronic Systems and reduced shipments of tactical quiet generators for the U.S. Army. 
Sales of C3ISR led our C3ISR business whose net sales for the quarter increased by about 1% compared to the third quarter of 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower sales for network communication systems. 
In our AM&M segment, net sales for the quarter increased by 4%, compared with the third quarter of 2011. In addition to the Fort Rucker win, in our support of U.S. Navy and Air Force Aircraft Sustaining programs, we also had strategic business wins in the international arena, with new work in both Korea and Canada. 
Net sales in our National Security Solutions business declined by 16% due to decreased demand. We were selected for a quick response cyber program for the U.S. Air Force and received new IT support services contract with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Additionally, we received we recently opened our new National Security Solutions center in conjunction with Virginia Tech. This innovative partnership provides L-3 with access to R&D facilities and exclusive licensing rights to products and services developed there. 
Regarding the DoD budget and sequestration, unfortunately, there is still very limited clarity on the fiscal '13 budget and whether or not sequestration will be implemented on January 2. Politically, this uncertainty remains and were staying tune to new developments and directives as they become known. In the postelection session of Congress, we expect that short-term solutions to sequestration may emerge to be followed next year by larger scale, longer-term deficit reduction efforts to be offered by the Congress. 
Recently, conflicting interpretations with respect to guidelines have not served to clarify the situation. 
In the meantime, we're monitoring everything closely. We're planning for how best to moderate the impact of sequestration should it occur. We are continuing to align our businesses for the long term to capitalize on growth and acquisition opportunities that may arise as a result of sequestration and any policy changes by a new or reelected administration. 
In terms of awards or milestones during the quarter, I'll briefly make notice some of the more significant ones. In C3ISR, we received the full rate production contract for the U.S. Navy's CDL Hawk Link high-speed digital high-speed system. We also received a continued support of our ROVER products. I'm pleased to report that our new SPYDR platform successfully completed the training exercise for a NATO program in Europe, and we're providing continuous sustainment and technology insertion work on the Constant Hawk program. 
In Electronic Systems, our Microwave group received orders for our SATCOM equipment for use by the Special Operations Command, which included an increased contract ceiling that races the total contract value to $600 million. The TSA selected us for an ID/IQ contract to supply medium-speed explosive detection systems, as well as our next generation NIT technology, the ProVision 2. As we recently heard from news accounts due to ProVision's safety, privacy and speed, the TSA is shifting to a millimeter wave technology as America's busiest airports. 
We continue to receive strong for our Warriors Systems products for both military and commercial users. This includes an order for third-generation night vision systems for U.S. Army aviators. The Navy chose us to develop an undersea training range as well. Our newest acquisition, Link U.K., was selected by China's Spring Airlines to provide 2 A-320 full-flight simulators and 1 A-320 flat panel trainer system. We also delivered a system that domestic airline in Russia. 
The Marine Corps awarded us an order for our video products and related upgrades and support. We're selected by NASA to provide communications for the international space station, and we are providing continuing support of the WIN-T program. 
For AM&M, we delivered the first aircraft as part of the program, which provides aircraft sustainment services for the U.S. Navy's fleet of EP-3 and NP-3 aircraft. this is the work was completed 43% faster than previous processes, and we successfully fulfilled the customer requirement for A more efficient turnaround time. 
For Poland, we provided center wing box and avionics upgrades for a fifth C-130 aircraft, delivering the entire fleet of 5 aircraft ahead of schedule. We won a 5-year recompete for U.S. Navy and airports training aircraft for the aircraft intermediate maintenance depot. We were also selected, as part of a team, for a missions systems upgrade program for the P3-C aircraft for the Republic of Korea Navy. For the Canadian 150 Polaris program, we were selected for the interim support contract for both government and VIP transport and are performing very well on this program. 
In National Security Solutions. The business was awarded an ID/IQ contract under the Agile Cyber Technology or ACT program, a quick response cyber initiative. Several L-3 business units are members of this team, providing both hardware and software expertise. This is a 5-year program, with a total contract value of $300 million. 
As part of our ongoing commitment to shareholder value, we continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital and free cash flow to enhance our operations and return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $189 million of our common stock and paid dividends of $51 million. We continue to deliver a significant portion of our cash flow to shareholders through both our share repurchase program as well as our cash dividend, which has seen annual increase over the last 8 consecutive years. We remain strongly committed to this disciplined capital strategy. Overall, we've returned $653 million in cash to our shareholders year-to-date. Our strategy for long-term capital allocation is a balance program of share repurchases, dividends and a disciplined and focused approach to M&A. Our criteria for M&A remains. To find companies that are good strategic fit, providing opportunities for collaboration with other L-3 divisions and to increase our market share. 
As portfolios continued to be reshaped across the industry, the number of companies in the second tier continues to grow. We expect to see more companies become available as budget issues reach resolution. Over the past year, we have received dozens of opportunities that have resulted in 4 completed acquisitions to date this year. We'll continue to be disciplined, as well as opportunistic in finding the right matches for L-3 going forward.

Overall, we had good quarter, with results meeting or exceeding our expectations. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.98, down about 2% versus the third quarter of last year. And while there were several moving parts of EPS comparison, essentially what happened was that lower operating margin was offset by a 7% decline in the shares outstanding. Consolidated sales were just under $3.3 billion, with only a modest 0.5% decline versus the third quarter of last year and sales increased 4% sequentially versus the 2012 second quarter. We also continued to make good progress with our commercial and international sales, which grew 19% to just over $800 million and represented 25% of our consolidated sales in third quarter. 
Segment sales. We had modest growth in 3 of our segments, offset by a 16% decline in NSS. Consolidated operating margin declined 80 bps and was still healthy of 10.1%. And what happened there was higher pension expense, reduced margin by 40 basis points. And within the NSS segment, we took a inventory write-down charge and incurred legal expenses, which reduced margins by 20 basis points. And sales mix changes, mostly in Electronic Systems, accounted for the remaining 20 basis points of decline in margin. 
Free cash flow was very robust at $309 million, and we converted 159% of our earnings to cash flow. 
Moving on to the 2012 guidance update, we increased our EPS by $0.07 at the midpoint due to nonoperational items, which are explained in the earnings release. We also tightened our consolidated guidance range for $13.0 billion to $13.1 billion, and there was no change in the midpoint versus the prior sales guidance. 
At the segment level, sales guidance ranges were also narrowed to $50 million ranges. And at the midpoint, we increased Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance and NSS each by $25 million and decreased C3ISR and Electronic Systems each by $25 million. 
The Electronic Systems guidance now also includes the Thales commercial aircraft simulation acquisition, which closed in August 6 and now will add between $60 million and $70 million to this year's sales. Also in that segment, we had a $70 million reduction to guidance for some DoD funding softness and less booked and shipped orders, which are really a very small reduction and I would say characteristics of the defense down cycle and not a surprise. The weaker euro also impacted our commercial Marine business and is lowering sales this year by about $20 million. 
Consolidated operating margin remains at 10.3%, and at the segment level, we had increases in C3ISR and AM&M, which were offset by decreases for Electronic Systems and NSS. Free cash flow stays at $1,045,000,000 and it's approaching $11 per share. 
If you take a look at the fourth quarter outlook, and you can calculate this by subtracting our 9-month results from our guidance. Sales will be somewhere between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion; margins about 10.4%, with EPS between $2.05 and $2.15. Free cash flow is going to be very strong at about $470 million. And we expect the book-to-bill ratio to the 0.9. 
I'd also like to share with you our preliminary outlook for next year. The major assumptions and his outlook or that the sequestration cuts are avoided and that there are no meaningful reductions to DoD FY '13 plan and budget. For sales, we expect a decline of about 3% and that's going to be due entirely to the Afghanistan drawdown. Margins are going to be lower by 30 basis points to 10%, with minus 10 bps coming from higher pension, and the rest of the reduction, which is 20 basis points from changes in sales mix. Earnings per share, we expect to increase between 2% and 4%. And our free cash flow is going to continue to be very healthy over $1 billion and about flat for 2012. We'll provide you more details about 2013, including the segments at our Annual Investor conference, which will be held next month on December 4. 
I'd like to conclude my financial review with a few thoughts. The current environment is challenging but it's also manageable. L-3 is very healthy and we're doing a very good job of managing in this down cycle. We're continuing to generate solid financial performance, and we are getting stronger with our recent market share gains and disciplined capital allocation, including the portfolio reshaping actions that we took earlier this year. Thank you, and we'll go to Q&A now."

There are no plans to change that strategy, namely we've gone through eighth consecutive years of increasing our dividend, that is still our plan to increase the dividend. And in terms of the share repurchase program, we're in an environment where acquisitions, the number and amount spent annually is decreased in this environment. We've always used the cash data repurchase stock and that is not going to change. As we've seen in the past historically, through a declining defense cycle, there will be acquisition opportunities that will present themselves. We have sufficient dry powder to be opportunistic in that area. As you might recall, L-3 was formed and founded during the last one of the last down-cycles in some of the most important larger acquisitions we've done in the cycle. So we're optimistic that one, we'll continue to provide an increasing dividends, we'll stay focused on returning cash to our share repurchases, yet will stay flexible to address acquisitions as they become available."

For example, I mentioned during my commentary that the ProVision system is now being expanded in terms of deployment across some of the major U.S. airports where used to be us with buyer consistently growing market share there. In terms of the simulation and training business with the Link acquisition, we are first adding a whole commercial line of commercial aircraft simulation -- simulators, as well as -- which is new for L-3. But in addition, we've been winning more business because our focus is somewhat different than focus in terms of being aggressive in pursuing market. It is an important line of business for us as well. We are always looking to expand the ISR business firstly airborne. It may not always be apparent in the numbers, because we're dealing with headwinds related to the OCO account. But nevertheless, we've been pretty much able to offset some of those headwinds. In the Marine Electronics business, we've been expanding in areas for hybrid electric drive, for example, the DDG 51 program, as well as the generator system for the LAMPS helicopters. So those are some of the areas. Obviously, it's our goal to increase market share everywhere in the company that we can't because if in the flat to down budget, really a down budget, when you take OCO into account, other than getting additional awards and growth in our existing programs, the really growth had market share from others.

That said, the growth rate has slowed but we still expect it to be a modest grower respectively.

And that carries with it lower margin. And then, of course, we did have a big impact for higher pension expense in that segment.

We think it's important to have investment grade credit rating, especially that's what the crisis taught us from a few years ago. And at some point, we're going to start growing our operating income again. But we're going to come out in the cycle, it's going to turn. And when it does, we're probably going to take part of leverage and stay with that, credit rating so that will have the added financial leverage from using debt more efficiently on our capital structure.

The discussion that's kind of widely circulating, I think it's in the financial press as well, is that regardless of the election outcome, some action will be taken. In fact, at the last debate, the President actually said that sequestration is not going to happen. Now notwithstanding the fact that, that is in enacted law, what seems to be the order of the day is that there will be either a short-term measure put in place that will differ, delay, the actual implementation of sequestration, while longer-term plans are being developed. As you know, there's a lot of moving parts at the moment, notably the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, if you will, the need to increase the debt ceiling, as well as sequestration. So there's a number of moving parts that I think will be part of a longer-term negotiations slash resolution. So the way we view this is that given that it is an active law and given the fact that there is not a plan in place right now on how you mechanically this gets averted, we are not taking an optimistic view until we get something to be optimistic about. Notwithstanding that, we believe that if there is, in fact, sequestration that the effects would taper in during the course of '13 and not be the full-blown 10%, 12% hit that it would otherwise be for a full year. So I could kind of bound the problem by about that amount and I will tell you that we would expect it to be less just because the way it would bleed in over the course of the year. 
Okay, if that was our last question, just a concluding remark or 2. One, we will continue to deliver solid performance across our business segments, notwithstanding the persistent and challenging environment. Performance is evidence of a clear strategy, a committed workforce, strong program execution, customer focus and agility, which are the key discriminators for L-3. We'll continue to build lasting customer relationships, which do drive our business and preserve and expand our strong market positions, which I think you've seen us do this year when you look at some of the increases and sometimes it gets lost in the fact that we're facing headwinds and, of course, the board yet was still yet able to post numbers that are somewhat flat to slightly up, so there has been expansion in a lot of our business areas. In terms of optimizing the portfolio, we continue to focus on what the future is going to hold and to make sure that our portfolio is positioned correctly in the right places, at the same time staying well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities whether it's market share-related or acquisition-related as they present themselves. So we look forward to seeing everyone at the Investor Day that's coming up on December 4 where we are happy to have a more in-depth discussion. It'll be on the other side of the election, so I'm sure there will be new views that's going to be talked about and of course, you'll hear some of our folks in Washington and I'm sure you'll have some interesting things to say. So with that, thanks for joining us and we'll see you on December 4."

As you know, we rescheduled this earnings call from Tuesday due to the hurricane and the aftermath of this devastating storm. We hope that everyone, our investors, analysts and their families are safe. We have many employees who were impacted by the storm and our thoughts [indiscernible] are with them. Just judging by the headcount this morning on the call, it's about 1/3 of what we normally get, so I gather there is continuing issues across the community.
We had a solid third quarter. We performed well in our core areas across the company. We continue to execute well on our strategy of staying agile and adaptable and remain focus on growing market share and increasing our value for the shareholders. We achieved this by delivering cost-effective solutions and maintaining our excellent customer relationships across all our business lines. Our employees and management team are doing an outstanding job of increasing efficiencies, encouraging collaboration across the business and increasing market share in several areas, at all times, performing with excellence, integrity and accountability.
Net sales for the quarter were $3.3 billion. That's down slightly from the third quarter of last year. We had diluted earnings per share from continuing ops of $1.98 compared to $2.02 for the same period last year. We reported funded orders of $3.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 for the quarter. Our book-to-bill for the 9 months ended September 30 was a very strong 1.09, however. Funded backlog at the end of the quarter was $11 billion. That's up 11% compared to beginning of the year.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $309 million. Regarding the Engility business, which was spun off back in July on third quarter and year-to-date results, for all comparative periods, reflect Engility as discontinued operations.
We used a portion of the $325 million cash distribution from the spin-off to retire $250 million of debt. We plan to use the remainder to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock.
We also continue to evaluate our business portfolio and have been expanding offerings on the commercial and international business areas.
During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of the commercial aircraft simulation business of Thales Group, which we now call Link U.K. I had the opportunity to visit the business last month in the U.K. I met with many of the employees there. All I can say is it is a terrific acquisition for L-3.
For our business segments, Electronic Systems sales for the quarter were up slightly due to increased sales in Microwave Products for both military and commercial applications; Sensor Systems from our acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical and Link U.K. We also had some declines in our Marine & Power Systems business due to lower demand for commercial shipboard Electronic Systems and reduced shipments of tactical quiet generators for the U.S. Army.
Sales of airborne ISR systems led our C3ISR business whose net sales for the quarter increased by about 1% compared to the third quarter of 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower sales for network communication systems.
In our AM&M segment, net sales for the quarter increased by 4% compared with the third quarter of 2011. In addition to the Fort Rucker win, in our support of U.S. Navy and Air Force aircraft sustainment programs, we also had strategic business wins in the international arena, with new work in both Korea and Canada.
Net sales in our National Security Solutions business declined by 16% due to decreased demand. We were selected for a quick response cyber program for the U.S. Air Force and received new IT support services contract with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Additionally, we received -- we recently opened our new National Security Solutions center in conjunction with Virginia Tech. This innovative partnership provides L-3 with access to R&D facilities and exclusive licensing rights to the products and services developed there.
Regarding the DoD budget and sequestration, unfortunately, there is still very limited clarity on the fiscal '13 budget and whether or not sequestration will be implemented on January 2. Politically, this uncertainty remains, and we're staying tuned to new developments and directives as they become known. In the post-election session of Congress, we expect that short-term solutions to sequestration may emerge to be followed next year by larger scale, longer-term deficit reduction efforts to be offered by the Congress. Recently, conflicting interpretations with respect to warnet [ph] guidelines [ph] have not served to clarify the situation.
In the meantime, we're monitoring everything closely. We're planning for how best to moderate the impact of sequestration should it occur. We are continuing to align our businesses for the long term to capitalize on growth and acquisition opportunities that may arise as a result of sequestration and any policy changes by a new or reelected administration.
In terms of awards or milestones during the quarter, I'll briefly make note of some of the more significant ones. In C3ISR, we received a full rate production contract for the U.S. Navy's CDL Hawklink high-speed digital data system. We also received an order for continued support of our ROVER products. I'm pleased to report that our new SPYDR platform successfully completed the training exercise for NATO program in Europe, and we're providing continuous sustainment and technology insertion work on the Constant Hawk Program.
In Electronic Systems, our Microwave group received orders for our SATCOM equipment for use by the Special Operations Command, which included an increased contract ceiling that raises the total contract value to $600 million. The TSA selected us for an ID/IQ contract to supply medium-speed explosive detection systems, as well as our next-generation AIT technology, the ProVision 2. As we recently heard from news accounts, due to ProVision's safety, privacy and speed, the TSA is shifting to a millimeter wave technology at America's busiest airports.
We continue to receive strong orders for our Warriors Systems products for both military and commercial users. This includes an order for third-generation night vision systems for U.S. Army aviators. The Navy chose us to develop an undersea training range as well. Our newest acquisition, Link U.K., was selected by China Spring Airlines to provide 2 A320 Full Flight Simulators and 1 A320 Flat Panel Trainer system. We also delivered a system to a domestic airline in Russia.
The Marine Corps awarded us an order for our VideoScout products and related upgrades and support. We're selected by NASA to provide communications for the international space station, and we are providing continuing support of the WIN-T program. 
For AM&M, we delivered the first aircraft as part of the slip 2 [ph] program, which provides aircraft sustainment services for the U.S. Navy's fleet of P-3, EP-3 and NP-3 aircraft. This sustainment work was completed 43% faster than previous processes, and we successfully fulfilled the customer requirement for more efficient turnaround time.
For Poland, we provided center wing box and avionics upgrades for a fifth C-130 aircraft, delivering the entire fleet of 5 aircraft ahead of schedule. We won a 5-year recompete for U.S. Navy and airports training aircraft for the aircraft intermediate maintenance depot. We were also selected, as part of a team, for a mission systems upgrade program for the P-3C aircraft for the Republic of Korea Navy.
For the Canadian CC-150 Polaris program, we were selected for the interim support contract for both government and VIP transport and are performing very well on this program.
In National Security Solutions, the business was awarded an ID/IQ contract under the Agile Cyber Technology, or ACT program, a quick response cyber initiative. Several L-3 business units are members of this team, providing both hardware and software expertise. This is a 5-year program with a total contract value of $300 million.
As part of our ongoing commitment to shareholder value, we continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital and free cash flow to enhance our operations and return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $189 million of our common stock and paid dividends of $51 million. We continue to deliver a significant portion of our cash flow to shareholders through both our share repurchase program as well as our cash dividend, which has seen annual increase over the last 8 consecutive years. We remain strongly committed to this disciplined capital strategy.
Overall, we've returned $653 million in cash to our shareholders year-to-date. Our strategy for long-term capital allocation is a balanced program of share repurchases, dividends and a disciplined and focused approach to M&A. Our criteria for M&A remains to find companies that are good strategic fit, providing opportunities for collaboration with other L-3 divisions and to increase our market share.
As portfolios continue to be reshaped across the industry, the number of companies in the second tier continues to grow. We expect to see more companies become available as budget issues reach resolution. Over the past year, we have received dozens of opportunities that have resulted in 4 completed acquisitions to date this year. We'll continue to be disciplined as well as opportunistic in finding the right matches for L-3 going forward.
Ralph will now provide a review of the financials in greater detail, and then we'll go on to take your questions. Go ahead, Ralph."

I'll cover some more details about the third quarter and review the 2012 guidance update. Overall, we had a good quarter with results meeting or exceeding our expectations.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.98, down about 2% versus the third quarter of last year. And while there were several moving parts of EPS comparison, essentially what happened was that lower operating margin was offset by a 7% decline in the shares outstanding. Consolidated sales were just under $3.3 billion with only a modest 0.5% decline versus the third quarter of last year, and sales increased 4% sequentially versus the 2012 second quarter. We also continue to make good progress with our commercial and international sales, which grew 19% to just over $800 million and represented 25% of our consolidated sales in the third quarter.
Segment sales. We had modest growth in 3 of our segments, offset by a 16% decline in NSS. Consolidated operating margin declined 80 bps, but was still healthy at 10.1%. And what happened there was higher pension expense reduced margin by 40 basis points. And within the NSS segment, we took a inventory write-down charge and incurred some legal expenses, which reduced margins by 20 basis points. And sales mix changes, mostly in Electronic Systems, accounted for the remaining 20 basis points of decline in margin. Free cash flow was very robust at $309 million, and we converted 159% of our earnings to cash flow.
Moving on to the 2012 guidance update, we increased our EPS by $0.07 at the midpoint due to non-operational items, which are explained in the earnings release. We also tightened our consolidated sales guidance range to $13.0 billion to $13.1 billion, and there was no change in the midpoint versus the prior sales guidance.
At the segment level, sales guidance ranges were also narrowed to $50 million ranges. And at the midpoints, we increased Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance and NSS each by $25 million and decreased C3ISR and Electronic Systems each by $25 million.
The Electronic Systems segment guidance now also includes the Thales commercial aircraft simulation acquisition, which closed on August 6 and now will add between $60 million and $70 million to this year's sales. Also in that segment, we had a $70 million reduction to guidance for some DoD funding softness and less booked and shipped orders, which are really a very small reduction and I would say characteristic of the defense down cycle and not a surprise. The weaker euro also impacted our commercial marine business and is lowering sales this year by about $20 million.
Consolidated operating margin remains at 10.3%. And at the segment level, we had increases in C3ISR and AM&M, which were offset by decreases for Electronic Systems and NSS. Free cash flow stays at $1,045,000,000, and it's approaching $11 per share.
If you take a look at the fourth quarter outlook, and you can calculate this by subtracting our 9-month results from our guidance, sales will be somewhere between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion; margin is about 10.4% with EPS between $2.05 and $2.15. Free cash flow is going to be very strong at about $470 million, and we expect the book-to-bill ratio to be 0.9.
I'd also like to share with you our preliminary outlook for next year. The major assumptions in this outlook are that the sequestration cuts are avoided and that there are no meaningful reductions to the DoD FY '13 plan and budget.
For sales, we expect a decline of about 3%, and that's going to be due entirely to the Afghanistan drawdown. Margins are going to be lower by about 30 basis points to 10%, with minus 10 bps coming from higher pension and the rest of the reduction, which is 20 basis points, from changes in sales mix.
Earnings per share. We expect to increase between 2% and 4%, and our free cash flow is going to continue to be very healthy over $1 billion and about flat for 2012. We'll provide you more details about 2013, including the segments at our Annual Investor Conference, which will be held next month on December 4.
I'd like to conclude my financial review with a few thoughts. The current environment is challenging, but it is also manageable. L-3 is very healthy, and we're doing a very good job of managing in this defense down cycle. We're continuing to generate solid financial performance, and we are getting stronger with our recent market share gains and disciplined capital allocation, including the portfolio-reshaping actions that we took earlier this year.
Thank you, and we'll go to Q&A now."

And in terms of the share repurchase program, where -- we're in an environment where acquisitions, the number and amount spent annually is decreased in this environment. We've always used the cash we get to repurchase stock, and that is not going to change. As we've seen in the past, historically, for declining defense cycles, there will be acquisition opportunities that will present themselves. We have sufficient dry powder to be opportunistic in that area. As you might recall, L-3 was formed and founded during the last one of the last down cycles in some of the most important and larger acquisitions we've done within -- during down cycles. So we're optimistic that, one, we will continue to provide an increasing dividend; we'll stay focused on returning cash through our share repurchases; yet, we'll stay flexible to address acquisitions as they become available."

In terms of the simulation and training business with the Link acquisition, we are first adding a whole commercial line of commercial aircraft simulators, as well as -- which is new for L-3. But in addition, we've been winning more business because our focus is somewhat different than the sales focus in terms of being aggressive in pursuing market. It is an important line of business for us as well. We are always looking to expand the ISR business, firstly airborne. It may not always be apparent in the numbers because we're dealing with headwinds related to the OCO account. But nevertheless, we've been pretty much able to offset some of those headwinds. In the marine electronics business, we've been expanding in areas for hybrid electric drive, for example, the DDG-51 program as well as the generator system for the LAMPS helicopters. So those are some of the areas. Obviously, it's our goal to expand market share everywhere in the company that we can because given the flat-to-down budget -- really a down budget, when you take OCO into account, other than getting additional awards and growth in our existing programs, well, it really grows to take market share from others. So that's a big focus for us right now."

And as a result, some sales that we thought that would have been happening this year are going to be happening next year in that segment. That said, the growth rate has slowed, but we still expect it to be a modest grower, prospectively. With respect to the operating margin, we did have a sales mix change this year, and I talked about this earlier in the year as well and it pertained to a change that we were seeing in the small ISR aircraft business, where we were transitioning from modification work to more sustainment and fleet management support work and that carries with it lower margin. And then, of course, we did have a big impact for higher pension expense in that segment. In fact, that segment is bearing the brunt of our higher interest -- higher pension expense for 2012 versus 2011.

We think it's important to have investment grade credit rating, especially that's what the crisis taught us from a few years ago. And at some point, we're going to start growing our operating income again. But as we're going to come out of the cycle at some point, it's going to turn. And when it does, we're probably going to take up our leverage and stay within that credit rating, so that we'll have the added financial leverage from using debt more efficiently on our capital structure.

The discussion that that's kind of widely circulating, I think it's in the financial press as well, is that regardless of the election outcome, some action will be taken. In fact, at the last debate, if I'm not mistaken, the President actually said that sequestration is not going to happen now -- notwithstanding the fact that, that is enacted law. What seems to be the order of the day is that there will be either a short-term measure put in place that will defer, delay the actual implementation of sequestration while longer-term plans are being developed. As you know, there's a lot of moving parts at the moment, notably the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, if you will, the need to increase the debt ceiling as well as sequestration. So there's a number of moving parts that I think will be part of a longer-term negotiation/resolution. So the way we view this is that, given that it is enacted law and given the fact that there is not a plan in place right now on how you mechanically this gets averted, we are not taking an optimistic view until we hear something to be optimistic about. Notwithstanding that, we believe that if there is, in fact, the sequestration that the effects would taper in during the course of '13 and not be the full-blown 10%, 12% hit that it would otherwise be for a full year. So I could kind of bound the problem by about that amount, and I will tell you that we would expect it to be less just because of the way it would bleed in over the course of the year.
Okay. As that was our last question, just a concluding remark or 2. One, we will continue to deliver solid performance across our business segments, notwithstanding the persistent and challenging environment. Performance is evidence of a clear strategy, a committed workforce, strong program execution, customer focus and agility, which are the key discriminators for L-3. We'll continue to build lasting customer relationships, which do drive our business; and preserve and expand our strong market positions, which I think you've seen us do this year, when you look at some of the increases and sometimes it gets lost in the fact that we're facing headwinds across the board, yet we're still able to post numbers that are somewhat flat to slightly up. So there has been expansion in a lot of our business areas.
In terms of optimizing the portfolio, we continue to focus on what the future is going to hold and to make sure that our portfolio is positioned correctly in the right places, at the same time, staying well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities whether it's market share-related or acquisition-related as they present themselves.
So we look forward to seeing everyone at the Investor Day that's coming up on December 4, where we are happy to have a more in-depth discussion. It'll be on the other side of the election, so I'm sure there'll be new views that are going to be talked about. And of course, you'll hear from some of our folks in Washington that will be sure to have some interesting things to say. So with that, thanks for joining us, and we'll see you on December 4."

As you know, we rescheduled this earnings call from Tuesday due to the hurricane and the aftermath of this devastating storm. We hope that everyone, our investors, analysts and their families, are safe. We have many employees who were impacted by the storm and our thoughts and prayers are with them. Just judging by the headcount this morning on the call, it's about 1/3 of what we normally get, so I gather there is continuing issues across the community.
We had a solid third quarter. We performed well in our core areas across the company. We continue to execute well on our strategy of staying agile and adaptable and remain focused on growing market share and increasing our value for the shareholders. We achieved this by delivering cost-effective solutions and maintaining our excellent customer relationships across all our business lines. Our employees and management team are doing an outstanding job of increasing efficiencies, encouraging collaboration across the business and increasing market share in several areas, at all times performing with excellence, integrity and accountability.
Net sales for the quarter were $3.3 billion. That's down slightly from the third quarter of last year. We had diluted earnings per share from continuing ops of $1.98 compared to $2.02 for the same period last year. We reported funded orders of $3.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 for the quarter. Our book-to-bill for the 9 months ended September 30 was a very strong 1.09, however. Funded backlog at the end of the quarter was $11 billion. That's up 11% compared to the beginning of the year.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $309 million. Regarding the Engility business, which was spun off back in July, our third quarter and year-to-date results for all comparative periods reflect Engility as discontinued operations.
We used a portion of the $325-million cash distribution from the spin-off to retire $250 million of debt. We plan to use the remainder to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock.
We also continue to evaluate our business portfolio and have been expanding offerings on our commercial and international business areas.
During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of the commercial aircraft simulation business of Thales Group, which we now call Link U.K. I had the opportunity to visit the business last month in the U.K. I met with many of the employees there. All I can say is it is a terrific acquisition for L-3.
For our business segments, Electronic Systems sales for the quarter were up slightly due to increased sales in Microwave Products for both military and commercial applications; Sensor Systems from our acquisition of Kollmorgen Electro-Optical and Link U.K. We also had some declines in our Marine & Power Systems business due to lower demand for commercial shipboard electronic systems and reduced shipments of tactical quiet generators for the U.S. Army.
Sales of airborne ISR systems led our C3ISR business, whose net sales for the quarter increased by about 1% compared to the third quarter of 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower sales for network communication systems.
In our AM&M segment, net sales for the quarter increased by 4% compared with the third quarter of 2011. In addition to the Fort Rucker win and our support of U.S. Navy and Air Force aircraft sustainment programs, we also had strategic business wins in the international arena, with new work in both Korea and Canada.
Net sales in our National Security Solutions business declined by 16% due to decreased demand. We were selected for a quick-response cyber program for the U.S. Air Force and received a new IT support services contract with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Additionally, we received -- we recently opened our new National Security Solutions center in conjunction with Virginia Tech. This innovative partnership provides L-3 with access to R&D facilities and exclusive licensing rights to the products and services developed there.
Regarding the DoD budget and sequestration, unfortunately, there is still very limited clarity on the fiscal '13 budget and whether or not sequestration will be implemented on January 2. Politically, this uncertainty remains, and we're staying tuned to new developments and directives as they become known. In the post-election session of Congress, we expect that short-term solutions to sequestration may emerge to be followed next year by larger scale, longer-term deficit reduction efforts to be offered by the Congress. Recently, conflicting interpretations with respect to WARN Act guidelines have not served to clarify the situation.
In the meantime, we're monitoring everything closely. We're planning for how best to moderate the impact of sequestration should it occur. We are continuing to align our businesses for the long term to capitalize on growth and acquisition opportunities that may arise as a result of sequestration and any policy changes by a new or reelected administration.
In terms of awards or milestones during the quarter, I'll briefly make note of some of the more significant ones. In C3ISR, we received a full rate production contract for the U.S. Navy's CDL Hawklink high-speed digital data system. We also received an order for continued support of our ROVER products. I'm pleased to report that our new SPYDR platform successfully completed a training exercise for a NATO program in Europe, and we're providing continuous sustainment and technology insertion work on the Constant Hawk Program.
In Electronic Systems, our Microwave group received orders for our SATCOM equipment for use by the Special Operations Command, which included an increased contract ceiling that raises the total contract value to $600 million. The TSA selected us for an ID/IQ contract to supply medium-speed explosive detection systems, as well as our next-generation AIT technology, the ProVision 2. As we recently heard from news accounts, due to ProVision's safety, privacy and speed, the TSA is shifting to our millimeter wave technology at America's busiest airports.
We continue to receive strong orders for our Warrior Systems products for both military and commercial users. This includes an order for third-generation night vision systems for U.S. Army aviators. The Navy chose us to develop an undersea training range as well. Our newest acquisition, Link U.K., was selected by China Spring Airlines to provide 2 A320 Full Flight Simulators and 1 A320 Flat Panel Trainer system. We also delivered a system to a domestic airline in Russia.
The Marine Corps awarded us an order for our VideoScout products and related upgrades and support. We were selected by NASA to provide communications for the international space station, and we are providing continuing support of the WIN-T program. 
For AM&M, we delivered the first aircraft as part of the SMIP 2 program, which provides aircraft sustainment services for the U.S. Navy's fleet of P-3, EP-3 and NP-3 aircraft. This sustainment work was completed 43% faster than previous processes, and we successfully fulfilled the customer requirement for more efficient turnaround time.
For Poland, we provided center wing box and avionics upgrades for a fifth C-130 aircraft, delivering the entire fleet of 5 aircraft ahead of schedule. We won a 5-year recompete for U.S. Navy and Air Force training aircraft for the aircraft intermediate maintenance depot. We were also selected, as part of a team, for a mission systems upgrade program for the P-3C aircraft for the Republic of Korea Navy. For the Canadian CC-150 Polaris program, we were selected for the interim support contract for both government and VIP transport and are performing very well on this program.
In National Security Solutions, the business was awarded an ID/IQ contract under the Agile Cyber Technology, or ACT program, a quick response cyber initiative. Several L-3 business units are members of this team, providing both hardware and software expertise. This is a 5-year program with a total contract value of $300 million.
As part of our ongoing commitment to shareholder value, we continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital and free cash flow to enhance our operations and return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $189 million of our common stock and paid dividends of $51 million. We continue to deliver a significant portion of our cash flow to shareholders through both our share repurchase program as well as our cash dividend, which has seen annual increase over the last 8 consecutive years. We remain strongly committed to this disciplined capital strategy.
Overall, we've returned $653 million in cash to our shareholders year-to-date. Our strategy for long-term capital allocation is a balanced program of share repurchases, dividends and a disciplined and focused approach to M&A. Our criteria for M&A remains to find companies that are good strategic fit, providing opportunities for collaboration with other L-3 divisions and to increase our market share.
As portfolios continue to be reshaped across the industry, the number of companies in the second tier continues to grow. We expect to see more companies become available as budget issues reach resolution. Over the past year, we have received dozens of opportunities that have resulted in 4 completed acquisitions to date this year. We'll continue to be disciplined as well as opportunistic in finding the right matches for L-3 going forward.
Ralph will now provide a review of the financials in greater detail, and then we'll go on to take your questions. Go ahead, Ralph."

I'll cover some more details about the third quarter and review the 2012 guidance update. Overall, we had a good quarter with results meeting or exceeding our expectations.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.98, down about 2% versus the third quarter of last year. And while there were several moving parts in our EPS comparison, essentially what happened was that lower operating margin was offset by a 7% decline in the shares outstanding. Consolidated sales were just under $3.3 billion, with only a modest 0.5% decline versus the third quarter of last year, and sales increased 4% sequentially versus the 2012 second quarter. We also continue to make good progress with our commercial and international sales, which grew 19% to just over $800 million and represented 25% of our consolidated sales in the third quarter.
Segment sales. We had modest growth in 3 of our segments, offset by a 16% decline in NSS. Consolidated operating margin declined 80 bps, but was still healthy at 10.1%. And what happened there was higher pension expense reduced margin by 40 basis points. And within the NSS segment, we took a inventory write-down charge and incurred some legal expenses, which reduced margins by 20 basis points. And sales mix changes, mostly in Electronic Systems, accounted for the remaining 20 basis points of decline in margin. Free cash flow was very robust at $309 million, and we converted 159% of our earnings to cash flow.
Moving on to the 2012 guidance update, we increased our EPS by $0.07 at the midpoint due to non-operational items, which are explained in the earnings release. We also tightened our consolidated sales guidance range to $13.0 billion to $13.1 billion, and there was no change in the midpoint versus the prior sales guidance.
At the segment level, sales guidance ranges were also narrowed to $50-million ranges. And at the midpoints, we increased Aircraft Modernization and Maintenance and NSS each by $25 million and decreased C3ISR and Electronic Systems each by $25 million.
The Electronic Systems segment guidance now also includes the Thales commercial aircraft simulation acquisition, which closed on August 6, and that will add between $60 million and $70 million to this year's sales. Also in that segment, we had a $70-million reduction to guidance for some DoD funding softness and less book-and-ship orders, which are really a very small reduction and I would say characteristic of the defense down cycle and not a surprise. The weaker euro also impacted our commercial marine business and is lowering sales this year by about $20 million.
Consolidated operating margin remains at 10.3%. And at the segment level, we had increases in C3ISR and AM&M, which were offset by decreases for Electronic Systems and NSS. Free cash flow stays at $1,045,000,000, and it's approaching $11 per share.
If you take a look at the fourth quarter outlook, and you can calculate this by subtracting our 9-month results from our guidance, sales will be somewhere between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, margins about 10.4%, with EPS between $2.05 and $2.15. Free cash flow is going to be very strong at about $470 million, and we expect the book-to-bill ratio to be 0.9.
I'd also like to share with you our preliminary outlook for next year. The major assumptions in this outlook are that the sequestration cuts are avoided and that there are no meaningful reductions to the DoD FY '13 plan and budget.
For sales, we expect a decline of about 3%, and that's going to be due entirely to the Afghanistan drawdown. Margins are going to be lower by about 30 basis points to 10%, with minus 10 bps coming from higher pension, and the rest of the reduction, which is 20 basis points, from changes in sales mix. Earnings per share, we expect to increase between 2% and 4%, and our free cash flow is going to continue to be very healthy, over $1 billion and about flat with 2012. We'll provide you more details about 2013, including the segments, at our Annual Investor Conference, which will be held next month on December 4.
I'd like to conclude my financial review with a few thoughts. The current environment is challenging, but it is also manageable. L-3 is very healthy, and we're doing a very good job of managing in this defense down cycle. We're continuing to generate solid financial performance, and we are getting stronger with our recent market share gains and disciplined capital allocation, including the portfolio-reshaping actions that we took earlier this year.
Thank you, and we'll go to the Q&A now."

We've always used the cash there to repurchase stock, and that is not going to change. As we've seen in the past, historically, for declining defense cycles, there will be acquisition opportunities that will present themselves. We have sufficient dry powder to be opportunistic in that area. As you might recall, L-3 was formed and founded during the last --  one of the last down cycles, and some of the most important, larger acquisitions we've done have been during down cycles.

In terms of the simulation and training business, with the Link acquisition, we are first adding a whole commercial line of commercial aircraft simulators, as well as -- which is new for L-3. But in addition, we've been winning more business because our focus is somewhat different than the Thales focus in terms of being aggressive in pursuing markets. It is an important line of business for us as well. We are always looking to expand the ISR business, especially airborne. It may not always be apparent in the numbers because we're dealing with headwinds related to the OCO account. But nevertheless, we've been pretty much able to offset some of those headwinds. In the marine electronics business, we've been expanding in areas for hybrid electric drive, for example, the DDG-51 program as well as the generator system for the LAMPS helicopters. So those are some of the areas. Obviously, it's our goal to expand market share everywhere in the company that we can because given the flat-to-down budget -- really a down budget, when you take the OCO into account -- other than getting additional awards and growth in our existing programs, the only way to really grow is to take market share from others. So that's a big focus for us right now."

With respect to the operating margin, we did have a sales mix change this year, and I talked about this earlier in the year as well and it pertained to a change that we were seeing in the small ISR aircraft business, where we were transitioning from modification work to more sustainment and fleet management support work, and that carries with it lower margin. And then, of course, we did have a big impact for higher pension expense in that segment. In fact, that segment is bearing the brunt of our higher interest -- higher pension expense for 2012 versus 2011. Prospectively, and we'll get into these details at the investor conference, we expect the margins to modestly improve in C3ISR."

We think it's important to have the investment-grade credit rating, especially that's what the crisis taught us from a few years ago. And at some point, we're going to start growing our operating income again. But as we're going to come out of the cycle at some point, it's going to turn. And when it does, we're probably going to take up our leverage and stay within that credit rating, so that we'll have the added financial leverage from using debt more efficiently on our capital structure. So prospectively, we see a little more debt reduction but not a lot more.

The discussion that that's kind of widely circulating, I think it's in the financial press as well, is that regardless of the election outcome, some action will be taken. In fact, at the last debate, if I'm not mistaken, the President actually said that sequestration is not going to happen. Now notwithstanding the fact that, that is enacted law, what seems to be the order of the day is that there will be either a short-term measure put in place that will defer, delay the actual implementation of sequestration while longer-term plans are being developed. As you know, there's a lot of moving parts at the moment, notably the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, if you will, the need to increase the debt ceiling, as well as sequestration. So there's a number of moving parts that I think will be part of a longer-term negotiation/resolution. So the way we view this is that, given that it is enacted law and given the fact that there is not a plan in place right now on how mechanically this gets averted, we are not taking an optimistic view until we hear something to be optimistic about. Notwithstanding that, we believe that if there is in fact sequestration, that the effects would taper in during the course of '13 and not be the full-blown 10%, 12% hit that it would otherwise be for a full year. So I could kind of bound the problem by about that amount, and I will tell you that we would expect it to be less just because of the way it would bleed in over the course of the year.
Okay. As that was our last question, just a concluding remark or 2. One, we will continue to deliver solid performance across our business segments, notwithstanding the persistent and challenging environment. Performance is evidence of a clear strategy, a committed workforce, strong program execution, customer focus and agility, which are the key discriminators for L-3. We'll continue to build lasting customer relationships, which do drive our business; and preserve and expand our strong market positions, which I think you've seen us do this year, when you look at some of the increases. And sometimes it gets lost, the fact that we're facing headwinds across the board, yet we're still able to post numbers that are somewhat flat to slightly up. So there has been expansion in a lot of our business areas.
In terms of optimizing the portfolio, we continue to focus on what the future is going to hold and to make sure that our portfolio is positioned correctly in the right places, at the same time, staying well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities, whether it's market share-related or acquisition-related, as they present themselves.
So we look forward to seeing everyone at the Investor Day that's coming up on December 4, where we are happy to have a more in-depth discussion. It'll be on the other side of the election, so I'm sure there'll be new views that are going to be talked about. And of course, you'll hear from some of our folks in Washington that will be sure to have some interesting things to say. So with that, thanks for joining us, and we'll see you on December 4."
