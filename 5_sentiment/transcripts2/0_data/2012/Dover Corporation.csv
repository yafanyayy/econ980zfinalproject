Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our solid fourth quarter capped off a record year in revenue and earnings. As we posted quarterly revenue growth of 15%, including organic growth of 6%.",652,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our solid fourth quarter capped off a record year in revenue and earnings. As we posted quarterly revenue growth of 15%, including organic growth of 6%. This growth enabled us to deliver fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.07, a 19% improvement over the prior year. 
In our Energy segment, we continued to see strength across all end markets, especially production-related activity, market dynamics, including the shift from gas to oil drilling remained very solid for us, and we anticipate this strength continuing well into 2012.
Within our Engineered Systems segment, our refrigeration and fluid equipment businesses continued to execute extremely well, driven by a market leading technology and customer focus. We were pleasantly surprised with the strength of fourth quarter bookings in refrigeration and began 2012 well positioned to deliver another outstanding year.
Fluids and our other industrial businesses also performed very well. The fluids performance was driven by significant investments we've made throughout the year in product development and growth in emerging markets. 
At our Communication Technologies segment, we saw extremely strong MEMS microphone activity, as well as solid life science and commercial aerospace markets. We expect the handset market to show high single-digit growth in 2012, with smartphone growth rates much higher.
Within our Printing & Identification segment, I am encouraged by the actions taken by our [indiscernible] team to deliver new products and expand our global and marketing activities. The customers have responded very favorably to our new printers, which are for broader market and application coverage than in the prior generation. 
These investments in products and resources will drive even better growth in the coming years. 
These strong performance has helped offset continued fourth quarter headwinds and alternative energy and semicon markets, and weakness in telecom infrastructure markets. Despite these headwinds and general economic softness in Europe, we finished the year with a book-to-bill of one, illustrating the depth and resilience of our business mix. I feel we are well positioned as we enter 2012.
For the full year of 2011, we achieved record revenue of $8 billion, up 20%, including organic growth of 11% and acquisitions growth of 7%. Segment earnings were also a record, up 18%. Full year margin was 17%, a very strong result considering we absorbed in over $30 million in deal costs and a significant increase in acquisition amortization. 
In addition to revenue and earnings, we set full year records for EPS and free cash flow. We also increased our dividend for the 56th consecutive year. 
During the year, we took several important steps to better position Dover for the long-term. We realigned our businesses into a new segment structure to more closely match our 5 key growth markets. We also divested 3 businesses, which did not fit our long-term strategy. We received over $0.5 billion in proceeds for these businesses and believe we have positively impacted our long-term profile. 
In 2011, we spent $1.4 billion in acquiring 9 businesses, all in our growth spaces. Most notably, Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions. Harbison-Fischer was a great addition to our Energy segment and delivered a strong year. Our Sound Solutions acquisition was also an exciting deal for us, as it expands our products and technology in the handset market. 
As you know, we acquired the business just as it started to ramp new automation and products. The production ramp has been more challenging than originally anticipated, impacting us in the short term. That being said, my enthusiasm around the combination of Knowles and Sound Solutions is stronger than ever. 
Our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce additional deals in the next 3 to 4 months.
In summary, I am pleased, actually proud, of our 2011 achievements and results and believe we are well positioned as we enter 2012. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 15%. Earnings per share also increased 15% to $1.12. After adjusting for tax benefits in the quar",1487,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 15%. Earnings per share also increased 15% to $1.12. After adjusting for tax benefits in the quarter, EPS was $1.07, a 19% improvement over the prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.5%, down 50 basis points. Solid performances in Energy, Communications Technologies and Engineered Systems were offset by the expected lower volume and Printing & Identification, solar and semi-markets as well as significant acquisition-related costs. 
Bookings increased 14% over last year to $2 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in Energy, Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings were stable in our fast-moving consumer goods market, while alternative energy and semicon markets continue at low levels. 
Overall, book-to-bill finished at one, which is in line with our seasonal pattern in historical fourth quarter trend. Backlog grew 15% to $1.4 billion.
In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $276 million or 14% of revenue. For the full year, we generated $786 million of free cash flow, representing 10% of revenue. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue growth of 15% was comprised of 6% organic growth and 9% from acquisitions. Organic revenue growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 25% growth in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies also saw solid growth, 8% and 6%, respectively, driven by the handset, refrigeration, fluid and industrial end markets. Printing & Identification was down 13%, largely driven by weakness in solar and semi. These results were partially offset by fast-moving consumer goods markets.
For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Communication Technologies and Energy where acquisitions contributed 35% and 16%, respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5, and our sequential results. As expected, revenue declined from the third quarter. Strong Energy results were offset by normal seasonality and other segments and weakness in some end markets. Engineered Systems, normal seasonal pattern was evident as revenue declined 11% sequentially, primarily driven by the refrigeration markets. Printing & Identification and Communication Technologies were down 8% and 2%, respectively, due to normal seasonality and weak alternative energy and telecom markets.
Bookings also declined from the third quarter of 2011, largely reflecting normal seasonal patterns. Of note, we saw strong bookings in refrigeration and food equipment and solid energy order rates. 
Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $396 million and $71 million of earnings, an increase of 41% and 40%, respectively. These results were driven by strong MEMS and aerospace OEM and aftermarket activity. Sound Solutions volume accounted for 35 points of the revenue growth. 
Operating margin was 17.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix in the handset markets and production ramp challenges, as well as softness in telecom and the impact of acquisition-related costs.
Bookings were $350 million, an increase of 21%. This growth was largely driven by our very strong MEMS handset margins. We also robust order rates in aerospace. Book-to-bill was 0.88, reflecting normal seasonality and the timing of orders based on new product introductions and handset OEMs. 
The handset market will continue to be strong in 2012, as cellphone growth, smartphones in particular, will be positively impacted by new product releases.
Turning to Slide 7. Energy produced another excellent quarter, as North American rig count modestly group and oil prices were favorable. During the year, and continuing right through the fourth quarter, we saw a shift from gas to liquid and oil rigs. Oil rigs are now approximately 70% of the market, a dynamic that is positive for our Energy businesses. Revenue increased 41% to $510 million, while earnings increased 40% to $122 million. Acquisitions accounted for 16 points of the growth. In the quarter, we saw a growth across all end markets: Drilling, production and downstream.
Operating margin was 23.9%, 30 basis points lower than last year. The margins remained extremely strong even after the impact associated with 2011 acquisitions. Bookings were $520 million, a 42% increase over the prior year, which included 29% organic growth. Book-to-bill was 1.02. We expect the Energy markets to remain strong as we start 2012, driven by the shift from gas to oil and continued growth in North American rig count.
Moving to Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $731 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Fluid Solutions grew 13% to $163 million, while Refrigeration and Industrial grew 7% to $569 million. Segment earnings increased 17% to $93 million. These excellent results are broad-based, with strong performances in both platforms and across most end markets.
Operating margin was 12.7%, an increase of 100 basis points, reflecting strong leverage across the segment. Bookings were $783 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.07. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 10% to $159 million, while Refrigeration and Industrial was up 11% to $626 million. Book-to-Bill for Fluid Solutions and Refrigeration and Industrial were 0.98 and 1.1, respectively.
The strong growth in bookings at Fluid Solutions was broad-based, while Refrigeration and Industrial was led by very solid refrigeration and food equipment orders. We begin 2012 with a healthy backlog in this segment. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $368 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 43% to $45 million. The declines reflect the continued weakness in alternative energy and semicon markets, as compared against a very strong prior year. These markets accounted for $50 million of revenue in the quarter, down 50% from the prior year, primarily driven by solar. That aside, activity in the fast-moving consumer goods markets overcame a softening euro and continue to expand from the strength of new product introductions. 
The operating Margin declined 640 basis points to 12.1%, reflecting significantly lower volume.
Bookings were $354 million, a decrease of 11% from last year. These results were driven by weak semicon and alternative energy markets, which we believe have stabilized. With regard to our fast-moving consumer goods exposure, we expect solid market conditions in 2012. Book-to-bill ended at 0.96.
Going to Slide 10. Fourth quarter net interest expense and corporate expense were both in line with our expectations. With respect to taxes, our fourth quarter rate was 22.3%. The rate was favorably impacted by a $0.05 tax benefit. Adjusting for this benefit, the rate would have been 25.5%. 
For the full year, after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits, our normalized rate was 26.5%. Our tax rate continued lower due to the impact of geographic mix of earnings.
Now turning to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. We expect 2012 full year revenue growth of 7% to 10%, consistent with expectations shared at Dover debt. Organic growth is estimated to be 4% to 7% with acquisitions adding around 3%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies will grow organically 11% to 13%, driven by strong prospects for MEMS microphones. Acquisition growth will add 10% to 12%. Energy should grow in the range of 10% to 12%, comprised of 8% to 10% organic growth and 2% from acquisitions. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow organically 3% to 5%. We also expect 1% from acquisitions for total growth of 4% to 6%. Lastly, Printing & Identification revenue is forecasted to be flat.
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We expect corporate expense to be around $145 million, up about $7 million from 2011, representing continued investment and incremental pension cost. Interest expense will be about $118 million. We are forecasting our full year tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27%. CapEx should be approximately 3% of full year revenue, as we continue to invest in capacity expansion and automation and emerging economy growth. We again anticipate generating significant free cash flow, roughly 10% of revenue. Based on the above, we anticipate full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.70 to $5.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 13. 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits. Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.26 to $0.52 for the year, while net productivity is expected to generate $0.21 to $0.31. We now expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.18 to $0.22. We will continue to make investments in sales and engineering for growth. Combined impact of these investments and higher compensation cost should be $0.20 to $0.30. 
Lastly, interest expense, a slightly lower share count and our normalized tax rate, all largely offset each other, resulting in a $0.01 impact. Net result is EPS growth of 14% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the midpoint. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

As we posted quarterly revenue growth of 15%, including organic growth of 6%.",649,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our solid fourth quarter capped off a record year in revenue and earnings. As we posted quarterly revenue growth of 15%, including organic growth of 6%. This growth enabled us to deliver fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.07, a 19% improvement over the prior year. 
In our Energy segment, we continue to see strength across all end markets, especially production-related activity, market dynamics, including the shift from gas to oil drilling remain very solid for us, and we anticipate this strength continuing well into 2012.
Within our Engineered Systems segment, our refrigeration and fluid equipment businesses continued to execute extremely well, driven by a market leading technology and customer focus. We were pleasantly surprised with the strength of fourth quarter bookings in refrigeration and began 2012 well-positioned to deliver another outstanding year.
Fluids and our other industrial businesses also performed very well. The Fluids performance was driven by significant investments we've made throughout the year in product development and growth in emerging markets. 
At our Communication Technologies segment, we saw extremely strong MEMS microphone activity, as well as solid life science and commercial aerospace markets. We expect the handset market to show high single-digit growth in 2012, with smartphone growth rates much higher.
Within our Printing & Identification segment, I am encouraged by the actions taken by our Markem-Imaje team to deliver new products and expand our global sales and marketing activities. Our customers have responded very favorably to our new printers, which are for broader market and application coverage than the prior generation. These investments in products and resources will drive even better growth in the coming years. 
These strong performance has helped offset continued fourth quarter headwinds and alternative energy and semicon markets, and weakness in telecom infrastructure markets. Despite these headwinds and general economic softness in Europe, we finished the year with a book-to-bill of one, illustrating the depth and the resilience of our business mix. I feel we are well-positioned as we enter 2012.
For the full year of 2011, we achieved record revenue of $8 billion, up 20%, including organic growth of 11% and acquisition growth of 7%. Segment earnings were also a record, up 18%. Full year margin was 17%, a very strong result considering we absorbed over $30 million in deal cost and a significant increase in acquisition amortization. In addition to revenue and earnings, we set full year records for EPS and free cash flow. We also increased our dividend for the 56th consecutive year. 
During the year, we took several important steps to better position Dover for the long-term. We realigned our businesses into a new segment structure to more closely match our 5 key growth markets. We also divested 3 businesses which did not fit our long-term strategy. We received over $0.5 billion in proceeds for these businesses and believe we have positively impacted our long-term profile. 
In 2011, we spent $1.4 billion in acquiring 9 businesses, all in our growth spaces. Most notably, Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions. Harbison-Fischer was a great addition to our Energy segment and delivered a strong year. Our Sound Solutions acquisition was also an exciting deal for us, as it expands our products and technology in the handset market. 
As you know, we acquired the business just as it started to ramp new automation in products. The production ramp has been more challenging than originally anticipated, impacting us in the short term. That being said, my enthusiasm around the combination of Knowles and Sound Solutions is stronger than ever. Our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce additional deals in the next 3 to 4 months.
In summary, I am pleased, actually proud, of our 2011 achievements and results and believe we are well-positioned as we enter 2012. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

After adjusting for tax benefits in the quar",1502,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 15%. Earnings per share also increased 15% to $1.12. After adjusting for tax benefits in the quarter, EPS was $1.07, a 19% improvement over the prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.5%, down 50 basis points. Solid performances in Energy, Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems were offset by the expected lower volume in Printing & Identification, solar and semi markets, as well as significant acquisition-related costs. 
Bookings increased 14% over last year to $2 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in Energy, Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings were stable in our fast-moving consumer goods market, while alternative energy and semicon markets continue at low levels. 
Overall, book-to-bill finished at one, which is in line with our seasonal pattern and historical fourth quarter trend. Backlog grew 15% to $1.4 billion.
In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $276 million or 14% of revenue. For the full year, we generated $786 million of free cash flow, representing 10% of revenue. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue growth of 15% was comprised of 6% organic growth and 9% from acquisitions. Organic revenue growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 25% growth in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies also saw solid growth, 8% and 6% respectively, driven by the handset, refrigeration, fluid and industrial end markets. Printing & Identification was down 13%, largely driven by weakness in solar and semi. These results were partially offset by fast-moving consumer goods markets.
For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Communication Technologies and Energy, where acquisitions contributed 35% and 16% respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. As expected, revenue declined from the third quarter. Strong Energy results were offset by normal seasonality in other segments and weakness in some end markets. Engineered Systems, normal seasonal pattern was evident as revenue declined 11% sequentially, primarily driven by the refrigeration markets. Printing & Identification and Communication Technologies were down 8% and 2% respectively, due to normal seasonality and weak alternative energy and telecom end markets.
Bookings also declined from the third quarter of 2011, largely reflecting normal seasonal patterns. Of note, we saw strong bookings in refrigeration and food equipment and solid energy order rates. 
Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $396 million and $71 million of earnings, an increase of 41% and 40% respectively. These results were driven by strong MEMS and aerospace OEM and aftermarket activity. Sound Solutions volume accounted for 35 points of the revenue growth. 
Operating margin was 17.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix in the handset market and production ramp challenges, as well as softness in telecom and the impact of acquisition-related costs.
Bookings were $350 million, an increase of 21%. This growth was largely driven by our very strong MEMS handset margins. We also saw robust order rates in aerospace. Book-to-bill was 0.88, reflecting normal seasonality and the timing of orders based on new product introductions from handset OEMs. The handset market will continue to be strong in 2012, as cellphone growth, smartphones in particular, will be positively impacted by new product releases.
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered produced another -- Energy produced another excellent quarter, as North American rig count modestly group and oil prices were favorable. During the year, and continuing right through the fourth quarter, we saw a shift from gas to liquid and oil rigs. Oil rigs are now approximately 70% of the market, a dynamic that is positive for our Energy businesses. Revenue increased 41% to $510 million, while earnings increased 40% to $122 million. Acquisitions accounted for 16% -- 16 points of the growth. In the quarter, we saw a growth across all end markets: Drilling, production and downstream.
Operating margin was 23.9%, 30 basis points lower than last year. Our margins remained extremely strong, even after the impact associated with 2011 acquisitions. Bookings were $520 million, a 42% increase over the prior year, which included 29% organic growth. Book-to-bill was 1.02. We expect the Energy markets to remain strong as we start 2012, driven by the shift from gas to oil and continued growth in North American rig count.
Moving to Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $731 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Fluid Solutions grew 13% to $163 million, while Refrigeration and Industrial grew 7% to $569 million. Segment earnings increased 17% to $93 million. These excellent results were broad-based, with strong performances in both platforms and across most end markets. Operating margin was 12.7%, an increase of 100 basis points, reflecting strong leverage across the segment. Bookings were $783 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.07. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 10% to $159 million, while Refrigeration and Industrial was up 11% to $626 million. Book-to-Bill for Fluid Solutions and Refrigeration and Industrial were 0.98 and 0.1 respectively -- 1.1, sorry, respectively.
The strong growth in bookings at Fluid Solutions was broad-based, while Refrigeration and Industrial was led by very solid refrigeration and food equipment orders. We begin 2012 with a healthy backlog in this segment. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $368 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 43% to $45 million. The declines reflect the continued weakness in alternative energy and semicon markets, as compared against a very strong prior year. These markets accounted for $50 million of revenue in the quarter, down 50% from the prior year, primarily driven by solar. That aside, activity in the fast-moving consumer goods market overcame a softening euro and continue to expand on the strength of new product introductions. Operating Margin declined 640 basis points to 12.1%, reflecting significantly lower volume. Bookings were $354 million, a decrease of 11% from last year. These results were driven by weak semicon and alternative energy markets, which we believe have stabilized. With regard to our fast-moving consumer goods exposure, we expect solid market conditions in 2012. Book-to-bill ended at 0.96.
Going to Slide 10. Fourth quarter net interest expense and corporate expense were both in line with our expectations. With respect to taxes, our fourth quarter rate was 22.3%. The rate was favorably impacted by a $0.05 tax benefit. Adjusting for this benefit, the rate would have been 25.5%. 
For the full year, after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits, our normalized rate was 26.5%. Our tax rate continued lower due to the impact of geographic mix of earnings.
Now turning to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. We expect 2012 full year revenue growth of 7% to 10%, consistent with expectations shared at Dover Day. Organic growth is estimated to be 4% to 7% with acquisitions adding around 3%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies will grow organically, 11% to 13%, driven by strong prospects for MEMS microphones. Acquisition growth will add 10% to 12%. Energy should grow in a range of 10% to 12%, comprised of 8% to 10% organic growth, and 2% from acquisitions. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow organically, 3% to 5%. We also expect 1% from acquisitions, for a total growth of 4% to 6%. Lastly, Printing & Identification revenue is forecasted to be flat.
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We expect corporate expense to be around $145 million, up about $7 million from 2011, representing continued investment and incremental pension cost. Interest expense will be about $118 million. We are forecasting our full year tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27%. CapEx should be approximately 3% of full year revenue, as we continue to invest in capacity expansion and automation and emerging economy growth. We again anticipate generating significant free cash flow, roughly 10% of revenue. Based on the above, we anticipate full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.70 to $5.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 13. 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits. Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.26 to $0.52 for the year, while net productivity is expected to generate $0.21 to $0.31. We now expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.18 to $0.22. We will continue to make investments in sales and engineering for growth. The combined impact of these investments and higher compensation cost should be $0.20 to $0.30. 
Lastly, interest expense, a slightly lower share count in our normalized tax rate, all largely offset each other, resulting in a $0.01 impact. The net result is EPS growth of 14% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the midpoint. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

And your observation is correct, I think total segment margin expansion is probably -- we said 40 to 70 basis points, we're probably 10 off on that range at this stage, not much. Not much change is the way I would think about it."

In drilling, we -- because of the, I call it the tapering off of the growth rate and the rig count deployment for drilling growth in 2012, we're looking at mid single-digit growth in drilling next year, 6% to 7%. In downstream and production, low double-digit. So that gives you a little bit of color on the market. Your question on why the shift to oil favors us. Well, to be rather frank about it, on a typical gas well, to bring it in production, we will get maybe $10,000 or $12,000 of revenue per completed gas well. On an oil well or a liquid rich well, it's about $50,000. We just have more product content."

And that as we see that further encroachment on MEMS technology, we believe we're going to maintain a very, very high share of the MEMS microphones for the cellphone guys.

Our solid fourth quarter capped off a record year in revenue and earnings. As we posted quarterly revenue growth of 15%, including organic growth of 6%. This growth enabled us to deliver fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.07, a 19% improvement over the prior year. 
In our Energy segment, we continue to see strength across all end markets, especially production-related activity, market dynamics, including the shift from gas to oil drilling remain very solid for us, and we anticipate this strength continuing well into 2012.
Within our Engineered Systems segment, our refrigeration and food equipment businesses continued to execute extremely well, driven by a market leading technology and customer focus. We were pleasantly surprised with the strength of fourth quarter bookings in refrigeration and began 2012 well-positioned to deliver another outstanding year.
Fluids and our other industrial businesses also performed very well. The Fluids performance was driven by significant investments we've made throughout the year in product development and growth in emerging markets. 
At our Communication Technologies segment, we saw extremely strong MEMS microphone activity, as well as solid life science and commercial aerospace markets. We expect the handset market to show high single-digit growth in 2012, with smartphone growth rates much higher.
Within our Printing & Identification segment, I am encouraged by the actions taken by our Markem-Imaje team to deliver new products and expand our global sales and marketing activities. Our customers have responded very favorably to our new printers, which are for broader market and application coverage than the prior generation. These investments in products and resources will drive even better growth in the coming year. 
These strong performance helped offset continued fourth quarter headwinds and alternative energy and semicon markets, and weakness in telecom infrastructure markets. Despite these headwinds and general economic softness in Europe, we finished the year with a book-to-bill of one, illustrating the depth and the resilience of our business mix. I feel we are well-positioned as we enter 2012.
For the full year of 2011, we achieved record revenue of $8 billion, up 20%, including organic growth of 11% and acquisition growth of 7%. Segment earnings were also a record, up 18%. Full year margin was 17%, a very strong result considering we absorbed over $30 million in deal cost and a significant increase in acquisition amortization. In addition to revenue and earnings, we set full year records for EPS and free cash flow. We also increased our dividend for the 56th consecutive year. 
During the year, we took several important steps to better position Dover for the long-term. We realigned our businesses into a new segment structure to more closely match our 5 key growth markets. We also divested 3 businesses which did not fit our long-term strategy. We received over $0.5 billion in proceeds for these businesses and believe we have positively impacted our long-term profile. 
In 2011, we spent $1.4 billion in acquiring 9 businesses, all in our growth spaces. Most notably, Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions. Harbison-Fischer was a great addition to our Energy segment and delivered a strong year. Our Sound Solutions acquisition was also an exciting deal for us, as it expands our products and technology in the handset market. 
As you know, we acquired the business just as it started to ramp new automation and products. The production ramp has been more challenging than originally anticipated, impacting us in the short term. That being said, my enthusiasm around the combination of Knowles and Sound Solutions is stronger than ever. Our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce additional deals in the next 3 to 4 months.
In summary, I am pleased, actually proud, of our 2011 achievements and results and believe we are well-positioned as we enter 2012. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 15%. Earnings per share also increased 15% to $1.12. After adjusting for tax benefits in the quarter, EPS was $1.07, a 19% improvement over the prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.5%, down 50 basis points. Solid performances in Energy, Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems were offset by the expected lower volume in Printing & Identification, solar and semi markets, as well as significant acquisition-related costs. 
Bookings increased 14% over last year to $2 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in Energy, Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings were stable in our fast-moving consumer goods market, while alternative energy and semicon markets continue at low levels. 
Overall, book-to-bill finished at one, which is in line with our seasonal pattern and historical fourth quarter trends. Backlog grew 15% to $1.4 billion.
In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $276 million or 14% of revenue. For the full year, we generated $786 million of free cash flow, representing 10% of revenue. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue growth of 15% was comprised of 6% organic growth and 9% from acquisitions. Organic revenue growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 25% growth in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies also saw solid growth, 8% and 6% respectively, driven by the handset, refrigeration, fluid and industrial end markets. Printing & Identification was down 13%, largely driven by weakness in solar and semi. These results were partially offset by fast-moving consumer goods markets.
For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Communication Technologies and Energy, where acquisitions contributed 35% and 16% respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. As expected, revenue declined from the third quarter. Strong Energy results were offset by normal seasonality in other segments and weakness in some end markets. Engineered Systems, normal seasonal pattern was evident as revenue declined 11% sequentially, primarily driven by the refrigeration markets. Printing & Identification and Communication Technologies were down 8% and 2% respectively, due to normal seasonality and weak alternative energy and telecom end markets.
Bookings also declined from the third quarter of 2011, largely reflecting normal seasonal patterns. Of note, we saw strong bookings in refrigeration and food equipment and solid energy order rates. 
Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $396 million and $71 million of earnings, an increase of 41% and 40% respectively. These results were driven by strong MEMS and aerospace OEM and aftermarket activity. Sound Solutions volume accounted for 35 points of the revenue growth. 
Operating margin was 17.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix in the handset market and production ramp challenges, as well as softness in telecom and the impact of acquisition-related costs.
Bookings were $350 million, an increase of 21%. This growth was largely driven by our very strong MEMS handset margins. We also saw robust order rates in aerospace. Book-to-bill was 0.88, reflecting normal seasonality and the timing of orders based on new product introductions from handset OEMs. The handset market will continue to be strong in 2012, as cellphone growth, smartphones in particular, will be positively impacted by new product releases.
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered produced another -- Energy produced another excellent quarter, as North American rig count modestly group and oil prices were favorable. During the year, and continuing right through the fourth quarter, we saw a shift from gas to liquid and oil rigs. Oil rigs are now approximately 70% of the market, a dynamic that is positive for our Energy businesses. Revenue increased 41% to $510 million, while earnings increased 40% to $122 million. Acquisitions accounted for 16% -- 16 points of the growth. In the quarter, we saw a growth across all end markets: Drilling, production and downstream.
Operating margin was 23.9%, 30 basis points lower than last year. Our margins remained extremely strong, even after the impact associated with 2011 acquisitions. Bookings were $520 million, a 42% increase over the prior year, which included 29% organic growth. Book-to-bill was 1.02. We expect the Energy market to remain strong as we start 2012, driven by the shift from gas to oil and continued growth in North American rig count.
Moving to Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $731 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Fluid Solutions grew 13% to $163 million, while Refrigeration and Industrial grew 7% to $569 million. Segment earnings increased 17% to $93 million. These excellent results were broad-based, with strong performances in both platforms and across most end markets. Operating margin was 12.7%, an increase of 100 basis points, reflecting strong leverage across the segment. Bookings were $783 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.07. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 10% to $159 million, while Refrigeration and Industrial was up 11% to $626 million. Book-to-Bill for Fluid Solutions and Refrigeration and Industrial were 0.98 and 0.1 respectively -- 1.1, sorry, respectively.
The strong growth in bookings at Fluid Solutions was broad-based, while Refrigeration and Industrial was led by very solid refrigeration and food equipment orders. We begin 2012 with a healthy backlog in this segment. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $368 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 43% to $45 million. The declines reflect the continued weakness in alternative energy and semicon markets, as compared against a very strong prior year. These markets accounted for $50 million of revenue in the quarter, down 50% from the prior year, primarily driven by solar. That aside, activity in the fast-moving consumer goods market overcame a softening euro and continue to expand on the strength of new product introductions. Operating Margin declined 640 basis points to 12.1%, reflecting significantly lower volume. Bookings were $354 million, a decrease of 11% from last year. These results were driven by weak semicon and alternative energy markets, which we believe have stabilized. With regard to our fast-moving consumer goods exposure, we expect solid market conditions in 2012. Book-to-bill ended at 0.96.
Going to Slide 10. Fourth quarter net interest expense and corporate expense were both in line with our expectations. With respect to taxes, our fourth quarter rate was 22.3%. The rate was favorably impacted by a $0.05 tax benefit. Adjusting for this benefit, the rate would have been 25.5%. 
For the full year, after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits, our normalized rate was 26.5%. Our tax rate continued lower due to the impact of geographic mix of earnings.
Now turning to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. We expect 2012 full year revenue growth of 7% to 10%, consistent with expectations shared at Dover Day. Organic growth is estimated to be 4% to 7% with acquisitions adding around 3%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies will grow organically, 11% to 13%, driven by strong prospects for MEMS microphones. Acquisition growth will add 10% to 12%. Energy should grow in a range of 10% to 12%, comprised of 8% to 10% organic growth, and 2% from acquisitions. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow organically, 3% to 5%. We also expect 1% from acquisitions, for a total growth of 4% to 6%. Lastly, Printing & Identification revenue is forecasted to be flat.
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We expect corporate expense to be around $145 million, up about $7 million from 2011, representing continued investment and incremental pension cost. Interest expense will be about $118 million. We are forecasting our full year tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27%. CapEx should be approximately 3% of full year revenue, as we continue to invest in capacity expansion and automation and emerging economy growth. We again anticipate generating significant free cash flow, roughly 10% of revenue. Based on the above, we anticipate full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.70 to $5.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 13. 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits. Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.26 to $0.52 for the year, while net productivity is expected to generate $0.21 to $0.31. We now expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.18 to $0.22. We will continue to make investments in sales and engineering for growth. The combined impact of these investments and higher compensation cost should be $0.20 to $0.30. 
Lastly, interest expense, a slightly lower share count in our normalized tax rate, all largely offset each other, resulting in a $0.01 impact. The net result is EPS growth of 14% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the midpoint. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

Number one, we still believe there's going to be significant MEMS encroachment on the old style audio technology for microphones, we think that still has a lot of room to move. And that as we see that further encroachment on MEMS technology, we believe we're going to maintain a very, very high share of the MEMS microphones for the cellphone guys.

Our solid fourth quarter capped off a record year in revenue and earnings. As we posted quarterly revenue growth of 15%, including organic growth of 6%. This growth enabled us to deliver fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.07, a 19% improvement over the prior year. 
In our Energy segment, we continue to see strength across all end markets, especially production-related activity, market dynamics, including the shift from gas to oil drilling remain very solid for us, and we anticipate this strength continuing well into 2012.
Within our Engineered Systems segment, our refrigeration and food equipment businesses continued to execute extremely well, driven by a market leading technology and customer focus. We were pleasantly surprised with the strength of fourth quarter bookings in refrigeration and began 2012 well-positioned to deliver another outstanding year.
Fluids and our other industrial businesses also performed very well. The Fluids performance was driven by significant investments we've made throughout the year in product development and growth in emerging markets. 
At our Communication Technologies segment, we saw extremely strong MEMS microphone activity, as well as solid life science and commercial aerospace markets. We expect the handset market to show high single-digit growth in 2012, with smartphone growth rates much higher.
Within our Printing & Identification segment, I am encouraged by the actions taken by our Markem-Imaje team to deliver new products and expand our global sales and marketing activities. Our customers have responded very favorably to our new printers, which are for broader market and application coverage than the prior generation. These investments in products and resources will drive even better growth in the coming year. 
This strong performance helped offset continued fourth quarter headwinds and alternative energy and semicon markets, and weakness in telecom infrastructure markets. Despite these headwinds and general economic softness in Europe, we finished the year with a book-to-bill of one, illustrating the depth and the resilience of our business mix. I feel we are well-positioned as we enter 2012.
For the full year of 2011, we achieved record revenue of $8 billion, up 20%, including organic growth of 11% and acquisition growth of 7%. Segment earnings were also a record, up 18%. Full year margin was 17%, a very strong result considering we absorbed over $30 million in deal cost and a significant increase in acquisition amortization. In addition to revenue and earnings, we set full year records for EPS and free cash flow. We also increased our dividend for the 56th consecutive year. 
During the year, we took several important steps to better position Dover for the long-term. We realigned our businesses into a new segment structure to more closely match our 5 key growth markets. We also divested 3 businesses which did not fit our long-term strategy. We received over $0.5 billion in proceeds for these businesses and believe we have positively impacted our long-term profile. 
In 2011, we spent $1.4 billion in acquiring 9 businesses, all in our growth spaces. Most notably, Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions. Harbison-Fischer was a great addition to our Energy segment and delivered a strong year. Our Sound Solutions acquisition was also an exciting deal for us, as it expands our products and technology in the handset market. 
As you know, we acquired the business just as it started to ramp new automation and products. The production ramp has been more challenging than originally anticipated, impacting us in the short term. That being said, my enthusiasm around the combination of Knowles and Sound Solutions is stronger than ever. Our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce additional deals in the next 3 to 4 months.
In summary, I am pleased, actually proud, of our 2011 achievements and results and believe we are well-positioned as we enter 2012. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 15%. Earnings per share also increased 15% to $1.12. After adjusting for tax benefits in the quar",1502,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 15%. Earnings per share also increased 15% to $1.12. After adjusting for tax benefits in the quarter, EPS was $1.07, a 19% improvement over the prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.5%, down 50 basis points. Solid performances in Energy, Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems were offset by the expected lower volume in Printing & Identification, solar and semi markets, as well as significant acquisition-related costs. 
Bookings increased 14% over last year to $2 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in Energy, Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings were stable in our fast-moving consumer goods market, while alternative energy and semicon markets continue at low levels. 
Overall, book-to-bill finished at one, which is in line with our seasonal pattern and historical fourth quarter trends. Backlog grew 15% to $1.4 billion.
In the fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of $276 million or 14% of revenue. For the full year, we generated $786 million of free cash flow, representing 10% of revenue. 
Now turning to Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue growth of 15% was comprised of 6% organic growth and 9% from acquisitions. Organic revenue growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 25% growth in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies also saw solid growth, 8% and 6% respectively, driven by the handset, refrigeration, fluid and industrial end markets. Printing & Identification was down 13%, largely driven by weakness in solar and semi. These results were partially offset by fast-moving consumer goods markets.
For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Communication Technologies and Energy, where acquisitions contributed 35% and 16% respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. As expected, revenue declined from the third quarter. Strong Energy results were offset by normal seasonality in other segments and weakness in some end markets. Engineered Systems, normal seasonal pattern was evident as revenue declined 11% sequentially, primarily driven by the refrigeration markets. Printing & Identification and Communication Technologies were down 8% and 2% respectively, due to normal seasonality and weak alternative energy and telecom end markets.
Bookings also declined from the third quarter of 2011, largely reflecting normal seasonal patterns. Of note, we saw strong bookings in refrigeration and food equipment and solid energy order rates. 
Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $396 million and $71 million of earnings, an increase of 41% and 40% respectively. These results were driven by strong MEMS and aerospace OEM and aftermarket activity. Sound Solutions volume accounted for 35 points of the revenue growth. 
Operating margin was 17.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume increases were offset by product mix in the handset market and production ramp challenges, as well as softness in telecom and the impact of acquisition-related costs.
Bookings were $350 million, an increase of 21%. This growth was largely driven by our very strong MEMS handset margins. We also saw robust order rates in aerospace. Book-to-bill was 0.88, reflecting normal seasonality and the timing of orders based on new product introductions from handset OEMs. The handset market will continue to be strong in 2012, as cellphone growth, smartphones in particular, will be positively impacted by new product releases.
Turning to Slide 7. Engineered produced another -- Energy produced another excellent quarter, as North American rig count modestly group and oil prices were favorable. During the year, and continuing right through the fourth quarter, we saw a shift from gas to liquid and oil rigs. Oil rigs are now approximately 70% of the market, a dynamic that is positive for our Energy businesses. Revenue increased 41% to $510 million, while earnings increased 40% to $122 million. Acquisitions accounted for 16% -- 16 points of the growth. In the quarter, we saw a growth across all end markets: Drilling, production and downstream.
Operating margin was 23.9%, 30 basis points lower than last year. Our margins remained extremely strong, even after the impact associated with 2011 acquisitions. Bookings were $520 million, a 42% increase over the prior year, which included 29% organic growth. Book-to-bill was 1.02. We expect the Energy market to remain strong as we start 2012, driven by the shift from gas to oil and continued growth in North American rig count.
Moving to Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $731 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Fluid Solutions grew 13% to $163 million, while Refrigeration and Industrial grew 7% to $569 million. Segment earnings increased 17% to $93 million. These excellent results were broad-based, with strong performances in both platforms and across most end markets. Operating margin was 12.7%, an increase of 100 basis points, reflecting strong leverage across the segment. Bookings were $783 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.07. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 10% to $159 million, while Refrigeration and Industrial was up 11% to $626 million. Book-to-Bill for Fluid Solutions and Refrigeration and Industrial were 0.98 and 0.1 respectively -- 1.1, sorry, respectively.
The strong growth in bookings at Fluid Solutions was broad-based, while Refrigeration and Industrial was led by very solid refrigeration and food equipment orders. We begin 2012 with a healthy backlog in this segment. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $368 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 43% to $45 million. The declines reflect the continued weakness in alternative energy and semicon markets, as compared against a very strong prior year. These markets accounted for $50 million of revenue in the quarter, down 50% from the prior year, primarily driven by solar. That aside, activity in the fast-moving consumer goods market overcame a softening euro and continue to expand on the strength of new product introductions. Operating Margin declined 640 basis points to 12.1%, reflecting significantly lower volume. Bookings were $354 million, a decrease of 11% from last year. These results were driven by weak semicon and alternative energy markets, which we believe have stabilized. With regard to our fast-moving consumer goods exposure, we expect solid market conditions in 2012. Book-to-bill ended at 0.96.
Going to Slide 10. Fourth quarter net interest expense and corporate expense were both in line with our expectations. With respect to taxes, our fourth quarter rate was 22.3%. The rate was favorably impacted by a $0.05 tax benefit. Adjusting for this benefit, the rate would have been 25.5%. 
For the full year, after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits, our normalized rate was 26.5%. Our tax rate continued lower due to the impact of geographic mix of earnings.
Now turning to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. We expect 2012 full year revenue growth of 7% to 10%, consistent with expectations shared at Dover Day. Organic growth is estimated to be 4% to 7% with acquisitions adding around 3%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies will grow organically, 11% to 13%, driven by strong prospects for MEMS microphones. Acquisition growth will add 10% to 12%. Energy should grow in a range of 10% to 12%, comprised of 8% to 10% organic growth, and 2% from acquisitions. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow organically, 3% to 5%. We also expect 1% from acquisitions, for a total growth of 4% to 6%. Lastly, Printing & Identification revenue is forecasted to be flat.
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We expect corporate expense to be around $145 million, up about $7 million from 2011, representing continued investment and incremental pension cost. Interest expense will be about $118 million. We are forecasting our full year tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27%. CapEx should be approximately 3% of full year revenue, as we continue to invest in capacity expansion and automation and emerging economy growth. We again anticipate generating significant free cash flow, roughly 10% of revenue. Based on the above, we anticipate full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.70 to $5.
Now let's go to the full year earnings bridge on Slide 13. 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits. Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.26 to $0.52 for the year, while net productivity is expected to generate $0.21 to $0.31. We now expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.18 to $0.22. We will continue to make investments in sales and engineering for growth. The combined impact of these investments and higher compensation cost should be $0.20 to $0.30. 
Lastly, interest expense, a slightly lower share count in our normalized tax rate, all largely offset each other, resulting in a $0.01 impact. The net result is EPS growth of 14% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the midpoint. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

I have to tell you, as we -- January is not over, but we're 3 weeks into the new year, and bookings activity at Hill PHOENIX is remaining fairly strong.

We're working on a lot of other areas including efforts around our IT infrastructure, and as well as we're in the very early days of taking a look at some back office opportunities. And you'll perhaps hear that unfold a little bit as we get later into 2012, about things that we can expect to achieve in the back office and through IT. But that's an area that up to now, Dover hasn't spent a lot of time working on. It's the natural progression coming off of our supply chain efforts and centralization."

Number one, we still believe there's going to be significant MEMS encroachment on the old style audio technology for microphones, we think that still has a lot of room to move. And that as we see that further encroachment on MEMS technology, we believe we're going to maintain a very, very high share of the MEMS microphones for the cellphone guys. And for the next 2 to 3 years, we believe there's going to be continued growth in the cellphone market. There will be competition, it's a big market."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. We are off to a very solid start this year. The first quarter revenue in segment earnings both up 14% over last year. Organic revenue growth was 9%. We delivered first quarter EPS of $1.05, a 19% improvement over the prior year adjusted EPS. These results illustrate the strength of our business mix and reflect the positive portfolio changes we've made over the last 3 years.
In our Energy segment, we continue to see strong activity across all end markets, with double-digit sequential order growth. Market dynamics, including the ongoing shift from gas to oil, remain very positive for us, and we anticipate the strength in this segment continue. 
Within our Engineered Systems segment, our refrigeration and food equipment business had a great quarter, capitalizing on strong customer service and product innovation. We saw a strong seasonal increase in bookings in refrigeration and are well positioned to have an outstanding year. 
Fluids and our other industrial businesses also performed very well. The Fluids' performance was driven by the significant investments we've made over the last several quarters. Solid business trends continue as bookings grew nicely.
I'm very pleased with the first quarter performance in Engineered Systems and I'm confident they'll have a great year. 
At our Communication Technology segment, we saw solid life science and commercial aerospace markets and strong MEMS microphone activity in their first quarter. We continue to ramp production at Sound Solutions and expand capacity at Knowles. We anticipate a stronger back half for the year as Knowles and Sound Solutions benefit from new design wins connected with anticipated OEM product releases.
Within our Printing & Identification segment, the new products introduced by the Markem-Imaje team are winning in the marketplace. We believe our new products, coupled with our stronger sales and service organization, has enabled us to grow even in slower markets. We will continue to invest in products and people to draw a stronger global growth at Markem-Imaje.
Overall, I am pleased with our margin performance in the first quarter. Our productivity and cost takeout initiatives enable us to continue to invest for growth. We ended the quarter with a solid book-to-bill of 1.06 despite some anticipated market softness, most notably in Europe. I'm also very pleased with the significant progress we achieved on several other fronts during the quarter. We continue to work on the ramp of new customers and products at Sound Solutions. The magnitude of this undertaking and the related market opportunity is significant. By the end of our first quarter, we had 2 semi-automated lines up and running in our Beijing factory, and we expect that number to at least double by the end of the second quarter.
These lines enabled us to increase volume, improve yield and margin and increase our customer service flexibility. We also made progress on our globalization efforts. I'm happy to report these efforts are bearing fruit as we are now winning business in smaller markets like the Middle East, Australian and Russia. For example, our Energy segment recently won a major contract, significantly increasing our business in Australia. I was also pleased we closed the Clojure flow in Maag Pump acquisition in the first quarter. These deals fit in our strategy of expending our Fluids platform. We believe that adding pump technology, integrating our manufacturing footprint and leveraging our global sales channel allows us to create value for our customers.
Finally, our acquisition pipeline remains active. We expect to announce another acquisition in our Energy segment within the next few weeks, and would hope to announce additional deals in our growth spaces in the coming months. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,183752519,285016,"Dover Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2012",2012-04-18,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 14%. Earnings per share also increased 14% to $1.05. After adjusting for $0.04 of tax benefits in the first quarter of 20",1508,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 14%. Earnings per share also increased 14% to $1.05. After adjusting for $0.04 of tax benefits in the first quarter of 2011, EPS improved 19% over the prior year. Segment margin was 16.2%, flat with last year. This result reflects very strong conversion in Energy and Engineered Systems, as well as our traditional Knowles market. Our outstanding performance was partially offset by the expected lower volume in Printing & Identification and, in general, softer volume and higher cost at Knowles Sound Solutions as we ramp up production in automation related to new design wins. 
Bookings increased 7% over last year to $2.2 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in Energy and Communication Technologies and solid growth in Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings decreased 21% where solid order rate in our fast-moving consumer goods markets were offset by weakness in our solar and semi-markets.
Overall book-to-bill finished at a very solid 1.06, which is in line with our seasonal pattern. Backlog grew 12% to $1.7 billion. In the first quarter, we generated $89 million in free cash flow or 4% of revenue as the first quarter is typically our lightest in terms of cash generation. We expect free cash flow for the year to be approximately 10% of revenue.
Now turning to Slide 4. First quarter revenue growth of 14% was comprised of 9% organic and 5% from acquisitions. Organic growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 23% in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies also saw solid growth, 12% and 7%, respectively, driven by the refrigeration, fluid, industrial and handset markets. 
Printing & Identification was down 9% as growth in the fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets were offset by the expected weakness in solar and semi-markets. For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Communication Technologies. The acquisitions contributed 26%.
Turning to Slide 5 in our sequential results. Revenue increased 3% from the fourth quarter, driven by strong results in Energy and Engineered Systems. Energy's results were broad-based, while Engineered Systems growth was primarily led by Hill PHOENIX. Printing & Identification decreased 4%, while Communication Technologies was down 10%. These results large reflect seasonality in electronics market, coupled with softer volumes at Sound Solutions. 
Bookings increased 9% sequentially from the fourth quarter with continued strong growth across Energy and Engineered Systems. Communication Technologies' bookings in the fourth quarter were impacted by the timing of orders, which we anticipate will accelerate in the coming quarters.
Now moving to Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $358 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year. These results reflect strong MEMS, life science and military defense activity, partially offset by weak telecom markets. Sound Solutions volume accounted for 26 points of the revenue growth. Earnings of $46 million were down 2% and segment margin was 13%, a decrease of 460 basis points. Earnings increases in our MEMS business were partially offset by lower telecom results. Sound Solutions reduced margin approximately 600 basis points in the quarter. We expect segment margin to significantly improve as the year unfolds, most notably in the second half on the expected benefits of higher volume and automation productivity gains. 
Bookings were $356 million, an increase of 30%. This growth was largely, driven by our handset markets. We also saw robust order rates in life sciences and aerospace. Book-to-bill was 1.0.
Turning to Slide 7. Energy produced another excellent quarter as the average North American rig count was up double digits from last year and oil prices remain favorable. Although rig count flattened sequentially, the ongoing transition in drilling from gas to liquid and oil rigs accelerated during the quarter. Oil rigs are now approximately 66% of the market, which lines up well with our product offerings. Revenue increased 25% to $532 million, while earnings increased 42% to $132 million. As was the case last quarter, we saw growth across all end markets, drilling, production and downstream.
Operating margin was 24.9%, a 300 basis points improvement from last year. Margin performance was driven by very strong leverage on volume and lower acquisition costs. Bookings were $586 million, an 18% increase over the prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.1. We expect the Energy segment to remain strong, driven by solid market dynamics, our focus on globalization and significant new customer wins.
Now, Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $822 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Fluid Solutions grew 11% to $180 million, while refrigeration and industrial grew 15% to $642 million. Segment earnings increased 24% to $122 million. These excellent results were broad-based, with strong performances in both platforms and all end markets, highlighted by another outstanding performance in refrigeration and food equipment, which was up 21% over last year.
Operating margin was 14.9%. The increase of 130 basis points, reflecting strong leverage across the segment. Bookings were $896 million, an increase of 8%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.09. 
Our Fluids platform, bookings increased 6%, while refrigeration and industrial was up 8%. Book-to-bill for Fluid Solutions was 1.02 and refrigeration and industrial was 1.11. Growth in bookings at Fluid Solutions was broad-based, while refrigeration and industrial continues to be led by very solid refrigeration equipment orders.
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $356 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 40% to $33 million. The revenue decline reflects the expected continuing weakness in solar and semi as compared against a very strong prior year. These markets now represent about 15% of this segment's revenue or down approximately $35 million year-over-year. That aside, our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial market continue to perform well despite the economic challenges in Europe. We believe our new product initiatives and the strength and sales and service organization has enabled us to grow our business in a challenging environment, a trend we believe will continue.
Operating margin declined 450 basis points to 9.3%, reflecting significantly lower volume in electronics, continued investment in our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets and product mix. We continue to drive actions that increase our flexibility in operating leverage. We completed some targeted small restructurings in the quarter, and we expect some further actions to better align our footprint with the faster growing market opportunities. Restructuring cost related to these actions will be approximately $5 million in the second quarter.
Bookings were $347 million, a decrease of 21% from last year. These results were driven by weakness in solar and semi, whereas bookings grew 1% in our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets. Book-to-bill ended at 0.99.
Going to Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense, corporate expense and our tax rate were generally in line with expectations. 
Now moving to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. Now we expect full year revenue growth of 10% to 12%, which is an increase from our prior guidance. Organic growth is estimated to be 5% to 7% with completed acquisitions adding around 5%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be unchanged from our previous forecast at 11% to 13% organic, while acquisitions will add 10% to 12%. Energy's growth is expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%. Organic growth should be 9% to 11%, up 1 point from our prior forecast. Acquisition growth is unchanged at 2%. Engineered Systems is now forecasted to grow 10% to 12%. Organic growth is up 1 point to 4% to 6%, while acquisitions are up 5 points to 6%.  Lastly, Printing & Identification revenue is forecasted to be down 1% to 2% versus our prior flat forecast.
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect total revenue to be in the range of 10% to 12%. CapEx will be roughly 3.5% to 3.8% of revenue, up from our prior forecast is we aggressively invest in our growth spaces, especially in automation and capacity at Communication Technologies. All other aspects of our prior guidance remained substantially unchanged. Based on the above, we are raising the low end of our range and now anticipate full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.80 to $5. 
Now let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits. Volume mix and price will contribute roughly $0.33 to $0.49 for the full year, while net productivity will add $0.19 to $0.29. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.18 to $0.22 for the year. Investment and compensation is $0.03 lower than our prior forecast. 
Interest expense, share count and our tax rate should yield a $0.03 benefit, up $0.02 from our prior forecast, primarily driven by lower average shares. Net result of EPS growth of 15% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the midpoint. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

Our Energy and Engineered Systems segments had a strong first quarter and are well positioned to produce excellent results for the balance of the year. Printing & Identification is facing tough comps in a slower economy in Europe in the first half. I do, however, expect a stronger showing in the second half as we benefit from our people and product investments, improved productivity and a modest second quarter restructuring. Communication Technologies is investing quite heavily in their first half on automation at Sound Solutions, capacity expansion at Knowles, as well as significant design win efforts. Anticipated second half product launches benefits from automation and additional capacity will be quite noticeable in our second half results. I expect Dover second half revenue to be up about 6% to 7% from the first half and anticipate solid leverage on the increased volume.
As I look across Dover, I am extremely pleased with our positioning. [indiscernible] and global energy demand and wireless communications, a recovering U.S. economy and the continuing opportunities in emerging economies fit well with the focus and the direction of our businesses. We maintain our focus and financial flexibility to continue to expand in our 5 growth spaces. We are poised to have a great year with record revenue, earnings and cash flow. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our team for a very solid start for the year. As always, your focus on customers, productivity and winning in the marketplace has enabled us to begin 2012 on a very positive note. 
With that, Paul, let's take some questions."

Your comment on the DCT, Communication Technologies margin, excluding Sound Solutions are about right. Let me step back a little bit here, and take a historical perspective on Sound Solutions and then I'll give you a direct response to your question. If you look at, first of all, we had been looking at this business as an acquisition target for several years before we actually made the acquisition. And if you look at the second half of '10, and I'm going to pick the second half of '10 because that's before the noise with the Nokia market share dropped started to affect the business. If you look at the second half of '10, their quarterly revenue was running at about $80 million a quarter. And at that time, about 75% of their business was with Nokia and ram. 25%, all other. Now we sort of know what happened during 2011. We experienced a decline or Nokia experienced a decline and in our market share. We've seen it with a couple of other customers and you've heard us comment about the activity we've been undertaking for the last couple of quarters on production ramps with other customers. But now let's bring it to the first quarter of '11. Revenue was about $70 million -- on first quarter '12, so the revenue was about $70 million. But the share positions with customers has changed significantly. Nokia and RIM is down to about 35% of our business. Now all other, and all other is a fairly long list. All other is about 65% of our business. When you do the math, what this business has been able to do and is trying to expand even more is increase this business with all other account list, excluding Nokia and RIM. And over the last several months, we've actually just about doubled that amount of business with the other customers. Now your comment on margins. All in, including our acquisition charges, Sound Solutions was negative for Dover in the first quarter. And I'm going to tell you, we expect it to be negative for Dover in the second quarter. But again, I emphasize all in, including the acquisition charges. On an operating basis, it's mid, perhaps a bit higher than mid-single digits operating EBITDA. That is much lower than it should be and it's much lower than what we expected to be in the first half. We get to the second half, Brad, help with the numbers here a bit. We get to the second half, the significant in this design wins and the impact from the automation projects, as well as the anticipated customer launches in the second half, the revenue increase is significant and the second half margins get us back to the historical margins that we saw and continue to expect from Sound Solutions."

And the -- I wouldn't change my comment on the deals that are, I'll call them, the close-end deals that we have in our pipeline. The multiples are rather constant. That doesn't mean there haven't been some deals we've seen that have gone at higher prices, and we've just elected to not change of the higher prices."

We're going to have very strong growth in this business for the year with a significant chunk of the growth coming from the Maag acquisition, as we've shared. But you're asking specific areas. It's very, very broad-based. We have seen parts of this business continue to do very, very well in Europe, in China, even with all of the reported slowdowns and market activity. We've also seen a couple of smaller parts of the pump portfolio that have been impacted by the slowdown in Europe and especially some of the tempering our the slowdown in construction activity in China. By the business continues to expand. This is a very, very balanced global business for us. It's probably as equally balanced between U.S., Europe and emerging economies with an emphasis in China and Asia as any other business we have in our entire portfolio.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. We are off to a very solid start this year. The first quarter revenue and segment earnings both up 14% over last year. Organic revenue growth was 9%. We delivered first quarter EPS of $1.05, a 19% improvement over the prior year adjusted EPS. These results illustrate the strength of our business mix and reflect the positive portfolio changes we've made over the last 3 years.
In our Energy segment, we continue to see strong activity across all end markets, with double-digit sequential order growth. Market dynamics, including the ongoing shift from gas to oil, remain very positive for us, and we anticipate the strength in this segment to continue. 
Within our Engineered Systems segment, our refrigeration and food equipment businesses had a great quarter, capitalizing on strong customer service and product innovation. We saw a strong seasonal increase in bookings in refrigeration and are well positioned to have an outstanding year. 
Fluids and our other industrial businesses also performed very well. The Fluids' performance was driven by the significant investments we've made the last several quarters. Solid business trends continue as bookings grew nicely.
I am very pleased with the first quarter performance in Engineered Systems and I'm confident they'll have a great year. 
At our Communication Technology segment, we saw solid life science and commercial aerospace markets and strong MEMS microphone activity in the first quarter. We continue to ramp production at Sound Solutions and expand capacity at Knowles. We anticipate a stronger back half for the year as Knowles and Sound Solutions benefit from new design wins connected with anticipated OEM product releases.
Within our Printing & Identification segment, the new products introduced by the Markem-Imaje team are winning in the marketplace. We believe our new products, coupled with our stronger sales and service organization, has enabled us to grow even in slower markets. We will continue to invest in products and people to draw a stronger global growth at Markem-Imaje.
Overall, I am pleased with our margin performance in the first quarter. Our productivity and cost takeout initiatives enable us to continue to invest for growth. We ended the quarter with a solid book-to-bill of 1.06 despite some anticipated market softness, most notably in Europe. 
I'm also very pleased with the significant progress we achieved on several other fronts during the quarter. We continue to ramp -- we continue to work on the ramp of new customers and products at Sound Solutions. The magnitude of this undertaking and the related market opportunity is significant. By the end of the first quarter, we had 2 semi-automated lines up and running in our Beijing factory, and we expect that number to at least double by the end of the second quarter. These lines enable us to increase volume, improve yield and margin and increase our customer service flexibility. 
We also made progress on our globalization efforts. I'm happy to report these efforts are bearing fruit as we are now winning business in smaller markets like the Middle East, Australia and Russia. For example, our Energy segment recently won a major contract, significantly increasing our business in Australia. I was also pleased we closed on the quarter flow in Maag Pump acquisitions in the first quarter. These deals fit in our strategy of expanding our Fluids platform. We believe that adding pump technology, integrating our manufacturing footprint and leveraging our global sales channel allows us to create value for our customers.
Finally, our acquisition pipeline remains active. We expect to announce another acquisition in our Energy segment within the next few weeks and would hope to announce additional deals in our growth spaces in the coming months. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 14%. Earnings per share also increased 14% to $1.05. After adjusting for $0.04 of tax benefits in the first quarter of 20",1518,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 14%. Earnings per share also increased 14% to $1.05. After adjusting for $0.04 of tax benefits in the first quarter of 2011, EPS improved 19% over the prior year. Segment margin was 16.2%, flat with last year. This result reflects very strong conversion in Energy and Engineered Systems, as well as our traditional Knowles markets. This outstanding performance was partially offset by the expected lower volume in Printing & Identification and in general, softer volume and higher cost at Knowles Sound Solutions as we ramp up production in automation related to new design wins. 
Bookings increased 7% over last year to $2.2 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in Energy and Communication Technologies and solid growth in Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings decreased 21% where solid order rate in our fast-moving consumer goods markets were offset by weakness in our solar and semi markets.
Overall, book-to-bill finished at a very solid 1.06, which is in line with our seasonal pattern. Backlog grew 12% to $1.7 billion. In the first quarter, we generated $89 million in free cash flow or 4% of revenue as the first quarter is typically our lightest in terms of cash generation. We expect free cash flow for the year to be approximately 10% of revenue.
Now turning to Slide 4. First quarter revenue growth of 14% was comprised of 9% organic and 5% from acquisitions. Organic growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 23% in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies also saw a solid growth, 12% and 7%, respectively, driven by the refrigeration, fluid, industrial and handset markets. 
Printing & Identification was down 9% as growth in the fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets were offset by the expected weakness in solar and semi markets. For the quarter, majority of our acquisition growth was at Communication Technologies. The acquisitions contributed 26%.
Turning to Slide 5 in our sequential results. Revenue increased 3% from the fourth quarter, driven by strong results in Energy and Engineered Systems. Energy's results were broad-based, while Engineered Systems growth was primarily led by Hill PHOENIX. Printing & Identification decreased 4%, while Communication Technologies was down 10%. These results largely reflect seasonality in electronics markets, coupled with softer volume at Sound Solutions. 
Bookings increased 9% sequentially from the fourth quarter with continued strong growth across Energy and Engineered Systems. Communication Technologies' bookings in the fourth quarter were impacted by the timing of orders, which we anticipate will accelerate in the coming quarters.
Now moving to Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $358 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year. These results reflect strong MEMS, life science and military defense activity, partially offset by weak telecom markets. Sound Solutions' volume accounted for 26 points of the revenue growth. Earnings of $46 million were down 2% and segment margin was 13%, a decrease of 460 basis points. Earnings increases in our MEMS business were partially offset by lower telecom results. Sound Solutions reduced margin approximately 600 basis points in the quarter. We expect segment margin to significantly improve as the year unfolds, most notably in the second half on the expected benefits of higher volume and automation productivity gains. 
Bookings were $356 million, an increase of 30%. This growth was largely driven by our handset markets. We also saw robust order rates in life sciences and aerospace. Book-to-bill was 1.0.
Turning to Slide 7. Energy produced another excellent quarter as the average North American rig count was up double digits from last year, and oil prices remain favorable. Although rig count flattened sequentially, the ongoing transition in drilling from gas to liquid and oil rigs accelerated during the quarter. Oil rigs are now approximately 66% of the market, which lines up well with our product offerings. Revenue increased 25% to $532 million, while earnings increased 42% to $132 million. As was the case last quarter, we saw strong -- we saw growth across all end markets: Drilling, production and downstream.
Operating margin was 24.9%, a 300 basis point improvement from last year. Margin performance was driven by very strong leverage on volume and lower acquisition costs. Bookings were $586 million, an 18% increase over the prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.1. We expect the Energy segment to remain strong, driven by solid market dynamics, our focus on globalization and significant new customer wins.
Now Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $822 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Fluid Solutions grew 11% to $180 million, while refrigeration and industrial grew 15% to $642 million. Segment earnings increased 24% to $122 million. These excellent results were broad-based, with strong performances in both platforms and all end markets, highlighted by another outstanding performance in refrigeration and food equipment, which was up 21% over last year.
Operating margin was 14.9%, an increase of 130 basis points, reflecting strong leverage across the segment. Bookings were $896 million, an increase of 8%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.09. 
Our Fluids platform, bookings increased 6%, while refrigeration and industrial was up 8%. Book-to-bill for Fluid Solutions was 1.02, and refrigeration and industrial was 1.11. Growth in bookings at Fluid Solutions was broad-based, while refrigeration and industrial continues to be led by very solid refrigeration equipment orders.
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $356 million (sic) [$352 million], a decrease of 11% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 40% to $33 million. The revenue decline reflects the expected continuing weakness in solar and semi as compared against a very strong prior year. These markets now represent about 15% of this segment's revenue or down approximately $35 million year-over-year. That aside, our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets continue to perform well despite the economic challenges in Europe. We believe our new product initiatives and the strength in sales and service organization has enabled us to grow our business in a challenging environment, a trend we believe will continue.
Operating margin declined 450 basis points to 9.3%, reflecting significantly lower volume in electronics, continued investment in our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets and product mix. We continue to drive actions that increase our flexibility in operating leverage. We completed some targeted small restructurings in the quarter, and we expect some further actions to better align our footprint with the faster growing market opportunities. Restructuring cost related to these actions will be approximately $5 million in the second quarter.
Bookings were $347 million, a decrease of 21% from last year. These results were driven by weakness in solar and semi, whereas bookings grew 1% in our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets. Book-to-bill ended at 0.99.
Going to Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense, corporate expense and our tax rate were generally in line with expectations. 
Now moving to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. Now we expect full year revenue growth of 10% to 12%, which is an increase from our prior guidance. Organic growth is estimated to be 5% to 7%, with completed acquisitions adding around 5%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be unchanged from our previous forecast at 11% to 13% organic, while acquisitions will add 10% to 12%. Energy's growth is expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%. Organic growth should be 9% to 11%, up 1 point from our prior forecast. Acquisition growth is unchanged at 2%. 
Engineered Systems is now forecasted to grow 10% to 12%. Organic growth is up 1 point to 4% to 6%, while acquisitions are up 5 points to 6%. Lastly, Printing & Identification revenue is forecasted to be down 1% to 2% versus our prior flat forecast.
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect total revenue to be in the range of 10% to 12%. CapEx will be roughly 3.5% to 3.8% of revenue, up from our prior forecast, as we aggressively invest in our growth spaces, especially in automation and capacity at Communication Technologies. All other aspects of our prior guidance remained substantially unchanged. Based on the above, we are raising the low end of our range and now anticipate a full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.80 to $5. 
Now let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits. Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.33 to $0.49 for the full year, while net productivity will add $0.19 to $0.29. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.18 to $0.22 for the year. Investment and compensation is $0.03 lower than our prior forecast. 
Interest expense, share count and our tax rate should yield a $0.03 benefit, up $0.02 from our prior forecast, primarily driven by lower average shares. Net result is EPS growth of 15% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the midpoint. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

Our Energy and Engineered Systems segments had a strong first quarter and are well positioned to produce excellent results for the balance of the year. Printing & Identification is facing tough comps in a slower economy in Europe in the first half. I do, however, expect a stronger showing in the second half as we benefit from our people and product investments, improved productivity and a modest second quarter restructuring. 
Communication Technologies is investing quite heavily in their first half on automation at Sound Solutions, capacity expansion at Knowles, as well as significant design win efforts. Anticipated second half product launches, benefits from automation and additional capacity will be quite noticeable in their second half results. 
I expect Dover second half revenue to be up about 6% to 7% from the first half and anticipate solid leverage on the increased volume.
As I look across Dover, I am extremely pleased with our positioning. Trends in global energy demand and wireless communication, a recovering U.S. economy and the continuing opportunities in emerging economies fit well with the focus and the direction of our businesses. We maintain our focus and financial flexibility to continue to expand in our 5 growth spaces. We are poised to have a great year with record revenue, earnings and cash flow.

Your comment on the DCT, Communication Technologies margins, excluding Sound Solutions, are about right. Shannon, let me step back a little bit here and take a historical perspective on Sound Solutions and then I'll give you a direct response to your question. If you look at -- first of all, we had been looking at this business as an acquisition target for several years before we actually made the acquisition. And if you look at the second half of '10 -- and I'm going to pick the second half of '10 because that's before the noise with the Nokia market share drop started to affect the business. If you look at the second half of '10, their quarterly revenue was running at about $80 million a quarter. And at that time, about 75% of their business was with Nokia and RIM; 25%, all other. Now we sort of know what happened during 2011. We experienced a decline -- or Nokia experienced a decline in their market share. We've seen it with a couple of other customers. And you've heard us comment about the activity we've been undertaking for the last couple of quarters on production ramps with other customers. But now let's bring it to the first quarter of '11. So the revenue was about $70 million -- on first quarter of '12, I'm sorry. So the revenue was about $70 million. But the share positions with customers has changed significantly. Nokia and RIM was down to about 35% of their business. Now all other, and all other is a fairly long list. All other is about 65% of our business. When you do the math, what this business has been able to do and is trying to expand even more, is increase this business with all other account list, excluding Nokia and RIM. And over the last several months, we've actually just about doubled that amount of business with the other customers. Now your comment on margins. All in, including our acquisition charges, Sound Solutions was negative for Dover in the first quarter. And I'm going to tell you, we expect it to be negative for Dover in the second quarter. But again, I emphasize all in, including the acquisition charges. On an operating basis, it's mid -- perhaps a bit higher than mid-single digits operating EBITDA.

I would tell you to think more about the downstream business as having a bump from the low natural gas prices as being a bit of a tailwind for us late this year and going into '13."

They were quite a bit stronger than we had anticipated. So, John, to be frank, coming in to their first quarter, there were probably some questions or concerns that maybe for whatever reason, project timing and customer decisions that some 2012 business that we were expecting had been pulled into 2011. Well, the first quarter sort of proved that concern to be false. The business increase at Hill PHOENIX was very broad-based. It was not driven. I think you're referring to the big projects at Walmart and Target. It was not -- we had nice increase with both of those customers, but it was not driven significantly so by those customers. We had very strong business increases in Canada and Mexico, which has been a focus for the business over the last couple of years to grow the business outside of the U.S. And did we take share? We think we did. We believe that at least on the data we're looking at, at the end of February, I do not have full first quarter data, but through the end of February, our share of the case business is up about 4% to 5%.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. We are off to a very solid start this year with first quarter revenue and segment earnings both up 14% over last year. Organic revenue growth was 9%. We delivered first quarter EPS of $1.05, a 19% improvement over the prior year adjusted EPS. These results illustrate the strength of our business mix and reflect the positive portfolio changes we've made over the last 3 years.
In our Energy segment, we continue to see strong activity across all end markets, with double-digit sequential order growth. Market dynamics, including the ongoing shift from gas to oil, remain very positive for us, and we anticipate the strength in this segment to continue. 
Within our Engineered Systems segment, our refrigeration and food equipment businesses had a great quarter, capitalizing on strong customer service and product innovation. We saw a strong seasonal increase in bookings in refrigeration and are well positioned to have an outstanding year. 
Fluids and our other industrial businesses also performed very well. The fluids performance was driven by the significant investments we've made the last several quarters. Solid business trends continue as bookings grew nicely.
I am very pleased with the first quarter performance in Engineered Systems and am confident they'll have a great year. 
At our Communication Technologies segment, we saw solid life science and commercial aerospace markets and strong MEMS microphone activity in the first quarter. We continued to ramp production at Sound Solutions and expand capacity at Knowles. We anticipate a stronger back half for the year as Knowles and Sound Solutions benefit from new design wins connected with anticipated OEM product releases.
Within our Printing & Identification segment, the new products introduced by the Markem-Imaje team are winning in the marketplace. We believe our new products, coupled with our stronger sales and service organization, has enabled us to grow even in slower markets. We will continue to invest in products and people to draw a stronger global growth at Markem-Imaje.
Overall, I am pleased with our margin performance in the first quarter. Our productivity and cost takeout initiatives enabled us to continue to invest for growth. We ended the quarter with a solid book-to-bill of 1.06 despite some anticipated market softness, most notably in Europe. 
I'm also very pleased with the significant progress we achieved on several other fronts during the quarter. We continued to ramp -- we continued to work on the ramp of new customers and products at Sound Solutions. The magnitude of this undertaking and the related market opportunity is significant. By the end of the first quarter, we had 2 semi-automated lines up and running in our Beijing factory, and we expect that number to at least double by the end of the second quarter. These lines enabled us to increase volume, improve yield and margin, and increase our customer service flexibility. 
We also made progress on our globalization efforts. I'm happy to report these efforts are bearing fruit, as we are now winning business in smaller markets like the Middle East, Australia and Russia. For example, our Energy segment recently won a major contract, significantly increasing our business in Australia. I was also pleased we closed on the QuattroFlow and Maag Pump acquisitions in the first quarter. These deals fit in our strategy of expanding our fluids platform. We believe that adding pump technology, integrating our manufacturing footprint and leveraging our global sales channel allows us to create value for our customers.
Finally, our acquisition pipeline remains active. We expect to announce another acquisition in our Energy segment within the next few weeks and would hope to announce additional deals in our growth spaces in the coming months. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,183752519,285230,"Dover Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2012",2012-04-18,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 14%. Earnings per share also increased 14% to $1.05. After adjusting for $0.04 of tax benefits in the first quarter of 20",1516,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 14%. Earnings per share also increased 14% to $1.05. After adjusting for $0.04 of tax benefits in the first quarter of 2011, EPS improved 19% over the prior year. Segment margin was 16.2%, flat with last year. This result reflects very strong conversion in Energy and Engineered Systems, as well as our traditional Knowles markets. This outstanding performance was partially offset by the expected lower volume in Printing & Identification and in general, softer volume and higher cost at Knowles Sound Solutions as we ramp up production in automation related to new design wins. 
Bookings increased 7% over last year to $2.2 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in Energy and Communication Technologies and solid growth in Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings decreased 21% where solid order rates in our fast-moving consumer goods markets were offset by weakness in our solar and semi markets.
Overall, book-to-bill finished at a very solid 1.06, which is in line with our seasonal pattern. Backlog grew 12% to $1.7 billion. In the first quarter, we generated $89 million in free cash flow or 4% of revenue, as the first quarter is typically our lightest in terms of cash generation. We expect free cash flow for the year to be approximately 10% of revenue.
Now turning to Slide 4. First quarter revenue growth of 14% was comprised of 9% organic and 5% from acquisitions. Organic growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 23% in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies also saw solid growth, 12% and 7%, respectively, driven by the refrigeration, fluid, industrial and handset markets. Printing & Identification was down 9% as growth in the fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets were offset by the expected weakness in solar and semi markets.
For the quarter, the majority of our acquisition growth was at Communication Technologies, where acquisitions contributed 26%.
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 3% from the fourth quarter, driven by strong results in Energy and Engineered Systems. Energy's results were broad-based, while Engineered Systems growth was primarily led by Hill PHOENIX. Printing & Identification decreased 4%, while Communication Technologies was down 10%. These results largely reflect seasonality in electronics markets, coupled with softer volume at Sound Solutions. 
Bookings increased 9% sequentially from the fourth quarter with continued strong growth across Energy and Engineered Systems. Communication Technologies' bookings in the fourth quarter were impacted by the timing of orders, which we anticipate will accelerate in the coming quarters.
Now moving to Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $358 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year. These results reflect strong MEMS, life science and military defense activity, partially offset by weak telecom markets. Sound Solutions' volume accounted for 26 points of the revenue growth.
Earnings of $46 million were down 2% and segment margin was 13%, a decrease of 460 basis points. Earnings increases in our MEMS business were partially offset by lower telecom results. Sound Solutions reduced margin approximately 600 basis points in the quarter. We expect segment margin to significantly improve as the year unfolds, most notably in the second half on the expected benefits of higher volume and automation productivity gains. 
Bookings were $356 million, an increase of 30%. This growth was largely driven by our handset markets. We also saw robust order rates in life sciences and aerospace. Book-to-bill was 1.0.
Turning to Slide 7. Energy produced another excellent quarter, as the average North American rig count was up double digits from last year and oil prices remain favorable. Although rig count flattened sequentially, the ongoing transition in drilling from gas to liquid and oil rigs accelerated during the quarter. Oil rigs are now approximately 66% of the market, which lines up well with our product offerings. Revenue increased 25% to $532 million, while earnings increased 42% to $132 million. As was the case last quarter, we saw strong -- we saw growth across all end markets: drilling, production and downstream.
Operating margin was 24.9%, a 300-basis-point improvement from last year. Margin performance was driven by very strong leverage on volume and lower acquisition costs. Bookings were $586 million, an 18% increase over the prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.1. We expect the Energy segment to remain strong, driven by solid market dynamics, our focus on globalization and significant new customer wins.
Now Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $822 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Fluid Solutions grew 11% to $180 million, while refrigeration and industrial grew 15% to $642 million. Segment earnings increased 24% to $122 million. These excellent results were broad-based, with strong performances in both platforms and all end markets, highlighted by another outstanding performance in refrigeration and food equipment, which was up 21% over last year.
Operating margin was 14.9%, an increase of 130 basis points, reflecting strong leverage across the segment. Bookings were $896 million, an increase of 8%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.09. 
Our fluids platform, bookings increased 6%, while refrigeration and industrial was up 8%. Book-to-bill for Fluid Solutions was 1.02, and refrigeration and industrial was 1.11. The growth in bookings at Fluid Solutions was broad-based, while refrigeration and industrial continues to be led by very solid refrigeration equipment orders.
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $356 million (sic) [$352 million], a decrease of 11% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 40% to $33 million. The revenue decline reflects the expected continuing weakness in solar and semi as compared against a very strong prior year. These markets now represent about 15% of this segment's revenue or down approximately $35 million year-over-year. That aside, our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets continue to perform well despite the economic challenges in Europe. We believe our new product initiatives and the strengthened sales and service organization has enabled us to grow our business in a challenging environment, a trend we believe will continue.
Operating margin declined 450 basis points to 9.3%, reflecting significantly lower volume in electronics, continued investment in our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets, and product mix. We continue to drive actions that increase our flexibility in operating leverage. We completed some targeted small restructurings in the quarter, and we expect some further actions to better align our footprint with the faster-growing market opportunities. Restructuring costs related to these actions will be approximately $5 million in the second quarter.
Bookings were $347 million, a decrease of 21% from last year. These results were driven by weakness in solar and semi, whereas bookings grew 1% in our fast-moving consumer goods and industrial markets. Book-to-bill ended at 0.99.
Going to Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense, corporate expense and our tax rate were generally in line with expectations. 
Now moving to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue growth of 10% to 12%, which is an increase from our prior guidance. Organic growth is estimated to be 5% to 7%, with completed acquisitions adding around 5%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be unchanged from our previous forecast at 11% to 13% organic, while acquisitions will add 10% to 12%. Energy's growth is expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%. Organic growth should be 9% to 11%, up 1 point from our prior forecast. Acquisition growth is unchanged at 2%. 
Engineered Systems is now forecasted to grow 10% to 12%. Organic growth is up 1 point to 4% to 6%, while acquisitions are up 5 points to 6%. Lastly, Printing & Identification revenue is forecasted to be down 1% to 2% versus our prior flat forecast.
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect total revenue to be in the range of 10% to 12%. CapEx will be roughly 3.5% to 3.8% of revenue, up from our prior forecast, as we aggressively invest in our growth spaces, especially in automation and capacity at Communication Technologies. All other aspects of our prior guidance remain substantially unchanged. Based on the above, we are raising the low end of our range and now anticipate a full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.80 to $5. 
Now let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of tax benefits. Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.33 to $0.49 for the full year, while net productivity will add $0.19 to $0.29. We expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.18 to $0.22 for the year. Investment and compensation is $0.03 lower than our prior forecast. 
Interest expense, share count and our tax rate should yield a $0.03 benefit, up $0.02 from our prior forecast, primarily driven by lower average shares. The net result is EPS growth of 15% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the midpoint. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

Our Energy and Engineered Systems segments had a strong first quarter and are well positioned to produce excellent results for the balance of the year. Printing & Identification is facing tough comps and a slower economy in Europe in the first half. I do, however, expect a stronger showing in the second half as we benefit from our people and product investments, improved productivity and a modest second quarter restructuring. 
Communication Technologies is investing quite heavily in the first half on automation at Sound Solutions, capacity expansion at Knowles, as well as significant design win efforts. Anticipated second half product launches, benefits from automation and additional capacity will be quite noticeable in their second half results. 
I expect Dover's second half revenue to be up about 6% to 7% from the first half and anticipate solid leverage on the increased volume.
As I look across Dover, I am extremely pleased with our positioning. Trends in global energy demand and wireless communication, a recovering U.S. economy and the continuing opportunities in emerging economies fit well with the focus and the direction of our businesses. We maintain our focus and financial flexibility to continue to expand in our 5 growth spaces. We are poised to have a great year with record revenue, earnings and cash flow. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our team for a very solid start to the year. As always, your focus on customers, productivity and winning in the marketplace has enabled us to begin 2012 on a very positive note.

Your comment on the DCT, Communication Technologies margins, excluding Sound Solutions, are about right. Shannon, let me step back a little bit here and take a historical perspective on Sound Solutions, and then I'll give you a direct response to your question. If you look at -- first of all, we had been looking at this business as an acquisition target for several years before we actually made the acquisition. And if you look at the second half of '10 -- and I'm going to pick the second half of '10 because that's before the noise with the Nokia market share drop started to affect the business. If you look at the second half of '10, their quarterly revenue was running at about $80 million a quarter. And at that time, about 75% of their business was with Nokia and RIM; 25%, all other. Now we sort of know what happened during 2011. We experienced a decline -- or Nokia experienced a decline in their market share. We've seen it with a couple of other customers. And you've heard us comment about the activity we've been undertaking for the last couple of quarters on production ramps with other customers. But now let's bring it to the first quarter of '11. So the revenue was about $70 million -- on first quarter of '12, I'm sorry. So the revenue was about $70 million. But the share positions with customers has changed significantly. Nokia and RIM is down to about 35% of our business. Now all other, and all other is a fairly long list, but all other is about 65% of our business. When you do the math, what this business has been able to do and is trying to expand even more, is increase this business with the all-other account list, excluding Nokia and RIM. And over the last several months, we've actually just about doubled that amount of business with the other customers. Now your comment on margins. All in, including our acquisition charges, Sound Solutions was negative for Dover in the first quarter. And I'm going to tell you, we expect it to be negative for Dover in the second quarter. But again, I emphasize ""all in,"" including the acquisition charges. On an operating basis, it's mid -- perhaps a bit higher than mid-single digits operating EBITDA. That is much lower than it should be and it's much lower than what we expect it to be..."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before I get to our second quarter results, I'd like to share a few observations on the changes we saw in the macroenvironment during the quarter. 
We entered the second quarter knowing we were dealing with some modest challenges in the Europe and a slowing economy in China. The decline in Europe was greater than our expectations. These weaker conditions were felt most notably within our fluids platform and our printing and identification segment. 
With respect to China, we experienced some of the effects of the slowing export market in a few of our businesses. Our U.S. markets held up quite well, namely refrigeration and food equipment, industrial, energy, commercial aerospace and Life Sciences. 
Now let me provide some comments on our second quarter results. We posted revenue of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8%. Our second quarter EPS of $1.15 was a slight improvement over the prior-year adjusted EPS. In our energy segment, we continued to see growth across our end markets with production in downstream being the strongest. As a result, we posted strong organic revenue growth in the quarter. As I shared with you before, while rig count has flatten, market dynamics provide a solid environment for our products and services. These dynamics include the ongoing shift from gas to oil, oil prices supporting continued CapEx for production and a strengthening downstream market.  We expect energy results to remain solid for the balance of the year. 
At our Communication Technologies segment, we saw the continuation of a strong smartphone market as well as solid commercial aerospace and life science markets. Telecom markets remain weak. The -- was 25% organic growth in our MEMS sales to the handset market in the second quarter, and we expect even stronger MEMS performance in the second half. 
Although results at Sound Solutions continue to be significantly impacted by further OEM share shifts, I was especially encouraged by increasing order rates on new design wins in the quarter and expect shipments at Sound Solutions to accelerate through the second half. 
Within our engineered system segments, refrigeration and food equipment markets were solid as were most of our U.S. industrial end markets. Regarding our fluids platform, the strong start for Maag pump was offset by a weaker Europe and China. The result for the segment was lower-than-anticipated revenue in fluids largely offset by 8% revenue growth in refrigeration and food equipment. Going forward, we believe second half results in refrigeration will remain solid on the strength of an active remodeling market, our leading technology and our customers' continued focus on Energy Efficiency. 
Our U.S. industrial markets, which account for 65% of segment revenue, should be rather stable. Within our printing and identification segment, we continue to see a weak but improving market through electronics equipment. Within our consumer goods and industrial markets, our focus on new products, channel expansion and service is making a difference. For Markem-Imaje, this result in a 5% organic growth excluding the impact of currency. A strong results in North America and modest growth in China offset a weak Europe. We expect improved results in the back half of the year driven by new product launches, normal seasonality and the benefits of our first half restructuring activities. 
Overall, the strength of our businesses enabled Dover to deliver segment margin of 16.7% in the quarter, inclusive of $11 million of restructuring and deal costs. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill of 0.99. 
I was pleased with our free cash flow generation in the second quarter as it improved 30% over the prior-year period. Our teams continue to focus on working capital management and lean activity. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we remain highly disciplined on valuation. The opportunities in -- are all strategic add-ons, highly synergistic and offer strong integration opportunities. 
In summary, I believe our second half will be stronger than the first as revenue in our handset businesses will be up significantly. I also expect solid contribution from our businesses serving the oil production, downstream energy, fast-moving consumer goods and U.S. industrial markets. With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,213698234,326601,"Dover Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, comprised of 3% organic growth and acquisition growth of 7%, offset in part by 2% on favorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings p",1549,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, comprised of 3% organic growth and acquisition growth of 7%, offset in part by 2% on favorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings per share was $1.15. This result was below our expectations, primarily due to a $0.07 impact from a weaker Europe and unfavorable foreign exchange. 
After adjusting for $0.12 of tax benefits in the second quarter of 2011, EPS improved 1% over the prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.7%, a decline of 140 basis points. This result reflects solid performance in energy offset by lower volume and printing and identification, volume declines in costs associated with new design wins at Sound Solutions and mix within Engineered Systems. 
We also absorbed nearly $11 million of restructuring and deal costs in the quarter. Absent these costs, segment margin would have been 17.2%. 
Bookings increased 9% over last year to $2.1 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in energy and communication technologies, a solid growth in -- and a solid growth in Engineered Systems. In printing and identification, bookings decreased 7% where stable order rates and our consumer goods markets were offset by tough comps in our electronic electronics market. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.99. Backlog grew 12% to $1.7 billion. 
In the second quarter, we generated $178 million of the free cash flow or 8% of revenue, an increase of $45 million over the prior year. We expect free cash flow for the year to be around 10% of revenue. 
Now turning to Slide 4, which shows our revenue growth. Organic growth remained strong at energies, achieving 14% in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies both grew by 4%, driven by refrigeration and food equipment, commercial aerospace and handset markets. Printing and identification was down 10%. For the quarter, acquisition growth at Communication Technologies was 22%. Energy and Engineered Systems both posted acquisition growth of 6%, led by our recently completed deals, PCF and Maag, respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5 on our sequential results. Revenue increased 5% from the first quarter with all 4 segments showing sequential growth. Engineered Systems increased 8%, primarily driven by refrigeration, food equipment and acquisitions. Printing and identification increased 5% with all markets except the solid portion of electronics showing sequential improvement. Communication technologies and energy both increased 1%. In energy, production in downstream markets performed well sequentially. 
Bookings decreased 2% sequentially from the first quarter. Growth of 7% at Communication Technologies was led by the handset market. Sequential bookings growth of 3% at printing and identification was broad-based. Engineered Systems, bookings declined 3% sequentially, largely impacted by the timing of refrigeration orders and continued weakness in the refuse vehicle portion of our industrial markets. 
Energy bookings declined 9%, primarily driven by moderating North American rig count, Canadian spring floor and large international orders in the first quarter. 
Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $362 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year. These results reflect strong MEMS, commercial aerospace and life sciences activities partially offset by weak telecom markets. Sound Solutions volume accounted for 22 points of the revenue growth. Earnings of $50 million were down 8%, and segment margin was 13.9%, a decrease of 500 basis points. Adjusting for Sound Solutions, margin would have been 20.8% in the quarter. 
We continue to expect segment margin to improve in the second half on the anticipated benefits of higher volume. Bookings were 383 million, an increase of 24%. This growth was largely driven by our handset. Book-to-bill finished at 1.06. 
Now turning to Slide 7. Energy revenue increased 19% to $539 million while earnings increased 21% to $134 million. Energy produced another strong quarter as the average North American rig count was up 6% from last year, and oil prices remain constructed for continued production. Although rig count remained flat sequentially, we continue to benefit from several factors including approximately 70% of active rigs dedicated to oil as well as a solid downstream market. As was the case last quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth across all end markets led by production. 
Operating margin was 24.9%, a 60 basis points improvement from last year. Bookings were 530 million, a 12% increase over the prior year book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 8. Engineered Systems sales were $886 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Earnings improved 4% to $134 million. Fluid Solutions grew 19% to $212 million, benefiting from recent acquisitions while refrigeration and industrial grew 4% to $675 million. In our fluids platform, organic revenue was down 4% due primarily to a weaker Europe. Operating margin was 15.1%, a decrease of 50 basis points from the prior year. This performance included roughly 100 basis points of incremental acquisition amortization costs. Bookings were 870 million, an increase of 9% resulting in the book-to-bill of 0.98. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 16% to $204 million while refrigeration industrial was up 7% to $666 million. Book-to-bill for Fluid Solutions was 0.96, and refrigeration industrials was 0.99. Bookings at Fluid Solutions included 21% acquisition growth, while refrigeration industrial was principally led by our businesses serving the food, equipment and U.S. industrial markets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Print and identification revenue was $370 million, a decrease of 14% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 39% to $42 million. The revenue decline reflects the expected continued weakness in our electronic markets as compared to a very strong prior year, a weak Europe as well as unfavorable foreign exchange. The solar and semi-exposure of our electronics market now about 16% of revenue was down approximately $47 million year-over-year. That aside, our consumer goods and industrial markets continued to perform well. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, organic growth in consumer goods and industrial markets was 5%. 
Operating margin declined 450 basis points to 11.3%, reflecting, significantly lower volume in electronics, $5 million of restructuring costs and continued strategic investments. The restructuring actions taken in the quarter are to better align our global footprint with higher growth geographic markets. Also, our investments in sales and service are yielding benefits in the form of year-over-year growth in North America and Asia. 
Bookings were 358 million, a decrease of 7% from last year. In the consumer goods and industrial markets, bookings increased 3%. Book-to-bill ended at 0.97. 
Now on Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense and corporate expense were generally in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 27.5%. This rate was slightly higher than our prior forecast and largely impacted by mix of geographic earnings. 
Now turning to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. We now expect full-year revenue growth of 8% to 10%. Organic growth is estimated to be 3% to 5% and completed acquisitions adding around 5%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be 17% to 18% for the year, about 5 percentage points lower than our last guidance. This forecast is comprised of 7% to 8% organic growth and 10% from acquisitions. The main drivers of this revision are primarily OEM share ships and the timing of orders at Sound Solutions. 
Energy growth is expected to be in the range of 15% to 16%. Organic growth is largely unchanged at 10% to 11%. Acquisition growth will be around 5%. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow 9% to 10%. Organic growth is down roughly 1.5 points to 3% to 4% from our prior guidance on a weaker Europe and a slowing China market. Acquisition at 6%. 
Lastly, in printing identification, a weak Europe including unfavorable foreign exchange and do more conservative outlook on electronics is driving organic revenue forecast down 6 points. We now expect revenue to decline 7% to 8.5% as compared to the prior year. 
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect revenue to be in the range of 8% to 10%. Corporate expense, interest expense and CapEx remain substantially unchanged. We now expect our 2012 tax rate to be around 27%. Based on the above, we expect full-year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.70 to $4.85. This guidance reflects a $0.125 reduction from our prior forecast at the midpoint. This change primarily reflects a $0.15 reduction related to Europe, China and unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Now let's turn to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of discrete tax benefits. Volume mix and price will contribute roughly $0.28 to $0.37 for the full year, while net productivity will add $0.22 to $0.32. Investment and compensation is now $0.08 to $0.14, reduced by $0.11 from our last forecast. 
We expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.03 to $0.05 for the year, down from our prior forecast. This revision largely reflect the timing of orders and OEM share shifts at Sound Solutions. Interest expense share count in our tax rate should lead to $0.01 benefit, down slightly from our prior forecast largely driven by slightly higher tax rate. The net result is EPS growth of 12% over our adjusted each 2011 EPS at the midpoint. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

And, Scott, I think by the time we get to the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we're going to start to see the operating margins of this business set the base for what we'll expect in the 2013, which I think will be very reflective of the business performance on this business that we expect it when we made the acquisition.

Is that difference there -- can you maybe just talk about that walk and I guess leveraging data performed normal seasonal you with the exception of this ramp in context?

We got -- I think we've got a fairly even spread in the second half between third quarter and fourth quarter with the total Knowles business. The other part of your question was around seasonality? The only difference, the only difference in the second half of this year with respect to seasonality would be around the comp tech part of the business. And it is interesting. Just because of the timing of these product launches, Steve, historically, we've always looked at the Knowles MEMS business is being 45% in the first half and 55% in the second half. And that's historically, that's where you sort of laid the revenue waterfall during the year because of this from product launches in the second half. It's probably closer to 40-60. And that's a significant change. Beyond that, you're not going to see any other differences in our seasonality. We still look at a seasonably weaker quarter from Phoenix in the fourth quarter than we do the preceding 3 quarters. And I'm not sure there's any other business in Dover that has such a strong seasonal trend as HP."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before I get to our second quarter results, I'd like to share a few observations on the changes we saw in the macroenvironment during the quarter. We",708,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before I get to our second quarter results, I'd like to share a few observations on the changes we saw in the macroenvironment during the quarter. 
We entered the second quarter knowing we were dealing with some modest challenges in Europe and a slowing economy in China. The decline in Europe was greater than our expectations. These weaker conditions were felt most notably within our fluids platform and our Printing & Identification segment. With respect to China, we experienced some of the effects of a slowing export market in a few of our businesses. Our U.S. markets held up quite well, namely, refrigeration and food equipment, industrial, energy, commercial aerospace and life sciences. 
Now let me provide some comments on our second quarter results. We posted revenue of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8%. Our second quarter EPS of $1.15 was a slight improvement over the prior year adjusted EPS. In our Energy segment, we continued to see growth across our end markets with production and downstream being the strongest. As a result, we posted strong organic revenue growth in the quarter. As I've shared with you before, while rig count has flattened, market dynamics provide a solid environment for our products and services. These dynamics include the ongoing shift from gas to oil, oil prices supporting continued CapEx for production and a strengthening downstream market. We expect Energy results to remain solid for the balance of the year. 
At our Communication Technologies segment, we saw the continuation of a strong smartphone market, as well as solid commercial aerospace and life science markets. Telecom markets remain weak. The highlight was 25% organic growth in our MEMS sales to the handset market in the second quarter, and we expect even stronger MEMS performance in the second half. Although results at Sound Solutions continue to be significantly impacted by further OEM share shifts, I was especially encouraged by increasing order rates on new design wins in the quarter and expect shipments at Sound Solutions to accelerate through the second half. 
Within our Engineered Systems segment, refrigeration and food equipment markets were solid as were most of our U.S. industrial end markets. Regarding our fluids platform, the strong start for Maag Pump was offset by a weaker Europe and China. The result for the segment was lower-than-anticipated revenue in fluids, largely offset by 8% revenue growth in refrigeration and food equipment. Going forward, we believe second half results in refrigeration will remain solid on the strength of an active remodeling market, our leading technology and our customers' continued focus on energy efficiency. Our U.S. industrial markets, which account for 65% of segment revenue, should be rather stable. 
Within our Printing & Identification segment, we continue to see a weak but improving market for electronics equipment. Within our consumer goods and industrial markets, our focus on new products, channel expansion and service is making a difference. For Markem-Imaje, this result in a 5% organic growth, excluding the impact of currency. A strong results in North America and modest growth in China offset a weak Europe. We expect improved results in the back half of the year driven by new product launches, normal seasonality and the benefits of our first half restructuring activities. 
Overall, the strength of our businesses enabled Dover to deliver segment margin of 16.7% in the quarter, inclusive of $11 million of restructuring and deal cost. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill of 0.99. 
I was pleased with our free cash flow generation in the second quarter as it improved 30% over the prior year period. Our teams continue to focus on working capital management and lean activity. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we remain highly disciplined on valuation. The opportunities in front of us are all strategic add-ons, highly synergistic and offer strong integration opportunities. 
In summary, I believe our second half will be stronger than the first, as revenue in our handset businesses will be up significantly. I also expect solid contribution from our businesses serving the oil production, downstream energy, fast-moving consumer goods and U.S. industrial markets. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,213698234,326745,"Dover Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion comprised of 3% organic growth and acquisition growth of 7%, offset in part by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings p",1557,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion comprised of 3% organic growth and acquisition growth of 7%, offset in part by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings per share was $1.15. This result was below our expectations, primarily due to a $0.07 impact from a weaker Europe and unfavorable foreign exchange. After adjusting for $0.12 of tax benefits in the second quarter of 2011, EPS improved 1% over the prior year. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 16.7%, a decline of 140 basis points. This result reflects solid performance in Energy, offset by lower volume in Printing & Identification, volume declines in costs associated with new design wins at Sound Solutions and mix within Engineered Systems. We also absorbed nearly $11 million of restructuring in deal costs in the quarter. Absent these costs, segment margin would have been 17.2%. 
Bookings increased 9% over last year to $2.1 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in Energy and Communication Technologies, a solid growth in Engineered -- and a solid growth in Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings decreased 7%, where stable order rates in our consumer goods markets were offset by tough comps in our electronics markets. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.99. Backlog grew 12% to $1.7 billion. 
In the second quarter, we generated $178 million of free cash flow or 8% of revenue, an increase of $45 million over the prior year. We expect free cash flow for the year to be around 10% of revenue. 
Now turning to Slide 4, which shows our revenue growth. Organic growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 14% in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies both grew by 4%, driven by refrigeration and food equipment, commercial aerospace and handset markets. Printing & Identification was down 10%. For the quarter, acquisition growth at Communication Technologies was 22%. Energy and Engineered Systems both posted acquisition growth of 6%, led by our recently completed deals, PCS and Maag, respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5 on our sequential results. Revenue increased 5% from the first quarter, with all 4 segments showing sequential growth. Engineered Systems increased 8%, primarily driven by refrigeration, food equipment and acquisitions. Printing & Identification increased 5% with all markets, except the solid portion of electronics, showing sequential improvement. Communication Technologies and Energy both increased 1%. In Energy, production in downstream markets performed well sequentially. 
Bookings decreased 2% sequentially from the first quarter. Growth of 7% at Communication Technologies was led by the handset market. Sequential bookings growth of 3% at Printing & Identification was broad based. Engineered Systems, bookings declined 3% sequentially, largely impacted by the timing of refrigeration orders and continued weakness in the refuse vehicle portion of our industrial markets. Energy bookings declined 9%, primarily driven by moderating North American rig count, Canadian spring thaw and large international orders in the first quarter. 
Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $362 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year. These results reflect strong MEMS, commercial aerospace and life sciences activities, partially offset by weak telecom markets. Sound Solutions volume accounted for 22 points of the revenue growth. Earnings of $50 million were down 8%, and segment margin was 13.9%, a decrease of 500 basis points. Adjusting for Sound Solutions, margin would have been 20.8% in the quarter. We continue to expect segment margin to improve in the second half on the anticipated benefits of higher volume. Bookings were $383 million, an increase of 24%. This growth was largely driven by our handset market. Book-to-bill finished at 1.06. 
Now turning to Slide 7. Energy revenue increased 19% to $539 million, while earnings increased 21% to $134 million. Energy produced another strong quarter as the average North American rig count was up 6% from last year, and oil prices remain constructed for continued production. Although rig count remained flat sequentially, we continue to benefit from several factors, including approximately 70% of active rigs dedicated to oil as well as a solid downstream market. As was the case last quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth across all end markets led by production. Operating margin was 24.9%, a 60-basis-point improvement from last year. Bookings were $530 million, a 12% increase over the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 8. Engineered Systems sales were $886 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Earnings improved 4% to $134 million. Fluid Solutions grew 19% to $212 million, benefiting from recent acquisitions, while refrigeration and industrial grew 4% to $675 million. In our fluids platform, organic revenue was down 4% due primarily to a weaker Europe. Operating margin was 15.1%, a decrease of 50 basis points from the prior year. This performance included roughly 100 basis points of incremental acquisition amortization costs. Bookings were $870 million, an increase of 9% resulting in the book-to-bill of 0.98. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 16% to $204 million, while refrigeration and industrial was up 7% to $666 million. Book-to-bill for Fluid Solutions was 0.96, and refrigeration and industrials was 0.99. Bookings at Fluid Solutions included 21% acquisition growth, while refrigeration and industrial was principally led by our businesses serving the food equipment and U.S. industrial markets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Print & Identification revenue was $370 million, a decrease of 14% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 39% to $42 million. The revenue decline reflects the expected continued weakness in our electronic markets as compared to a very strong prior year, a weak Europe, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange. The solar and semi-exposure of our electronics market, now about 16% of revenue, was down approximately $47 million year-over-year. That aside, our consumer goods and industrial markets continued to perform well. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, organic growth in consumer goods and industrial end markets was 5%. 
Operating margin declined 450 basis points to 11.3%, reflecting significantly lower volume in electronics, $5 million of restructuring costs and continued strategic investments. The restructuring actions taken in the quarter are to better align our global footprint with higher growth geographic markets. Also, our investments in sales and service are yielding benefits in the form of year-over-year growth in North America and Asia. Bookings were $358 million, a decrease of 7% from last year. In the consumer goods and industrial markets, bookings increased 3%. Book-to-bill ended at 0.97. 
Now on Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense and corporate expense were generally in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 27.5%. This rate was slightly higher than our prior forecast and largely impacted by mix of geographic earnings. 
Now turning to Slide 11 in our 2012 revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue growth of 8% to 10%. Organic growth is estimated to be 3% to 5% and completed acquisitions adding around 5%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be 17% to 18% for the year, about 5 percentage points lower than our last guidance. This forecast is comprised of 7% to 8% organic growth and 10% from acquisitions. The main drivers of this revision are primarily OEM share shifts and the timing of orders at Sound Solutions. 
Energy growth is expected to be in the range of 15% to 16%. Organic growth is largely unchanged at 10% to 11%. Acquisition growth will be around 5%. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow 9% to 10%. Organic growth is down roughly 1.5 points to 3% to 4% from our prior guidance on a weaker Europe and a slowing China market. Acquisition is at 6%. 
Lastly, in Printing & Identification, a weak Europe including unfavorable foreign exchange and a more conservative outlook on electronics is driving our organic revenue forecast down 6 points. We now expect revenue to decline 7% to 8.5% as compared to the prior year. 
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect revenue to be in the range of 8% to 10%. Corporate expense, interest expense and CapEx remain substantially unchanged. We now expect our 2012 tax rate to be around 27%. Based on the above, we expect full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.70 to $4.85. This guidance reflects a $0.125 reduction from our prior forecast at the midpoint. This change primarily reflects a $0.15 reduction related to Europe, China and unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Now let's turn to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of discrete tax benefits. Volume mix and price will contribute roughly $0.28 to $0.37 for the full year, while net productivity will add $0.22 to $0.32. Investment and compensation is now $0.08 to $0.14, reduced by $0.11 from our last forecast. 
We expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.03 to $0.05 for the year, down from our prior forecast. This revision largely reflects the timing of orders and OEM share shifts at Sound Solutions. Interest expense, share count and our tax rate should yield a $0.01 benefit, down slightly from our prior forecast, largely driven by a slightly higher tax rate. The net result is EPS growth of 12% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the midpoint. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

As I mentioned up front, I am convinced that our second half will be stronger than our first half.

I expect Dover's second half revenue to be up about 7% sequentially and anticipate solid leverage on the increased volume. As always, our teams are focused on programs and initiatives to reduce costs and increase productivity. 
As I look beyond 2012, I remain confident in our positions in our 5 key growth spaces. I am convinced our play in the energy, fluids, refrigeration and food equipment, product identification and communication components offer growth opportunities built on technology leadership, geographic expansion and commitment to our customers. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their hard work and dedication. Their focus on serving customers and achieving results will continue to drive Dover's success.

Brad can probably correct me here on my answer. But I think sequentially, as we look at Sound Solutions coming out of the second order, the revenue expectations in the third quarter are up about 20% to 25% and another sequential improvement in revenue in the fourth quarter of additional 20% to 25%. And Scott, I think, by the time we get to the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we're going to start to see the operating margins of this business set the base for what we'll expect in 2013, which I think will be very reflective of the business performance on this business that we expected when we made the acquisition.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before I get to our second quarter results, I'd like to share a few observations on the changes we saw in the macroenvironment during the quarter. 
We entered the second quarter knowing we were dealing with some modest challenges in Europe and a slowing economy in China. The decline in Europe was greater than our expectations. These weaker conditions were felt most notably within our Fluids platform and our Printing & Identification segment. With respect to China, we experienced some of the effects of a slowing export market in a few of our businesses. Our U.S. markets held up quite well, namely, refrigeration and food equipment, industrial, energy, commercial aerospace and life sciences. 
Now let me provide some comments on our second quarter results. We posted revenue of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an increase of 8%. Our second quarter EPS of $1.15 was a slight improvement over the prior year adjusted EPS. In our Energy segment, we continued to see growth across our end markets with production and downstream being the strongest. As a result, we posted strong organic revenue growth in the quarter. As I've shared with you before, while rig count has flattened, market dynamics provide a solid environment for our products and services. These dynamics include the ongoing shift from gas to oil, oil prices supporting continued CapEx for production and a strengthening downstream market. We expect Energy results to remain solid for the balance of the year. 
At our Communication Technologies segment, we saw the continuation of a strong smartphone market, as well as solid commercial aerospace and life science markets. Telecom markets remained weak. The highlight was 25% organic growth in our MEMS sales to the handset market in the second quarter, and we expect even stronger MEMS performance in the second half. Although results at Sound Solutions continued to be significantly impacted by further OEM share shifts, I was especially encouraged by increasing order rates on new design wins in the quarter and expect shipments at Sound Solutions to accelerate through the second half. 
Within our Engineered Systems segment, refrigeration and food equipment markets were solid as were most of our U.S. industrial end markets. Regarding our Fluids platform, the strong start for Maag Pump was offset by a weaker Europe and China. The result for the segment was lower-than-anticipated revenue in Fluids, largely offset by 8% revenue growth in refrigeration and food equipment. Going forward, we believe second half results in refrigeration will remain solid on the strength of an active remodeling market, our leading technology and our customers' continued focus on energy efficiency. Our U.S. industrial markets, which account for 65% of segment revenue, should be rather stable. 
Within our Printing & Identification segment, we continued to see a weak but improving market for electronics equipment. Within our consumer goods and industrial markets, our focus on new products, channel expansion and service is making a difference. For Markem-Imaje, this result in a 5% organic growth, excluding the impact of currency, as strong results in North America and modest growth in China offset a weak Europe. We expect improved results in the back half of the year driven by new product launches, normal seasonality and the benefits of our first half restructuring activities. 
Overall, the strength of our businesses enabled Dover to deliver segment margin of 16.7% in the quarter, inclusive of $11 million of restructuring and deal cost. We ended the quarter with a book-to-bill of 0.99. 
I was pleased with our free cash flow generation in the second quarter as it improved 30% over the prior year period. Our teams continue to focus on working capital management and lean activity. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we remain highly disciplined on valuation. The opportunities in front of us are all strategic add-ons, highly synergistic and offer strong integration opportunities. 
In summary, I believe our second half will be stronger than the first, as revenue in our handset businesses will be up significantly. I also expect solid contribution from our businesses serving the oil production, downstream energy, fast-moving consumer goods and U.S. industrial markets. 
With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,213698234,326838,"Dover Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion comprised of 3% organic growth and acquisition growth of 7%, offset in part by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings p",1556,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion comprised of 3% organic growth and acquisition growth of 7%, offset in part by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Earnings per share was $1.15. This result was below our expectations, primarily due to a $0.07 impact from a weaker Europe and unfavorable foreign exchange. After adjusting for $0.12 of tax benefits in the second quarter of 2011, EPS improved 1% over the prior year. 
Segment margin for the quarter was 16.7%, a decline of 140 basis points. This result reflects solid performance in Energy, offset by lower volume in Printing & Identification, volume declines in costs associated with new design wins at Sound Solutions and mix within Engineered Systems. We also absorbed nearly $11 million of restructuring in deal costs in the quarter. Absent these costs, segment margin would have been 17.2%. 
Bookings increased 9% over last year, to $2.1 billion, reflecting double-digit growth in Energy and Communication Technologies, a solid growth in Engineered -- and a solid growth in Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings decreased 7%, where stable order rates in our consumer goods markets were offset by tough comps in our electronics markets. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.99. Backlog grew 12%, to $1.7 billion. 
In the second quarter, we generated $178 million of free cash flow, or 8% of revenue, an increase of $45 million over the prior year. We expect free cash flow for the year to be around 10% of revenue. 
Now turning to Slide 4, which shows our revenue growth. Organic growth remained strong at Energy, achieving 14% in the quarter. Engineered Systems and Communication Technologies both grew by 4%, driven by refrigeration and food equipment, commercial aerospace and handset markets. Printing & Identification was down 10%. For the quarter, acquisition growth at Communication Technologies was 22%. Energy and Engineered Systems both posted acquisition growth of 6%, led by our recently completed deals, PCS and Maag, respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 5% from the first quarter, with all 4 segments showing sequential growth. Engineered Systems increased 8%, primarily driven by refrigeration, food equipment and acquisitions. Printing & Identification increased 5%, with all markets, except the solar portion of electronics, showing sequential improvement. Communication Technologies and Energy both increased 1%. In Energy, production in downstream markets performed well sequentially. 
Bookings decreased 2% sequentially from the first quarter. Growth of 7% at Communication Technologies was led by the handset market. Sequential bookings growth of 3% at Printing & Identification was broad based. Engineered Systems, bookings declined 3% sequentially, largely impacted by the timing of refrigeration orders and continued weakness in the refuse vehicle portion of our industrial markets. Energy bookings declined 9%, primarily driven by moderating North American rig count, Canadian spring thaw and large international orders in the first quarter. 
Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $362 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year. These results reflect strong MEMS, commercial aerospace and life sciences activities, partially offset by weak telecom markets. Sound Solutions volume accounted for 22 points of the revenue growth. Earnings of $50 million were down 8%, and segment margin was 13.9%, a decrease of 500 basis points. Adjusting for Sound Solutions, margin would have been 20.8% in the quarter. We continue to expect segment margin to improve in the second half on the anticipated benefits of higher volume. Bookings were $383 million, an increase of 24%. This growth was largely driven by our handset market. Book-to-bill finished at 1.06. 
Now turning to Slide 7. Energy revenue increased 19%, to $539 million, while earnings increased 21%, to $134 million. Energy produced another strong quarter as the average North American rig count was up 6% from last year, and oil prices remained constructive for continued production. Although rig count remained flat sequentially, we continue to benefit from several factors, including approximately 70% of active rigs dedicated to oil as well as a solid downstream market. As was the case last quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth across all end markets led by production. Operating margin was 24.9%, a 60-basis-point improvement from last year. Bookings were $530 million, a 12% increase over the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.98. 
Now on Slide 8. Engineered Systems sales were $886 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Earnings improved 4%, to $134 million. Fluid Solutions grew 19%, to $212 million, benefiting from recent acquisitions, while refrigeration and industrial grew 4% to $675 million. In our fluids platform, organic revenue was down 4% due primarily to a weaker Europe. Operating margin was 15.1%, a decrease of 50 basis points from the prior year. This performance included roughly 100 basis points of incremental acquisition amortization costs. Bookings were $870 million, an increase of 9%, resulting in the book-to-bill of 0.98. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 16%, to $204 million, while refrigeration and industrial was up 7%, to $666 million. Book-to-bill for Fluid Solutions was 0.96, and refrigeration and industrials was 0.99. Bookings at Fluid Solutions included 21% acquisition growth, while refrigeration and industrial was principally led by our businesses serving the food equipment and U.S. industrial markets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Print & Identification revenue was $370 million, a decrease of 14% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 39%, to $42 million. The revenue decline reflects the expected continued weakness in our electronic markets as compared to a very strong prior year, a weak Europe, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange. The solar and semi-exposure of our electronics market, now about 16% of revenue, was down approximately $47 million year-over-year. That aside, our consumer goods and industrial markets continued to perform well. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, organic growth in consumer goods and industrial end markets was 5%. 
Operating margin declined 450 basis points to 11.3%, reflecting significantly lower volume in electronics, $5 million of restructuring costs and continued strategic investments. The restructuring actions taken in the quarter are to better align our global footprint with higher-growth geographic markets. Also, our investments in sales and service are yielding benefits in the form of year-over-year growth in North America and Asia. Bookings were $358 million, a decrease of 7% from last year. In the consumer goods and industrial markets, bookings increased 3%. Book-to-bill ended at 0.97. 
Now on Slide 10. First quarter net interest expense and corporate expense were generally in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 27.5%. This rate was slightly higher than our prior forecast and largely impacted by mix of geographic earnings. 
Now turning to Slide 11 in our 2012 revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue growth of 8% to 10%. Organic growth is estimated to be 3% to 5% and completed acquisitions adding around 5%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be 17% to 18% for the year, about 5 percentage points lower than our last guidance. This forecast is comprised of 7% to 8% organic growth and 10% from acquisitions. The main drivers of this revision are primarily OEM share shifts and the timing of orders at Sound Solutions. 
Energy growth is expected to be in the range of 15% to 16%. Organic growth is largely unchanged, at 10% to 11%. Acquisition growth will be around 5%. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow 9% to 10%. Organic growth is down roughly 1.5 points, to 3% to 4%, from our prior guidance on a weaker Europe and a slowing China market. Acquisition is at 6%. 
Lastly, in Printing & Identification, a weak Europe including unfavorable foreign exchange and a more conservative outlook on electronics is driving our organic revenue forecast down 6 points. We now expect revenue to decline 7% to 8.5% as compared to the prior year. 
Moving on to Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect revenue to be in the range of 8% to 10%. Corporate expense, interest expense and CapEx remain substantially unchanged. We now expect our 2012 tax rate to be around 27%. Based on the above, we expect full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.70 to $4.85. This guidance reflects a $0.125 reduction from our prior forecast at the midpoint. This change primarily reflects a $0.15 reduction related to Europe, China and unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Now let's turn to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of discrete tax benefits. Volume mix and price will contribute roughly $0.28 to $0.37 for the full year, while net productivity will add $0.22 to $0.32. Investment and compensation is now $0.08 to $0.14, reduced by $0.11 from our last forecast. 
We expect completed acquisitions to deliver roughly $0.03 to $0.05 for the year, down from our prior forecast. This revision largely reflects the timing of orders and OEM share shifts at Sound Solutions. Interest expense, share count and our tax rate should yield a $0.01 benefit, down slightly from our prior forecast, largely driven by a slightly higher tax rate. The net result is EPS growth of 12% over our adjusted 2011 EPS at the midpoint. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

As I mentioned up front, I am convinced that our second half will be stronger than our first half. Our participation in the handset market, our production and downstream Energy businesses and our businesses serving the fast-moving consumer goods and U.S. industrial markets will lead the way. I expect Dover's second half revenue to be up about 7% sequentially and anticipate solid leverage on the increased volume. As always, our teams are focused on programs and initiatives to reduce costs and increase productivity. 
As I look beyond 2012, I remain confident in our positions in our 5 key growth spaces. I am convinced our play in the energy, fluids, refrigeration and food equipment, product identification and communication components offer growth opportunities built on technology leadership, geographic expansion and commitment to our customers. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their hard work and dedication. Their focus on serving customers and achieving results will continue to drive Dover's success.

And, Scott, I think, by the time we get to the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we're going to start to see the operating margins of this business set the base for what we'll expect in 2013, which I think will be very reflective of the business performance on this business that we expected when we made the acquisition.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before I get to our third quarter results, I'd like to share a few observations on the macroenvironment during the quarter. During our last quarterly call, we discussed the significant decline we had experienced in Europe and moderating activity in China. We also saw North America markets as mostly stable. 90 days later, I would say these trends are generally continuing. Europe has remained at a low level, though the weakness is broader based than last quarter. China has weakened especially with respect to the electronics markets. The bright spot this quarter again was a U.S. industrial activity. In summary, these conditions result in moderately slower global growth rates as we enter the fourth quarter. 
Now some comments on our third quarter results. We posted revenue $2.2 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3%. Our third quarter EPS of $1.32 was an 11% improvement over the prior year, largely driven by strong leverage on volume. In our Energy segment, expanding production activity and strong downstream investments in distribution and retail feelings are among the trends that drove excellent business results in the quarter. Our drilling results were impacted by the lower year-over-year North American rig count, though rig count did increase sequentially. Overall, Energy's performance was characterized by continuing growth and strong margins. We expect these trends to continue in the fourth quarter. 
In our Communication Technologies segment, several handset OEMs launched new products toward the end of the quarter, which drove solid sequential results. Our MEMS activity was very strong, reflecting the breadth of our OEM coverage and the benefits of multiple design wins. 
The challenges at Sound Solutions led to lower revenue than expected. This, along with normal seasonality in the handset market, will continue to impact results through year end. While I was disappointed with our performance at Sound Solutions, we continued to work through significant business transitions and are making substantial progress. I firmly believe we will make further progress in this important business in the coming months. 
Within our Engineered Systems segments, refrigeration and food equipment markets remain quite solid and our business performance was strong. Regarding our fluids platform, markets remain much the same as last quarter, highlighted by the excellent results of recent acquisitions. We expect the segment's fourth quarter results reflect the normal seasonality of our refrigeration markets and slightly moderating macro growth friends. 
Within our Printing & Identification segment, strong organic growth in our fast-moving consumer goods market, along with the benefits of our second quarter restructuring, helped drive solid margin performance. The China electronics equipment market weakened through the quarter and was below our prior expectations. We believe this trend will continue and now project this segment's performance to be lower in the fourth quarter. 
Overall, the strong market positions of our businesses and productivity initiatives enabled us to deliver third quarter segment margin of 18%. During the quarter, our acquisition pipeline developed nicely, and we have several deals that have matured and are actionable. I remain bullish on our 5 growth spaces and enthusiastic with the strategic add-ons in our pipeline. 
In summary, the majority of our businesses performed very well. I am quite pleased with our third quarter results and the responsiveness of our business. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, the softening global economy especially impacting electronics and lower volumes at Sound Solutions resulted in an outlook that is less than we expected at the beginning of the third quarter. We remain focused on our growth initiatives and investments, select restructuring activities and the pursuit of strategic opportunities, all of which will help deliver further earnings gains in 2013. With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year. This was comprised of 1% organic growth, 4% from acquisitions and an unfavorable impact of 2% from foreign exchange. EPS was $1.32, which included a small benefit from discrete tax matters settled during the quarter. After adjusting for minor tax benefits realized in the third quarter of both periods, EPS improved 10% over the prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 18%, an increase of 100 basis points. This result reflects solid performance in all segments in the absence of onetime acquisition related costs incurred in the third quarter of last year. 
Bookings increased 1% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. These results represent solid 6% growth in energy and modest increases in both Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings decreased 10%, as further weakness in electronics markets impacted the segment. Overall book to bill finished at 0.94, in line with normal seasonality. Backlog grew 6% to $1.5 billion. 
In the third quarter, we generated $230 million of free cash flow or 10% of revenue. We expect free cash flow for the year to be roughly 10% of revenue. 
Now turning to Slide 4 and our revenue growth. Organic growth remains solid at Engineered Systems and Energy, achieving 4% and 3% respectively in the quarter, reflecting strong performance in the food, equipment, production and downstream markets. Communication Technologies organic revenue declined 1%, while Printing & Identification decreased 6%. For the quarter, acquisition growth was strong in Energy and Engineered Systems as they both posted 8% and 7% growth respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 2% from the second quarter with 3 of our 4 segments showing sequential growth. Communication Technologies increased 10%, primarily driven by handset market. Energy increased 4%, led by the production in downstream markets. Engineered Systems showed modest sequential growth of 1%. Printing & Identification declined 3%. 
Bookings decreased 3% sequentially from the second quarter, in line with historical trends. Growth of 8% at Communication Technologies was led by the handset and aerospace markets. Engineered Systems bookings declined 8% sequentially, largely reflecting the normal seasonality of our refrigeration markets. The sequential bookings decline of 4% in Printing & Identification was primarily driven by continued weakness in the electronics markets. Energy bookings declined 1%. 
Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $396 million, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. These results reflect modest growth revenue declines in all end markets with the exception of aerospace/industrial. Within the handset market, very strong MEMS activity was offset by lower volume at Sound Solutions. Earnings increased 19% to $64 million and segment margin improved 290 basis points to 16.1%. This performance reflects strong leverage on MEMS volume, weaker results at Sound Solutions and the absence of onetime costs associated with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of last year. We expect segment revenue and margin to moderate sequentially in the fourth quarter on anticipated lower volumes primarily due to seasonality and mix. 
Bookings of $412 million -- bookings were $412 million, essentially flat with last year. Book to bill finished at 1.04. 
Turning to Slide 7. Energy revenue increased 10% to $562 million, while earnings increased 11% to $139 million. Energy produced another solid quarter as oil prices remain supportive of continued production activity and downstream markets remained strong. Rig count declined year-over-year, impacting our drilling business. Our focus on international growth, coupled with the diversity of our end markets, allowed us to post another quarter of strong revenue growth in both production and downstream. Operating margin was 24.7%, a 20 basis points improvement. Bookings were $527 million, 6% increase over the prior year. Book to bill was 0.94. 
Now on Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $892 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Earnings improved 15% to $144 million. Fluid Solutions revenue grew 26% to $218 million, benefiting from recent acquisitions. Fluid Solutions organic revenue was flat, with solid results in North America and Asia offset by a weak Europe. Refrigeration and Industrial grew 5% organically to $674 million. Revenue gains were broad-based with Hill PHOENIX posting a quarterly record for revenue. Operating margin was 16.2%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily driven by solid operating performance and our focus on cost improvements. 
Bookings were $798 million, an increase of 3%, resulting in the book to bill of 0.89. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 13% to $98 million -- $198 million. Refrigeration and Industrial was essentially flat with last year at $600 million. Book to bill for Fluid Solutions was 0.91, while Refrigeration and Industrials was 0.89. The segment book to bill principally reflects the normal seasonality of the refrigeration market and softer European and Asian markets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $358 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 14% to $51 million. Gains in our consumer group markets helped to partially mitigate the continued softness in our electronics markets as well as unfavorable foreign exchange. Our electronic markets were down over 30 million year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, organic growth in the fast-moving consumer goods end market was 6%. 
Operating margin declined 40 basis points to 14.4%. The benefits of prior restructuring and continued cost improvements largely offset significantly lower volume in Electronics. Looking forward, we do not see near-term recovery in the electronics markets. 
Bookings were $343 million, a decrease of 10% from last year. In the consumer goods and industrial markets, bookings increased 1% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Book to bill ended at 0.96. 
Moving to Slide 10. Third quarter net interest expense was generally in line with expectations. Corporate expense decreased by $2 million year-over-year.  Our third quarter tax rate was 27.9%. This rate was slightly higher than our prior forecast and largely impacted by mix and geographic earnings. This rate also included a $0.02 benefit from the resolution of discrete tax matters.  Our CapEx for the quarter was $69 million, and we repurchased 4.3 million shares since our last call. 
Now turning to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue growth of around 7%. Organic growth is estimated to be about 3% including a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. Completed acquisitions will add around 4%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be around 11% for the year, around 7 percentage points lower than our previous guidance. The main drivers of this change are OEM launch delays and lower volumes at Sound Solutions. Energy growth is expected to be approximately 16%, largely unchanged from our prior forecast. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow around 9%, again in line with our prior expectations. Lastly, within Printing & Identification, weakening electronics market is driving our revenue forecast down 1 percentage point. We now expect revenue to decline around 9% for the year, inclusive of the 3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Now on Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect revenue growth to be around 7%. Corporate expense decreased slightly, while interest expense and CapEx remained substantially unchanged. We now expect our 2012 tax rate to be 27.9%, reflecting changes in the mix of geographic earnings. Based on the above, we expect our full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.55 to $4.65. 
Now let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of discrete tax benefits. Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.24 to $0.30 for the full year, down about $0.06 from our last forecast. Net productivity will add $0.20 to $0.24. Investment and compensation is now about $0.05, a $0.06 adjustment from our last forecast. We expect completed acquisitions to be about $0.14 dilutive for the year, down from our prior forecast. This revision largely reflects the impact of Sound Solutions. On a net basis, the impact of corporate expense, interest expense, share count and our tax rate is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. The net result is full year EPS of $4.55 to $4.65. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob for some final comments."

As I mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance. We delivered strong earnings growth in a tough environment. This is a testament to the strength of our businesses and the responsiveness of our leadership teams across the company. As Brad just mentioned, our fourth quarter outlook has been reduced. 
I expect a few of our highlights for the quarter to be: further progress at Sound Solutions, continuing strong gains in our MEMS business, continued strength in Energy and the continuation of our focus on cost reduction versus select restructuring activities. My reduced guidance does not change my conviction on the long-term growth opportunities before us. 
Looking ahead to 2013, I remain confident in the positions we hold in our 5 key growth spaces. Our focus in energy, fluids, refrigeration and food equipment, product identification and communication components offer us substantial growth opportunities. I look forward to sharing specific details regarding 2013 at our Investor Day conference in New York on December 10. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their hard work and dedication. Their focus on serving customers and achieving results will continue to drive Dover's success. With that, Paul, let's take some questions."

We knew who we we",477,"Okay. Wow, it's about 4 questions, Shannon. So let me back up to about 15 months ago and just highlight what I would label as the 3 primary objectives we had as we entered the third quarter right after the acquisition of Sound Solutions. We knew who we were dealing with, the significant change in the marketplace with Nokia and a couple of other OEMs. But objective #1 was aggressively pursue design wins with new OEMs. I would say objective #2 goes to the heart of your question, which was a significant manufacturing transition in the Beijing operation with the focus on the high flex automation. And the third objective would be the work the new designs quickly to drive yield improvements and volume ramp. Shannon, the execution on all 3 of these objectives has been slower than I expected, slower than we expected, and it has been disappointing. Your question about the capability we have, both in Indiana as well as the Knowles team, is true. In fact, as we exited the second quarter, early part of the third quarter, we did start to make some management transitions in Beijing. In fact, the General Manager of Beijing now, the Operations Manager, I think the Quality Manager and probably about 5 other key leadership positions have been changed since the end of the second quarter, with Knowles China personnel taking over responsibility for these positions. So now let's comment on the third quarter. I think we've learned a lot in the first 6 months of this year. I think those learnings, along with the management transitions that we started to make at the end of the second quarter and into the early part of the third quarter, we have seen some progress. On the high flex lines, we like what we have and we feel we made the right decision. We've have had lots of learning between line 1 and where we are today. But I would also that this high flex automation objective is no longer a challenge. Our yields continue to improve. We had significant improvements during the third quarter, more in the latter part of the third quarter than we did in the early part. And we will continue to make more progress in the fourth quarter. The volume has been lower than expected, but I also expect it to continue to increase. Shannon, I'd share one further comment and it has less to do with performance and more to do with sort of the outlook for the business. As focused as we have been in the last 6 months on bringing up the high flex automation and improving our yields, we are already working on several new designs for 2013 OEM product launches. And actually, a couple of the key designs are actually scheduled for first quarter qualification tests, and we're on schedule."

You would normally expect us to narrow that to $0.05. Let me give you some color. I would tell you that as we sit here today, we clearly are focused on achieving and hitting the top end of the range with respect to EPS. That is our target and that is our goal. As we came through the third quarter, September bookings were the lightest month of the quarter. And I don't think it was an aberration. September bookings with the lightest month of the quarter and that statement is true for 3 of our 4 segments, the one exception being Communication Technologies. That gives us a little bit of a pause and sort of call it increase the uncertainty level as we come into the fourth quarter. I got a very short data point for you. And that's after the first 2 weeks of this quarter, after the first 2 weeks of October, the order rates and activity would have us comfortable with the minimum of the mid-range of our revenue guidance. So why do we have this sort of someone could say conservative safety net at the bottom end of the range? Part of that is the uncertainty we have around the month of December with respect to our handset business. A couple of other points I would share with you is we exited the third quarter if not with a record backlog, pretty darn close to it at Hill PHOENIX. And the interesting characteristic on that backlog is a much higher percentage of their third quarter ending backlog is actually scheduled for first quarter delivery, enough so that it actually appears odd. And we have a little bit of a concern that there could be some further push outs from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. Nothing has been signaled in the last 2 weeks. We have a little bit of an elevated concern. And the third one, I would just say some uneasiness and uncertainty around the macroenvironment in the fourth quarter. don't lose track of my first 2 comments. From an earnings perspective, we are clearly targeted and focused on delivering the top end of the range."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before I get to our third quarter results, I'd like to share a few observations on the macroenvironment during the quarter. During our last quarterly call, we discussed the significant decline we had experienced in Europe and moderating activity in China. We also saw North American markets as mostly stable. 90 days later, I would say these trends are generally continuing. Europe has remained at a low level, though the weakness is broader based than last quarter. China has weakened especially with respect to the electronics markets. The bright spot this quarter again was U.S. industrial activity. In summary, these conditions result in moderately slower global growth rates as we enter the fourth quarter. 
Now, some comments on our third quarter results. We posted revenue $2.2 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3%. Our third quarter EPS of $1.32 was an 11% improvement over the prior year, largely driven by strong leverage on volume. In our Energy segment, expanding production activity and strong downstream investments in distribution and retail fueling are among the trends that drove excellent business results in the quarter. Our drilling results were impacted by the lower year-over-year North American rig count, though rig count did increase sequentially. Overall, Energy's performance was characterized by continuing growth and strong margins. We expect these trends to continue in the fourth quarter. 
At our Communication Technologies segment, several handset OEMs launched new products towards the end of the quarter, which drove solid sequential results. Our MEMS activity was very strong, reflecting the breadth of our OEM coverage and the benefits of multiple design wins. 
The challenges at Sound Solutions led to lower revenue than expected. This, along with normal seasonality in the handset market, will continue to impact results through year end. While I was disappointed with our performance at Sound Solutions, we continued to work through significant business transitions and are making substantial progress. I firmly believe we will make further progress in this important business in the coming months. 
Within our Engineered Systems segment, refrigeration and food equipment markets remain quite solid and our business performance was strong. Regarding our fluids platform, markets remain much the same as last quarter, highlighted by the excellent results of recent acquisitions. We expect the segment's fourth quarter results to reflect the normal seasonality of our refrigeration markets and slightly moderating macro growth friends. 
Within our Printing & Identification segment, strong organic growth in our fast-moving consumer goods market, along with the benefits of our second quarter restructuring, helped drive solid margin performance. The China electronics equipment market weakened through the quarter and was below our prior expectations. We believe this trend will continue and now project this segment's performance to be lower in the fourth quarter. 
Overall, the strong market positions of our businesses and productivity initiatives enabled us to deliver third quarter segment margin of 18%. During the quarter, our acquisition pipeline developed nicely, and we have several deals that have matured and are actionable. I remain bullish on our 5 growth spaces and I'm enthusiastic with the strategic add-ons in our pipeline. 
In summary, the majority of our businesses performed very well. I am quite pleased with our third quarter results and the responsiveness of our businesses. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, the softening global economy, especially impacting electronics and lower volumes at Sound Solutions resulted an outlook that is less than we expected at the beginning of the third quarter. We remain focused on our growth initiatives and investments, select restructuring activities and the pursuit of strategic acquisition opportunities, all of which will help deliver further earnings gains in 2013. With that, let me turn it over to Brad."

Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year. This was comprised of 1% organic growth, 4% from acquisitions and an unfavorable impact of 2% from foreign exchange. EPS was $1.32, which included a small benefit from discrete tax matters settled during the quarter. After adjusting for minor tax benefits realized in the third quarter of both periods, EPS improved 10% over the prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 18%, an increase of 100 basis points. This result reflects solid performance in all segments and the absence of onetime acquisition related costs incurred in the third quarter of last year. 
Bookings increased 1% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. These results represent solid 6% growth in energy and modest increases in both Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings decreased 10% as further weakness in electronics markets impacted the segment. Overall, book to bill finished at 0.94, in line with normal seasonality. Backlog grew 6% to $1.5 billion. 
In the third quarter, we generated $230 million of free cash flow or 10% of revenue. We expect free cash flow for the year to be roughly 10% of revenue. 
Now turning to Slide 4 in our revenue growth. Organic growth remains solid at Engineered Systems and Energy, achieving 4% and 3% respectively in the quarter, reflecting strong performance in the food, equipment, production and downstream markets. Communication Technologies organic revenue declined 1%, while Printing & Identification decreased 6%. For the quarter, acquisition growth was strong in Energy and Engineered Systems as they both posted 8% and 7% growth respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5 in our sequential results. Revenue increased 2% from the second quarter with 3 of our 4 segments showing sequential growth. Communication Technologies increased 10%, primarily driven by handset market. Energy increased 4%, led by the production in downstream markets. Engineered Systems showed modest sequential growth of 1%. Printing & Identification declined 3%. 
Bookings decreased 3% sequentially from the second quarter, in line with historical trends. Growth of 8% at Communication Technologies was led by the handset and aerospace markets. Engineered Systems bookings declined 8% sequentially, largely reflecting the normal seasonality of our refrigeration markets. The sequential bookings decline of 4% in Printing & Identification was primarily driven by continued weakness in the electronics markets. Energy bookings declined 1%. 
Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $396 million, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. These results reflect modest revenue declines in all end markets with the exception of aerospace/industrial. Within the handset market, very strong MEMS activity was offset by lower volume at Sound Solutions. Earnings increased 19% to $64 million and segment margin improved 290 basis points to 16.1%. This performance reflects strong leverage on MEMS volume, weaker results at Sound Solutions and the absence of onetime costs associated with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of last year. We expect segment revenue and margin to moderate sequentially in the fourth quarter on anticipated lower volumes primarily due to seasonality and mix. 
Bookings were $412 million, essentially flat with last year. Book to bill finished at 1.04. 
Turning to Slide 7. Energy revenue increased 10% to $562 million, while earnings increased 11% to $139 million. Energy produced another solid quarter as oil prices remain supportive of continued production activity and downstream markets remained strong. Rig count declined year-over-year, impacting our drilling business. Our focus on international growth, coupled with the diversity of our end markets, allowed us to post another quarter of strong revenue growth in both production and downstream. Operating margin was 24.7%, a 20 basis points improvement. Bookings were $527 million, a 6% increase over the prior year. Book to bill was 0.94. 
Now on Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $892 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Earnings improved 15% to $144 million. Fluid Solutions revenue grew 26% to $218 million, benefiting from recent acquisitions. Fluid Solutions organic revenue was flat, with solid results in North America and Asia, offset by a weak Europe. 
Refrigeration and Industrial grew 5% organically to $674 million. Revenue gains were broad-based with Hill PHOENIX posting a quarterly record for revenue. Operating margin was 16.2%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily driven by solid operating performance and our focus on cost improvements. 
Bookings were $798 million, an increase of 3%, resulting in a book to bill of 0.89. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 13% to $198 million. Refrigeration and Industrial was essentially flat with last year at $600 million. Book to bill for Fluid Solutions was 0.91, while Refrigeration and Industrials was 0.89. The segment book to bill principally reflects the normal seasonality of the refrigeration market and softer European and Asian markets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $358 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 14% to $51 million. Gains in our consumer goods markets helped to partially mitigate the continued softness in our electronics markets as well as unfavorable foreign exchange. Our electronic markets were down over 30 million year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, organic growth in the fast-moving consumer goods end market was 6%. 
Operating margin declined 40 basis points to 14.4%. The benefits of prior restructuring and continued cost improvements largely offset significantly lower volume in Electronics. Looking forward, we do not see a near-term recovery in the electronics markets. 
Bookings were $343 million, a decrease of 10% from last year. In the consumer goods and industrial markets, bookings increased 1%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Book to bill ended at 0.96. 
Moving to Slide 10. Third quarter net interest expense was generally in line with expectations. Corporate expense decreased by $2 million year-over-year.  Our third quarter tax rate was 27.9%. This rate was slightly higher than our prior forecast and largely impacted by mix and geographic earnings. This rate also included a $0.02 benefit from the resolution of discrete tax matters.  Our CapEx spend for the quarter was $69 million, and we repurchased 4.3 million shares since our last call. 
Now turning to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue growth of around 7%. Organic growth is estimated to be about 3%, including a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. Completed acquisitions will add around 4%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be around 11% for the year, about 7 percentage points lower than our last guidance. The main drivers of this change are OEM launch delays and lower volumes at Sound Solutions. Energy growth is expected to be approximately 16%, largely unchanged from our prior forecast. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow around 9%, again in line with our prior expectations. Lastly, within Printing & Identification, a weakening electronics market is driving our revenue forecast down 1 percentage point. We now expect revenue to decline around 9% for the year, inclusive of a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Now on Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect revenue growth to be around 7%. Corporate expense decreased slightly while interest expense and CapEx remained substantially unchanged. We now expect our 2012 tax rate to be 27.9%, reflecting changes in the mix of geographic earnings. Based on the above, we expect our full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.55 to $4.65. 
Now let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of discrete tax benefits. Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.24 to $0.30 for the full year, down about $0.06 from our last forecast. Net productivity will add $0.20 to $0.24. Investment and compensation is now about $0.05, a $0.06 adjustment from our last forecast. We expect completed acquisitions to be about $0.14 dilutive for the year, down from our prior forecast. This revision largely reflects the impact of Sound Solutions. On a net basis, the impact of corporate expense, interest expense, share count and our tax rate is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. The net result is full year EPS of $4.55 to $4.65. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

As I mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance. We delivered strong earnings growth in a tough environment. This is a testament to the strength of our businesses and the responsiveness of our leadership teams across the company. As Brad just mentioned, our fourth quarter outlook has been reduced. 
I expect a few of our highlights for the quarter to be: further progress at Sound Solutions, continuing strong gains in our MEMS business, continued strength in Energy and the continuation of our focus on cost reduction versus via select restructuring activities. My reduced guidance does not change my conviction on the long-term growth opportunities before us. 
Looking ahead to 2013, I remain confident in the positions we hold in our 5 key growth spaces. Our focus in energy, fluids, refrigeration and food equipment, product identification and communication components offer us substantial growth opportunities. I look forward to sharing specific details regarding 2013 at our Investor Day conference in New York on December 10. 
In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their hard work and dedication. Their focus on serving customers and achieving results will continue to drive Dover's success. With that, Paul, let's take some questions."

So let me back up to about 15 months ago and just highlight what I would label as the 3 primary objectives we had as we entered the third quarter right after the acquisition of Sound Solutions. We knew we were dealing with the significant change in the marketplace with Nokia and a couple of other OEMs but objective #1 was aggressively pursue design wins with new OEMs. I would say objective #2 goes to the heart of your question, which was a significant manufacturing transition in the Beijing operation with the focus on the high flex automation. And the third objective would be to work the new designs quickly to drive yield improvements and volume ramp. Shannon, the execution on all 3 of these objectives has been slower than I expected, slower than we expected, and it has been disappointing. Your question about the capability we have, both in Vienna as well as the Knowles team, is true. In fact, as we exited the second quarter, early part of the third quarter, we did start to make some management transitions in Beijing. In fact, the General Manager of Beijing now, the Operations Manager, I think the Quality Manager and probably about 5 other key leadership positions have been changed since the end of the second quarter, with Knowles China personnel taking over responsibility for these positions. So now, let's comment on the third quarter. I think we've learned a lot in the first 6 months of this year. I think those learnings, along with the management transitions that we started to make at the end of the second quarter and into the early part of the third quarter, we have seen some progress. On the high flex lines, we like what we have and we feel we made the right decision. We've had lots of learning between line 1 and where we are today but I would also label that this high flex automation objective as no longer a challenge. Our yields continue to improve. We had significant improvements during the third quarter, more in the latter part of the third quarter than we did in the early part. And we will continue to make more progress in the fourth quarter. The volume has been lower than expected but I also expect it to continue to increase. Shannon, I'd share one further comment and it has less to do about performance and more to do with sort of the outlook for this business. As focused as we have been in the last 6 months on bringing up the high flex automation and improving our yields, we are already working on several new designs for 2013 OEM product launches. And actually, a couple of the key designs are actually scheduled for first quarter qualification tests and we're on schedule."

And we spent a lot of time talking about this, debating this, as you would normally expect us to narrow that to $0.05. Let me give you some color. I will tell you that as we sit here today, we clearly are focused on achieving and hitting the top end of the range with respect to EPS. That is our target and that is our goal. As we came through the third quarter, September bookings were the lightest month of the quarter. And I don't think it was an aberration. September bookings was the lightest month of the quarter and that statement is true for 3 of our 4 segments, the one exception being Communication Technologies. That gives us a little bit of a pause and sort of, I call it, increases the uncertainty level as we come into the fourth quarter. I've got a very short data point for you, and that's after the first 2 weeks of this quarter, after the first 2 weeks of October, the order rates and activity would have us comfortable with the minimum of the mid-range of our revenue guidance. So why do we have this sort of, someone could say, conservative safety net at the bottom end of the range? Part of that is the uncertainty we have around the month of December with respect to our handset business. A couple of other points I would share with you is, we exited the third quarter, if not with a record backlog, pretty darn close to it at Hill PHOENIX. And the interesting characteristic on that backlog is a much higher percentage of their third quarter ending backlog is actually scheduled for first quarter delivery, enough so that it actually appears odd. And we have a little bit of a concern that there could be some further push outs from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. Nothing has been signaled in the last 2 weeks, we just have a little bit of an elevated concern. And the third one, I would just say some uneasiness and uncertainty around the macroenvironment in the fourth quarter. Don't lose track of my first 2 comments. From an earnings perspective, we are clearly targeted and focused on delivering the top end of the range."

174901,222617946,365868,"Dover Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2012",2012-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before I get to our third quarter results, I'd like to share a few observations on the macro environment during the quarter. During our last quarterly c",631,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Before I get to our third quarter results, I'd like to share a few observations on the macro environment during the quarter. During our last quarterly call, we discussed the significant decline we had experienced in Europe, and moderating activity in China. We also saw North American markets as mostly stable. 90 days later, I would say these trends are generally continuing. Europe has remained at a low level, though the weakness is broader-based than last quarter. China has weakened, especially with respect to the electronics markets. The bright spot this quarter, again, was U.S. industrial activity. In summary, these conditions result in moderately slower global growth rates as we enter the fourth quarter. 
Now some comments on our third quarter results. We posted revenue of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an increase of 3%. Our third quarter EPS of $1.32 was an 11% improvement over the prior year, largely driven by strong leverage on volume. In our Energy segment, expanding production activity and strong downstream investments in distribution and retail fueling are among the trends that drove excellent business results in the quarter. Our drilling results were impacted by the lower year-over-year North American rig count, though rig count did increase sequentially. Overall, Energy's performance was characterized by continuing growth and strong margins. We expect these trends to continue in the fourth quarter. 
At our Communication Technologies segment, several handset OEMs launched new products towards the end of the quarter, which drove solid sequential results. Our MEMS activity was very strong, reflecting the breadth of our OEM coverage and the benefits of multiple design wins. 
The challenges at Sound Solutions led to lower revenue than expected. This, along with normal seasonality in the handset market, will continue to impact results through year end. While I was disappointed with our performance at Sound Solutions, we continue to work through significant business transitions and are making substantial progress. I firmly believe we will make further progress in this important business in the coming months. 
Within our Engineered Systems segment, refrigeration and food equipment markets remain quite solid and our business performance was strong. Regarding our fluids platform, markets remain much the same as last quarter, highlighted by the excellent results of recent acquisitions. We expect the segment's fourth quarter results to reflect the normal seasonality of our refrigeration markets and slightly moderating macro growth trends. 
Within our Printing & Identification segment, strong, organic growth in our fast-moving consumer goods market, along with the benefits of our second quarter restructuring, helped drive solid margin performance. The China electronics equipment market weakened through the quarter and was below our prior expectations. We believe this trend will continue and now project this segment's performance to be lower in the fourth quarter. 
Overall, the strong market positions of our businesses and productivity initiatives enabled us to deliver third quarter segment margin of 18%. During the quarter, our acquisition pipeline developed nicely, and we have several deals that have matured and are actionable. I remain bullish on our 5 growth spaces and I'm enthusiastic with the strategic add-ons in our pipeline. 
In summary, the majority of our businesses performed very well. I am quite pleased with our third quarter results and the responsiveness of our businesses. 
As we enter the fourth quarter, the softening global economy, especially impacting electronics, and lower volumes at Sound Solutions, result in an outlook that is less than we expected at the beginning of the third quarter. We remain focused on our growth initiatives and investments, select restructuring activities and the pursuit of strategic acquisition opportunities, all of which will help deliver further earnings gains in 2013. With that, let me turn it over to Brad."
174901,222617946,365868,"Dover Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2012",2012-10-17,"Earnings Calls","Dover Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year.

Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year. This was comprised of 1% organic growth, 4% from acquisitions and an unfavorable impact of 2% from foreign exchange. EPS was $1.32, which included a small benefit from discrete tax matters settled during the quarter. After adjusting for minor tax benefits realized in the third quarter of both periods, EPS improved 10% over the prior year. Segment margin for the quarter was 18%, an increase of 100 basis points. This result reflects solid performance in all segments and the absence of onetime acquisition-related costs incurred in the third quarter of last year. 
Bookings increased 1% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. These results represent solid 6% growth in Energy and modest increases in both Communication Technologies and Engineered Systems. In Printing & Identification, bookings decreased 10%, as further weakness in the electronics markets impacted the segment. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.94, in line with normal seasonality. Backlog grew 6% to $1.5 billion. 
In the third quarter, we generated $230 million of free cash flow, or 10% of revenue. We expect free cash flow for the year to be roughly 10% of revenue. 
Now turning to Slide 4 and our revenue growth. Organic growth remains solid at Engineered Systems and Energy, achieving 4% and 3% respectively in the quarter, reflecting strong performance in the food, equipment, production and downstream markets. Communication Technologies organic revenue declined 1%, while Printing & Identification decreased 6%. For the quarter, acquisition growth was strong in Energy and Engineered Systems, as they both posted 8% and 7% growth respectively. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 2% from the second quarter, with 3 of our 4 segments showing sequential growth. Communication Technologies increased 10%, primarily driven by the handset market. Energy increased 4%, led by the production in downstream markets. Engineered Systems showed modest sequential growth of 1%. Printing & Identification declined 3%. 
Bookings decreased 3% sequentially from the second quarter, in line with historical trends. Growth of 8% at Communication Technologies was led by the handset and aerospace markets. Engineered Systems bookings declined 8% sequentially, largely reflecting the normal seasonality of our refrigeration markets. The sequential bookings decline of 4% in Printing & Identification was primarily driven by continued weakness in the electronics markets. Energy bookings declined 1%. 
Now on Slide 6. Communication Technologies posted revenue of $396 million, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. These results reflect modest revenue decline in all end markets with the exception of aerospace/industrial. Within the handset market, very strong MEMS activity was offset by lower volume at Sound Solutions. Earnings increased 19% to $64 million and segment margin improved 290 basis points to 16.1%. This performance reflects strong leverage on MEMS volume, weaker results at Sound Solutions and the absence of onetime costs associated with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of last year. We expect segment revenue and margin to moderate sequentially in the fourth quarter on anticipated lower volumes, primarily due to seasonality and mix. 
Bookings were $412 million, essentially flat with last year. Book-to-bill finished at 1.04. 
Turning to Slide 7. Energy revenue increased 10% to $562 million, while earnings increased 11% to $139 million. Energy produced another solid quarter, as oil prices remain supportive of continued production activity and downstream markets remain strong. Rig count declined year-over-year, impacting our drilling business. Our focus on international growth, coupled with the diversity of our end markets, allowed us to post another quarter of strong revenue growth in both production and downstream. Operating margin was 24.7%, a 20 basis point improvement. Bookings were $527 million, a 6% increase over the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.94. 
Now on Slide 8. At Engineered Systems, sales were $892 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Earnings improved 15% to $144 million. Fluid Solutions revenue grew 26% to $218 million, benefiting from recent acquisitions. Fluid Solutions organic revenue was flat, with solid results in North America and Asia, offset by a weak Europe. 
Refrigeration and Industrial grew 5% organically to $674 million. Revenue gains were broad-based, with Hill PHOENIX posting a quarterly record for revenue. Operating margin was 16.2%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily driven by solid operating performance and our focus on cost improvements. 
Bookings were $798 million, an increase of 3%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.89. Our Fluid Solutions platform bookings increased 13% to $198 million. Refrigeration and Industrial was essentially flat with last year at $600 million. Book-to-bill for Fluid Solutions was 0.91, while Refrigeration and Industrials was 0.89. The segment book-to-bill principally reflects the normal seasonality of the refrigeration market and softer European and Asian markets. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. Printing & Identification revenue was $358 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 14% to $51 million. Gains in our consumer goods market helped to partially mitigate the continued softness in our electronics markets as well as unfavorable foreign exchange. Our electronic markets were down over $30 million year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, organic growth in the fast-moving consumer goods end market was 6%. 
Operating margin declined 40 basis points to 14.4%. The benefits of prior restructuring and continued cost improvements largely offset significantly lower volume in Electronics. Looking forward, we do not see a near-term recovery in the electronics markets. 
Bookings were $343 million, a decrease of 10% from last year. In the consumer goods and industrial markets, bookings increased 1%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Book-to-bill ended at 0.96. 
Moving to Slide 10. Third quarter net interest expense was generally in line with expectations. Corporate expense decreased by $2 million year-over-year.  Our third quarter tax rate was 27.9%. This rate was slightly higher than our prior forecast and largely impacted by mix and geographic earnings. This rate also included a $0.02 benefit from the resolution of discrete tax matters. Our CapEx spend for the quarter was $69 million, and we repurchased 4.3 million shares since our last call. 
Now turning to Slide 11 and our 2012 revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue growth of around 7%. Organic growth is estimated to be about 3%, including a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. Completed acquisitions will add around 4%. 
Breaking down revenue growth by segment. We expect Communication Technologies growth to be around 11% for the year, about 7 percentage points lower than our last guidance. The main drivers of this change are OEM launch delays and lower volumes at Sound Solutions. Energy growth is expected to be approximately 16%, largely unchanged from our prior forecast. Engineered Systems is forecasted to grow around 9%, again, in line with our prior expectations. Lastly, within Printing & Identification, a weakening electronics market is driving our revenue forecast down 1 percentage point. We now expect revenue to decline around 9% for the year, inclusive of a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. 
Now on Slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. As previously mentioned, we now expect revenue growth to be around 7%. Corporate expense decreased slightly, while interest expense and CapEx remained substantially unchanged. We now expect our 2012 tax rate to be 27.9%, reflecting changes in the mix of geographic earnings. Based on the above, we expect our full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be $4.55 to $4.65. 
Now let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 13. As a reminder, 2011 EPS was $4.26 after adjusting for $0.22 of discrete tax benefits. Volume, mix and price will contribute roughly $0.24 to $0.30 for the full year, down about $0.06 from our last forecast. Net productivity will add $0.20 to $0.24. Investment and compensation is now about $0.05, a $0.06 adjustment from our last forecast. We expect completed acquisitions to be about $0.14 dilutive for the year, down from our prior forecast. This revision largely reflects the impact of Sound Solutions. On a net basis, the impact of corporate expense, interest expense, share count and our tax rate is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. The net result is full year EPS of $4.55 to $4.65. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments."

As I mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance. We delivered strong earnings growth in a tough environment. This is a testament to the strength of our businesses and the responsiveness of our leadership teams across the company. As Brad just mentioned, our fourth quarter outlook has been reduced. 
I expect a few of our highlights for the quarter to be: further progress at Sound Solutions, continuing strong gains in our MEMS business, continued strength in Energy and the continuation of our focus on cost reduction versus via select restructuring activities. My reduced guidance does not change my conviction on the long-term growth opportunities before us. 
Looking ahead to 2013, I remain confident in the positions we hold in our 5 key growth spaces. Our focus in energy, fluids, refrigeration and food equipment, product identification and communication components, offer us substantial growth opportunities. I look forward to sharing specific details regarding 2013 at our Investor Day conference in New York on December 10.

So let me back up to about 15 months ago and just highlight what I would label as the 3 primary objectives we had as we entered the third quarter right after the acquisition of Sound Solutions. We knew we were dealing with the significant change in the marketplace with Nokia and a couple of other OEMs, but objective #1 was aggressively pursue design wins with new OEMs. I would say objective #2 sort of goes to the heart of your question, which was a significant manufacturing transition in the Beijing operation with the focus on the high flex automation. And the third objective would be to work the new designs quickly to drive yield improvements and volume ramp. Shannon, the execution on all 3 of these objectives has been slower than I expected, slower than we expected, and it has been disappointing. Your question about the capability we have, both in Vienna as well as the Knowles team, is true. In fact, as we exited the second quarter, early part of the third quarter, we did start to make some management transitions in Beijing. In fact, the General Manager of Beijing, now the Operations Manager. I think the Quality Manager and probably about 5 other key leadership positions have been changed since the end of the second quarter, with Knowles China personnel taking over responsibility for these positions. So now, let's comment on the third quarter. I think we've learned a lot in the first 6 months of this year. I think those learnings, along with the management transitions that we started to make at the end of the second quarter and into the early part of the third quarter, we have seen some progress. On the high flex lines, we like what we have and we feel we made the right decision. We've had lots of learning between line 1 and where we are today, but I would also label that this high flex automation objective as no longer a challenge. Our yields continue to improve. We had significant improvements during the third quarter, more in the latter part of the third quarter than we did in the early part. And we will continue to make more progress in the fourth quarter. The volume has been lower than expected, but I also expect it to continue to increase. Shannon, I'd share one further comment and it has less to do about performance and more to do with sort of the outlook for this business. As focused as we have been in the last 6 months on bringing up the high flex automation and improving our yields, we are already working on several new designs for 2013 OEM product launches. And actually, a couple of the key designs are actually scheduled for first quarter qualification tests and we're on schedule."

And we spent a lot of time talking about this, debating this, as you would normally expect us to narrow that to $0.05. Let me give you some color. I will tell you that as we sit here today, we clearly are focused on achieving and hitting the top end of the range with respect to EPS. That is our target and that is our goal. As we came through the third quarter, September bookings were the lightest month of the quarter. And I don't think it was an aberration. September bookings was the lightest month of the quarter and that statement is true for 3 of our 4 segments, the one exception being Communication Technologies. That gives us a little bit of a pause and sort of, I call it, increases the uncertainty level as we come into the fourth quarter. I've got a very short data point for you, and that's after the first 2 weeks of this quarter, after the first 2 weeks of October, the order rates and activity would have us comfortable with a minimum of the mid-range of our revenue guidance. So why do we have this sort of, someone could say, conservative safety net at the bottom end of the range? Part of that is the uncertainty we have around the month of December with respect to our handset business. A couple of other points I would share with you is, we exited the third quarter, if not with a record backlog, pretty darn close to it, at Hill PHOENIX. And the interesting characteristic on that backlog is a much higher percentage of their third quarter ending backlog is actually scheduled for first quarter delivery, enough so that it actually appears odd. And we have a little bit of a concern that there could be some further pushouts from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. Nothing has been signaled in the last 2 weeks, we just have a little bit of an elevated concern. And the third one, I would just say some uneasiness and uncertainty around the macro environment in the fourth quarter. Don't lose track of my first 2 comments. From an earnings perspective, we are clearly targeted and focused on delivering the top end of the range."
