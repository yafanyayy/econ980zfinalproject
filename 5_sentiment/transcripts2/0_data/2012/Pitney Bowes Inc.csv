After the presentatio",825,"Thanks, Charlie. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our business, Mike will follow on the details for the quarter and the results, and I will provide full year guidance for 2012. After the presentation, we'll take your questions.
2011 was the year in which we continued to make progress in laying the foundation for longer-term growth and value creation. We are pleased that we are able to achieve our original earnings objective and exceed our cash flow target, despite a business environment that remained unexpectedly challenging throughout the year. As part of our Strategic Transformation program, we continued to take actions to streamline our business processes and improve the way we interact with our customers. 
Our cost structure is now more valuable and efficient, and as a result, we achieved EBIT margin improvement for the year on our adjusted results despite lower revenues. However, before I discuss some highlights of our fourth quarter performance, I would like to put our long-term growth strategies into perspective. 
Our growth strategies are grounded in an understanding of the fundamental changes in the way businesses and customers communicate. Historically, when businesses communicated with customers, it was largely around transactions and primarily through physical channels. The business communications landscape is much more complex today. Now, businesses are communicating with customers more frequently through multiple channels in an effort to stay connected in hypercompetitive global markets. 
Customers are seeking more control as they search for timely, relevant offers in the midst of an abundance of information from multiple sources. Digital Communications continues to increase though those physical communications remain an important part of the overall communications mix. 
Businesses are struggling to reach all of their customers with the right offers in the ways that their customers want, with the technologies of their preference. Our growth strategies are built on helping enterprise and SMB customers navigate this complex environment. 
In 2011, strategic transformation allowed us to continue making the necessary investments to expand our capabilities despite the revenue weakness that persisted throughout the year. As a result, we are delivering a wider array of solutions to help our customers manage physical, digital and hybrid communications with their customers. 
Throughout the year, we continued to make progress in establishing Volly as the secure digital mail platform of choice for the industry. We are actively building a community of mailing providers that are interested in offering their customers' digital options for aggregating, storing, managing and making payments for a variety of content down for their physical address. We have now signed over 40 large third-party mail service providers, who produce billions of bills, statements and account communications each year for more than 5,000 companies and consumer brands. Each of them are working to bring the companies they represent into Volly. 
Our investments also enabled us to change our value proposition with our SMB mailers from meters only, to a broader solution set that includes our smart family of cloud-based digital solutions.
The momentum is growing for this family of solutions which help SMB customers use QR codes, e-mail and direct mail for marketing campaign. Our new PB smart postage solution, recently reached its 10,000th customer. Many of the trends, which we noted in our fourth quarter performance were consistent with those which impacted our performance in the second half of the year. 
Despite improvement in our equipment sales in the first half of the year, persistent economic uncertainty worldwide resulted in some of our customers deferring new equipment purchases and capital commitments during the second half of the year. However, our Connect+ digital mailing system continued to sell well on a global basis, and Production Mail installed additional and Intellijet color printers both in the U.S. and Europe in the quarter. 
We grew our software revenue for the full year despite some deferred business at year-end. As a result of strong global demand for our communications management software solutions. Our Mail Services employees did a remarkable job recovering from the fire in the beginning of the year that destroyed our largest mail presorting site that was located in Dallas, Texas. In less than 9 months, we located and outsetted a new site and resumed revenue growth in our Presort business in the fourth quarter. 
We are now positioned to continue the profitable growth trend in our Presort business that we experienced before the fire. We had outstanding free cash flow for the quarter of $215 million and we generated $1.03 billion of free cash flow for the year. 
We are pleased to note that because of our sound capital structure, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend for the 30th consecutive year. As we reported last week, the dividend for the first quarter of 2012 is $0.375 per common share. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike, for a discussion of other fourth quarter and our full-year financial results."
297018,146292008,218907,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray.

Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 6.5% when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter had no impact on revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by SMB sales and some deferred enterprise deals, especially in Production Mail and Software, as well as continued economic uncertainty. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 8%. Outside the U.S., revenue declined by 2% versus the prior year. Non-U.S. operations now represent 33% of our total revenue. 
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes. Adjusted EBIT was $239 million for the quarter. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17.8%, which was a decrease of 20 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was affected this quarter by our planned investment in Volly. Excluding our investment in Volly, EBIT margin would've been 40 basis points higher and would've improved 20 basis points versus the prior year.
Adjusted EBIT was also impacted by the decline in our Software revenue this quarter, as well as the anticipated decline in our rentals and finance revenue streams.
Favorable margin in Mail Services, International Mailing and Marketing Services were somewhat offset by the margin impact in Software and rental financing and supply streams in North America. SG&A in the quarter declined by more than $20 million when compared with the prior year. SG&A continues to benefit from our ongoing productivity initiatives. 
On a segment basis, EBIT margins this quarter improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments. Both of our SMB segment businesses improved their year-over-year EBIT margins for the fourth consecutive quarter, now Mail Services and Marketing Services businesses also had improving EBIT margins. Production Mail excluding the Volly investment is the fifth segment to have a higher year-over-year EBIT margin. 
These improvements are primarily a result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses.
We continue to reap the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions that we have taken since the second half of 2009. We've implemented actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers, and develop new products. We will continue to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined, and our cost more variable, allowing us to continue to improve profitability by better leveraging future revenue growth. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $306 million or $1.53 a share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $49 million, a modest decrease of $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.61%, which was 5 basis points lower than the prior year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was actually a benefit of 5.4%, versus an effective tax rate of 33% last year. The change in the tax rate this quarter was a result of reaching an agreement with the IRS on tax matters, that related to years 2005 through 2008 and included some other tax matters fort the years 2001 through 2007. As a result, during the quarter, we realized an income tax benefit of $74 million in continuing operations.
Excluding the impact of the tax settlement with the IRS, our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been 33.6% for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to our earnings per share, which had a lot of different factors impacting it this quarter, and therefore, it might be helpful if you refer to the reconciliation table we have on Page 3 of our earnings release.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.97. If we look at our earnings on an underlying operational basis, consistent with our annual guidance presentation, you would include the tax benefit of $0.37 I noted earlier. On this basis, adjusted earnings per share this quarter was $0.61, which is comparable to the $0.66 we earned last year. 
As I noted earlier, adjusted earnings per share includes cost of about $0.02 per share this quarter for the planned investment in Volly. GAAP earnings per share, per diluted share per quarter, quadrupled versus the prior year to $1.28. There are 3 specific items causing the difference between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings this quarter. 
First, we incurred restructuring charges in asset impairments that totaled $0.31 per share. For the $0.31, $0.28 per share represents restructuring charges related to our Strategic Transformation program. Asset impairments of $0.03 per share relate to a facility exit, and an impairment of intangible assets associated with the international operations of Pitney Bowes management services. 
Second, GAAP earnings per diluted share include a $0.41 per share, noncash, goodwill impairment charge related to the international operations of Pitney Bowes management services. The impairment reflects weaker than expected growth, changing print demand and a weaker economic outlook for European markets. 
Third, GAAP earnings per share for the quarter included a net benefit of $1.4 in discontinued operations, due to resolution of tax issues, primarily related to our former Capital Services business. While these adjustments to earnings are significant, they have resulted in a more streamlined and flexible business model, and lower risks and uncertainties on our balance sheet. 
In our third quarter 2011 announcement, we provided earnings guidance for 2011 on an adjusted basis in a range of $2.30 to $2.35. This included the $0.08 per share tax benefit recognized in the third quarter. On that same basis, our adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2011, was $2.34. 
As Murray noted, free cash flow was $215 million for the quarter, and was $1.03 billion for the year. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the year benefited from higher net income, and our U.S. tax settlement, which positively impacted cash flow by about $100 million. 
During the quarter, we returned $74 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends, and made $29 million of payments related to our restructuring program. For the year, we returned $300 million in cash to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, and we also repurchased $100 million in common stock. 
Additionally, we made $123 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan, paid $107 million in restructuring payments, and reduced our debt by $15 million. We do not purchase common stock this quarter.
As of the end of the quarter, we have no commercial paper outstanding, and we have no term debt coming due, until October of this year. With that, 76% of our total debt is fixed rate and 24% is floating rate. 
Let me now update you on our Strategic Transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we identified and again, implementing a number of new initiatives that we will complete in 2012. During the fourth quarter, the pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our Strategic Transformation program were approximately $79 million, principally for severance and other exit costs. 
During the quarter, approximately 700 positions were eliminated across the company, as we continue to create efficiencies, automate processes and outsource non-core functions. Since the beginning of the program, we've reduced the workforce by approximately 14%. 
Our pretax charges this year related to the Strategic Information program were about $132 million or about $0.46 per share. This exceeded our original guidance of $0.25 to $0.35 per share as we were successful in identifying additional opportunities to streamline our operations and reduce costs. Therefore, we now estimate the run rate of net savings associated with our Strategic Transformation program will be in excess of $300 million.
That concludes my remarks. Now, Murray will discuss our guidance, and we'll have some closing comments."

We expect 2012 revenue excluding the impacts of currency to be in the range of plus or minus 2% in growth. Our outlook anticipates improving revenue trends versus last year, due in part to a number of initiatives designed to drive new growth opportunities. The guidance reflects a postal and economic environment that is not expected to improve, nor deteriorate significantly over the next 12 months. We anticipate gradual improvement in our SMB equipment sales in 2012, driven primarily by the positive outlet for sales of the Connect+  digital marketing system on a global basis, which will also result in fewer lease extensions by customers. 
We have previously discussed how lower equipment sales and prior periods affect financing, rentals and supplies revenue streams. As a result, we expect declines in recurring revenue streams but at a moderating rate, as equipment sales improve. 
In 2012, we expect growth across our enterprise businesses as well. We anticipate continued growth in Software revenue due to increasing global demand for our customer communications management software solutions, such as those that manage data, target prospects, and use location to make offers more relevant. 
We also expect increased placements of Intellijet color printing systems and Production Mail, continued expansion in Mail Services and benefit from a focus on legal, commercial and government sectors in our Management Services business. 
Based on our revenue expectations, our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $2.5 to $2.25. Included in these earnings expectations, our higher costs associated with our pension and benefit plans, increased investment in Volly, and a mixed shift resulting from faster growing, yet relatively lower margin enterprise businesses. We expect to generate free cash flow for 2012 in the range of $700 million to $800 million. 
We expect free cash flow will be lower in 2012 then in 2011 since we anticipate investing more cash in finance receivables, because of higher levels of equipment sales. We also do not anticipate the level of tax refunds that we received in 2011. For over 90 years, we have helped our customers reduce their costs and increase their efficiency of using mail to connect with their customers. 
Over the last few years, the way businesses and customers communicate has changed, and so have we. We have enhanced our operating efficiencies added variability to our cost structure and expanded our digital hybrid and software offerings. We believe there are tremendous opportunities ahead to enrich the value of both physical and digital communications.
In 2011, we continued to make progress in positioning ourselves to help our customer use physical, digital and hybrid communications to connect with their customers. We will continue to innovate and invest to expand our capabilities to help our customers provide their customers with the offers they want, when they want it, through the channel of their choice. 
Our competitive advantage lies in our knowledge and expertise of physical communications in conjunction with our growing digital and software capabilities. There are exciting things ahead in 2012 and beyond, and we are committed to making them happen. 
Now, we'll be happy to answer your questions."

First of all, what we're seeing is we've seen Europe or international now run positive for the last 3 quarters. And we expect to see the rate of decline we experienced this year to decline in 2012. Now that will happen due to a number of things. First, the Connect+ product that continues to expand around the world and we continue to place that here in the U.S. We will see that affect our lease renewal business by having less lease extensions. And as we've described before, a lease extension gets about 70% of the revenue that we get from a lease upgrade. So as that continues to roll out, we expect to see that benefit. Then in addition to that, they continued to roll out of our digital services around our existing meter base will also be a positive and expanding our reach into the leader base itself. At the same time, with Connect+, as you're aware, it uses color and therefore, ink will begin to become a better part of the growth going forward. So I think those are the general items. Also, inside of international, we've seen Canada now move to a net positive. So units are actually growing again. So as we look at the different parts of the world and where they are in the economic environment, the U.S. is trailing some of the areas and slightly ahead of the few but generally, we expect to see that move in a positive direction."

Also, there's another element that affects the equivalent sales line, which is the Production Mail business. A good portion of their revenue goes through that equipment sales line as well. So you have to look at that on a year-over-year basis in terms of its impact on that line all in. But to your point, the equipment sales is the starting point of the building of the asset base and the finance receivable base which drives financing income, and obviously the placement of rental supplies as Murray said. The high end with color is going to be an opportunity for greater supply streams. So, it is sort of a leading indicator for the future growth of those or improvement in those trends."

We're now up and running and in fact, saw the profitability improvement come back as we move that mail back into the Dallas facility, which happens to be the highest volume facility in our network. So we anticipate that that's going to be a positive contributor going forward.

So, that's one of the leading indicators obviously for that business in terms of improved revenue and there's a installation process that goes with the contracts but we put a focus in that business around 3 key verticals. And we begin to see some of the benefits of the actions that they've taken there. The aberrations in the fourth quarter from trend were around the Software business, which we saw a good strong growth through the first 3 quarters. In fact, for the full year, they were up 9% in revenue. We saw some delays of accounts at the end of the year, and I think timing of some things. We would expect that to be a growth contributor in 2012. So versus the fourth quarter more in line with what they have seen over the course of the full year of 2011, certainly in the first 3 quarters of 2011. In terms of the mailing business, I think we've touch on that obviously Connect+ is an important product for us. As well as Murray mentioned, there's a number of digital products that have been launched over the course of 2011, and we're beginning to see some uptake on that. But they're recurring revenue type products and low dollar value per unit, which you build over time. Not unlike what we did in the small and meter base. So, we would look to that contributes over a period of time."

And it's a little more financially sensitive, depending on what is happening in the markets. But as we've said before, of those deals are usually timing related, rather than whether they exist or not. It isn't that any of those deals were really lost. There's really just timing and as we expressed in prior periods, they tend to bounce back fairly well. In Europe, our written business actually was up in the DMT space versus softer in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. So we do expect to start to see that becoming more like it historically has been as we get into 2012."

What we've been focused on Shannon is the signing of the billers and then the next phase is the implementation of those billers so that their data can move forward. As we do look at the research, and this is why we've held back from going to the consumers with the product, is if a consumers get the product and there's no content, it is not considered valuable and then when content appears, it's actually a negative and you have to resell it. So we are continuing to hold back until we get the contents from the billers. We have announced earlier in the week that we are over 40 billers that we have signed. They have over 5,000 billers inside of those 40. So we need to now, place the technology into those 40 sites. Those 40 sites now need to work with their 5,000 to get the fees in. So we only have one central fee to meet to those sites but we need to connect all of the others. We would expect that somewhere in that made year at that third quarter, those connectors would be in place along with the addition that we are expecting. We're going to continue to grow that over the next 6 months. But we are already -- if all of those were connected, that is already in the billions of pieces that could be moved digitally. So that is our drive, is to get the connectivity there, get the pipes in place, and then be able to go live later in the year and consumers to be able to get actual data when they turn the system on. So our investment will continue in building out the pipes, etc., and you really won't see us going to marketing, until we are close to the launch date."

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our business.

Mike will follow with the details on our fourth quarter and full year results, and I'll provide full year guidance for 2012. After the presentation, we'll take your questions.
2011 was a year in which we continued to make progress in laying the foundation for longer-term growth and value creation. We are pleased that we were able to achieve our original earnings objective and exceed our cash flow target despite a business environment that remained unexpectedly challenging throughout the year. As part of our Strategic Transformation program, we continued to take actions to streamline our business processes and improve the way we interact with our customers. Our cost structure is now more variable and efficient, and, as a result, we achieved EBIT margin improvement for the year on our adjusted results despite lower revenues. However, before I discuss some highlights of our fourth quarter performance, I want to put our long-term growth strategies into perspective. 
Our growth strategies are grounded in an understanding of the fundamental changes in the way businesses and customers communicate. Historically, when businesses communicated with customers, it was largely around transactions and primarily through physical channels. The business communications landscape is much more complex today. Now businesses are communicating with customers more frequently through multiple channels in an effort to stay connected in hypercompetitive global markets. 
Customers are seeking more control as they search for timely, relevant offers in the midst of an abundance of information from multiple sources. Digital Communications continues to increase through -- though those physical communications remain an important part of the overall communications mix. 
Businesses are struggling to reach all of their customers with the right offers in the ways that their customers want, with the technologies of their preference. Our growth strategies are built on helping enterprise and SMB customers navigate this complex environment. 
In 2011, Strategic Transformation allowed us to continue making the necessary investments to expand our capabilities despite the revenue weakness that persisted throughout the year. As a result, we are delivering a wider array of solutions to help our customers manage physical, digital and hybrid communications with their customers. 
Throughout the year, we continued to make progress in establishing Volly as the secure digital mail platform of choice for the industry. We are actively building a community of mailing providers that are interested in offering their customers digital options for aggregating, storing, managing and making payments for a variety of content bound for their physical addresses. We have now signed over 40 large third-party mail service providers, who produce billions of bills, statements and account communications each year for more than 5,000 companies and consumer brands. Each of them are working to bring the companies they represent into Volly. 
Our investments also enabled us to change our value proposition with our SMB mailers from meters only to a broader solution set that includes our smart family of cloud-based digital solutions.
The momentum is growing for this family of solutions, which help SMB customers use QR codes, email and direct mail for marketing campaign. Our new pbSmartPostage solution recently reached its 10,000th customer. Many of the trends which we noted in our fourth quarter performance were consistent with those, which impacted our performance in the second half of the year. 
Despite improvement in our equipment sales in the first half of the year, persistent economic uncertainty worldwide resulted in some of our customers deferring new equipment purchases and capital commitments during the second half of the year. However, our Connect+ digital mailing system continued to sell well on a global basis, and Production Mail installed additional and IntelliJet color printers both in the U.S. and Europe in the quarter. 
We grew our Software revenue for the full year despite some deferred business at year end as a result of strong global demand for our communications management software solutions. Our Mail Services employees did a remarkable job recovering from the fire in the beginning of the year that destroyed our largest mail presorting site that was located in Dallas, Texas. In less than 9 months, we located and outfitted a new site and resumed revenue growth in our presort business in the fourth quarter. We are now positioned to continue the profitable growth trend in our presort business that we experienced before the fire. 
We had outstanding free cash flow for the quarter of $215 million, and we generated $1.03 billion of free cash flow for the year. We are pleased to note that because of our sound capital structure, our Board Of directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend for the 30th consecutive year. As we reported last week, the dividend for the first quarter of 2012 is $0.375 per common share. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our fourth quarter and our full year financial results."
297018,146292008,219001,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 6.5% when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter had no impact on revenue.

Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 6.5% when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter had no impact on revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by lower SMB sales and some deferred enterprise deals, especially in Production Mail and Software, as well as continued economic uncertainty. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 8%. Outside the U.S., revenue declined by 2% versus the prior year. Non-U.S. operations now represent 33% of our total revenue. 
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes. Adjusted EBIT was $239 million for the quarter. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17.8%, which was a decrease of 20 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was affected this quarter by our planned investment in Volly. Excluding our investment in Volly, EBIT margin would have been 40 basis points higher and would have improved 20 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was also impacted by the decline in our Software revenue this quarter, as well as the anticipated decline in our rentals and finance revenue streams. Favorable margins in Mail Services, International Mailing and Marketing Services were somewhat offset by the margin impact in Software and rental financing and supply streams in North America. 
SG&A in the quarter declined by more than $20 million when compared with the prior year. SG&A continues to benefit from our ongoing productivity initiatives. 
On a segment basis, EBIT margins this quarter improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments. Both of our SMB segment businesses improved their year-over-year EBIT margins for the fourth consecutive quarter, and our Mail Services and Marketing Services businesses also had improving EBIT margins. Production Mail, excluding the Volly investment, is the fifth segment to have a higher year-over-year EBIT margin. These improvements are primarily a result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses.
We continue to reap the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions that we have taken since the second half of 2009. We've implemented actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. We will continue to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and our costs more variable, allowing us to continue to improve profitability by better leveraging future revenue growth. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $306 million or $1.53 a share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was $49 million, a modest decrease of $2 million when compared with prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.61%, which was 5 basis points lower than the prior year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was actually a benefit of 5.4% versus an effective tax rate of 33% last year. The change in the tax rate this quarter was a result of reaching an agreement with the IRS on tax matters that related to years 2005 through 2008, and we included some other tax matters for the years 2001 through 2007. As a result, during the quarter, we realized an income tax benefit of $74 million in continuing operations. Excluding the impact of the tax settlement with the IRS, our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been 33.6% for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to our earnings per share, which had a lot of different factors impacting it this quarter. And therefore, it might be helpful if you refer to the reconciliation table we have on Page 3 of our earnings release.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.97. If we look at our earnings on an underlying operational basis, consistent with our annual guidance presentation, you would include the tax benefit of $0.37 I noted earlier. On this basis, adjusted earnings per share this quarter was $0.61, which is comparable to the $0.66 we earned last year. As I noted earlier, adjusted earnings per share includes costs of about $0.02 per share this quarter for the planned investment in Volly. GAAP earnings per share -- per diluted share for the quarter quadrupled versus the prior year to $1.28. 
There are 3 specific items causing the difference between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings this quarter. First, we incurred restructuring charges and asset impairments that totaled $0.31 per share. For the $0.31, $0.28 per share represents restructuring charges related to our Strategic Transformation program. Asset impairments of $0.03 per share relate to a facility exit and an impairment of intangible assets associated with the international operations of Pitney Bowes Management Services. 
Second, GAAP earnings per diluted share include a $0.41-per-share noncash goodwill impairment charge related to the international operations of Pitney Bowes Management Services. The impairment reflects weaker-than-expected growth, changing print demand and a weaker economic outlook for European markets. 
Third, GAAP earnings per share for the quarter included a net benefit of $1.04 in discontinued operations due to resolution of tax issues primarily related to our former Capital Services business. While these adjustments to earnings are significant, they have resulted in a more streamlined and flexible business model and lower risks and uncertainties on our balance sheet. 
In our third quarter 2011 announcement, we provided earnings guidance for 2011 on an adjusted basis in a range of $2.30 to $2.35. This included the $0.08-per-share tax benefit recognized in the third quarter. On that same basis, our adjusted earnings per share for the full year of 2011 was $2.34. 
As Murray noted, free cash flow was $215 million for the quarter and was $1.03 billion for the year. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the year benefited from higher net income and our U.S. tax settlement, which positively impacted cash flow by about $100 million. 
During the quarter, we returned $74 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and made $29 million of payments related to our restructuring program. For the year, we returned $300 million in cash to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, and we also repurchased $100 million of common stock. Additionally, we made a $123 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan, paid $107 million in restructuring payments and reduced our debt by $50 million. We did not purchase common stock this quarter.
As of the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding, and we have no term debt coming due until October of this year. About 76% of our total debt is fixed rate, and 24% is floating rate. 
Let me now update you on our Strategic Transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we identified and began implementing a number of new initiatives that we will complete in 2012. During the fourth quarter, the pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our Strategic Transformation program were approximately $79 million, principally for severance and other exit costs. During the quarter, approximately 700 positions were eliminated across the company as we continued to create efficiencies, automate processes and outsource noncore functions. Since the beginning of the program, we've reduced the workforce by approximately 14%. 
Our pretax charges this year related to the Strategic Transformation program were about $132 million or about $0.46 per share. This exceeded our original guidance of $0.25 to $0.35 per share as we were successful in identifying additional opportunities to streamline our operations and reduce costs. Therefore, we now estimate the run rate of net savings associated with our Strategic Transformation program will be in excess of $300 million.
So that concludes my remarks. Now murray will discuss our guidance and will have some closing comments."

We expect 2012 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of plus or minus 2% in growth. Our outlook anticipates improving revenue trends versus last year due in part to a number of initiatives designed to drive new growth opportunities. The guidance reflects a postal and economic environment that is not expected to improve nor deteriorate significantly over the next 12 months. We anticipate gradual improvement in our SMB equipment sales in 2012, driven primarily by the positive outlet for sales of the Connect+  digital marketing system on a global basis, which will also result in fewer lease extensions by customers. We have previously discussed how lower equipment sales in prior periods affect financing, rentals and supplies revenue streams. As a result, we expect declines in recurring revenue streams but at a moderating rate as equipment sales improve. 
In 2012, we expect growth across our Enterprise businesses as well. We anticipate continued growth in Software revenue due to increasing global demand for customer communications management software solutions, such as those that manage data, target prospects and use location to make offers more relevant. We also expect increased placements of IntelliJet color printing systems in Production Mail, continued expansion in Mail Services and benefits from a focus on legal, commercial and government sectors in our Management Services business. 
Based on our revenue expectations, our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $2.05 to $2.25. Included in these earnings expectations are higher costs associated with our pension and benefit plans, increased investment in Volly and a mix shift resulting from faster growing, yet relatively lower, margin Enterprise businesses. We expect to generate free cash flow for 2012 in the range of $700 million to $800 million. We expect free cash flow will be lower in 2012 than in 2011 since we anticipate investing more cash in finance receivables because of higher levels of equipment sales. We also do not anticipate the level of tax refunds that we received in 2011. 
For over 90 years, we have helped our customers reduce their costs and increase their efficiency of using mail to connect with their customers. Over the last few years, the way businesses and customers communicate has changed, and so have we. We have enhanced our operating efficiencies, added variability to our cost structure and expanded our digital, hybrid and software offerings.

First of all, what we're seeing is we've seen Europe or international now run positive for the last 3 quarters. And we expect to see the rate of that -- of decline we experienced this year to decline in 2012. Now that will happen due to a number of things. First, the Connect+ product. That continues to expand around the world, and we continue to place that here in the U.S. We will see that affect our lease renewal business by having less lease extensions. And as we've described before, a lease extension gets about 70% of the revenue that we get from a lease upgrade. So as that continues to roll out, we expect to see that benefit. Then, in addition to that, they continued to roll out of our digital services around our existing meter base will also be a positive in expanding our reach into the meter base itself. At the same time, with Connect+, as you're aware, it uses color and, therefore, ink will begin to become a better part of the growth going forward. So I think those are the general items. Also, inside of international, we've seen Canada now move to a net positive. So units are actually growing again. So as we look at the different parts of the world and where they are in the economic environment, the U.S. is trailing some of the areas and slightly ahead of a few. But generally, we expect to see that move in a positive direction."

Also, there's one other element that affects the equivalent sales line, which is the Production Mail business. A good portion of their revenue goes through that equipment sale line as well. So you have to look at that on a year-over-year basis in terms of its impact on that line, all in. But to your point, the equipment sales is the starting point of the building of the asset base and the finance receivable base, which drives financing income. And obviously, the placement of rental supplies, as Murray said. The high end with color is going to be an opportunity for greater supply streams. So it is sort of a leading indicator for the future growth of those or improvement in those trends."

So we anticipate that that's going to be a positive contributor going forward. We obviously lost a lot of the income early in the year, and then we've received some of the insurance benefits in the latter part of the year.

We did see improved written business at the end of the year, both in the U.S. and in the international space. So that's one of the leading indicators, obviously, for that business in terms of improved revenue. And there's an installation process that goes with the contracts. But we put a focus in that business around 3 key verticals, and we're beginning to see some of the benefits of the actions that they've taken there. The aberrations in the fourth quarter from trend were around the Software business, which we saw a good strong growth through the first 3 quarters. In fact, for the full year, they were up 9% in revenue. We saw some delays of accounts at the end of the year and, I think, timing on some things. We would expect that to be a growth contributor in 2012. So versus the fourth quarter, more in line with what they had seen over the course of the full year of 2011, certainly in the first 3 quarters of 2011. In terms of the mailing business, I think we touched on that in terms of, obviously, Connect+ is an important product for us. As well as, Murray mentioned there's a number of digital products that have been launched over the course of 2011, and we're beginning to see some uptake on that. But they're recurring revenue-type products and low dollar value per unit which you build over time, not unlike what we did in the small and meter base.

But as we've said before, those deals are usually timing related rather than whether they exist or not. And it isn't that any of those deals were really lost. There's really just timing. And as we expressed in prior periods, they tend to bounce back fairly well. In Europe, our written business actually was up in the DMT space versus softer in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. So we'd expect to start to see that becoming more like it historically has been as we get through 2012."

What we've been focused on, Shannon, is the signing of billers, and then the next phase is the implementation of those billers so that their data can move forward. As we do look at the research, and this is why we've held back from going to the consumers with the product, is if a consumer gets a product and there's no content, it is not considered valuable. And then when content appears, it's actually a negative and you have to resell it. So we are continuing to hold back until we get the content from the billers. We have announced earlier in the week that we are over 40 billers that we have signed. They have over 5,000 billers inside of those 40. So we need to now place the technology into those 40 sites. Those 40 sites now need to work with their 5,000 to get the feeds in. So we'll have one central feed from each of those sites, but we need to connect all of the others. We would expect that somewhere in the midyear to third quarter, those connectors would be in place, along with the additions that we're expecting to -- we're going to continue to grow that over the next 6 months, but we already -- if all of those were connected, that is already in the billions of pieces that could be moved digitally. So that is our drive, is to get the connectivity there, get the pipes in place and then be able to go live later in the year and consumers be able to get actual data when they turn the system on. So our investment will continue in building out the pipes, et cetera, and you really won't see us going to marketing until we are close to the launch date."

So if you take the midpoints of our ranges just as a way to compare, the key drivers of the difference, I would say, between our earnings this year on an adjusted basis and what's proposed next year is principally the pension and the incremental Volly investment. So pension is probably in the range of $0.04 to $0.05, and the Volly investment could be a broader range than that. It could be from $0.03 to $0.07, in that range, potentially. And that really goes back to Shannon's question of the timing of when we go to market, how much marketing spend against that. So we've sort of planned for a wider range there until we see exactly how we go to market. But the biggest variable on that would be marketing expense. So that puts you at more or less a push, and the other drivers in there are, obviously, we anticipate faster growth in the Enterprise businesses than the SMB business, which has, on average, a lower-margin profile. And then we have the benefits from our transformation program that are mitigating that. So to give you an idea of -- about how that works out."

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start by sharing some thoughts on our business. Mike will follow with the details on our fourth quarter and full year results, and I'll provide full year guidance for 2012. After the presentation, we'll take your questions.
2011 was a year in which we continued to make progress in laying the foundation for longer-term growth and value creation. We are pleased that we were able to achieve our original earnings objective and exceed our cash flow target despite a business environment that remained unexpectedly challenging throughout the year. As part of our Strategic Transformation program, we continued to take actions to streamline our business processes and improve the way we interact with our customers. Our cost structure is now more variable and efficient, and, as a result, we achieved EBIT margin improvement for the year on our adjusted results despite lower revenues. However, before I discuss some highlights of our fourth quarter performance, I want to put our long-term growth strategies into perspective. 
Our growth strategies are grounded in an understanding of the fundamental changes in the way businesses and customers communicate. Historically, when businesses communicated with customers, it was largely around transactions and primarily through physical channels. The business communications landscape is much more complex today. Now businesses are communicating with customers more frequently through multiple channels in an effort to stay connected in hypercompetitive global markets. 
Customers are seeking more control as they search for timely, relevant offers in the midst of an abundance of information from multiple sources. Digital Communications continues to increase through -- though physical communications remain an important part of the overall communications mix. 
Businesses are struggling to reach all of their customers with the right offers in the ways that their customers want, with the technologies of their preference. Our growth strategies are built on helping enterprise and SMB customers navigate this complex environment. 
In 2011, Strategic Transformation allowed us to continue making the necessary investments to expand our capabilities despite the revenue weakness that persisted throughout the year. As a result, we are delivering a wider array of solutions to help our customers manage physical, digital and hybrid communications with their customers. 
Throughout the year, we continued to make progress in establishing Volly as the secure digital mail platform of choice for the industry. We are actively building a community of mailing providers that are interested in offering their customers digital options for aggregating, storing, managing and making payments for a variety of content bound for their physical addresses. We have now signed over 40 large third-party mail service providers, who produce billions of bills, statements and account communications each year for more than 5,000 companies and consumer brands. Each of them are working to bring the companies they represent into Volly. 
Our investments also enabled us to change our value proposition with our SMB mailers from meters only to a broader solution set that includes our smart family of cloud-based digital solutions.
The momentum is growing for this family of solutions, which help SMB customers use QR codes, email and direct mail for marketing campaign. Our new pbSmartPostage solution recently reached its 10,000th customer. Many of the trends which we noted in our fourth quarter performance were consistent with those, which impacted our performance in the second half of the year. 
Despite improvement in our equipment sales in the first half of the year, persistent economic uncertainty worldwide resulted in some of our customers deferring new equipment purchases and capital commitments during the second half of the year. However, our Connect+ digital mailing system continued to sell well on a global basis, and Production Mail installed additional and IntelliJet color printers both in the U.S. and Europe in the quarter. 
We grew our Software revenue for the full year despite some deferred business at year-end as a result of strong global demand for our communications management software solutions. Our Mail Services employees did a remarkable job recovering from the fire in the beginning of the year that destroyed our largest mail presorting site that was located in Dallas, Texas. In less than 9 months, we located and outfitted a new site and resumed revenue growth in our presort business in the fourth quarter. We are now positioned to continue the profitable growth trend in our presort business that we experienced before the fire. 
We had outstanding free cash flow for the quarter of $215 million, and we generated $1.03 billion of free cash flow for the year. We are pleased to note that because of our sound capital structure, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend for the 30th consecutive year. As we reported last week, the dividend for the first quarter of 2012 is $0.375 per common share. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our fourth quarter and our full year financial results."
297018,146292008,219042,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2012",2012-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray.

Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 6.5% when compared with the prior year. Currency this quarter had no impact on revenue. As Murray noted, revenue was adversely impacted this quarter by lower SMB sales and some deferred enterprise deals, especially in Production Mail and Software, as well as continued economic uncertainty. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 8%. Outside the U.S., revenue declined by 2% versus the prior year. Non-U.S. operations now represent 33% of our total revenue. 
Turning to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes. Adjusted EBIT was $239 million for the quarter. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17.8%, which was a decrease of 20 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was affected this quarter by our planned investment in Volly. Excluding our investment in Volly, EBIT margin would have been 40 basis points higher and would have improved 20 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted EBIT was also impacted by the decline in our Software revenue this quarter, as well as the anticipated decline in our rentals and finance revenue streams. Favorable margins in Mail Services, International Mailing and Marketing Services were somewhat offset by the margin impact in Software and rental financing and supply streams in North America. 
SG&A in the quarter declined by more than $20 million when compared with the prior year. SG&A continues to benefit from our ongoing productivity initiatives. 
On a segment basis, EBIT margins this quarter improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments. Both of our SMB segment businesses improved their year-over-year EBIT margins for the fourth consecutive quarter, and our Mail Services and Marketing Services businesses also had improving EBIT margins. Production Mail, excluding the Volly investment, is the fifth segment to have a higher year-over-year EBIT margin. These improvements are primarily a result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all of our businesses.
We continue to reap the benefits of the Strategic Transformation actions that we have taken since the second half of 2009. We've implemented actions that are enabling us to improve the way we go to market, interact with our customers and develop new products. We will continue to put in place new processes and systems that will make our operations more streamlined and our costs more variable, allowing us to continue to improve profitability by better leveraging future revenue growth. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $306 million or $1.53 a share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was $49 million, a modest decrease of $2 million when compared with prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.61%, which was 5 basis points lower than the prior year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was actually a benefit of 5.4% versus an effective tax rate of 33% last year. The change in the tax rate this quarter was a result of reaching an agreement with the IRS on tax matters that related to years 2005 through 2008, and we included some other tax matters for the years 2001 through 2007. As a result, during the quarter, we realized an income tax benefit of $74 million in continuing operations. Excluding the impact of the tax settlement with the IRS, our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been 33.6% for the quarter. 
Now let's turn to our earnings per share, which had a lot of different factors impacting it this quarter. And therefore, it might be helpful if you refer to the reconciliation table we have on Page 3 of our earnings release.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.97. If we look at our earnings on an underlying operational basis, consistent with our annual guidance presentation, you would include the tax benefit of $0.37 I noted earlier. On this basis, adjusted earnings per share this quarter was $0.61, which is comparable to the $0.66 we earned last year. As I noted earlier, adjusted earnings per share includes costs of about $0.02 per share this quarter for the planned investment in Volly. GAAP earnings per share -- per diluted share for the quarter quadrupled versus the prior year to $1.28. 
There are 3 specific items causing the difference between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings this quarter. First, we incurred restructuring charges and asset impairments that totaled $0.31 per share. For the $0.31, $0.28 per share represents restructuring charges related to our Strategic Transformation program. Asset impairments of $0.03 per share relate to a facility exit and an impairment of intangible assets associated with the international operations of Pitney Bowes Management Services. 
Second, GAAP earnings per diluted share include a $0.41-per-share noncash goodwill impairment charge related to the international operations of Pitney Bowes Management Services. The impairment reflects weaker-than-expected growth, changing print demand and a weaker economic outlook for European markets. 
Third, GAAP earnings per share for the quarter included a net benefit of $1.04 in discontinued operations due to resolution of tax issues primarily related to our former Capital Services business. While these adjustments to earnings are significant, they have resulted in a more streamlined and flexible business model and lower risks and uncertainties on our balance sheet. 
In our third quarter 2011 announcement, we provided earnings guidance for 2011 on an adjusted basis in a range of $2.30 to $2.35. This included the $0.08-per-share tax benefit recognized in the third quarter. On that same basis, our adjusted earnings per share for the full year of 2011 was $2.34. 
As Murray noted, free cash flow was $215 million for the quarter and was $1.03 billion for the year. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow for the year benefited from higher net income and our U.S. tax settlement, which positively impacted cash flow by about $100 million. 
During the quarter, we returned $74 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and made $29 million of payments related to our restructuring program. For the year, we returned $300 million in cash to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, and we also repurchased $100 million of common stock. Additionally, we made a $123 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan, paid $107 million in restructuring payments and reduced our debt by $50 million. We did not purchase common stock this quarter.
As of the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding, and we have no term debt coming due until October of this year. About 76% of our total debt is fixed rate, and 24% is floating rate. 
Let me now update you on our Strategic Transformation program. In the fourth quarter, we identified and began implementing a number of new initiatives that we will complete in 2012. During the fourth quarter, the pretax restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our Strategic Transformation program were approximately $79 million, principally for severance and other exit costs. During the quarter, approximately 700 positions were eliminated across the company as we continued to create efficiencies, automate processes and outsource noncore functions. Since the beginning of the program, we've reduced the workforce by approximately 14%. 
Our pretax charges this year related to the Strategic Transformation program were about $132 million or about $0.46 per share. This exceeded our original guidance of $0.25 to $0.35 per share as we were successful in identifying additional opportunities to streamline our operations and reduce costs. Therefore, we now estimate the run rate of net savings associated with our Strategic Transformation program will be in excess of $300 million.
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance and will have some closing comments."

We expect 2012 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of plus or minus 2% in growth. Our outlook anticipates improving revenue trends versus last year due in part to a number of initiatives designed to drive new growth opportunities. The guidance reflects a postal and economic environment that is not expected to improve nor deteriorate significantly over the next 12 months. We anticipate gradual improvement in our SMB equipment sales in 2012, driven primarily by the positive outlet for sales of the Connect+  digital marketing system on a global basis, which will also result in fewer lease extensions by customers. We have previously discussed how lower equipment sales in prior periods affect financing, rentals and supplies revenue streams. As a result, we expect declines in recurring revenue streams but at a moderating rate as equipment sales improve. 
In 2012, we expect growth across our Enterprise businesses as well. We anticipate continued growth in Software revenue due to increasing global demand for customer communications management software solutions, such as those that manage data, target prospects and use location to make offers more relevant. We also expect increased placements of IntelliJet color printing systems in Production Mail, continued expansion in Mail Services and benefits from a focus on legal, commercial and government sectors in our Management Services business. 
Based on our revenue expectations, our 2012 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $2.05 to $2.25. Included in these earnings expectations are higher costs associated with our pension and benefit plans, increased investment in Volly and a mix shift resulting from faster growing, yet relatively lower, margin Enterprise businesses. We expect to generate free cash flow for 2012 in the range of $700 million to $800 million. We expect free cash flow will be lower in 2012 than in 2011 since we anticipate investing more cash in finance receivables because of higher levels of equipment sales. We also do not anticipate the level of tax refunds that we received in 2011. 
For over 90 years, we have helped our customers reduce their costs and increase their efficiency of using mail to connect with their customers. Over the last few years, the way businesses and customers communicate has changed, and so have we. We have enhanced our operating efficiencies, added variability to our cost structure and expanded our digital, hybrid and software offerings. We believe there are tremendous opportunities ahead to enrich the value of both physical and digital communications.
In 2011, we continued to make progress in positioning ourselves to help our customer use physical, digital and hybrid communications to connect with their customers. We will continue to innovate and invest to expand our capabilities to help our customers provide their customers with the offers they want, when they want it through the channel of their choice. 
Our competitive advantage lies in our knowledge and expertise of physical communications in conjunction with our growing digital and software capabilities. There are exciting things ahead in 2012 and beyond, and we are committed to making them happen. 
Now we'll be happy to answer your questions."

First of all, what we're seeing is we've seen Europe or international now run positive for the last 3 quarters. And we expect to see the rate of that -- of decline we experienced this year to decline in 2012. Now that will happen due to a number of things. First, the Connect+ product. That continues to expand around the world, and we continue to place that here in the U.S. We will see that affect our lease renewal business by having less lease extensions. And as we've described before, a lease extension gets about 70% of the revenue that we get from a lease upgrade. So as that continues to roll out, we expect to see that benefit. Then, in addition to that, they continued to roll out of our digital services around our existing meter base will also be a positive in expanding our reach into the meter base itself. At the same time, with Connect+, as you're aware, it uses color and, therefore, ink will begin to become a better part of the growth going forward. So I think those are the general items. Also, inside of international, we've seen Canada now move to a net positive. So units are actually growing again. So as we look at the different parts of the world and where they are in the economic environment, the U.S. is trailing some of the areas and slightly ahead of a few. But generally, we expect to see that move in a positive direction."

So you have to look at that on a year-over-year basis in terms of its impact on that line, all in. But to your point, the equipment sales is the starting point of the building of the asset base and the finance receivable base, which drives financing income. And obviously, the placement of rental supplies, as Murray said. The high end with color is going to be an opportunity for greater supply streams. So it is sort of a leading indicator for the future growth of those or improvement in those trends."

So we anticipate that, that's going to be a positive contributor going forward.

But we put a focus in that business around 3 key verticals, and we're beginning to see some of the benefits of the actions that they've taken there. The aberrations in the fourth quarter from trend were around the Software business, which we saw a good strong growth through the first 3 quarters. In fact, for the full year, they were up 9% in revenue. We saw some delays of accounts at the end of the year and, I think, timing on some things. We would expect that to be a growth contributor in 2012. So versus the fourth quarter, more in line with what they had seen over the course of the full year of 2011, certainly in the first 3 quarters of 2011. In terms of the mailing business, I think we touched on that in terms of, obviously, Connect+ is an important product for us. As well as, Murray mentioned there's a number of digital products that have been launched over the course of 2011, and we're beginning to see some uptake on that. But they're recurring revenue-type products and low dollar value per unit which you build over time, not unlike what we did in the small and meter base. So we would look for that to contribute over a period of time."

Also, Shannon, DMT, which we also saw light in the fourth quarter, we saw significant delays, particularly in the financial sector in the U.S. So that is -- as you're aware, that business tends to be a little lumpier and is a little more financially sensitive depending on what is happening in the markets. But as we've said before, those deals are usually timing related rather than whether they exist or not. And it isn't that any of those deals were really lost. There's really just timing. And as we expressed in prior periods, they tend to bounce back fairly well. In Europe, our written business actually was up in the DMT space versus softer in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. So we'd expect to start to see that becoming more like it historically has been as we get through 2012."

What we've been focused on, Shannon, is the signing of billers, and then the next phase is the implementation of those billers so that their data can move forward. Because as we looked at the research, and this is why we've held back from going to the consumers with the product, is if a consumer gets a product and there's no content, it is not considered valuable. And then when content appears, it's actually a negative and you have to resell it. So we are continuing to hold back until we get the content from the billers. We have announced earlier in the week that we are over 40 billers that we have signed. They have over 5,000 billers inside of those 40. So we need to now place the technology into those 40 sites. Those 40 sites now need to work with their 5,000 to get the feeds in. So we'll have one central feed from each of those sites, but we need to connect all of the others. We would expect that somewhere in the midyear to third quarter, those connectors would be in place, along with the additions that we're expecting to -- we're going to continue to grow that over the next 6 months, but we already -- if all of those were connected, that is already in the billions of pieces that could be moved digitally. So that is our drive, is to get the connectivity there, get the pipes in place and then be able to go live later in the year and consumers be able to get actual data when they turn the system on. So our investment will continue in building out the pipes, et cetera, and you really won't see us going to marketing until we are close to the launch date."

So pension is probably in the range of $0.04 to $0.05, and the Volly investment could be a broader range than that. It could be from $0.03 to $0.07, in that range, potentially. And that really goes back to Shannon's question of the timing of when we go to the market, how much marketing spend against that. So we've sort of planned for a wider range there until we see exactly how we go to market. But the biggest variable on that would be marketing expense. So that puts you at more or less a push, and the other drivers in there are, obviously, we anticipate faster growth in the Enterprise businesses than the SMB business, which has, on average, a lower-margin profile.

And they range anywhere from sales automation to service force dispatch on -- in real time. And a number of other infrastructure systems around IT, facilities, reductions and all that have given us a lot more flexibility in the business and enabled us to move resources from slower-growth businesses to higher-growth businesses and gain some efficiencies in things around product management and product development, around product hierarchy.

I'll start by sharing some thoughts on our business, Mike will follow with details on first quarter results and then I'll discuss our outlook for 2012. After that, we'll take your questions. 
Our financial results and business developments during the quarter pointed to the progress that we're making against our long-term goals as well as some near-term stabilization and parts of our business. The benefits from our previous actions to improve productivity and reduce costs enabled us to increase our EBIT margins in 4 of our 7 business segments, which in turn enabled us to grow our overall EBIT despite a decline in revenue. Although the total revenue was down during the quarter, we did also have growth on a constant-currency basis in 4 of our 7 business segments. Additionally, there were several other positive factors in our SMB business. 
We had improving trends for equipment sales and this was led by our Connect+ digital mailing system, in lieu of lease extensions and improved customer retention rates. We also continue to move forward with long-term strategies to enhance value. During the quarter, we reached several key milestones in the areas of Software and digital solutions that marked our progress in expanding our value proposition beyond physical mail. 
We were please to note that at the end of the quarter, we signed a multi-year agreement with Facebook to offer our global geocoding, reverse geocoding and other location intelligence applications and data for integration into Facebook's applications and services. Our best-of-breed technology will provide Facebook developers and ultimately their users, high-performance, high precision, location processing across desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile platforms. This is a great example of the kinds of solutions we are developing to help our customers deliver more personalized, relevant communications to their customers. 
Our Volly secure digital mail delivery platform and our SMB customer communication solutions are other examples of the solutions where we are increasing investment and are deploying to help customers of all sizes manage their communications in a changing communication environment. Earlier this quarter, we announced a partnership in which Australia Post will become the first national post to incorporate Volly into its digital offerings. 
Australia Post delivers more than 5 billion pieces of mail annually to more than 10 million households. The service will launch later this year. We're continuing to invest in Volly in the U.S. as we move forward towards our initial consumer launch in the fourth quarter. The phase global rollout of our Connect+ product line will continue throughout the year. We launched Connect+ in Germany at the end of the first quarter and are planning a third quarter launch in France. 
This month, we'll launch a small business cloud-connected metering solution to Web-enable more of our mailing customer base. We're also partnering to integrate and expand our global e-commerce capabilities. As a result, we've decided to increase our investments in the second quarter to bring this new solutions to market more quickly, to take advantage of emerging and growing opportunities. To take advantage of these incremental investment opportunities, we're expanding on our productivity initiatives. We believe that these actions will enable us to accelerate investments for growth while delivering expected adjusted earnings within our annual guidance range. 
Now let me turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our first quarter financial results."
297018,204748959,299744,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 07, 2012",2012-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 4% excluding the impact of currency. As Murray noted on a constant-currency basis, revenue benefited from growth in 4 of our 7 business segments, which includes International Ma",1012,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 4% excluding the impact of currency. As Murray noted on a constant-currency basis, revenue benefited from growth in 4 of our 7 business segments, which includes International Mailing, Software, Mail Services and marketing services. Whoever while SMB equipment sales comparisons improved year-over-year. There continue to be declines in the SMB recording revenue streams. Also revenue is adversely impacted by weakness in the Production Mail and Management Services businesses. 
I want to note that there was also a onetime $10 million reduction in revenue this quarter due to an adjustment to our deferred revenue accrual. Excluding this adjustment, rental revenue declined 6% year-over-year and financing revenue declined less than 8%. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by 4%. Outside the U.S., revenue declined by about 7% on a reported basis and about 5% excluding the impact of currency. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of our total revenue. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes was $211 million this quarter and excludes the impact from the sale of leveraged leased assets in Canada. The adjusted EBIT margin this quarter was 16.8%, which was an increase of 90 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin benefited from favorable margin trends in a maturity of our business segments this quarter. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses declined more than $15 million when compared with the prior year. SG&A continues to benefit from previous non-going productivity initiatives as well as improved credit experience. On a segment basis, EBIT margins this quarter improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments. The North America Mailing segment improved its year-over-year EBIT margin for the seventh consecutive quarter, and our Software Mail Services and Marketing Services segments also had improved in EBIT margins. These improvements are primarily result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all our businesses and the benefits we're realizing from our previous Strategic Transformation initiatives. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $276 million or $1.37 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $49 million, a decrease of about $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.71%, which was 10 basis points lower than last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 19.4% versus an effective tax rate of 29.9% last year. The lower tax rate this quarter was primarily due to the resolution of additional tax matters with the IRS related to years 2005 through 2008. 
As a result, during the quarter, we realized a net tax benefit of about $22 million in continuing operations or $0.11 per share. Excluding the net impact of the usual tax adjustments, our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been about 33% this quarter. 
Now let's turn to our adjusted earnings per diluted share, which includes the $0.11 per share tax benefit I just noted. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.63. However, on an underlying operational basis, consistent with our annual guidance, you would exclude the $0.11 per share tax benefit. On this basis, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.52, which is comparable to the $0.53 we earned last year. 
GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 87% versus the prior year to $0.79. There are 2 specific items causing the difference between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings this quarter. First, GAAP earnings per diluted share included a net benefit of $0.06 per share related to the sale of leveraged leased assets in Canada. Second, we resolved additional tax matters with the IRS related to our formal capital services business. This resulted in a $0.10 per share, net tax benefit in discontinued operations in the quarter. 
Now let me update you on our cash flow and capital structure. Free cash flow for the quarter was $211 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow was impacted by higher working capital requirements due to timing of disbursements, higher CapEx investment and less of a benefit from finance receivables. During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and made $26 million of payments related to our restructuring program. We also made voluntary contributions of $85 million to our U.S. pension fund and $10 million to our Canadian pension fund. As a result, we estimate our U.S. pension plan is now about 95% funded and our Canadian pension plan is about 85% funded. 
As a reminder, both our U.S. and Canadian pension plans will be frozen as of the end of 2014. We are changing our investment strategy and managing our pension asset mix to reduce the volatility of future pension expense from cash contribution requirements. This is part of our overall strategy to better match the value of our assets to our liabilities. We do not purchase any shares of our common stock this quarter. 
As of the end of the quarter, we had $178 million of commercial paper outstanding primarily as a result of retiring $150 million of our term debt during the quarter. So our expectation that we will pay down a portion of this commercial paper balance during the year. We have $400 million of additional debt scheduled to mature in October. We're currently evaluating our alternatives on how best to manage our debt portfolio including refinancing through new term debt, commercial paper, cash or a combination of these 3 options. At the end of the quarter, about 76% of our total debt was fixed-rate and 24% was floating-rate. In April, we also renewed our bank line of credit for $1 billion for a term of 4 years. This line of credit supports our commercial paper program. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance and we'll have some closing comments."

This includes the $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and a $0.06 per share benefit from the sale of leveraged leased assets in Canada. Excluding these 2 items, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for 2012 are expected to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.25. 
We still expect revenue excluding the impacts of currency to be in the range of 2% growth to a decline of 2% as compared to 2011. We also still expect free cash flow to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Keep in mind that all of our guidance reflects a postal and an economic environment that is not expected to improve nor deteriorate significantly for the rest of the calendar year. Our growth strategies are based on continuing to increase the value of our core mailing offerings while developing a range of offerings that help our customers manage across physical, digital and hybrid communications channels. During the quarter, we made progress on both fronts and we are excited about the opportunities ahead to do even more.

I'll start by sharing some thoughts on our business. Mike will follow with details on our first quarter results. And then I'll discuss our outlook for 2012. After that, we'll take your questions. 
Our financial results and business developments during the quarter point to the progress that we're making against our long-term goals as well as some near-term stabilization in parts of our business. The benefits from our previous actions to improve productivity and reduce costs enabled us to increase our EBIT margins in 4 of our 7 business segments, which in turn enabled us to grow our overall EBIT despite a decline in revenue. 
Although the total revenue was down during the quarter, we did also have growth on a constant-currency basis in 4 of our 7 business segments. Additionally, there were several other positive factors in our SMB business. 
We had improving trends for equipment sales, and this was led by our Connect+ digital mailing system, in lieu of lease extensions and improved customer retention rates. We also continue to move forward with our long-term strategies to enhance value. 
During the quarter, we reached several key milestones in the areas of software and digital solutions that marked our progress in expanding our value proposition beyond physical mail. 
We're pleased to note that at the end of the quarter, we signed a multi-year agreement with Facebook to offer global geocoding, reverse geocoding and other location intelligence applications and data for integration into Facebook's applications and services. Our best-of-breed technology will provide Facebook developers and ultimately their users high-performance, high-precision location processing across desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile platforms. This is a great example of the kinds of solutions we are developing to help our customers deliver more personalized, relevant communications to their customers. 
Our Volly secure digital mail delivery platform and our SMB customer communication solutions are other examples of the solutions where we are increasing investment and are deploying to help customers of all sizes manage their communications in a changing communication environment. Earlier this quarter, we announced a partnership in which Australia Post will become the first national post to incorporate Volly into its digital offerings. Australia Post delivers more than 5 billion pieces of mail annually to more than 10 million households. The service will launch later this year. 
We're continuing to invest in Volly in the U.S. as we move forward toward an initial consumer launch in the fourth quarter. The phase global rollout of our Connect+ product line will continue throughout the year. We launched Connect+ in Germany at the end of the first quarter and are planning a third quarter launch in France. 
This month, we'll launch a small business cloud-connected metering solution to Web-enable more of our mailing customer base. We're also partnering to integrate and expand our global e-commerce capabilities. As a result, we've decided to increase our investments in the second quarter to bring this new solutions to market more quickly to take advantage of emerging and growing opportunities. To take advantage of these incremental investment opportunities, we're expanding on our productivity initiatives. We believe that these actions will enable us to accelerate investments for growth while delivering expected adjusted earnings within our annual guidance range. 
Now let me turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our first quarter financial results."
297018,204748959,299857,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 07, 2012",2012-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 4% excluding the impact of currency. As Murray noted on a constant-currency basis, revenue benefited from growth in 4 of our 7 business segments, which includes International Ma",1013,"Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 4% excluding the impact of currency. As Murray noted on a constant-currency basis, revenue benefited from growth in 4 of our 7 business segments, which includes International Mailing, Software, Mail Services and Marketing Services. However, while SMB equipment sales comparisons improved year-over-year, there continued to be declines in the SMB recording revenue streams. Also revenue was adversely impacted by weakness in the Production Mail and Management Services businesses. 
I want to note that there was also a one-time $10 million reduction in revenue this quarter due to an adjustment to a deferred revenue accrual. Excluding this adjustment, rental revenue declined 6% year-over-year and financing revenue declined less than 8%. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by 4%. Outside the U.S., revenue declined by about 7% on a reported basis and about 5% excluding the impact of currency. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of our total revenue. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes was $211 million this quarter and excludes the impact from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada. The adjusted EBIT margin this quarter was 16.8%, which was an increase of 90 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin benefited from favorable margin trends in a majority of our business segments this quarter. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses, it declined by more than $15 million when compared with the prior year. SG&A continues to benefit from previous non-going productivity initiatives as well as improved credit experience. On a segment basis, EBIT margins this quarter improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments. The North American Mailing segment improved its year-over-year EBIT margin for the seventh consecutive quarter, and our Software, Mail Services and Marketing Services segments also had improving EBIT margins. These improvements are primarily result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all our businesses and the benefits we're realizing from our previous Strategic Transformation initiatives. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $276 million, or $1.37 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was $49 million, a decrease of about $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.71%, which was 10 basis points lower than last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 19.4% versus an effective tax rate of 29.9% last year. The lower tax rate this quarter was primarily due to the resolution of additional tax matters with the IRS related to years 2005 through 2008. 
As a result, during the quarter, we realized a net tax benefit of about $22 million in continuing operations, or $0.11 per share. Excluding the net impact of the unusual tax adjustments, our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been about 33% this quarter.
Now let's turn to our adjusted earnings per diluted share, which includes the $0.11 per share tax benefit I just noted. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.63. However, on an underlying operational basis, consistent with our annual guidance, you would exclude the $0.11 per share tax benefit. On this basis, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.52, which is comparable to the $0.53 we earned last year. 
GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 87% versus the prior year to $0.79. There are 2 specific items causing the difference between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings this quarter. First, GAAP earnings per diluted share included a net benefit of $0.06 per share related to the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada. Second, we resolved additional tax matters with the IRS related to our formal capital services business. This resulted in a $0.10 per share net tax benefit in discontinued operations in the quarter. 
Now let me update you on our cash flow and capital structure. Free cash flow for the quarter was $211 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow was impacted by higher working capital requirements due to timing of disbursements, higher CapEx investment and less of a benefit from finance receivables. During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and made $26 million of payments related to our restructuring program. We also made voluntary contributions of $85 million to our U.S. pension fund and $10 million to our Canadian pension fund. As a result, we estimate our U.S. pension plan is now about 95% funded and our Canadian pension plan is about 85% funded. 
As a reminder, both our U.S. and Canadian pension plans will be frozen as of the end of 2014. We are changing our investment strategy and managing our pension asset mix to reduce the volatility of future pension expense from cash contribution requirements. This is part of our overall strategy to better match the value of our assets to our liabilities. We do not purchase any shares of our common stock this quarter. 
As of the end of the quarter, we had $178 million of commercial paper outstanding primarily as a result of retiring $150 million of our term debt during the quarter. It's our expectation that we will pay down a portion of this commercial paper balance during the year. We have $400 million of additional debt scheduled to mature in October. We're currently evaluating our alternatives on how best to manage our debt portfolio including refinancing through new term debt, commercial paper, cash or a combination of these 3 options. At the end of the quarter, about 76% of our total debt was fixed-rate and 24% was floating-rate. In April, we also renewed our bank line of credit for $1 billion for a term of 4 years. This line of credit supports our commercial paper program. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance, and we'll have some closing comments."

We're updating our 2012 annual guidance for GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to reflect the net tax benefits realized in the first quarter and the net benefit from the first quarter sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada. 
We now expect to GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.42. This includes $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and a $0.06 per share benefit from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada. Excluding these 2 items, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for 2012 are expected to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.25. 
We still expect revenue excluding the impacts of currency to be in the range of 2% growth to a decline of 2% as compared to 2011. We also still expect free cash flow to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Keep in mind that all of our guidance reflects a postal and an economic environment that is not expected to improve nor deteriorate significantly for the rest of the calendar year. Our growth strategies are based on continuing to increase the value of our core mailing offerings while developing a range of offerings that help our customers manage across physical, digital and hybrid communications channels. During the quarter, we made progress on both fronts, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead to do even more.

I'll start by sharing some thoughts on our business. Mike will follow with details on our first quarter results. And then I'll discuss our outlook for 2012. After that, we'll take your questions. 
Our financial results and business developments during the quarter point to the progress that we're making against our long-term goals as well as some near-term stabilization in parts of our business. The benefits from our previous actions to improve productivity and reduce costs enabled us to increase our EBIT margins in 4 of our 7 business segments, which in turn enabled us to grow our overall EBIT despite a decline in revenue. 
Although the total revenue was down during the quarter, we did also have growth on a constant-currency basis in 4 of our 7 business segments. Additionally, there were several other positive factors in our SMB business. 
We had improving trends for equipment sales, and this was led by our Connect+ digital mailing system, in lieu of lease extensions and improved customer retention rates. We also continue to move forward with our long-term strategies to enhance value. 
During the quarter, we reached several key milestones in the areas of software and digital solutions that marked our progress in expanding our value proposition beyond physical mail. 
We're pleased to note that at the end of the quarter, we signed a multi-year agreement with Facebook to offer global geocoding, reverse geocoding and other location intelligence applications and data for integration into Facebook's applications and services. Our best-of-breed technology will provide Facebook developers and ultimately their users high-performance, high-precision location processing across desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile platforms. This is a great example of the kinds of solutions we are developing to help our customers deliver more personalized, relevant communications to their customers. 
Our Volly secure digital mail delivery platform and our SMB customer communication solutions are other examples of the solutions where we are increasing investment and are deploying to help customers of all sizes manage their communications in a changing communication environment. Earlier this quarter, we announced a partnership in which Australia Post will become the first national post to incorporate Volly into its digital offerings. Australia Post delivers more than 5 billion pieces of mail annually to more than 10 million households. The service will launch later this year. 
We're continuing to invest in Volly in the U.S. as we move forward toward an initial consumer launch in the fourth quarter. The phased global rollout of our Connect+ product line will continue throughout the year. We launched Connect+ in Germany at the end of the first quarter and are planning a third quarter launch in France. 
This month, we'll launch a small business cloud-connected metering solution to Web-enable more of our mailing customer base. We're also partnering to integrate and expand our global e-commerce capabilities. As a result, we've decided to increase our investments in the second quarter to bring these new solutions to market more quickly to take advantage of emerging and growing opportunities. To take advantage of these incremental investment opportunities, we're expanding upon our productivity initiatives. We believe that these actions will enable us to accelerate investments for growth while delivering expected adjusted earnings within our annual guidance range. 
Now let me turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our first quarter financial results."
297018,204748959,299951,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 07, 2012",2012-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 4% excluding the impact of currency.

Our revenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a decline of 4% excluding the impact of currency. As Murray noted on a constant-currency basis, revenue benefited from growth in 4 of our 7 business segments, which includes International Mailing, Software, Mail Services and Marketing Services. However, while SMB equipment sales comparisons improved year-over-year, there continued to be declines in the SMB recording revenue streams. Also revenue was adversely impacted by weakness in the Production Mail and Management Services businesses. 
I want to note that there was also a one-time $10 million reduction in revenue this quarter due to an adjustment to a deferred revenue accrual. Excluding this adjustment, rental revenue declined 6% year-over-year and financing revenue declined less than 8%. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by 4%. Outside the U.S., revenue declined by about 7% on a reported basis and about 5% excluding the impact of currency. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of our total revenue. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes was $211 million this quarter and excludes the impact from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada. The adjusted EBIT margin this quarter was 16.8%, which was an increase of 90 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin benefited from favorable margin trends in a majority of our business segments this quarter. 
Turning to selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses, it declined by more than $15 million when compared with the prior year. SG&A continues to benefit from previous non-going productivity initiatives as well as improved credit experience. On a segment basis, EBIT margins this quarter improved year-over-year in 4 of our 7 business segments. The North American Mailing segment improved its year-over-year EBIT margin for the seventh consecutive quarter, and our Software, Mail Services and Marketing Services segments also had improving EBIT margins. These improvements are primarily a result of our continued focus on increasing our operating efficiency across all our businesses and the benefits we're realizing from our previous Strategic Transformation initiatives. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $276 million, or $1.37 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was $49 million, a decrease of about $2 million when compared with the prior year. The average interest rate in the quarter was 4.71%, which was 10 basis points lower than last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter on adjusted earnings was 19.4% versus an effective tax rate of 29.9% last year. The lower tax rate this quarter was primarily due to the resolution of additional tax matters with the IRS related to years 2005 through 2008. 
As a result, during the quarter, we realized a net tax benefit of about $22 million in continuing operations, or $0.11 per share. Excluding the net impact of the unusual tax adjustments, our tax rate on adjusted earnings from continuing operations would have been about 33% this quarter.
Now let's turn to our adjusted earnings per diluted share, which includes the $0.11 per share tax benefit I just noted. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.63. However, on an underlying operational basis, consistent with our annual guidance, you would exclude the $0.11 per share tax benefit. On this basis, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.52, which is comparable to the $0.53 we earned last year. 
GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 87% versus the prior year to $0.79. There are 2 specific items causing the difference between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings this quarter. First, GAAP earnings per diluted share included a net benefit of $0.06 per share related to the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada. Second, we resolved additional tax matters with the IRS related to our formal capital services business. This resulted in a $0.10 per share net tax benefit in discontinued operations in the quarter. 
Now let me update you on our cash flow and capital structure. Free cash flow for the quarter was $211 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow was impacted by higher working capital requirements due to timing of disbursements, higher CapEx investment and less of a benefit from finance receivables. During the quarter, we returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and made $26 million of payments related to our restructuring program. We also made voluntary contributions of $85 million to our U.S. pension fund and $10 million to our Canadian pension fund. As a result, we estimate our U.S. pension plan is now about 95% funded and our Canadian pension plan is about 85% funded. 
As a reminder, both our U.S. and Canadian pension plans will be frozen as of the end of 2014. We are changing our investment strategy and managing our pension asset mix to reduce the volatility of future pension expense from cash contribution requirements. This is part of our overall strategy to better match the value of our assets to our liabilities. We did not purchase any shares of our common stock this quarter. 
As of the end of the quarter, we had $178 million of commercial paper outstanding, primarily as a result of retiring $150 million of our term debt during the quarter. It's our expectation that we will pay down a portion of this commercial paper balance during the year. We have $400 million of additional debt scheduled to mature in October. We're currently evaluating our alternatives on how best to manage our debt portfolio including refinancing through new term debt, commercial paper, cash or a combination of these 3 options. At the end of the quarter, about 76% of our total debt was fixed-rate and 24% was floating-rate. In April, we also renewed our bank line of credit for $1 billion for a term of 4 years. This line of credit supports our commercial paper program. 
So that concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance, and we'll have some closing comments."

We're updating our 2012 annual guidance for GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to reflect the net tax benefits realized in the first quarter and the net benefit from the first quarter sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada. 
We now expect to GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.42. This includes $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and a $0.06 per share benefit from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada. Excluding these 2 items, adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for 2012 are expected to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.25. 
We still expect revenue excluding the impacts of currency to be in the range of 2% growth to a decline of 2% as compared to 2011. We also still expect free cash flow to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Keep in mind that all of our guidance reflects a postal and an economic environment that is not expected to improve nor deteriorate significantly for the rest of the calendar year. Our growth strategies are based on continuing to increase the value of our core mailing offerings while developing a range of offerings that help our customers manage across physical, digital and hybrid communications channels. During the quarter, we made progress on both fronts, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead to do even more.

The other is particularly at the high end of the marketplace, we focused on placing more new equipment. In fact our lease extensions are down about a quarter versus the prior year, about 25% versus the prior year. And we've seen increased placement of the Connect+ new machines.

After the pres",612,"Thanks, Charlie. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. I'll start by putting our overall performance this quarter into context, Mike will follow with the details on our second quarter results and then I'll discuss our outlook for 2012. After the presentation, we'll take your questions. 
For the last 2 years, we've been on a journey to deliver long-term customer and shareholder value year. We are fundamentally transforming our business processes, reducing our cost structure and diversifying our range of offerings beyond the physical mail. During the quarter, we continue to make progress against these long-term goals. We also continue to see favorable trends in parts of our business despite ongoing economic uncertainty and fluctuations in currency. Although total revenue decline during the quarter, there was growth on  a constant-currency basis in 3 of our 7 business segments and in 2 of the remaining segments the rate of revenue decline has moderated. 
There are drivers particularly in the Enterprise group that we anticipate will moderate year-over-year revenue declines in the second half of the year as compared with the first half of the year. These drivers include, expansion of e-commerce and direct mail opportunities in Mail Services, new print outsourcing services provided by management services and increased backlog of equipment orders for Production Mail. 
In the quarter, we signed a strategic partnership with ORION Holdings to provide print management services that create substantial cost savings and increased value for the global network of Interpublic companies, groups, agencies and clients. We will provide a platform that supports ORION printing worldwide, which includes project management, global network of selected printers, print outsourcing expertise and technology that provides visibility tracking and accountability to each project. 
Our Volly secure digital mail delivery service continues to add capabilities and partnerships, which we believe will enhance its successful adoption when it launches. 
During the quarter, we announced the first partner who will be part of our payment system. The Prophet Stars division of Jack Henry and Associates will enable free one click bill payments for consumers in Volly. We believe pre-bill payment on-site is a critical consumer requirement and we are pleased to be offering it to our Volly users. 
We also reached an agreement with SafeNet Inc. to enhance the security of digital mail delivery in the cloud. Additionally, we have now signed more than 50 large third-party mail service providers who will offer the Volly secure digital mail service to more than 6,000 customer companies and the consumer brands. 
The positive signs that we noted in our SMB business in the first quarter continued this quarter as well. This was led by improved customer retention rates and increased placements of the Connect+ digital mailing systems globally. During the quarter, we launched Connect+ in Germany and it was approved for placement in France beginning in the third quarter. 
In the U.S., we also launched the innovative mail station 2 with pbWeb Connect. It is the world's first cloud-based mailing and shipping system that gives customers the ability to manage mail and packages via the postage meter or online. Customers can also gain access to special USPS discounts, not typically available through standard metering systems. In addition, to Gateway access to a range of applications including the full pbSmart suite of digital solutions. pbWeb Connect is already earning high marks from early adopters, for the convenience, discounts and the online access that it provides. 
We continue to generate strong free cash flow during the quarter and we also strengthened our balance sheet through the early redemption of $400 million of debt. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our second quarter financial results."

Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, which was a decline of 3% on a constant-currency basis, and an improvement versus the first quarter decline of 4.4%. Currency had a negative impact of approximately 2% this quarter, as a result revenue declined 5% versus prior year on a reported basis. 
The company experienced continued growth in its Software in Mail Services segments when the impacts of currency are excluded. In the SMB Solutions Group, International Mailing had its third consecutive quarter of revenue growth when you exclude the impacts of currency, however, there continued to be declines in the North American SMB revenue streams. 
While revenue was also adversely impacted by weakness in the Production Mail and Management Services segments due to lower global economic activity, both segments had improving revenue comparisons against the prior quarter on a constant currency basis. 
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 3%. Outside the U.S., revenue also declined by about 3% on a constant-currency basis. Including the 7% adverse impact of currency, revenue declined about 10% outside the U.S. on a reported basis. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of total revenue. 
Turning to our earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT. It was $205 million this quarter, the EBIT margin was 16.5%, which was an increase of 70 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin continues to benefit from ongoing improvements in our operating efficiencies across the business as a result of our Strategic Transformation initiatives. Our EBIT margin also include the impacted investments in new products and services. We expect these investments will accelerate as we approach the launch of our Volly product and continue to invest in new e-commerce opportunities. 
On a segment basis, EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 3 of our 7 business segments. The North American mailing segment improved its year-over-year EBIT margin for the eighth consecutive quarter. Our Mail Services and Marketing Services segments also had continued improvement in their EBIT margins. 
Our selling, general and administrative expenses continued to improve with a decline of more than $41 million in the second quarter when compared with the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 31.4% this quarter versus 32.9% in the prior year, an improvement of 150 basis points. SG&A continues to benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives and good credit experience as well as lower benefit cost for this quarter. When we add back depreciation and amortization to our EBIT, EBITDA for the quarter was $273 million or $1.36 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $49 million, which was relatively flat to the prior year. The average interest rate was 4.87% for the quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.4% versus an effective tax rate of 33.3% last year. The tax rate is in line with the 32% to 35% expected rate for the year. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.50 compared to $0.49 last year. Earnings per share this quarter included a reduction of $0.03 per cost related to debt management, which included net cost associated with our decision to redeem $400 million of our bonds that were originally scheduled to mature in October. Excluding these costs, earnings per diluted share this quarter were $0.53. 
Now let me update you on our cash flow and capital structure. Free cash flow in the quarter was $301 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow increased by $32 million primarily due to the timing of working capital payments. Free cash flow year-to-date was $512 million. 
During the quarter, we returned $84 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and had $22 million of payments related to our restructuring program. The company did not make any voluntary contributions to our pension funds this quarter nor did we repurchase any shares of our common stock. 
As I mentioned earlier, we retired $400 million of debt this quarter using a combination of free cash flow and cash on the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Since the end of 2008, we have reduce our debt by more than $1 billion. We continue to evaluate our alternatives on how best to manage our remaining debt portfolio, this includes refinancing debt as it approaches maturity with new term debt and/or using cash or commercial paper. At the end of the quarter about 88% of our total debt was fixed-rate and 12% was floating-rate. 
That concludes my remarks. Now, Murray will discuss our guidance and we'll have some closing comments."

Our o",343,"We have updated our 2012 annual guidance to reflect results year-to-date and weaker than originally anticipated business conditions in the second half of the year. This is due in part to prolong the global economic uncertainty, especially in Europe. Our original earnings-per-share guidance did not anticipate the significant changes in currency that have occurred this year. 
Year-to-date, excluding currency, our revenues declined 4% and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.02, which excludes $0.11 per share of tax benefit in the first quarter. Based on the results to date and expectations for the second half of the year, we now anticipate 2012 revenue excluding the impacts of currency to be in the range of flat to a decline of 4% when compared to 2011. This guidance assumes moderating revenue declines for the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for 2012 to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.15 and GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.32. The updated earnings-per-share guidance reflects an adverse impact of $0.04 to $0.06 per share based on current foreign exchange rates. 
GAAP earnings per diluted share include $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and $0.06 per share from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada, both of which occurred in the first quarter of the year. 
Based on our strong cash flow performance year-to-date, we are increasing annual free cash flow range by $50 million. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. 
We remain focused on our goals to deliver sustainable value for our stakeholders even as we operate in challenging economic conditions. We have maintained a book progress in developing solutions that help customers manage their physical, their digital and their hybrid communication needs. We believe that these are the right strategies and are committed to enhancing the long-term growth and profitability of our business.

Then you have the installed meter base, which tends to be in the $20-plus range. What Web Connect does is it adds the cloud functionality of the non-meter-based equipment to the meter. So the people that have a meter for doing postage can now do shipping easily out of the cloud. They can do printing sheets to stamps on their local printer in addition, to their meters. So it creates a hybrid opportunity for the existing customer base to expand their capabilities around the device. It also then connects them via the Internet or broadband rather than telephone for updating rates, updating their software, et cetera and makes the experience significantly better on the meter. The meter does have advantages on many applications where people have things in the envelope before they go to print and that you can't do through a printer very easily. It usually jams or causes problems and it doesn't require sticking things on the surface of the envelope. So we see really 2 markets: The non-meter market, which we will grow with smart postage; and then the expansion of the smart postage into Webconnect, which creates  a hybrid product that gives all the functionality of the cloud-based offering plus the functionality of meter brought together in one connected environment."

We continue to develop and launch a range of new solutions to help the customers manage their physical, their digital and their hybrid communication needs in the quarter such as Connect+ and pbweb clinic as well as made ongoing progress in the preparations for the launch of Volly. We believe that the base are derived strategies and we are committed to enhancing the long-term growth and profitability of our business. Thank you."

I'll start by putting our overall performance this quarter into context. Mike will follow with the details on our second quarter results, and then I'll discuss our outlook for 2012. After the presentation, we'll take your questions. 
For the last few years, we've been on a journey to deliver long-term customer and shareholder value. We are fundamentally transforming our business processes, reducing our cost structure and diversifying our range of offerings beyond physical mail.  During the quarter, we continue to make progress against these long-term goals. We also continue to see favorable trends in parts of our business despite ongoing economic uncertainty and fluctuations in currency. 
Although total revenue declined during the quarter, there was growth on a constant currency basis in 3 of our 7 business segments. And in 2 of the remaining segments, the rate of revenue decline has moderated.
There are drivers, particularly in the enterprise group, that we anticipate will moderate year-over-year revenue declines in the second half of the year as compared with the first half of the year. These drivers include expansion of e-commerce and direct mail opportunities in Mail Services, new print outsourcing services provided by management services and increased backlog of equipment orders for Production Mail. 
In the quarter, we signed a strategic partnership with ORION Holdings to provide print management services that create substantial cost savings and increased value for the global network of interpublic companies, groups, agencies and clients. We will provide a platform that supports ORION Printing worldwide, which includes project management, global network of selected printers, print outsourcing expertise and technology that provides visibility tracking and accountability to each project. 
Our Volly secure digital mail delivery service continues to add capabilities and partnerships which we believe will enhance its successful adoption when it launches. 
During the quarter, we announced the first partner who will be part of our payment system. The ProfitStars division of Jack Henry & Associates will enable free one-click bill payments for consumers in Volly. We believe pre-bill payment on-site is a critical consumer requirement, and we are pleased to be offering it to our Volly users. 
We also reached an agreement with SafeNet Inc. to enhance the security of digital mail delivery in the cloud. Additionally, we have now signed more than 50 large third-party mail service providers who will offer the Volly secure digital mail service to more than 6,000 customer companies and the consumer brands. 
The positive signs that we noted in our SMB business in the first quarter continued this quarter as well. This was led by improved customer retention rates and increased placements of the Connect+ digital mailing systems globally. During the quarter, we launched Connect+ in Germany, and it was approved for placement in France beginning in the third quarter. 
In the U.S., we also launched the innovative mailstation2 with pbWebConnect. It is the world's first cloud-based mailing and shipping system that gives customers the ability to manage mail and packages via the postage meter or online. Customers can also gain access to special USPS discounts, not typically available through standard metering systems in addition to gateway access to a range of applications including the full pbSmart suite of digital solutions. pbWebConnect is already earning high marks from early adopters, for the convenience, discounts and the online access that it provides. 
We continue to generate strong free cash flow during the quarter, and we also strengthened our balance sheet through the early redemption of $400 million of debt. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our second quarter financial results."

Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, which was a decline of 3% on a constant currency basis and an improvement versus the first quarter decline of 4.4%. Currency had a negative impact of approximately 2% this quarter. As a result,",778,"Thank you, Murray. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, which was a decline of 3% on a constant currency basis and an improvement versus the first quarter decline of 4.4%. Currency had a negative impact of approximately 2% this quarter. As a result, revenue declined 5% versus prior year on a reported basis. 
The company experienced continued growth in its Software and Mail Services segments when the impacts of currency are excluded. In the SMB Solutions Group, International Mailing had its third consecutive quarter of revenue growth when you exclude the impacts of currency. However, there continue to be declines in the North American SMB revenue streams. 
While revenue was also adversely impacted by weakness in the Production Mail and Management Services segments due to lower global economic activity, both segments had improving revenue comparisons against the prior quarter on a constant currency basis.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 3%. Outside the U.S., revenue also declined by about 3% on a constant currency basis. Including the 7% adverse impact of currency, revenue declined about 10% outside the U.S. on a reported basis. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of total revenue. 
Turning to our earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, it was $205 million this quarter. The EBIT margin was 16.5%, which was an increase of 70 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin continues to benefit from ongoing improvements in our operating efficiencies across the business as a result of our Strategic Transformation initiatives. Our EBIT margin also include the impact of investments in new products and services. We expect these investments will accelerate as we approach the launch of our Volly product and continue to invest in new e-commerce opportunities. 
On a segment basis, EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 3 of our 7 business segments. The North American mailing segment improved its year-over-year EBIT margin for the eighth consecutive quarter. Our Mail Services and Marketing Services segments also had continued improvement in their EBIT margins. 
Our selling, general and administrative expenses continued to improve, with a decline of more than $41 million in the second quarter when compared with the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 31.4% this quarter versus 32.9% in the prior year, an improvement of 150 basis points. SG&A continues to benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives and good credit experience, as well as lower benefit cost this quarter. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our EBIT, EBITDA for the quarter was $273 million or $1.36 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $49 million, which was relatively flat to the prior year. The average interest rate was 4.87% for the quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.4% versus an effective tax rate of 33.3% last year. The tax rate is in line with the 32% to 35% expected rate for the year. 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.50 compared to $0.49 last year. Earnings per share this quarter included a reduction of $0.03 per cost related to debt management, which included net cost associated with our decision to redeem $400 million of our bonds that were originally scheduled to mature in October. Excluding these costs, earnings per diluted share this quarter were $0.53. 
Now let me update you on our cash flow and capital structure. Free cash flow in the quarter was $301 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow increased by $32 million, primarily due to the timing of working capital payments. Free cash flow year-to-date was $512 million. 
During the quarter, we returned $84 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and had $22 million of payments related to our restructuring program. The company did not make any voluntary contributions to our pension funds this quarter nor did we repurchase any shares of our common stock. 
As I mentioned earlier, we retired $400 million of debt this quarter using a combination of free cash flow and cash on the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Since the end of 2008, we have reduced our debt by more than $1 billion. We continue to evaluate our alternatives on how best to manage our remaining debt portfolio, this includes refinancing debt as it approaches maturity with new term debt and/or using cash or commercial paper. At the end of the quarter, about 88% of our total debt was fixed-rate and 12% was floating-rate. 
That concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance, and we'll have some closing comments."

This is due in part to prolong the global economic uncertainty, especially in Europe. Our original earnings per share guidance did not anticipate the significant changes in currency that have occurred this year. 
Year-to-date, excluding currency, our revenues declined 4%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.02, which excludes $0.11 per share of tax benefit in the first quarter. Based on the results to date and expectations for the second half of the year, we now anticipate 2012 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to a decline of 4% when compared to 2011. This guidance assumes moderating revenue declines for the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for 2012 to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.15, and GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.32. The updated earnings per share guidance reflects an adverse impact of $0.04 to $0.06 per share based on current foreign exchange rates. 
GAAP earnings per diluted share include $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and $0.06 per share from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada, both of which occurred in the first quarter of the year. 
Based on our strong cash flow performance year-to-date, we are increasing annual free cash flow range by $50 million. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. 
We remain focused on our goals to deliver sustainable value for our stakeholders even as we operate in challenging economic conditions. We have made tangible progress in developing solutions that help customers manage their physical, their digital and their hybrid communication needs. We believe that these are the right strategies and are committed to enhancing the long-term growth and profitability of our business.

One, small business creation at the low end of the SMB market is important for placing units and creating growth. However, we are seeing the initiatives that we put in place starting to have some positive effect on the challenges that have been there. Our retention rates continue to improve with our customer base, so we are seeing fewer customers leave. And in the long-term, that will definitely help us from the revenue side. Also, the Connect+ system continues to place. And then as I mentioned, we've launched Web Connect, which is -- really brings web connectivity to the low end of the meter line and will then start opening up the ability to add web-based applications for those customers. So those are the areas that we see as mitigating. However, certainly, small business creation is what would create the greatest stimulus."

I think there's obviously a couple of factors that drive free cash flow, and certainly earnings are one. And I think what we've shown over extended period of time is an ability to manage our cost structure relative to the change in the revenue profile of the business. And that's represented in the fact that in that core mailing business we had 8 consecutive quarters of improving margins. So as we go through sort of the transition of the business, we have been managing the cost side of it. The other is we have been evolving to a model that requires less capital in terms of capital expenditures back into the business. And that come down substantially over the last several years as we move to more digitally based products and lower costs in terms of delivering our products to our customers. In terms of the business model, obviously, as Murray talked to, there's a number of things that we're doing from a product and services perspective to diversify the revenue streams within the SMB business to be able to drive growth in the business on a revenue-per-customer basis. Obviously, lower rental asset investments but maintaining those revenue streams. And the finance receivables is where we see the biggest change over the period. And obviously, that's why we focus on equipment sales as a key driver to driving that finance receivables balance as we go forward."

While the range of EPS has changed somewhat, that is not the single -- necessarily single biggest contributor to the free cash flow. Again, we are seeing a need for less capital in the business. We have seen a little bit more of a run off in the finance receivables relative to what we had originally incorporated in the guidance, but actually seeing less run-off than we saw last year.

Then you have the installed meter base, which tends to be in the $20-plus range. What Web Connect does is it adds the cloud functionality of the non-meter-based equipment to the meter. So the people that have a meter for doing postage can now do shipping easily out of the cloud. They can do printing sheets of stamps, et cetera, on their local printer in addition to their meters. So it creates a hybrid opportunity for the existing customer base to expand their capabilities around the device. It also then connects them via the Internet or broadband rather than telephone for updating rates, updating their software, et cetera, and makes the experience significantly better on the meter. The meter does have advantages on many applications where people have things in the envelope before they go to print and that you can't do through a printer very easily. It usually jams or causes problems, and it doesn't require sticking things on the surface of the envelope. So we see really 2 markets: the non-meter market, which we will grow with smart postage; and then the expansion of the smart postage into Web Connect, which creates  a hybrid product that gives all the functionality of the cloud-based offering plus the functionality of meter brought together in one connected environment."

I would say though that a number of the investments we've made in the Strategic Transformation program were geared at creating an infrastructure that gave us more flexibility, more variability of our costs. So as we evolved the portfolio and the revenue base, we have greater flexibility to continue to manage our costs relative to our revenue performance. We have a continuous improvement program to continue to look at costs across the business. So that is our primary focus today. We always look at the business for opportunities to further improve the cost structure."

We're continuing to see positive there. We're seeing reasons for our customers to stay with a higher-end machine rather than migrating down market. We've also been very focused over the last year, or 2 years actually, as we've gone through transformation to change the customer experience and change how we manage our customers, how we support our customers and how we interact with them and take away some of the challenges we might have had with customers in the past. We believe that is always an area for improvement and we've seen that occur. We also have been very proactive on looking at our customer base and seeing what the needs of the customer are that could create behavior changes. So if we are seeing changes in how they work, we can then proactively look at what they are using and how they're seeing value and helping them.

I'll start by putting our overall performance this quarter into context. Mike will follow with the details on our second quarter results, and then I'll discuss our outlook for 2012. After the presentation, we'll take your questions. 
For the last few years, we've been on a journey to deliver long-term customer and shareholder value. We are fundamentally transforming our business processes, reducing our cost structure and diversifying our range of offerings beyond physical mail.  During the quarter, we continue to make progress against these long-term goals. We also continue to see favorable trends in parts of our business despite ongoing economic uncertainty and fluctuations in currency. 
Although total revenue declined during the quarter, there was growth on a constant currency basis in 3 of our 7 business segments. And in 2 of the remaining segments, the rate of revenue decline has moderated.
There are drivers, particularly in the enterprise group, that we anticipate will moderate year-over-year revenue declines in the second half of the year as compared with the first half of the year. These drivers include: expansion of e-commerce and direct mail opportunities in Mail Services, new print outsourcing services provided by management services and increased backlog of equipment orders for Production Mail. 
In the quarter, we signed a strategic partnership with ORION Holdings to provide print management services that create substantial cost savings and increased value for the global network of interpublic companies, groups, agencies and clients. We will provide a platform that supports ORION Printing worldwide, which includes project management, global network of selected printers, print outsourcing expertise and technology that provides visibility tracking and accountability to each project. 
Our Volly secure digital mail delivery service continues to add capabilities and partnerships which we believe will enhance its successful adoption when it launches. 
During the quarter, we announced the first partner who will be part of our payment system. The ProfitStars division of Jack Henry & Associates will enable free one-click bill payments for consumers in Volly. We believe pre-bill payment on-site is a critical consumer requirement, and we are pleased to be offering it to our Volly users. 
We also reached an agreement with SafeNet Inc. to enhance the security of digital mail delivery in the cloud. Additionally, we have now signed more than 50 large third-party mail service providers who will offer the Volly secure digital mail service to more than 6,000 companies and consumer brands. 
The positive signs that we noted in our SMB business in the first quarter continued this quarter as well. This was led by improved customer retention rates and increased placements of the Connect+ digital mailing systems globally. During the quarter, we launched Connect+ in Germany, and it was approved for placement in France beginning in the third quarter. 
In the U.S., we also launched the innovative mailstation2 with pbWebConnect. It is the world's first cloud-based mailing and shipping system that gives customers the ability to manage mail and packages via the postage meter or online. Customers can also gain access to special USPS discounts, not typically available through standard metering systems in addition to gateway access to a range of applications including the full pbSmart suite of digital solutions. pbWebConnect is already earning high marks from early adopters, for the convenience, discounts and the online access that it provides. 
We continued to generate strong free cash flow during the quarter, and we also strengthened our balance sheet through the early redemption of $400 million of debt. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our second quarter financial results."

Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, which was a decline of 3% on a constant currency basis and an improvement versus the first quarter decline of 4.4%. Currency had a negative impact of approximately 2% this quarter. As a result, revenue declined 5% versus prior year on a reported basis. 
The company experienced continued growth in its Software and Mail Services segments when the impacts of currency are excluded. In the SMB Solutions Group, International Mailing had its third consecutive quarter of revenue growth when you exclude the impacts of currency. However, there continue to be declines in the North American SMB revenue streams. 
While revenue was also adversely impacted by weakness in the Production Mail and Management Services segments due to lower global economic activity, both segments had improving revenue comparisons against the prior quarter on a constant currency basis.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 3%. Outside the U.S., revenue also declined by about 3% on a constant currency basis. Including the 7% adverse impact of currency, revenue declined about 10% outside the U.S. on a reported basis. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of total revenue. 
Turning to our earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, it was $205 million this quarter. The EBIT margin was 16.5%, which was an increase of 70 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin continues to benefit from ongoing improvements in our operating efficiencies across the business as a result of our Strategic Transformation initiatives. Our EBIT margin also include the impact of investments in new products and services. We expect these investments will accelerate as we approach the launch of our Volly product and continue to invest in new e-commerce opportunities. 
On a segment basis, EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 3 of our 7 business segments. The North American mailing segment improved its year-over-year EBIT margin for the eighth consecutive quarter. Our Mail Services and Marketing Services segments also had continued improvement in their EBIT margins. 
Our selling, general and administrative expenses continued to improve, with a decline of more than $41 million in the second quarter when compared with the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 31.4% this quarter versus 32.9% in the prior year, an improvement of 150 basis points. SG&A continues to benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives and good credit experience, as well as lower benefit cost this quarter. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our EBIT, EBITDA for the quarter was $273 million or $1.36 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $49 million, which was relatively flat to the prior year. The average interest rate was 4.87% for the quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.4% versus an effective tax rate of 33.3% last year. The tax rate is in line with the 32% to 35% expected rate for the year. 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.50 compared to $0.49 last year. Earnings per share this quarter included a reduction of $0.03 for cost related to debt management, which included net cost associated with our decision to redeem $400 million of our bonds that were originally scheduled to mature in October. Excluding these costs, earnings per diluted share this quarter were $0.53. 
Now let me update you on our cash flow and capital structure. Free cash flow in the quarter was $301 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow increased by $32 million, primarily due to the timing of working capital payments. Free cash flow year-to-date was $512 million. 
During the quarter, we returned $84 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and had $22 million of payments related to our restructuring program. The company did not make any voluntary contributions to our pension funds this quarter nor did we repurchase any shares of our common stock. 
As I mentioned earlier, we retired $400 million of debt this quarter using a combination of free cash flow and cash on the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Since the end of 2008, we have reduced our debt by more than $1 billion. We continue to evaluate our alternatives on how best to manage our remaining debt portfolio, this includes refinancing debt as it approaches maturity with new term debt and/or using cash or commercial paper. At the end of the quarter, about 88% of our total debt was fixed-rate and 12% was floating-rate. 
That concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance, and we'll have some closing comments."

This is due in part to prolonged global economic uncertainty, especially in Europe. Our original earnings per share guidance did not anticipate the significant changes in currency that have occurred this year. 
Year-to-date, excluding currency, our revenues declined 4%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.02, which excludes $0.11 per share of tax benefit in the first quarter. Based on the results to date and expectations for the second half of the year, we now anticipate 2012 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to a decline of 4% when compared to 2011. This guidance assumes moderating revenue declines for the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for 2012 to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.15, and GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.32. The updated earnings per share guidance reflects an adverse impact of $0.04 to $0.06 per share based on current foreign exchange rates. 
GAAP earnings per diluted share include $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and $0.06 per share from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada, both of which occurred in the first quarter of the year. 
Based on our strong cash flow performance year-to-date, we are increasing annual free cash flow range by $50 million. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. 
We remain focused on our goals to deliver sustainable value for our stakeholders even as we operate in challenging economic conditions. We have made tangible progress in developing solutions to help customers manage their physical, their digital and their hybrid communication needs. We believe that these are the right strategies and are committed to enhancing the long-term growth and profitability of our business.

Also, the Connect+ system continues to place.

I think there's obviously a couple of factors that drive free cash flow, and certainly earnings are one. And I think what we've shown over extended period of time is an ability to manage our cost structure relative to the change in the revenue profile of the business. And that's represented in the fact that in that core mailing business we had 8 consecutive quarters of improving margins. So as we go through sort of the transition of the business, we have been managing the cost side of it. The other is we have been evolving to a model that requires less capital in terms of capital expenditures back into the business. And that's come down substantially over the last several years as we've moved to more digitally based products and lower costs in terms of delivering our products to our customers. In terms of the business model, obviously, as Murray talked to, there's a number of things that we're doing from a product and services perspective to diversify the revenue streams within the SMB business to be able to drive growth in the business on a revenue-per-customer basis. Obviously, lower rental asset investments but maintaining those revenue streams. And the finance receivables is where we see the biggest change over the period. And obviously, that's why we focused on equipment sales as a key driver to driving that finance receivables balance as we go forward."

The revenue has been up just slightly for the last 3 quarters. We're looking to drive a change in the U.S. or the North American business as well.

So it's less of a contributor to the free cash flow. So overall, I would say it's strong asset management, good working capital management and continued focus on the cost.

Then you have the installed meter base, which tends to be in the $20-plus range. What Web Connect does is it adds the cloud functionality of the non-meter-based equipment to the meter. So the people that have a meter for doing postage can now do shipping easily out of the cloud. They can do printing sheets of stamps, et cetera, on their local printer in addition to their meters. So it creates a hybrid opportunity for the existing customer base to expand their capabilities around the device. It also then connects them via the Internet or broadband rather than telephone for updating their rates, updating their software, et cetera, and makes the experience significantly better on the meter. The meter does have advantages on many applications where people have things in the envelope before they go to print and that you can't do through a printer very easily. It usually jams or causes problems, and it doesn't require sticking things on the surface of the envelope. So we see really 2 markets: the non-meter market, which we will grow with smart postage; and then the expansion of the smart postage into Web Connect, which creates  a hybrid product that gives all the functionality of the cloud-based offering plus the functionality of meter brought together in one connected environment."

So that is the model that we see rolling out and the model that we've been signing billers up on. So we don't see any change there. We do see the enhancement, which I've talked about of adding payments so that it becomes an integrated solution. This is what our vision was from the beginning. And we have now brought our first payment provider in and are integrating that now, and that should be available at launch so that people will be able to receive and pay the bill in one closed environment."

That's a piece of it. The other 2 things affecting that equipment sales, if you remember, that DMT also drives that line. We did have a higher percentage of printer sales. The large production printer sales in DMT this quarter than we did last quarter. That has a lower relative margin because it is an OEM product. And then we have some ancillary businesses including office furniture in the Nordics. And they had a good-sized deal there this year that, again, given the nature of the product, doesn't have as high a margin as the traditional core mailing business.

There are other, I would say, remaining bits of programs going on now in the U.S. as well, but most are complete. I would say though that a number of the investments we've made in the Strategic Transformation program were geared at creating an infrastructure that gave us more flexibility, more variability of our costs. So as we evolved the portfolio and the revenue base, we have greater flexibility to continue to manage our costs relative to our revenue performance. We have a continuous improvement program to continue to look at costs across the business. So that is our primary focus today.

We believe that is always an area for improvement and we've seen that occur. We also have been very proactive on looking at our customer base and seeing what the needs of the customer are that could create behavior changes.

I'll start by putting our overall performance this quarter into context. Mike will follow with the details on our second quarter results, and then I'll discuss our outlook for 2012. After the presentation, we'll take your questions. 
For the last few years, we've been on a journey to deliver long-term customer and shareholder value. We are fundamentally transforming our business processes, reducing our cost structure and diversifying our range of offerings beyond physical mail.  During the quarter, we continue to make progress against these long-term goals. We also continue to see favorable trends in parts of our business despite ongoing economic uncertainty and fluctuations in currency. 
Although total revenue declined during the quarter, there was growth on a constant currency basis in 3 of our 7 business segments. And in 2 of the remaining segments, the rate of revenue decline has moderated.
There are drivers, particularly in the enterprise group, that we anticipate will moderate year-over-year revenue declines in the second half of the year as compared with the first half of the year. These drivers include: expansion of e-commerce and direct mail opportunities in Mail Services, new print outsourcing services provided by management services and increased backlog of equipment orders for Production Mail. 
In the quarter, we signed a strategic partnership with ORION Holdings to provide print management services that create substantial cost savings and increased value for the global network of interpublic companies, groups, agencies and clients. We will provide a platform that supports ORION Printing worldwide, which includes project management, global network of selected printers, print outsourcing expertise and technology that provides visibility tracking and accountability to each project. 
Our Volly secure digital mail delivery service continues to add capabilities and partnerships which we believe will enhance its successful adoption when it launches. 
During the quarter, we announced the first partner who will be part of our payment system. The ProfitStars division of Jack Henry & Associates will enable free one-click bill payments for consumers in Volly. We believe pre-bill payment on-site is a critical consumer requirement, and we are pleased to be offering it to our Volly users. 
We also reached an agreement with SafeNet Inc. to enhance the security of digital mail delivery in the cloud. Additionally, we have now signed more than 50 large third-party mail service providers who will offer the Volly secure digital mail service to more than 6,000 companies and consumer brands. 
The positive signs that we noted in our SMB business in the first quarter continued this quarter as well. This was led by improved customer retention rates and increased placements of the Connect+ digital mailing systems globally. During the quarter, we launched Connect+ in Germany, and it was approved for placement in France beginning in the third quarter. 
In the U.S., we also launched the innovative mailstation2 with pbWebConnect. It is the world's first cloud-based mailing and shipping system that gives customers the ability to manage mail and packages via the postage meter or online. Customers can also gain access to special USPS discounts, not typically available through standard metering systems in addition to gateway access to a range of applications including the full pbSmart suite of digital solutions. pbWebConnect is already earning high marks from early adopters, for the convenience, discounts and the online access that it provides. 
We continued to generate strong free cash flow during the quarter, and we also strengthened our balance sheet through the early redemption of $400 million of debt. 
Let me now turn it over to Mike for a discussion about our second quarter financial results."

Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, which was a decline of 3% on a constant currency basis and an improvement versus the first quarter decline of 4.4%. Currency had a negative impact of approximately 2% this quarter. As a result,",778,"Thank you, Murray. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, which was a decline of 3% on a constant currency basis and an improvement versus the first quarter decline of 4.4%. Currency had a negative impact of approximately 2% this quarter. As a result, revenue declined 5% versus prior year on a reported basis. 
The company experienced continued growth in its Software and Mail Services segments when the impacts of currency are excluded. In the SMB Solutions Group, International Mailing had its third consecutive quarter of revenue growth when you exclude the impacts of currency. However, there continue to be declines in the North American SMB revenue streams. 
While revenue was also adversely impacted by weakness in the Production Mail and Management Services segments due to lower global economic activity, both segments had improving revenue comparisons against the prior quarter on a constant currency basis.
Breaking down our revenue for the quarter between U.S. and non-U.S. operations, U.S. revenue declined by about 3%. Outside the U.S., revenue also declined by about 3% on a constant currency basis. Including the 7% adverse impact of currency, revenue declined about 10% outside the U.S. on a reported basis. Non-U.S. operations represented 31% of total revenue. 
Turning to our earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, it was $205 million this quarter. The EBIT margin was 16.5%, which was an increase of 70 basis points versus the prior year. EBIT margin continues to benefit from ongoing improvements in our operating efficiencies across the business as a result of our Strategic Transformation initiatives. Our EBIT margin also include the impact of investments in new products and services. We expect these investments will accelerate as we approach the launch of our Volly product and continue to invest in new e-commerce opportunities. 
On a segment basis, EBIT margins improved year-over-year in 3 of our 7 business segments. The North American mailing segment improved its year-over-year EBIT margin for the eighth consecutive quarter. Our Mail Services and Marketing Services segments also had continued improvement in their EBIT margins. 
Our selling, general and administrative expenses continued to improve, with a decline of more than $41 million in the second quarter when compared with the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 31.4% this quarter versus 32.9% in the prior year, an improvement of 150 basis points. SG&A continues to benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives and good credit experience, as well as lower benefit cost this quarter. 
When we add back depreciation and amortization to our EBIT, EBITDA for the quarter was $273 million or $1.36 per share. Net interest expense in the quarter including financing interest was $49 million, which was relatively flat to the prior year. The average interest rate was 4.87% for the quarter. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.4% versus an effective tax rate of 33.3% last year. The tax rate is in line with the 32% to 35% expected rate for the year. 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.50 compared to $0.49 last year. Earnings per share this quarter included a reduction of $0.03 for cost related to debt management, which included net cost associated with our decision to redeem $400 million of our bonds that were originally scheduled to mature in October. Excluding these costs, earnings per diluted share this quarter were $0.53. 
Now let me update you on our cash flow and capital structure. Free cash flow in the quarter was $301 million. In comparison to the prior year, free cash flow increased by $32 million, primarily due to the timing of working capital payments. Free cash flow year-to-date was $512 million. 
During the quarter, we returned $84 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and had $22 million of payments related to our restructuring program. The company did not make any voluntary contributions to our pension funds this quarter nor did we repurchase any shares of our common stock. 
As I mentioned earlier, we retired $400 million of debt this quarter using a combination of free cash flow and cash on the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Since the end of 2008, we have reduced our debt by more than $1 billion. We continue to evaluate our alternatives on how best to manage our remaining debt portfolio, this includes refinancing debt as it approaches maturity with new term debt and/or using cash or commercial paper. At the end of the quarter, about 88% of our total debt was fixed-rate and 12% was floating-rate. 
That concludes my remarks. Now Murray will discuss our guidance, and we'll have some closing comments."

Our ori",342,"We have updated our 2012 annual guidance to reflect results year-to-date and weaker-than-originally-anticipated business conditions in the second half of the year. This is due in part to prolonged global economic uncertainty, especially in Europe. Our original earnings per share guidance did not anticipate the significant changes in currency that have occurred this year. 
Year-to-date, excluding currency, our revenues declined 4%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.02, which excludes $0.11 per share of tax benefit in the first quarter. Based on the results to date and expectations for the second half of the year, we now anticipate 2012 revenue, excluding the impacts of currency, to be in the range of flat to a decline of 4% when compared to 2011. This guidance assumes moderating revenue declines for the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for 2012 to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.15, and GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.32. The updated earnings per share guidance reflects an adverse impact of $0.04 to $0.06 per share based on current foreign exchange rates. 
GAAP earnings per diluted share include $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and $0.06 per share from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada, both of which occurred in the first quarter of the year. 
Based on our strong cash flow performance year-to-date, we are increasing annual free cash flow range by $50 million. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. 
We remain focused on our goals to deliver sustainable value for our stakeholders even as we operate in challenging economic conditions. We have made tangible progress in developing solutions to help customers manage their physical, their digital and their hybrid communication needs. We believe that these are the right strategies and are committed to enhancing the long-term growth and profitability of our business.

One, small business creation at the low end of the SMB market is important for placing units and creating growth. However, we are seeing the initiatives that we put in place starting to have some positive effect on the challenges that have been there. Our retention rates continue to improve with our customer base, so we are seeing fewer customers leave. And in the long-term, that will definitely help us from the revenue side. Also, the Connect+ system continues to place. And then as I mentioned, we've launched Web Connect, which is -- really brings web connectivity to the low end of the meter line and will then start opening up the ability to add web-based applications for those customers. So those are the areas that we see as mitigating. However, certainly, small business creation is what would create the greatest stimulus."

I think there's obviously a couple of factors that drive free cash flow, and certainly earnings are one. And I think what we've shown over extended period of time is an ability to manage our cost structure relative to the change in the revenue profile of the business. And that's represented in the fact that in that core mailing business we had 8 consecutive quarters of improving margins. So as we go through sort of the transition of the business, we have been managing the cost side of it. The other is we have been evolving to a model that requires less capital in terms of capital expenditures back into the business. And that's come down substantially over the last several years as we've moved to more digitally based products and lower costs in terms of delivering our products to our customers. In terms of the business model, obviously, as Murray talked to, there's a number of things that we're doing from a product and services perspective to diversify the revenue streams within the SMB business to be able to drive growth in the business on a revenue-per-customer basis. Obviously, lower rental asset investments but maintaining those revenue streams. And the finance receivables is where we see the biggest change over the period.

So it's less of a contributor to the free cash flow. So overall, I would say it's strong asset management, good working capital management and continued focus on the cost.

Obviously, we're focused on our ratings and given the contraction in the revenue or in the finance receivables base, we wanted to make sure that our debt portfolio was in a line [ph] as well. And so we chose to redeem that debt. As we go forward, obviously, what we would do from a debt perspective is dependent upon the growth in our business. Obviously, finance receivables is one of the biggest reasons why we have the debt on our balance sheet. And obviously, if we grow those finance receivables in the future, we would look at providing financing for that. And that, obviously, has a good return on it. So it would be a good use of debt.

There's what we call pbSmartPostage, which is a non-meter, cloud-based postal system. And that is -- and that does both postage and shipping. And that's sort of in the $10 to $15 a month range. Then you have the installed meter base, which tends to be in the $20-plus range. What Web Connect does is it adds the cloud functionality of the non-meter-based equipment to the meter. So the people that have a meter for doing postage can now do shipping easily out of the cloud. They can do printing sheets of stamps, et cetera, on their local printer in addition to their meters. So it creates a hybrid opportunity for the existing customer base to expand their capabilities around the device. It also then connects them via the Internet or broadband rather than telephone for updating their rates, updating their software, et cetera, and makes the experience significantly better on the meter. The meter does have advantages on many applications where people have things in the envelope before they go to print and that you can't do through a printer very easily. It usually jams or causes problems, and it doesn't require sticking things on the surface of the envelope. So we see really 2 markets: the non-meter market, which we will grow with smart postage; and then the expansion of the smart postage into Web Connect, which creates  a hybrid product that gives all the functionality of the cloud-based offering plus the functionality of meter brought together in one connected environment."

Firstly is we launched the Connect+ product, which is really significantly differentiated from other products in the market, so at the high end of the marketplace. We're continuing to see positive there. We're seeing reasons for our customers to stay with a higher-end machine rather than migrating down market. We've also been very focused over the last year, or 2 years actually, as we've gone through transformation to change the customer experience and change how we manage our customers, how we support our customers and how we interact with them and take away some of the challenges we might have had with customers in the past. We believe that is always an area for improvement and we've seen that occur. We also have been very proactive on looking at our customer base and seeing what the needs of the customer are that could create behavior changes. So if we are seeing changes in how they work, we can then proactively look at what they are using and how they're seeing value and helping them. So it's really using the tools that we're creating to help our customers help their customers, applying the same thing to us in our relationship with our customers. So I really think it's across the board. It isn't really focused on price. It's really focused on changing the interaction with the customer and ensuring that the right value proposition is in place for the customer."

During the quarter, as we've mentioned, we've continued to make some tangible progress against our long-term goals to create more value for our stakeholders despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Though total revenue declined during the quarter, there was growth on a constant currency basis in 3 business segments and revenue decline lessened in 2 other segments. We believe there are drivers that will moderate our year-over-year revenue decline in the second half of the year, including the expansion of e-commerce and direct mail opportunities in our mail services business, new print outsourcing services provided by Management Services and the increased backlog of equipment orders for Production Mail. 
We continue to develop and launch a range of new solutions to help customers manage their physical, their digital and their hybrid communication needs in the quarter such as Connect+ and pbWebConnect, as well as made ongoing progress in the preparations for the launch of Volly.

Before we start I'd like to express our concern and best wishes for all of those who are impacted by Hurricane Sandy. I want to make a special note of appreciation to our employees who supported other employees, customers and our operations during this period of disruption. I'm happy to report that our employees in the impacted areas escaped injury and all of our facilities are now operational. 
In the third quarter, we continue to move forward on meeting our customers needs by delivering innovative solutions and focusing on higher growth markets. Before we discuss the results for the quarter, let me share with you some thoughts on where Pitney Bowes stands today, where it's been, where it is headed. We believe we are going through a critical period in the story of our company and our industry. Many of you who know our story understand that the shift has been underway for some time. So let me review what we've done and intend to continue doing to meet that shift head on. 
We recognized that we needed to take a long-term view specifically with investments towards higher growth opportunities to be more optimally positioned for the future. Over the last several years, we took actions to mitigate the impact of the global economy and evolving customer needs. And we focused on improving operations, increasing productivity and reducing cost and providing more opportunity for innovation. These actions allowed us to remain solidly profitable, generate strong cash flows and make strategic investments despite some revenue weakness. As many of you know, last year, we completed our 3-year Strategic Transformation program aimed at streamlining our business to further support growth. The initiative was broad-based and touched just about every part of the organization across the globe. We streamlined the organization, enhanced the efficiencies and market responsiveness and improve overall operations. In short, we did what needed to be done for Pitney Bowes and our stakeholders. As a result, the company is better positioned while at the same time delivering the products and services our customers want and need. 
We saw the benefits of the restructuring in SG&A improvement in our EBITDA margin in several of our business segments and our overall ability to operate more efficiently and be more responsive to our customers. This program generated more than $300 million in net annualized savings exceeding our targets. While the bulk of the work is complete, we continue to take cost out of the system and implement operational improvements across the business. In addition, by rethinking our cost structure and enhancing our market responsiveness, we've been able to make the investments necessary to support our long-term growth strategy: To be the leading provider of solutions to help customers of all sizes manage their physical, digital and high breed communications with their customers. Mail remains an important part of the business communication mix and we're continuing to invest in enhancing its value to our customers. 
The economic downturn is lasting longer than many expected. The various factors and measures I've mentioned have led to an ongoing and unique equilibrium at Pitney Bowes. We will simultaneously balance managing our business in an uneven global business environment with the need to invest and take action to drive longer-term growth. To that end, and building on the success of the Strategic Transformation program, we are initiating new actions to further improve long-term growth. We believe that there are opportunities to streamline and further reduce costs as well as address margin mix trends and strategically invest in higher growth businesses. We're committed to taking these measures to improve operational flexibility. Mike will provide more detail in his remarks. 
Consistent with the shift to higher growth opportunities, today, in our earnings release, we also stated our decision to exit the portion of the International Mail Services business related to the shipment of traditional mail and catalogs. We expect the exit will be completed in the fourth quarter. We've taken a charge in the quarter to reflect an impairment of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets. Mike will also discuss this in greater detail shortly. 
As for an additional investments, we have deep-rooted customer relationships and a unique understanding of the needs of the SMB and enterprise customers. It is this understanding that is driving our strategy for continued expansion of our e-commerce initiatives, cloud-based solutions, Software and Volly. 
Customers are looking for solutions that will help them not only managing their physical, digital and high breed communications but to do so in a more cost-effective way. We're excited to announce that we're expanding our cross-border e-commerce capabilities and will continue to strategically invest in technologies that make it easier for our customers to interact with their customers. Consistent with our strategy to leverage opportunities in this higher growth market, we formed a new global e-commerce business group, this group will focus on growing our cross-border e-commerce solutions and parcel services to help retailers create a seamless, online purchasing and shipping experience for consumers. Our expanding relationship with eBay is a good example. We are partnering on their recently announced global shipping program, or GSP, to help facilitate cross-border e-commerce and simplify the challenges associated with the historically, complex cross-border sale of goods. 
As many of you know, eBay and Pitney Bowes have been collaborating on technology solutions and services since 2004 when we enabled our internet postage platform to power the eBay shipping label printing service. Some 40% of sellers on eBay employee its label printing services. We are now providing technology and shipping services for the GSP, which eBay started testing during the quarter. 
To the GSP program, Pitney Bowes now supports eBay customers, shipping needs from the U.S. to 18 countries. This is particularly exciting as we look ahead to Q4 and support the holiday shipping season with our cross-border e-commerce solution. 
We continue to make progress with our Volly secure digital mail service and have now signed 60 large third-party mail service providers who will offer our service to 6,500 companies and consumer brands. As we continue to work with billers and develop our Software, we have decided to add and enhance our technology to provide additional capabilities that will improve the on boarding process for billers. This will result in improving the scalability of the service and facilitating the density. Partnering with several technology solutions that leverage the Volly platform will give us a faster path to the density necessary to move the market. Last week, for example, we along with Broadridge Financial Services announced that Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and UBS Financial Services have each indicated their support for our Volly solution. However, we have determined that Volly's long-term value will be enhanced by deferring its availability to consumers until 2013. 
Turning now to our earnings in the quarter, as I mentioned at the outset, there's a shift underway at Pitney Bowes to fundamentally transform our business with a diversified set of high-growth offerings and a reduced cost structure. Allowing us to respond to continued economic pressures while still investing for our future. 
Third quarter revenue benefited from growth in Production Mail also in Mail Services, prestored revenue grew as a result of increased standard mail volumes and continued penetration in all of the work shared discount categories. We also saw a gradually improving trends in our North American mailing business as we experienced the best year-over-year comparison in 6 quarters for equipment sales. 
While encouraged by these signs in investments for the future, revenue and earnings results did not meet our expectations. The decline in revenue and earnings during the quarter reflects the increasing impact of the global economic weakness especially in our Software and International Mailing and Management Services businesses. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin was down year-over-year, impacted by lower revenues and the changing business mix. Finally, our free cash flow during the quarter was also lower than usual totaling $40 million. However, on a year-to-date basis, it was $551 million. On a GAAP basis, third quarter cash from operations was $69 million and $440 million year-to-date. Based on our year-to-date free cash flow, we are reaffirming our guidance range for the year of $750 million to $850 million. 
Cash flow this quarter was impacted by the timing of tax refunds in payments and the timing of working capital requirements. For instance, in both taxes and accounts receivable, where significant sources of cash in the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011, for this quarter both items were uses of cash. 
Now, I'll turn it over to Mike to review the results in greater detail with a breakdown by the segments. Mike?"

This afternoon we reported results for the third quarter 2012. As Murray mentioned, many of the trends that we've been seeing throughout the year continued in the third quarter specifically as it relates to very uncertain and volatile global economic environment that continues to affect business spending patterns. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.47 for the third quarter of 2012 as compared with $0.69 per share for the same period in 2011. Last year's adjusted earnings per share included a $0.05 per share benefit from an insurance reimbursement and an $0.08 per share benefit from a tax settlement with the IRS. Excluding these 2 items, comparative adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year was $0.56. 
In general, adjusted results for this quarter and the prior year exclude the impact of restructuring cost, goodwill and asset impairment charges, asset sales and tax settlements that may have occurred in those periods that are not usual occurrences when considering normal ongoing operating results. A reconciliation schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. 
GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.38 versus $0.85 for the prior year. As outlined in today's press release and as Murray mentioned, we announced our intention to exit the International Mail Services business and as a result, there are $28 million of pre-tax non-cash goodwill intangible and long-lived asset impairment charges affecting this quarter's GAAP results. The remainder of my discussion will focus on the comparative operations of our businesses for the periods discussed and therefore all income statement related references or net results are on an adjusted basis. 
For the third quarter, company revenue totaled $1.2 billion, a decline of 6% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined 5%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT was $181 million this quarter and adjusted EBIT margin was 14.9%. Adjusted EBIT this quarter included an incremental investment of $3 million for Volly versus last year and approximately $3 million for infrastructure, distribution and related costs associated with our e-commerce growth initiatives. 
EBIT margin was also impacted by lower revenue in International Mailing and Software. Last year's EBIT margin benefited from an $18 million insurance reimbursement related to the Dallas facility fire. Adding back depreciation and amortization, EBITDA for the quarter was $241 million or $1.19 per share. 
SG&A for the quarter was $401 million, a decline of $27 million versus the prior year. As a percent of revenues, SG&A was 33%. SG&A continues to benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives and good credit experience as well as lower benefit cost this quarter. 
Net interest expense from the quarter including financing interest was $45 million, a decline of $4 million relative to the prior year. The average interest rate was 4.7% for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.4% versus an effective tax rate of 22.4% last year. The tax rate this quarter and last year benefited from the resolution of matters with tax authorities. 
On the balance sheet and cash flow, free cash flow during the quarter was $40 million and $551 million year-to-date. On a GAAP basis, we generated $69 million in cash from operations for the quarter and $440 million year-to-date. As Murray noted, cash flow was lower this quarter than usual. Comparisons of cash flow for this quarter versus the prior year were impacted by a large tax refund of almost $100 million and the timing of tax payments in the third quarter of last year. Comparisons to the second quarter of this year were also impacted by timing of tax payments as well as the timing of working capital requirements. 
We continue to closely monitor cash flow results and focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and had $13 million of restructuring payments related to our Strategic Transformation program. We are committed to a prudent use of cash. Our priorities for cash remain reinvestment in the business, consistent with our strategy to deliver innovative solutions and pursue higher growth markets, maintaining a fair return to our shareholders and managing our debt levels. We have $3.7 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, which was $550 million less than the amount of debt at the end of last year. 
As Murray highlighted, we believe that building on the success of Strategic Transformation, there are further opportunities to reduce costs and streamline the business. Therefore, we anticipate taking actions that will include organizational and management consolidations. We expect these actions will result in a pretax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter in the range of $40 million to $60 million and are anticipated to generate annualized savings in the range of $45 million to $55 million. 
Now I'd like to discuss the third quarter results for each of our segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to our website in the Investor Relations section. North America Mailing revenue for the quarter was $448 million and EBIT was $169 million. During the quarter, the North America Mailing segment continued to increase year-over-year placements of Connect+ and pbWebConnect mailing systems and SendSuite Live shipping solutions. As a result, this quarter we experienced the best year-over-year equipment sales performance in 6 quarters although it was a decline of less than 4%. 
Overall revenue declined primarily because of lower recurring revenue streams. EBIT margin was impacted by fewer lease extensions on existing equipment because there are few lease extensions this quarter there was a higher proportion of equipment sales will result in improvement and customer retention and future recurring revenue streams. 
International Mailing revenue for the quarter was $154 million and EBIT was $11 million. Revenue declined versus the prior year due to fewer equipment upgrades and lower equipment sales especially in the U.K. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by a postal rate change in France in the third quarter of last year, which generated $6 million of equipment sales related to postal rate updates, or PROMs, and there's no similar rate change this year. EBIT margin declined year-over-year due to lower revenue, lack of PROM sales this quarter and the overall mix of business. 
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. Production Mail revenue for the quarter was $122 million and EBIT was $4 million. Production Mail revenue grew due to increased worldwide equipment sales during the quarter, in part because of the group at trade show held during the second quarter. EBIT improved when compared to the prior year due to the growth of revenue and cost-reduction initiatives in the U.S. and Europe. The improvement in margin was partially offset by continued investment in our Volly service. Excluding the investment in Volly, EBIT margin would have been approximately 540 basis points higher. 
Software revenue for the quarter was $89 million and EBIT was $1 million. Software as we experienced the greatest effects of the challenging global economic environment. Revenue comparisons with the prior year were also a challenge given the high number of large licensing deals that we closed and declined versus the prior-year principally because of lower licensing revenue relatively higher R&D investment and marketing spend in the quarter. 
Management Services revenue for the quarter was $221 million and EBIT was $10 million. Management Services revenue and EBIT margin continue to be impacted by ongoing pricing pressures as a result of ongoing worldwide economic and competitive conditions and lower volumes. However, we continue to have positive net new Retail business, this coupled with our new strategic initiatives in print outsourcing are expected to drive revenue growth in the future. 
Mail Services revenue was $142 million and EBIT was $17 million. Increased standard mail volumes and continued penetration in the work share discount categories continue to drive revenue growth for the presort operations. Overall, Mail Services revenue declined slightly this quarter as a result of lower mail and catalog volumes in the International Mail Services business. As Murray mentioned, we're focusing on the higher growth cross-border e-commerce opportunities and our exiting the slower growth International Mail Services. 
EBIT margin comparisons this quarter versus the prior year were impacted by the $18 million insurance reimbursement received in the third quarter last year. Also impacting margin was the company's continued investment in Software applications and the distribution network to facilitate the expansion of the e-commerce solutions. 
Marketing Services revenue was $40 million and EBIT was $9 million. EBIT margin benefited from reduced print production costs and ongoing productivity initiatives. 
That concludes my comments and I'll turn the call over to Murray who will discuss guidance. Murray?"

We're operating in a very challenging and uncertain environment. While we expect effects of global economic uncertainty to persist, based on results to date and the expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2012 guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. 
Revenue is anticipated to be flat to minus 4%, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.15 and free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $750 million to $850. As I outlined earlier, given our intentions to further streamline the business, and reduce cost while shifting to higher growth opportunities, we will incur an expected restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of $40 million to $60 million. 
We are updating our GAAP EPS guidance to the range of $1.78 to $2.08 per diluted share. GAAP EPS reflects the goodwill and asset impairment charges of $0.09 per share related to our exit from our International Mail Services business and the anticipated restructuring charge of $0.15 to $0.25 per share. GAAP EPS also includes the $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and $0.06 per share benefit from the sale of leverage leased assets in Canada, both of which occurred in the first quarter of the year.

They have a very aggressive workshare program, which we participate in, in our presort business, where we have 36 sites and that also depending on how they reorganize could be beneficial. And then thirdly, as they look at creating more automation around mail, we do that automatically for our customers in our presort activity and this eliminates their need to make the investments.

As you look at e-commerce traffic and we'll look to provide more definitive information in that over the coming periods but the e-commerce traffic is growing particularly in the cross-border area. It has been challenged with the uncertainty of what fully loaded deliberate cost is providers. So there significant drop out when people realize that is a cross-border sale. That's really what this is focused that. It provides the consumer with an all-in price including duties, taxes, et cetera. We will then manage that and inspect the goods before they leave the country to ensure that they comply with the appropriate duties and taxes. But the customer will see an-all in price and not have any surprises. This -- everyone believes will actually accelerate cross-border e-commerce we are launching to 18 countries initially and then we'll be looking to expand that but as we move through the fourth quarter, we'll look to give you more information on what the market opportunity is for cross-border parcels."

Before we start, I'd like to express our concern and best wishes for all of those who were impacted by Hurricane Sandy. I want to make a special note of appreciation to our employees who supported other employees, customers and our operations during this period of disruption. I'm happy to report that our employees in the impacted areas escaped injury and all of our facilities are now operational.
In the third quarter, we continue to move forward on meeting our customers' needs by delivering innovative solutions and focusing on higher growth markets. Before we discuss the results for the quarter, let me share with you some thoughts on where Pitney Bowes stands today, where it's been, where it is headed. We believe we are going through a critical period in the history of our company and our industry. Many of you who know our story understand that a shift has been underway for some time. So let me review what we've done and intend to continue doing to meet that shift head on.
We recognize that we needed to take a long-term view, specifically with investments towards higher growth opportunities to be more optimally positioned for the future. Over the last several years, we took actions to mitigate the impact of the global economy and evolving customer needs. And we focused on improving operations, increasing productivity and reducing cost and providing more opportunity for innovation. These actions allowed us to remain solidly profitable, generate strong cash flows and make strategic investments despite some revenue weakness. As many of you know, last year, we completed our 3-year Strategic Transformation program aimed at streamlining our business to further support growth. The initiative was broad-based and touched just about every part of the organization across the globe. We streamlined the organization, enhanced efficiencies and market responsiveness and improved overall operations. In short, we did what needed to be done for Pitney Bowes and our stakeholders. As a result, the company is better positioned while at the same time delivering the products and services our customers want and need.
We saw the benefits of the restructuring in SG&A improvement, in our EBIT margins, in several of our business segments, and our overall ability to operate more efficiently and be more responsive to our customers. This program generated more than $300 million in net annualized savings, exceeding our targets. While the bulk of the work is complete, we continue to take cost out of the system and implement operational improvements across the business. In addition, by rethinking our cost structure and enhancing our market responsiveness, we've been able to make the investments necessary to support our long term growth strategy: To be the leading provider of solutions to help customers of all sizes manage their physical, digital and hybrid communications with their customers. Mail remains an important part of the business communications mix, and we are continuing to invest in enhancing its value to our customers.
The economic downturn is lasting longer than many expected. The various factors and measures I've mentioned have led to an ongoing and unique equilibrium at Pitney Bowes. We will simultaneously balance managing our business in an uneven global business environment, with the need to invest and take action to drive longer-term growth. To that end, and building on the success of the Strategic Transformation program, we are initiating new actions to further improve long-term growth. We believe that there are opportunities to streamline and further reduce costs, as well as address margin mix trends and strategically invest in higher growth businesses. We're committed to taking these measures to improve operational flexibility. Mike will provide more detail in his remarks.
Consistent with the shift to higher growth opportunities, today, in our earnings release, we also stated our decision to exit the portion of the International Mail Services business related to the shipment of traditional mail and catalogs. We expect the exit will be completed in the fourth quarter. We've taken a charge in the quarter to reflect an impairment of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets. Mike will also discuss this in greater detail shortly.
As for an additional investments, we have deep-rooted customer relationships and a unique understanding of the needs of the SMB and enterprise customers. It is this understanding that is driving our strategy for continued expansion of our ecommerce initiatives, cloud-based solutions, software and Volly.
Customers are looking for solutions that will help them not only manage their physical, digital and hybrid communications, but to do so in a more cost-effective way. We're excited to announce that we're expanding our cross-border ecommerce capabilities and will continue to strategically invest in technologies that make it easier for our customers to interact with their customers. Consistent with our strategy to leverage opportunities in this higher growth market, we formed a new global ecommerce business group, this group will focus on growing our cross-border ecommerce solutions and parcel services to help retailers create a seamless, online purchasing and shipping experience for consumers. Our expanding relationship with eBay is a good example. We are partnering on their recently announced Global Shipping Program or GSP to help facilitate cross-border ecommerce and simplify the challenges associated with the historically complex cross-border sale of goods.
As many of you know, eBay and Pitney Bowes have been collaborating on technology solutions and services since 2004 when we enabled our Internet postage platform to power the eBay shipping label printing service. Some 40% of sellers on eBay employ its label printing services. We are now providing technology and shipping services for the GSP, which eBay started testing during the quarter.
Through the GSP program, Pitney Bowes now supports eBay customers' shipping needs from the U.S. to 18 countries. This is particularly exciting as we look ahead to Q4 and support the holiday shipping season with our cross-border ecommerce solution.
We continue to make progress with our Volly secure digital mail service and have now signed 60 large third-party mail service providers who will offer our service to 6,500 companies and consumer brands. As we continue to work with billers and develop our software, we have decided to add and enhance our technology to provide additional capabilities that will improve the on-boarding process for billers. This will result in improving the scalability of the service and facilitating biller density. Partnering with several technology solutions that leverage the Volly platform will give us a faster path to the density necessary to move the market. Last week, for example, we, along with Broadridge Financial Services (sic) [Broadridge Financial Solutions], announced that Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and UBS Financial Services have each indicated their support for our Volly solution. However, we have determined that Volly's long-term value will be enhanced by deferring its availability to consumers until 2013.
Turning now to our earnings in the quarter, as I mentioned at the outset, there's a shift underway at Pitney Bowes to fundamentally transform our business, with a diversified set of high-growth offerings and a reduced cost structure. Allowing us to respond to continued economic pressures while still investing for our future.
Third quarter revenue benefited from growth in Production Mail, also in Mail Services, presort revenue grew as a result of increased Standard Mail volumes and continued penetration in all of the workshare discount categories. We also saw gradually improving trends in our North American mailing business as we experienced the best year-over-year comparison in 6 quarters for equipment sales.
While encouraged by these signs and investments for the future, revenue and earnings results did not meet our expectations. The decline in revenue and earnings during the quarter reflects the increasing impact of the global economic weakness, especially in our Software and International Mailing and Management Services businesses.
Adjusted EBIT margin was down year-over-year, impacted by lower revenues and the changing business mix. Finally, our free cash flow during the quarter was also lower than usual totaling $40 million. However, on a year-to-date basis, it was $551 million. On a GAAP basis, third quarter cash from operations was $69 million and $440 million year-to-date. Based on our year-to-date free cash flow, we are reaffirming our guidance range for the year of $750 million to $850 million.
Cash flow this quarter was impacted by the timing of tax refunds and payments and the timing of working capital requirements. For instance, in both taxes and accounts receivable were significant sources of cash in the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011. While this quarter, both items were uses of cash.
Now I'll turn it over to Mike to review the results in greater detail with a breakdown by the segments. Mike?"

Adjusted EPS was $0.47 for the third quarter of 2012 as compared with $0.69 per share for the same period in 2011. Last year's adjusted earnings per share included a $0.05 per share benefit from an insurance reimbursement and an $0.08 per share benefit from a tax settlement with the IRS. Excluding these 2 items, comparative adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year was $0.56.
In general, adjusted results for this quarter and the prior year exclude the impact of restructuring cost, goodwill and asset impairment charges, asset sales and tax settlements that may have occurred in those periods that are not usual occurrences when considering normal ongoing operating results. A reconciliation schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website.
GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.38 versus $0.85 for the prior year. As outlined in today's press release, and as Murray mentioned, we announced our intention to exit the International Mail Services business and as a result, there are $28 million of pretax noncash goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment charges affecting this quarter's GAAP results. The remainder of my discussion will focus on the comparative operations of our businesses for the periods discussed and therefore all income statement-related references or net results are on an adjusted basis.
For the third quarter, company revenue totaled $1.2 billion, a decline of 6% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined 5%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT was $181 million this quarter and adjusted EBIT margin was 14.9%. Adjusted EBIT this quarter included an incremental investment of $3 million for Volly versus last year and approximately $3 million for infrastructure, distribution and related cost associated with our ecommerce growth initiatives.
EBIT margin was also impacted by lower revenue in International Mailing and Software. Last year's EBIT margin benefited from an $18 million insurance reimbursement related to the Dallas facility fire. Adding back depreciation and amortization, EBITDA for the quarter was $241 million or $1.19 per share.
SG&A for the quarter was $401 million, a decline of $27 million versus the prior year. As a percent of revenues, SG&A was 33%. SG&A continues to benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives and good credit experience, as well as lower benefit cost this quarter.
Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was $45 million, a decline of $4 million relative to the prior year. The average interest rate was 4.7% for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.4% versus an effective tax rate of 22.4% last year. The tax rate this quarter and last year benefited from the resolution of matters with tax authorities.
On the balance sheet and cash flow, free cash flow during the quarter was $40 million and $551 million year-to-date. On a GAAP basis, we generated $69 million in cash from operations for the quarter and $440 million year-to-date. As Murray noted, cash flow was lower this quarter than usual. Comparisons of cash flow for this quarter versus the prior year were impacted by a large tax refund of almost $100 million and the timing of tax payments in the third quarter of last year. Comparisons to the second quarter of this year were also impacted by timing of tax payments, as well as the timing of working capital requirements.
We continue to closely monitor cash flow results and focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and had $13 million of restructuring payments related to our Strategic Transformation program. We are committed to a prudent use of cash. Our priorities for cash remain reinvestment in the business, consistent with our strategy to deliver innovative solutions and pursue higher growth markets, maintaining a fair return to our shareholders and managing our debt levels. We have $3.7 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, which was $550 million less than the amount of debt at the end of last year.
As Murray highlighted, we believe that building on the success of Strategic Transformation, there are further opportunities to reduce cost and streamline the business. Therefore, we anticipate taking actions that will include organizational and management consolidations. We expect these actions will result in a pretax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter in the range of $40 million to $60 million and are anticipated to generate annualized savings in the range of $45 million to $55 million.
Now I'd like to discuss the third quarter results for each of our segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to our website in the Investor Relations section. North America Mailing revenue for the quarter was $448 million and EBIT was $169 million. During the quarter, the North American Mailing segment continued to increase year-over-year placements of Connect+ and pbWebConnect mailing systems and SendSuite Live shipping solutions. As a result, this quarter, we experienced the best year-over-year equipment sales performance in 6 quarters, although it was a decline of less than 4%.
Overall revenue declined primarily because of lower recurring revenue streams. EBIT margin was impacted by fewer lease extensions on existing equipment. Because there are few lease extensions this quarter, there was a higher proportion of equipment sales, which will result in an improvement in customer retention and future recurring revenue streams.
International Mailing revenue for the quarter was $154 million and EBIT was $11 million. Revenue declined versus the prior year due to fewer equipment upgrades and lower equipment sales, especially in the U.K. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by a postal rate change in France in the third quarter of last year, which generated $6 million of equipment sales related to postal rate updates or PROMs, and there is no similar rate change this year. EBIT margin declined year-over-year due to lower revenue, lack of PROM sales this quarter and the overall mix of business.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. Production Mail revenue for the quarter was $122 million and EBIT was $4 million. Production Mail revenue grew due to increased worldwide equipment sales during the quarter, in part because of the Drupa trade show held during the second quarter. EBIT improved when compared to the prior year, due to the growth of revenue and cost-reduction initiatives in the U.S. and Europe. The improvement in margin was partially offset by continued investment in our Volly service. Excluding the investment in Volly, EBIT margin would have been approximately 540 basis points higher.
Software revenue for the quarter was $89 million and EBIT was $1 million. Software is where we experienced the greatest effects of the challenging global economic environment. Revenue comparisons with the prior year were also challenging given the high number of large licensing deals that we closed during the third quarter of 2011. Continued austerity measures by the public sector globally are also adversely impacting our business. EBIT margin declined versus the prior year principally because of lower licensing revenue, relatively higher R&D investment and marketing spend in the quarter.
Management Services revenue for the quarter was $221 million and EBIT was $10 million. Management Services revenue and EBIT margin continue to be impacted by ongoing pricing pressures as a result of ongoing worldwide economic and competitive conditions and lower volumes. However, we continue to have positive net new written business, this coupled with our new strategic initiatives in print outsourcing are expected to drive revenue growth in the future.
Mail Services revenue was $142 million and EBIT was $17 million. Increased Standard Mail volumes and continued penetration in the workshare discount categories continue to drive revenue growth for the presort operations. Overall, Mail Services revenue declined slightly this quarter as a result of lower mail and catalog volumes in the International Mail Services business. As Murray mentioned, we're focusing on the higher growth cross-border ecommerce opportunities and are exiting the slower growth International Mail Services.
EBIT margin comparisons this quarter versus the prior year were impacted by the $18 million insurance reimbursement received in the third quarter last year. Also impacting margin was the company's continued investment in Software applications and the distribution network to facilitate the expansion of its ecommerce solutions.
Marketing Services revenue was $40 million and EBIT was $9 million. EBIT margin benefited from reduced print production costs and ongoing productivity initiatives.
That concludes my comments, and I'll turn the call over to Murray who will discuss guidance. Murray?"

We're operating in a very challenging and uncertain environment. While we expect effects of global economic uncertainty to persist, based on results to date and the expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2012 guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.
Revenue is anticipated to be flat to minus 4%, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.15 and free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. As I outlined earlier, given our intentions to further streamline the business and reduce cost while shifting to higher growth opportunities, we will incur an expected restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of $40 million to $60 million.
We are updating our GAAP EPS guidance to the range of $1.78 to $2.08 per diluted share. GAAP EPS reflects the goodwill and asset impairment charges of $0.09 per share related to our exit from our International Mail Services business, and the anticipated restructuring charge of $0.15 to $0.25 per share. GAAP EPS also includes the $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and $0.06 per share benefit from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada, both of which occurred in the first quarter of the year.
Pitney Bowes is a global leader, and we believe that the steps we have taken and the actions we have underway will provide long-term benefit to our shareholders.

As we look at postal rate changes, as long as they're in a reasonable percentage, which the cap that is in place does force them to be -- it generally does not have a material effect in the near term. So it does, however, enhance the need for postal equipment as they look at how the rates are affected and easily implemented with our software-based systems. Of course, all of those rates are downloaded automatically. At the same time, as we look at postal restructuring, we see the post needing to look at how to provide easier access for customers in more locations, and that we would see as potentially beneficial to us, as well as how they would outsource more of their activities. They have a very aggressive workshare program, which we participate in, in our presort business, where we have 36 sites, and that also depending on how they reorganize could be beneficial. And then thirdly, as they look at creating more automation around mail, we do that automatically for our customers in our presort activity, and this eliminates their need to make the investments. So it actually enriches our presort opportunities."

As you look at ecommerce traffic, and we'll look to provide more definitive information in that over the coming periods, but the ecommerce traffic is growing particularly in the cross-border area. It has been challenged with the uncertainty of what fully loaded delivered cost is for buyers. So there's a significant dropout when people realize that it is a cross-border sale. And that's really what this is focused at. It provides the consumer with an all-in price, including duties, taxes, et cetera. We will then manage that and inspect the goods before they leave the country to ensure that they comply with the appropriate duties and taxes. But the customer will see an all-in price and not have any surprises. This everyone believes will actually accelerate cross-border ecommerce. We are launching to 18 countries initially, and then we'll be looking to expand that. But as we move through the fourth quarter, we'll look to give you more information on what the market opportunity is for cross-border parcels."

As to the restructuring charge itself, as you recall, we executed and completed a 3-year program. That was very broad based and affected pretty well every area around the world. And what we are doing here is targeting specifically the management and professional areas to ensure that they are aligned with the revision of the business model, with the changing mix of the business in growth, in enterprise and the margin mix that occurs as a result. So it's a very targeted approach in the areas that I mentioned, and therefore, it should execute fairly quickly and completely."

Yes, I mean, relative to the second quarter, if you were to compare it to the second quarter, there's some definite timing differences, particularly within accounts payable and accrued liability. One example of it, a fairly sizable number is accrued interest. We pay most of our interest on a semiannual basis. So we accrue over 2 quarters and then pay. So that creates a meaningful timing difference between the second and third quarter. On an annualized basis, it obviously washes out. Similarly, things like payroll, where we accrue at the end of a period for the number of days outstanding to pay, there was a big difference between the second and third quarter as well. There were some AR timing, accounts receivable timing that you can get big payments in just before the end of the quarter, end of quarter, so that was relatively minor. But those are the biggest items and some minor employee liability accruals. But on an annualized basis, we expect these things to even out.

I'd say, that was a significant item. The second significant item is the number of large transactions. The number of large transactions closed was down. So there is a delay. People are requiring more sign-offs in layers, which is increasing the time to get a business signed.

And then as Mike mentioned, a lot of those are going in as new rather than lease extension, and that also is longer term and over the long term will supply long-term revenue."

Firstly, the high-end items, Connect+, continues to move very well, and so we aren't seeing what we'd call any disproportionate downsizing. If anything, people in the upper-market area are staying with the product because they see more feature functionality and capabilities to deliver more value. So we really don't see too much there. At the same time, as we launched WebConnect, WebConnect supplies digital services as an adjunct to the product. And so again, it's providing a larger value proposition for the customers. So I think those 2 things in the mailing business have kept the size question as relatively stable and not created any real shift in that. Certainly, there is a question of confidence in the low end of the market. The NFIB report showed that the confidence has not improved in the market, and so we would like to see that because that would give us more breadth of that market space here in the U.S. So I think those are the ways we see the lower end. We expect it to continue. From your pricing question, there's always sensitivity and pricing in the market, but I wouldn't say we've seen anything that is significantly different than we have in the past periods."

Before we start, I'd like to express our concern and best wishes for all of those who were impacted by Hurricane Sandy. I want to make a special note of appreciation to our employees who supported other employees, customers and our operations during this period of disruption. I'm happy to report that our employees in the impacted areas escaped injury and all of our facilities are now operational.
In the third quarter, we continued to move forward on meeting our customers' needs by delivering innovative solutions and focusing on higher growth markets. Before we discuss the results for the quarter, let me share with you some thoughts on where Pitney Bowes stands today, where it's been, where it is headed. We believe we are going through a critical period in the history of our company and our industry. Many of you who know our story understand that a shift has been underway for some time. So let me review what we've done and intend to continue doing to meet that shift head on.
We recognize that we needed to take a long-term view, specifically with investments towards higher growth opportunities to be more optimally positioned for the future. Over the last several years, we took actions to mitigate the impact of the global economy and evolving customer needs. And we focused on improving operations, increasing productivity and reducing cost and providing more opportunity for innovation. These actions allowed us to remain solidly profitable, generate strong cash flows and make strategic investments despite some revenue weakness. As many of you know, last year, we completed our 3-year Strategic Transformation program aimed at streamlining our business to further support growth. The initiative was broad-based and touched just about every part of the organization across the globe. We streamlined the organization, enhanced efficiencies and market responsiveness and improved overall operations. In short, we did what needed to be done for Pitney Bowes and our stakeholders. As a result, the company is better positioned while at the same time delivering the products and services our customers want and need.
We saw the benefits of the restructuring in SG&A improvement, in our EBIT margins, in several of our business segments, and our overall ability to operate more efficiently and be more responsive to our customers. This program generated more than $300 million in net annualized savings, exceeding our targets. While the bulk of the work is complete, we continue to take cost out of the system and implement operational improvements across the business. In addition, by rethinking our cost structure and enhancing our market responsiveness, we've been able to make the investments necessary to support our long term growth strategy: To be the leading provider of solutions to help customers of all sizes manage their physical, digital and hybrid communications with their customers. Mail remains an important part of the business communications mix, and we are continuing to invest in enhancing its value to our customers.
The economic downturn is lasting longer than many expected. The various factors and measures I've mentioned have led to an ongoing and unique equilibrium at Pitney Bowes. We will simultaneously balance managing our business in an uneven global business environment, with the need to invest and take action to drive longer-term growth. To that end, and building on the success of the Strategic Transformation program, we are initiating new actions to further improve long-term growth. We believe that there are opportunities to streamline and further reduce costs, as well as address margin mix trends and strategically invest in higher growth businesses. We're committed to taking these measures to improve operational flexibility. Mike will provide more detail in his remarks.
Consistent with the shift to higher growth opportunities, today, in our earnings release, we also stated our decision to exit the portion of the International Mail Services business related to the shipment of traditional mail and catalogs. We expect the exit will be completed in the fourth quarter. We've taken a charge in the quarter to reflect an impairment of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets. Mike will also discuss this in greater detail shortly.
As for an additional investments, we have deep-rooted customer relationships and a unique understanding of the needs of the SMB and enterprise customers. It is this understanding that is driving our strategy for continued expansion of our ecommerce initiatives, cloud-based solutions, software and Volly.
Customers are looking for solutions that will help them not only manage their physical, digital and hybrid communications, but to do so in a more cost-effective way. We're excited to announce that we're expanding our cross-border ecommerce capabilities and will continue to strategically invest in technologies that make it easier for our customers to interact with their customers. Consistent with our strategy to leverage opportunities in this higher growth market, we formed a new global ecommerce business group, this group will focus on growing our cross-border ecommerce solutions and parcel services to help retailers create a seamless, online purchasing and shipping experience for consumers. Our expanding relationship with eBay is a good example. We are partnering on their recently announced Global Shipping Program or GSP to help facilitate cross-border ecommerce and simplify the challenges associated with the historically complex cross-border sale of goods.
As many of you know, eBay and Pitney Bowes have been collaborating on technology solutions and services since 2004 when we enabled our Internet postage platform to power the eBay shipping label printing service. Some 40% of sellers on eBay employ its label printing services. We are now providing technology and shipping services for the GSP, which eBay started testing during the quarter.
Through the GSP program, Pitney Bowes now supports eBay customers' shipping needs from the U.S. to 18 countries. This is particularly exciting as we look ahead to Q4 and support the holiday shipping season with our cross-border ecommerce solution.
We continue to make progress with our Volly secure digital mail service and have now signed 60 large third-party mail service providers who will offer our service to 6,500 companies and consumer brands. As we continue to work with billers and develop our software, we have decided to add and enhance our technology to provide additional capabilities that will improve the on-boarding process for billers. This will result in improving the scalability of the service and facilitating biller density. Partnering with several technology solutions that leverage the Volly platform will give us a faster path to the density necessary to move the market. Last week, for example, we, along with Broadridge Financial Services (sic) [Broadridge Financial Solutions], announced that Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and UBS Financial Services have each indicated their support for our Volly solution. However, we have determined that Volly's long-term value will be enhanced by deferring its availability to consumers until 2013.
Turning now to our earnings in the quarter, as I mentioned at the outset, there's a shift underway at Pitney Bowes to fundamentally transform our business, with a diversified set of high-growth offerings and a reduced cost structure. Allowing us to respond to continued economic pressures while still investing for our future.
Third quarter revenue benefited from growth in Production Mail, also in Mail Services, presort revenue grew as a result of increased Standard Mail volumes and continued penetration in all of the workshare discount categories. We also saw gradually improving trends in our North American mailing business as we experienced the best year-over-year comparison in 6 quarters for equipment sales.
While encouraged by these signs and investments for the future, revenue and earnings results did not meet our expectations. The decline in revenue and earnings during the quarter reflects the increasing impact of the global economic weakness, especially in our Software and International Mailing and Management Services businesses.
Adjusted EBIT margin was down year-over-year, impacted by lower revenues and the changing business mix. Finally, our free cash flow during the quarter was also lower than usual totaling $40 million. However, on a year-to-date basis, it was $551 million. On a GAAP basis, third quarter cash from operations was $69 million and $440 million year-to-date. Based on our year-to-date free cash flow, we are reaffirming our guidance range for the year of $750 million to $850 million.
Cash flow this quarter was impacted by the timing of tax refunds and payments and the timing of working capital requirements. For instance, in both taxes and accounts receivable were significant sources of cash in the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011. While this quarter, both items were uses of cash.
Now I'll turn it over to Mike to review the results in greater detail with a breakdown by the segments. Mike?"
297018,222422572,376173,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2012",2012-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Murray.

This afternoon we reported results for the third quarter of 2012. As Murray mentioned, many of the trends that we've been seeing throughout the year continued in the third quarter, specifically as it relates to the very uncertain and volatile global economic environment that continues to affect business spending patterns.
Adjusted EPS was $0.47 for the third quarter of 2012 as compared with $0.69 per share for the same period in 2011. Last year's adjusted earnings per share included a $0.05 per share benefit from an insurance reimbursement and an $0.08 per share benefit from a tax settlement with the IRS. Excluding these 2 items, comparative adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year was $0.56.
In general, adjusted results for this quarter and the prior year exclude the impact of restructuring cost, goodwill and asset impairment charges, asset sales and tax settlements that may have occurred in those periods that are not usual occurrences when considering normal ongoing operating results. A reconciliation schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website.
GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.38 versus $0.85 for the prior year. As outlined in today's press release, and as Murray mentioned, we announced our intention to exit the International Mail Services business and as a result, there are $28 million of pretax noncash goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment charges affecting this quarter's GAAP results. The remainder of my discussion will focus on the comparative operations of our businesses for the periods discussed and therefore all income statement-related references or net results are on an adjusted basis.
For the third quarter, company revenue totaled $1.2 billion, a decline of 6% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined 5%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT was $181 million this quarter and adjusted EBIT margin was 14.9%. Adjusted EBIT this quarter included an incremental investment of $3 million for Volly versus last year and approximately $3 million for infrastructure, distribution and related cost associated with our ecommerce growth initiatives.
EBIT margin was also impacted by lower revenue in International Mailing and Software. Last year's EBIT margin benefited from an $18 million insurance reimbursement related to the Dallas facility fire. Adding back depreciation and amortization, EBITDA for the quarter was $241 million or $1.19 per share.
SG&A for the quarter was $401 million, a decline of $27 million versus the prior year. As a percent of revenues, SG&A was 33%. SG&A continues to benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives and good credit experience, as well as lower benefit cost this quarter.
Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was $45 million, a decline of $4 million relative to the prior year. The average interest rate was 4.7% for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.4% versus an effective tax rate of 22.4% last year. The tax rate this quarter and last year benefited from the resolution of matters with tax authorities.
On the balance sheet and cash furlough, cash flow, free cash flow during the quarter was $40 million and $551 million year-to-date. On a GAAP basis, we generated $69 million in cash from operations for the quarter and $440 million year-to-date. As Murray noted, cash flow was lower this quarter than usual. Comparisons of cash flow for this quarter versus the prior year were impacted by a large tax refund of almost $100 million and the timing of tax payments in the third quarter of last year. Comparisons to the second quarter of this year were also impacted by timing of tax payments, as well as the timing of working capital requirements.
We continue to closely monitor cash flow results and focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and had $13 million of restructuring payments related to our Strategic Transformation program. We are committed to a prudent use of cash. Our priorities for cash remain reinvestment in the business, consistent with our strategy to deliver innovative solutions and pursue higher growth markets, maintaining a fair return to our shareholders and managing our debt levels. We have $3.7 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, which was $550 million less than the amount of debt at the end of last year.
As Murray highlighted, we believe that building on the success of Strategic Transformation, there are further opportunities to reduce cost and streamline the business. Therefore, we anticipate taking actions that will include organizational and management consolidations. We expect these actions will result in a pretax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter in the range of $40 million to $60 million and are anticipated to generate annualized savings in the range of $45 million to $55 million.
Now I'd like to discuss the third quarter results for each of our segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to our website in the Investor Relations section. North America Mailing revenue for the quarter was $448 million and EBIT was $169 million. During the quarter, the North American Mailing segment continued to increase year-over-year placements of Connect+ and pbWebConnect mailing systems and SendSuite Live shipping solutions. As a result, this quarter, we experienced the best year-over-year equipment sales performance in 6 quarters, although it was a decline of less than 4%.
Overall revenue declined primarily because of lower recurring revenue streams. EBIT margin was impacted by fewer lease extensions on existing equipment. Because there were fewer lease extensions this quarter, there was a higher proportion of equipment sales, which will result in an improvement in customer retention and future recurring revenue streams.
International Mailing revenue for the quarter was $154 million and EBIT was $11 million. Revenue declined versus the prior year due to fewer equipment upgrades and lower equipment sales, especially in the U.K. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by a postal rate change in France in the third quarter of last year, which generated $6 million of equipment sales related to postal rate updates or PROMs, and there is no similar rate change this year. EBIT margin declined year-over-year due to lower revenue, lack of PROM sales this quarter and the overall mix of business.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. Production Mail revenue for the quarter was $122 million and EBIT was $4 million. Production Mail revenue grew due to increased worldwide equipment sales during the quarter, in part because of the Drupa trade show held during the second quarter. EBIT improved when compared to the prior year, due to the growth of revenue and cost-reduction initiatives in the U.S. and Europe. The improvement in margin was partially offset by continued investment in our Volly service. Excluding the investment in Volly, EBIT margin would have been approximately 540 basis points higher.
Software revenue for the quarter was $89 million and EBIT was $1 million. Software is where we experienced the greatest effects of the challenging global economic environment. Revenue comparisons with the prior year were also challenging given the high number of large licensing deals that we closed during the third quarter of 2011. Continued austerity measures by the public sector globally are also adversely impacting our business. EBIT margin declined versus the prior year principally because of lower licensing revenue, relatively higher R&D investment and marketing spend in the quarter.
Management Services revenue for the quarter was $221 million and EBIT was $10 million. Management Services revenue and EBIT margin continue to be impacted by ongoing pricing pressures as a result of ongoing worldwide economic and competitive conditions and lower volumes. However, we continue to have positive net new written business, this coupled with our new strategic initiatives in print outsourcing are expected to drive revenue growth in the future.
Mail Services revenue was $142 million and EBIT was $17 million. Increased Standard Mail volumes and continued penetration in the workshare discount categories continue to drive revenue growth for the presort operations. Overall, Mail Services revenue declined slightly this quarter as a result of lower mail and catalog volumes in the International Mail Services business. As Murray mentioned, we're focusing on the higher growth cross-border ecommerce opportunities and are exiting the slower growth International Mail Services.
EBIT margin comparisons this quarter versus the prior year were impacted by the $18 million insurance reimbursement received in the third quarter last year. Also impacting margin was the company's continued investment in Software applications and the distribution network to facilitate the expansion of its ecommerce solutions.
Marketing Services revenue was $40 million and EBIT was $9 million. EBIT margin benefited from reduced print production costs and ongoing productivity initiatives.
That concludes my comments, and I'll turn the call over to Murray who will discuss guidance. Murray?"

We're operating in a very challenging and uncertain environment. While we expect effects of global economic uncertainty to persist, based on results to date and the expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2012 guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.
Revenue is anticipated to be flat to minus 4%, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.15 and free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. As I outlined earlier, given our intentions to further streamline the business and reduce cost while shifting to higher growth opportunities, we will incur an expected restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of $40 million to $60 million.
We are updating our GAAP EPS guidance to the range of $1.78 to $2.08 per diluted share. GAAP EPS reflects the goodwill and asset impairment charges of $0.09 per share related to our exit from our International Mail Services business, and the anticipated restructuring charge of $0.15 to $0.25 per share. GAAP EPS also includes the $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and $0.06 per share benefit from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada, both of which occurred in the first quarter of the year.

So it does, however, enhance the need for postal equipment as they look at how the rates are affected and easily implemented with our software-based systems. Of course, all of those rates are downloaded automatically. At the same time, as we look at postal restructuring, we see the post needing to look at how to provide easier access for customers in more locations, and that we would see as potentially beneficial to us, as well as how they would outsource more of their activities. They have a very aggressive workshare program, which we participate in, in our presort business, where we have 36 sites, and that also depending on how they reorganize could be beneficial. And then thirdly, as they look at creating more automation around mail, we do that automatically for our customers in our presort activity, and this eliminates their need to make the investments. So it actually enriches our presort opportunities."

And that's really what this is focused at. It provides the consumer with an all-in price, including duties, taxes, et cetera. We will then manage that and inspect the goods before they leave the country to ensure that they comply with the appropriate duties and taxes. But the customer will see an all-in price and not have any surprises. This everyone believes will actually accelerate cross-border ecommerce. We are launching to 18 countries initially, and then we'll be looking to expand that.

Yes, I mean, relative to the second quarter, if you were to compare it to the second quarter, there's some definite timing differences, particularly within accounts payable and accrued liability. One example of it, a fairly sizable number is accrued interest. We pay most of our interest on a semiannual basis. So we accrue over 2 quarters and then pay. So that creates a meaningful timing difference between the second and third quarter. On an annualized basis, it obviously washes out. Similarly, things like payroll, where we accrue at the end of a period for the number of days outstanding to pay, there was a big difference between the second and third quarter as well. There were some AR timing, accounts receivable timing that you can get big payments in just before the end of the quarter, end of quarter, so that was relatively minor. But those are the biggest items and some minor employee liability accruals. But on an annualized basis, we expect these things to even out.

Certainly, there is a question of confidence in the low end of the market.

As we have said since the beginning that Volly is really a significant change in the way people work and will work going forward, and that means it will continuously evolve. And the first requirement for that product to be successful is to have sufficient documents available to ensure that there is a real user experience and people can begin to see the benefit. What we're doing is, we look at the product as saying -- we have, as I also mentioned, signed 60 large billers with 6,500 brands, but now you have to have a structure that infuses those easily. And as we look at the processes around how we do that, we're looking at how to make that easier, simpler and quicker to bring people on so that we can get the density. And we felt we need to get some of those changes in place to create that density capability. Because if we launch the product without documents, it's going to not have the reputation that it needs. And so we have always said that, we will launch it when we believe there's enough documents for positive usage experience. Now at the same time, I also mentioned some of the financial services companies that are coming on board. But again, we have to get the connectors in place to bring those documents in."

Before we start, I'd like to express our concern and best wishes for all of those who were impacted by Hurricane Sandy. I want to make a special note of appreciation to our employees who supported other employees, customers and our operations during this period of disruption. I'm happy to report that our employees in the impacted areas escaped injury and all of our facilities are now operational.
In the third quarter, we continued to move forward on meeting our customers' needs by delivering innovative solutions and focusing on higher growth markets. Before we discuss the results for the quarter, let me share with you some thoughts on where Pitney Bowes stands today, where it's been, where it is headed. We believe we are going through a critical period in the history of our company and our industry. Many of you who know our story understand that a shift has been underway for some time. So let me review what we've done and intend to continue doing to meet that shift head on.
We recognize that we needed to take a long-term view, specifically with investments towards higher growth opportunities to be more optimally positioned for the future. Over the last several years, we took actions to mitigate the impact of the global economy and evolving customer needs. And we focused on improving operations, increasing productivity and reducing cost and providing more opportunity for innovation. These actions allowed us to remain solidly profitable, generate strong cash flows and make strategic investments despite some revenue weakness. As many of you know, last year, we completed our 3-year Strategic Transformation program aimed at streamlining our business to further support growth. The initiative was broad-based and touched just about every part of the organization across the globe. We streamlined the organization, enhanced efficiencies and market responsiveness and improved overall operations. In short, we did what needed to be done for Pitney Bowes and our stakeholders. As a result, the company is better positioned while at the same time delivering the products and services our customers want and need.
We saw the benefits of the restructuring in SG&A improvement, in our EBIT margins, in several of our business segments, and our overall ability to operate more efficiently and be more responsive to our customers. This program generated more than $300 million in net annualized savings, exceeding our targets. While the bulk of the work is complete, we continue to take cost out of the system and implement operational improvements across the business. In addition, by rethinking our cost structure and enhancing our market responsiveness, we've been able to make the investments necessary to support our long term growth strategy: To be the leading provider of solutions to help customers of all sizes manage their physical, digital and hybrid communications with their customers. Mail remains an important part of the business communications mix, and we are continuing to invest in enhancing its value to our customers.
The economic downturn is lasting longer than many expected. The various factors and measures I've mentioned have led to an ongoing and unique equilibrium at Pitney Bowes. We will simultaneously balance managing our business in an uneven global business environment, with the need to invest and take action to drive longer-term growth. To that end, and building on the success of the Strategic Transformation program, we are initiating new actions to further improve long-term growth. We believe that there are opportunities to streamline and further reduce costs, as well as address margin mix trends and strategically invest in higher growth businesses. We're committed to taking these measures to improve operational flexibility. Mike will provide more detail in his remarks.
Consistent with the shift to higher growth opportunities, today, in our earnings release, we also stated our decision to exit the portion of the International Mail Services business related to the shipment of traditional mail and catalogs. We expect the exit will be completed in the fourth quarter. We've taken a charge in the quarter to reflect an impairment of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets. Mike will also discuss this in greater detail shortly.
As for an additional investments, we have deep-rooted customer relationships and a unique understanding of the needs of the SMB and enterprise customers. It is this understanding that is driving our strategy for continued expansion of our ecommerce initiatives, cloud-based solutions, software and Volly.
Customers are looking for solutions that will help them not only manage their physical, digital and hybrid communications, but to do so in a more cost-effective way. We're excited to announce that we're expanding our cross-border ecommerce capabilities and will continue to strategically invest in technologies that make it easier for our customers to interact with their customers. Consistent with our strategy to leverage opportunities in this higher growth market, we formed a new global ecommerce business group, this group will focus on growing our cross-border ecommerce solutions and parcel services to help retailers create a seamless, online purchasing and shipping experience for consumers. Our expanding relationship with eBay is a good example. We are partnering on their recently announced Global Shipping Program or GSP to help facilitate cross-border ecommerce and simplify the challenges associated with the historically complex cross-border sale of goods.
As many of you know, eBay and Pitney Bowes have been collaborating on technology solutions and services since 2004 when we enabled our Internet postage platform to power the eBay shipping label printing service. Some 40% of sellers on eBay employ its label printing services. We are now providing technology and shipping services for the GSP, which eBay started testing during the quarter.
Through the GSP program, Pitney Bowes now supports eBay customers' shipping needs from the U.S. to 18 countries. This is particularly exciting as we look ahead to Q4 and support the holiday shipping season with our cross-border ecommerce solution.
We continue to make progress with our Volly secure digital mail service and have now signed 60 large third-party mail service providers who will offer our service to 6,500 companies and consumer brands. As we continue to work with billers and develop our software, we have decided to add and enhance our technology to provide additional capabilities that will improve the on-boarding process for billers. This will result in improving the scalability of the service and facilitating biller density. Partnering with several technology solutions that leverage the Volly platform will give us a faster path to the density necessary to move the market. Last week, for example, we, along with Broadridge Financial Services (sic) [Broadridge Financial Solutions], announced that Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and UBS Financial Services have each indicated their support for our Volly solution. However, we have determined that Volly's long-term value will be enhanced by deferring its availability to consumers until 2013.
Turning now to our earnings in the quarter, as I mentioned at the outset, there's a shift underway at Pitney Bowes to fundamentally transform our business, with a diversified set of high-growth offerings and a reduced cost structure. Allowing us to respond to continued economic pressures while still investing for our future.
Third quarter revenue benefited from growth in Production Mail, also in Mail Services, presort revenue grew as a result of increased Standard Mail volumes and continued penetration in all of the workshare discount categories. We also saw gradually improving trends in our North American mailing business as we experienced the best year-over-year comparison in 6 quarters for equipment sales.
While encouraged by these signs and investments for the future, revenue and earnings results did not meet our expectations. The decline in revenue and earnings during the quarter reflects the increasing impact of the global economic weakness, especially in our Software and International Mailing and Management Services businesses.
Adjusted EBIT margin was down year-over-year, impacted by lower revenues and the changing business mix. Finally, our free cash flow during the quarter was also lower than usual totaling $40 million. However, on a year-to-date basis, it was $551 million. On a GAAP basis, third quarter cash from operations was $69 million and $440 million year-to-date. Based on our year-to-date free cash flow, we are reaffirming our guidance range for the year of $750 million to $850 million.
Cash flow this quarter was impacted by the timing of tax refunds and payments and the timing of working capital requirements. For instance, in both taxes and accounts receivable were significant sources of cash in the second quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2011. While this quarter, both items were uses of cash.
Now I'll turn it over to Mike to review the results in greater detail with a breakdown by the segments. Mike?"

This afternoon we reported results for the third quarter of 2012. As Murray mentioned, many of the trends that we've been seeing throughout the year continued in the third quarter, specifically as it relates to the very uncertain and volatile global economic environment that continues to affect business spending patterns.
Adjusted EPS was $0.47 for the third quarter of 2012 as compared with $0.69 per share for the same period in 2011. Last year's adjusted earnings per share included a $0.05 per share benefit from an insurance reimbursement and an $0.08 per share benefit from a tax settlement with the IRS. Excluding these 2 items, comparative adjusted EPS in the third quarter last year was $0.56.
In general, adjusted results for this quarter and the prior year exclude the impact of restructuring cost, goodwill and asset impairment charges, asset sales and tax settlements that may have occurred in those periods that are not usual occurrences when considering normal ongoing operating results. A reconciliation schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release and posted to the Investor Relations section of our website.
GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.38 versus $0.85 for the prior year. As outlined in today's press release, and as Murray mentioned, we announced our intention to exit the International Mail Services business and as a result, there are $28 million of pretax noncash goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment charges affecting this quarter's GAAP results. The remainder of my discussion will focus on the comparative operations of our businesses for the periods discussed and therefore all income statement-related references or net results are on an adjusted basis.
For the third quarter, company revenue totaled $1.2 billion, a decline of 6% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined 5%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT was $181 million this quarter and adjusted EBIT margin was 14.9%. Adjusted EBIT this quarter included an incremental investment of $3 million for Volly versus last year and approximately $3 million for infrastructure, distribution and related cost associated with our ecommerce growth initiatives.
EBIT margin was also impacted by lower revenue in International Mailing and Software. Last year's EBIT margin benefited from an $18 million insurance reimbursement related to the Dallas facility fire. Adding back depreciation and amortization, EBITDA for the quarter was $241 million or $1.19 per share.
SG&A for the quarter was $401 million, a decline of $27 million versus the prior year. As a percent of revenues, SG&A was 33%. SG&A continues to benefit from ongoing productivity initiatives and good credit experience, as well as lower benefit cost this quarter.
Net interest expense in the quarter, including financing interest, was $45 million, a decline of $4 million relative to the prior year. The average interest rate was 4.7% for the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.4% versus an effective tax rate of 22.4% last year. The tax rate this quarter and last year benefited from the resolution of matters with tax authorities.
On the balance sheet and cash flow, free cash flow during the quarter was $40 million and $551 million year-to-date. On a GAAP basis, we generated $69 million in cash from operations for the quarter and $440 million year-to-date. As Murray noted, cash flow was lower this quarter than usual. Comparisons of cash flow for this quarter versus the prior year were impacted by a large tax refund of almost $100 million and the timing of tax payments in the third quarter of last year. Comparisons to the second quarter of this year were also impacted by timing of tax payments, as well as the timing of working capital requirements.
We continue to closely monitor cash flow results and focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. We returned $75 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and had $13 million of restructuring payments related to our Strategic Transformation program. We are committed to a prudent use of cash. Our priorities for cash remain reinvestment in the business, consistent with our strategy to deliver innovative solutions and pursue higher growth markets, maintaining a fair return to our shareholders and managing our debt levels. We have $3.7 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, which was $550 million less than the amount of debt at the end of last year.
As Murray highlighted, we believe that building on the success of Strategic Transformation, there are further opportunities to reduce cost and streamline the business. Therefore, we anticipate taking actions that will include organizational and management consolidations. We expect these actions will result in a pretax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter in the range of $40 million to $60 million and are anticipated to generate annualized savings in the range of $45 million to $55 million.
Now I'd like to discuss the third quarter results for each of our segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to our website in the Investor Relations section. North America Mailing revenue for the quarter was $448 million and EBIT was $169 million. During the quarter, the North American Mailing segment continued to increase year-over-year placements of Connect+ and pbWebConnect mailing systems and SendSuite Live shipping solutions. As a result, this quarter, we experienced the best year-over-year equipment sales performance in 6 quarters, although it was a decline of less than 4%.
Overall revenue declined primarily because of lower recurring revenue streams. EBIT margin was impacted by fewer lease extensions on existing equipment. Because there were fewer lease extensions this quarter, there was a higher proportion of equipment sales, which will result in an improvement in customer retention and future recurring revenue streams.
International Mailing revenue for the quarter was $154 million and EBIT was $11 million. Revenue declined versus the prior year due to fewer equipment upgrades and lower equipment sales, especially in the U.K. Revenue comparisons were also impacted by a postal rate change in France in the third quarter of last year, which generated $6 million of equipment sales related to postal rate updates or PROMs, and there is no similar rate change this year. EBIT margin declined year-over-year due to lower revenue, lack of PROM sales this quarter and the overall mix of business.
Turning to the Enterprise Business Solutions group. Production Mail revenue for the quarter was $122 million and EBIT was $4 million. Production Mail revenue grew due to increased worldwide equipment sales during the quarter, in part because of the Drupa trade show held during the second quarter. EBIT improved when compared to the prior year, due to the growth of revenue and cost-reduction initiatives in the U.S. and Europe. The improvement in margin was partially offset by continued investment in our Volly service. Excluding the investment in Volly, EBIT margin would have been approximately 540 basis points higher.
Software revenue for the quarter was $89 million and EBIT was $1 million. Software is where we experienced the greatest effects of the challenging global economic environment. Revenue comparisons with the prior year were also challenging given the high number of large licensing deals that we closed during the third quarter of 2011. Continued austerity measures by the public sector globally are also adversely impacting our business. EBIT margin declined versus the prior year principally because of lower licensing revenue, relatively higher R&D investment and marketing spend in the quarter.
Management Services revenue for the quarter was $221 million and EBIT was $10 million. Management Services revenue and EBIT margin continue to be impacted by ongoing pricing pressures as a result of ongoing worldwide economic and competitive conditions and lower volumes. However, we continue to have positive net new written business, this coupled with our new strategic initiatives in print outsourcing are expected to drive revenue growth in the future.
Mail Services revenue was $142 million and EBIT was $17 million. Increased Standard Mail volumes and continued penetration in the workshare discount categories continue to drive revenue growth for the presort operations. Overall, Mail Services revenue declined slightly this quarter as a result of lower mail and catalog volumes in the International Mail Services business. As Murray mentioned, we're focusing on the higher growth cross-border ecommerce opportunities and are exiting the slower growth International Mail Services.
EBIT margin comparisons this quarter versus the prior year were impacted by the $18 million insurance reimbursement received in the third quarter last year. Also impacting margin was the company's continued investment in Software applications and the distribution network to facilitate the expansion of its ecommerce solutions.
Marketing Services revenue was $40 million and EBIT was $9 million. EBIT margin benefited from reduced print production costs and ongoing productivity initiatives.
That concludes my comments, and I'll turn the call over to Murray who will discuss guidance. Murray?"

We're operating in a very challenging and uncertain environment. While we expect effects of global economic uncertainty to persist, based on results to date and the expectations for the fourth quarter, we are reaffirming our previously announced 2012 guidance for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.
Revenue is anticipated to be flat to minus 4%, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.15 and free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. As I outlined earlier, given our intentions to further streamline the business and reduce cost while shifting to higher growth opportunities, we will incur an expected restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of $40 million to $60 million.
We are updating our GAAP EPS guidance to the range of $1.78 to $2.08 per diluted share. GAAP EPS reflects the goodwill and asset impairment charges of $0.09 per share related to our exit from our International Mail Services business, and the anticipated restructuring charge of $0.15 to $0.25 per share. GAAP EPS also includes the $0.11 per share of net tax benefits and $0.06 per share benefit from the sale of leveraged lease assets in Canada, both of which occurred in the first quarter of the year.
Pitney Bowes is a global leader, and we believe that the steps we have taken and the actions we have underway will provide long-term benefit to our shareholders.

As we look at postal rate changes, as long as they're in a reasonable percentage, which the cap that is in place does force them to be -- it generally does not have a material effect in the near term. So it does, however, enhance the need for postal equipment as they look at how the rates are affected and easily implemented with our software-based systems. Of course, all of those rates are downloaded automatically. At the same time, as we look at postal restructuring, we see the post needing to look at how to provide easier access for customers in more locations, and that we would see as potentially beneficial to us, as well as how they would outsource more of their activities. They have a very aggressive workshare program, which we participate in, in our presort business, where we have 36 sites, and that also depending on how they reorganize could be beneficial. And then thirdly, as they look at creating more automation around mail, we do that automatically for our customers in our presort activity, and this eliminates their need to make the investments. So it actually enriches our presort opportunities."

As you look at ecommerce traffic, and we'll look to provide more definitive information in that over the coming periods, but the ecommerce traffic is growing particularly in the cross-border area. It has been challenged with the uncertainty of what fully loaded delivered cost is for buyers. So there's a significant dropout when people realize that it is a cross-border sale. And that's really what this is focused at. It provides the consumer with an all-in price, including duties, taxes, et cetera. We will then manage that and inspect the goods before they leave the country to ensure that they comply with the appropriate duties and taxes. But the customer will see an all-in price and not have any surprises. This everyone believes will actually accelerate cross-border ecommerce.

Yes, I mean, relative to the second quarter, if you were to compare it to the second quarter, there's some definite timing differences, particularly within accounts payable and accrued liability. One example of it, a fairly sizable number is accrued interest. We pay most of our interest on a semiannual basis. So we accrue over 2 quarters and then pay. So that creates a meaningful timing difference between the second and third quarter. On an annualized basis, it obviously washes out. Similarly, things like payroll, where we accrue at the end of a period for the number of days outstanding to pay, there was a big difference between the second and third quarter as well. There were some AR timing, accounts receivable timing that you can get big payments in just before the end of the quarter, end of quarter, so that was relatively minor. But those are the biggest items and some minor employee liability accruals. But on an annualized basis, we expect these things to even out.

Firstly, the high-end items, Connect+, continues to move very well, and so we aren't seeing what we'd call any disproportionate downsizing. If anything, people in the upper-market area are staying with the product because they see more feature functionality and capabilities to deliver more value. So we really don't see too much there. At the same time, as we launched WebConnect, WebConnect supplies digital services as an adjunct to the product. And so again, it's providing a larger value proposition for the customers. So I think those 2 things in the mailing business have kept the size question as relatively stable and not created any real shift in that. Certainly, there is a question of confidence in the low end of the market. The NFIB report showed that the confidence has not improved in the market, and so we would like to see that because that would give us more breadth of that market space here in the U.S. So I think those are the ways we see the lower end.
