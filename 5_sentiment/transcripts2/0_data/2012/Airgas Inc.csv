Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion. We once again delivered a strong quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.97, a 21% increase over last year on sales growth of 12%. Burdette",1453,"Thanks, Barry. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion. We once again delivered a strong quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.97, a 21% increase over last year on sales growth of 12%. Burdette volume that are still below prerecession levels. We continue to see evidence of steady economic growth in U.S. manufacturing, as well as in our Petrochemical and Energy customers. Strong growth in welding and automation equipment revenue is outpacing the remainder of our hardgoods portfolio, which is an encouraging indicator of future demand. Third quarter sales were $1.15 billion, marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 14%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 3%. During the quarter, we initiated a successful pricing option on both hardgoods and gas and rent. Gross margin improved by 140 basis points sequentially from the second quarter to 54.9% in the third, reflecting the benefit from the price increases and a favorable sales mix within gas to rent -- gas and rent. The third quarter marks our heaviest quarter of SAP implementation costs to date. Because we conferred -- converted 2 business units in the quarter, only 30 days apart, and as a result adjusted operating margin of 11.7% included a 110 basis points of SAP implementation and depreciation expense, making for a difficult comps in the prior year's 12.2%. adjusted operating margins. And that included only 30 basis points of impact related to SAP. Even with the burden of SAP implementation costs, our business continues to demonstrate its strength during a period of modest economic growth. Our return on capital increased to 100 basis over last year to 12.3% as we continue to leverage our national footprint and our industry-leading platform on rising sales volume. Since the beginning of our fiscal year on April, we've acquired 6 businesses with approximately $75 million in aggregate annual revenues. Our acquisition pipeline is far more active than it was last year and our advertise for acquisitions remain strong. We expect opportunities to continue to consolidate the fragmented U.S. package gas industry and those opportunities should increase noticeably in the next 12 to 18 months. On the strength of our third quarter results and outlook for sustained volumes in the coming quarters, we have updated our earnings guidance for fiscal '12 to a range of $4.03 to $4.07 per share, representing 21% to 22% growth over fiscal 2011. Sales trends through the holiday period were as expected, and January sales trends are just a continuation of a modest, steady growth environment. Please turn to Slide 3 to review some of our key initiatives. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. In the third quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 11% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fabrication, technology and services, and oil, gas and chemicals customer basis. New and existing Strategic Accounts customers drove particularly strong results in safety products and filler metals this quarter. Strategic Accounts present us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines and locations, and represents more than 20% of our sales. I encourage you to review our strategic products slide in the appendix in detail after our call. In the third quarter, strategic products which combine make up over 40% of our revenue increased 9% over the prior year. Safety products deliver the highest growth at 18% driven by business with new and existing large customers. Our Radnor private label products were up 16% for the quarter, long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remain strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products were 1.5x greater than those comparable OEM products. We would now like to provide an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide 4. We are progressing very well to planned phase rollout. Whereby our business units implement the new SAP system and succession. We now have more than 1/3 of our business and 3800 active users running smoothly on SAP. In the initial stages of the rollout implementation risk was a key focus area for us. Today we remain committed to minimizing implementation risks and converting the remaining business units, but much risk has been abated and we are beginning to focus more on attaining benefits. Our hardgoods infrastructure business including Airgas safety and our national buying centers and our distribution centers has been running successfully on SAP since going live in July 2010. Our first regional company, Airgas South, successfully went live on SAP at the beginning of April 2011, followed by Airgas Great Lakes at the beginning of September. During the third quarter, we implemented SAP at our Midsouth and West regional companies, bringing the number of converted regional companies to 4, all of which had been running smoothly. The third quarter mark the first in which we implemented SAP at 2 regional distribution companies in successive months. Both were successful but they require significant resources. After due consideration, we've decided to slightly expand our implementation time -- timeline, which will allow our implementation team the time to focus greater attention on pre-conversion date of preparation and post conversion support for each of the regional companies. It will also allow us to dedicate additional resources to the attainment of benefits, and also enable us to more effectively implement our normal pricing actions in the future. All of these factors will better position us to maximize value through this initiative in the near and long-term. Under an extended timeline, we will still expect to have 11 of our 12 regional distribution companies converted to SAP by the end of calendar 2012. But the remaining region converted in the first quarter of 2013. We have previously targeted to have all 12 converted by the end of September 2012. We expect incremental implementation costs to be more than offset by accelerated benefits. And we expect the extended time to have no material effect on the net EPS impact of implementation costs, benefits and depreciation as we have laid them out for each of the fiscal years 2014 -- 2013, '14 and '15. The next regional company will convert to SAP 5 weeks from now. Importantly, our core Business Support Centers into which the remaining regional company administrative functions will be consolidated upon converting to SAP are firmly in place, we should allow future conversions to go even smoother. We are actively building our telesales platform, whereby we can more effectively market industrial gases and welding hardgoods the customers whose needs don't require an in-person sales representative. In addition, we are building our strategic pricing organization led by Jay Worley and the newly created role of Vice President Strategic Pricing responsible for developing and implementing pricing practices that are consistent with our overall strategic direction and profitability goals. Based on our experience today, we are confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits we detail will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income, with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. The areas of benefits we have announced do not represent the full earnings power of our SAP conversion, however.  And we expect additional economic benefits after the implementation is completed and we tap into the potential of the new system. Our strategy has been to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery. And today, we are realizing the success of that strategy. We are delivering strong growth in operating income and earnings with attractive expansion and return on capital, while volumes are still below prerecession levels despite the heavy distraction of our SAP implementation, the reorganization of our administrative infrastructure and various product supply disruptions that have taken place over the last year. Our industry is still very fragmented and we have built the only true national platform in the business for the broadest available product of service offering. The benefits of our customer centric culture and our new sales alignment are just starting to develop and will yield even greater values for the customers, more than 1 million strong to make Airgas their supplier of choice. The combination of favorable business trends, shop -- sharp operating focus and SAP benefits offers Airgas shareholders very attractive future prospects. As I love to remind people, the best time in Airgas is now. Bob will now give you our financial review for the quarter and provide an update for guidance next year."

I'd like to start by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 5. Sales to $1.15 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth to 3% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of 7% increase i",1753,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 5. Sales to $1.15 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth to 3% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of 7% increase in gas and rent and a 14% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 4% and price was up 5%. Sequentially, total sales declined 3% from our second quarter on 2 fewer selling days and the impact of the holidays. On a daily basis, sales were comparable to the second quarter. Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from last year's gas and rent mix of 64% and slightly below the second quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 54.9%, a decline of 80 basis points from the prior year, reflecting continued out-performance of hardgoods sales, a mixed shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment and sales to large customers that generally carry lower margins and a lower net cost to serve. And they have been the clear leaders in the early stages of the recovery. On a sequential basis, gross margin improved by 140 basis points, reflecting a favorable sales mix within gas and rent towards rent on the strength of sales in our Red-D-Arc rental welder business and the favor impact -- the favorable impact of the December 1 gas and rent price increase. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $135 million, which was up 7% from last year and which included $9 million of incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Not included in adjusted operating income which are outlined in the EPS reconciliation on this slide for pretax charges of approximately $3 million related to the withdraw from the last of our multi- employer pension plans had approximately $2 million related to the previously announced business support center restructuring charges. As well as nearly a $1 million benefit from lower than previously estimated net cost related to the air products and solicited take over attempt in fiscal 2011. Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of the year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Adjusted operating margins of 11.7% for the quarter included 110 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. The prior year's adjusted operating margin of 12.2% included only 30 basis points of SAP related costs. Excluding incremental SAP costs, adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points year-over-year driven by operating leverage on strong organic sales growth. Including a net $0.04 of special charges, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.97, an increase of 21% from $0.80 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $0.97 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.08 and SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, which were substantially offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. There were approximately $77.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 10% year-over-year driven by share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.3%, an improvement of 100 basis points over last year on the strength of our improving operating income. Year-to-date adjusted cash from our operations was $417 million, and free cash flow was $175 million. The decrease in free cash flow from the prior year's $255 million reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support strong sales growth, as well as a major capital projects which I will comment on later. Free cash flow for the current and prior year quarters was $69 million and $67 million, respectively. In September, we received A2 [ph] and P2 ratings for our new commercial paper program and begin to utilize this program to reduce borrowings under our revolving line of credit during the third quarter. Amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program are classified as short-term debt on our balance sheet and are included in all of our debt related metrics. Total debt increased approximately $551 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion at December 31 reflecting $600 million spent on share repurchase program and $97 million spent on acquisitions, partially offset by debt paydown of $146 million. Our fixed flow debt ratio at the end of December was approximately 52% fixed and our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.6, comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. In December, we extended the maturity of our AR securitization program from March 2013 to December 2013 and reduced our borrowing rates slightly. We are well-positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx. Turning now to Slide 6. We'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus prior year to $1.04 billion. Same-store sales for distribution segment were up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7%, and hardgoods were up 14%, with pricing and volume each up 5%. Distribution gross margin was 55.1%, a decrease of 100 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to hardgoods and within our goods to lower margin welding and automation equipment, as well as sales to larger customers who have led to recovery. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 110 basis points from the second quarter as acceleration in sales of lower margin welding and automation was more than offset by the impact of our pricing actions and a sales mix shift the gas and rent in the third quarter. Gas and rent represented 58.7% of distribution sales in the third quarter, down from 60.2% in the prior year, and up from 58.1% in the second quarter. Operating income in the distribution segment which does not included in our location of SAP intimidation costs increased 14% year-over-year to $132 million and operating margin improved 20 basis points to 12.7% driven by operating leverage on strong organic sales growth. All other operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for all other operations were up 15% from the prior year with same-store sales up 6%. The same-store sales increase was largely driven by a significant increase in Ammonia sales on both the volume and price basis. Sequentially, daily sales at all other operations segment declined by 14% driven by the effect of seasonality in our Refrigerants, CO2, and Dry Ice businesses from our second to our third quarter. Gross margins for all other operations was 48.9%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by a mixed shift away from lower margin Refrigerants and production efficiencies gained in our CO2 business. Sequentially, the 300 and basis points increase in gross margins from the second quarter was driven -- was primarily driven by a continued mixed shift away from lower margin Refrigerants and margin improvements in our CO2 and Ammonia businesses. Operating income for other operations was $13 million and operating margin of 10.8% was down slightly by 50 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, the 240 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the effect of seasonality in the Refrigerants, CO2 and Dry Ice businesses. Please turn to Slide 7, capital expenditures. Year-to-date, our CapEx as a percent of sales was 7.5% through the third quarter. Construction in process was the asset category with the highest year-over-year growth in spending driven by the construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee, an expansion of our hardgoods distribution center in Duluth, Georgia, the buildout of our Business Support Centers and projects to expand or consolidate plans and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. The cylinders in both  tanks category were also a contributor to the year-over-year improvements in the demand for our core revenue generating assets. Gretel welders increased by $11 million due to the improvement in our Red-D-Arc rental business and excluding major business, CapEx as a percent of sales was approximately 5%. Slide 8 presents our fiscal 2012 and fourth quarter full-year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.04 dollars to $0.08 dollars, an increase of 18% to 22% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.04 of which is incremental over the prior year. For the full year, we are updating our adjusted earnings expectation to be in the range of $4.03 to $4.07 per diluted share, up 21% to 22% over fiscal '11, and includes $0.33 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, 19 of which are incremental over the last year. The previously announced range was $3.97 to $4.07. We expect same-store sales growth to land on the high single digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the 12% to 12.3% range, including the diluted impact of the increased SAP costs. CapEx is expected to be a repeat around 7.5% of sales for the year. Our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continued modest economic expansion and the guidance excludes the impact of restructuring charges. It also excludes the impact of the asset and asset impairment charges, the net impact related to the 2011 unsolicited takeover attempt and any multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges. Slide 9 presents a walk to the primary elements of our fourth quarter guidance, using third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.97 as the starting point. In the fourth quarter, the addition of 2 selling days and the follow-up of the third quarter holiday impact should provide $0.05 to $0.06 of benefit to EPS. The seasonal nature of our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a modest headwind. SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense are expected to be a slight tailwind compared to the third quarter as we'll be converting only 1 regional distribution company to SAP during the fourth quarter. We expect the core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.02 to $0.04 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and pricing gains. And now, I'll turn it back to Barry to begin our question-and-answer session."

It's going to be hard for us to hit that number this year where it's $75 million. I think we have a pretty good chance of getting close to it but you'll never know. But it my best guess right now is that it would be below that number. I don't know. I guess somewhere between $100 million and $140 million, or something like that is my best guess. That number, though, is just a plugged number, acquisitions or a lot of small companies are still holding off and waiting to sell off higher numbers. We're still 5% below peak volumes in gases and rent and we have a higher proportion of large customers than the typical independent distributor. And this has been a large customer recovery. So most of the ones we're seeing are more than 5% below peak sales volume that is in both gas and rent and hardgoods. So I think there's a lot of pent-up demand, I think we're going to have a surge in acquisitions sometime in the next 24 or 30 months. But I can't guarantee it. Pricing has been pretty good. There has been some -- I can't comment on any specific deals because we're part is the confidentiality agreements but I would say that the general feeling is pricing has moved up in the last year, probably by one turn of EBITDA. And -- but then again, it depends -- that I'm talking about for the larger ones. They -- pricing does tend to move up at this point early in the recoveries because people are anticipating better sales."

When you get growth in one area that requires certain assets, let's say, like micro bulk and large bulk and other areas, it's still have unused capacity. And we do have a fair amount of unused capacity in some asset categories in our system. So this tends to work out over time. And then there was a couple of things like we had a huge acetylene shortage this year. We had to buy a bunch of propylene thanks,, which is a substitute fuel gas and it's going to take a while for us to get all those cylinders utilized and get the acetylene cylinders that came out of the system back into the system as we recover those sales. So there's been some good dislocations, natural ones and some unnatural ones. And I think that's the biggest factor. There's been some inflation in tankage with steel prices but that's kind of leveled off. And we have a lot of different businesses. We use different asset classes and some are growing a lot faster and that also accounts for this."

And then we had a lot of training costs and then we had a lot of post conversion support costs. So it was a lot of different things and one reason it was so high is because the staging between the 2 conversions was only 30 days. So, the, what's that, Barry? Year-to-date we're 1.2 ahead on total implementation costs. It's just that we had -- we were over this quarter because of the scheduling, I would say. And these first 4 companies, and I can't stress this enough, these were the most important conversions because we established the Business Support Centers at these 4 companies. And so we've -- the next conversions, we have 8 more regional companies, they will be converted into these companies. So there won't be a back office conversion for those companies.

Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion. We have once again delivered a strong quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.97, a 21% increase over last year on sales growth of 12%. But",1461,"Thanks, Barry. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion. We have once again delivered a strong quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.97, a 21% increase over last year on sales growth of 12%. But at volumes that are still below prerecession levels. We continue to see evidence of steady economic growth in U.S. manufacturing, as well as in our Petrochemical and Energy customers. Strong growth in welding and automation equipment revenue is outpacing the remainder of our hardgoods portfolio, which is an encouraging indicator of future demand. Third quarter sales were $1.15 billion, marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 14%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 3%. During the quarter, we initiated a successful pricing action on both hardgoods and gas and rent. Gross margin improved by 140 basis points sequentially from the second quarter to 54.9% in the third, reflecting the benefit from the price increases and a favorable sales mix within gas to rent -- and rent. The third quarter marked our heaviest quarter of SAP implementation costs to date. Because we conferred -- converted 2 business units in the quarter, only 30 days apart, adjusting -- and as a result adjusted operating margin of 11.7% included a 110 basis points of SAP implementation and depreciation expense, making for a difficult comps in the prior year's 12.2%, adjusted operating margins. And that included only 30 basis points of impact related to SAP. Even with the burden of SAP implementation costs, our business continues to demonstrate its strength during a period of modest economic growth. Our return on capital increased to 100 basis over last year to 12.3% as we continue to leverage our national footprint and our industry-leading platform on rising sales volume. Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April, we've acquired 6 businesses with approximately $75 million in aggregate annual revenues. Our acquisition pipeline is far more active than it was last year and our appetite for acquisitions remain strong. We expect opportunities to continue to consolidate the fragment in U.S. package gas industry and those opportunities should increase noticeably in the next 12 to 18 months. On the strength of our third quarter results and outlook for sustained volumes in the coming quarters, we have updated our earnings guidance for fiscal '12 to a range of $4.03 to $4.07 per share, representing 21% to 22% growth over fiscal 2011. Sales trends through the holiday period were as expected, and January sales trends are just a continuation of a modest, steady growth environment. 
Please turn to Slide 3 to review some of our key initiatives. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. In the third quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 11% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fabrication, technology and services, and oil, gas and chemicals customer basis. New and existing Strategic Accounts customers drove particularly strong results in safety products and filler metals this quarter. Strategic Accounts present us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines and locations, and represent more than 20% of our sales. I encourage you to review our strategic products slide in the appendix in detail after our call. 
In the third quarter, strategic products which combine make up over 40% of our revenue increased 9% over the prior year. Safety products delivered the highest growth at 18% driven by business with new and existing large customers. Our Radnor private label products were up 16% for the quarter, long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remain strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products were 1.5x greater than those comparable OEM products. 
We would now like to provide an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide 4. We are progressing very well through our planned phase rollout. Whereby our business units implement the new SAP system in succession. We now have more than 1/3 of our business and 3800 active users running smoothly on SAP. In the initial stages of the rollout implementation risk was the key focus area for us. Today we remain committed to minimizing implementation risk and converting the remaining business units, but much risk has been abated and we are beginning to focus more on attaining benefits. Our hardgoods infrastructure business including Airgas safety and our national buying centers and our distribution centers have been running successfully on SAP since going live in July 2010. Our first regional company, Airgas South, successfully went live on SAP at the beginning of April 2011, followed by Airgas Great Lakes at the beginning of September. During the third quarter, we implemented SAP at our Midsouth and West regional companies, bringing the number of converted regional companies to 4, all of which have been running smoothly. The third quarter marked the first in which we implemented SAP at 2 regional distribution companies in successive months. Both were successful but they required significant resources. After due consideration, we've decided to slightly extend our implementation time -- timeline, which will allow our implementation team the time to focus greater attention on pre-conversion date of preparation and post conversion support for each of the regional companies. It will also allow us to dedicate additional resources to the attainment of benefits, and also enable us to more effectively implement our normal pricing actions in the future. All of these factors will better position us to maximize value through this initiative in the near and long-term. Under an extended timeline, we will still expect to have 11 of our 12 regional distribution companies converted to SAP by the end of calendar 2012. But the remaining region converted in the first quarter of 2013. We have previously targeted to have all 12 converted by the end of September 2012. We expect incremental implementation costs to be more than offset by accelerated benefits. And we expect the extended timeline to have no material effect on the net EPS impact of implementation costs, benefits and depreciation as we have laid them out for each of the fiscal years 2014 -- 2013, '14 and '15. The next regional company will convert to SAP, 5 weeks from now. 
Importantly, our 4 Business Support Centers into which the remaining regional company administrative functions will be consolidated upon converting to SAP are firmly in place, which should allow future conversions to go even smoother. We are actively building our telesales platform, whereby we can more effectively market industrial gases and welding hardgoods to customers who needs -- whose needs don't require an in-person sales representative. In addition, we are building our strategic pricing organization led by Jay Worley and the newly created role of Vice President Strategic Pricing responsible for developing and implementing pricing practices that are consistent with our overall strategic direction and profitability goals. Based on our experience today, we are confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits we detail will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income, with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. The areas of benefits we have announced do not represent the full earnings power of our SAP conversion, however.  And we expect additional economic benefits after the implementation is completed and we tap into the potential of the new system. Our strategy has been to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery. And today, we are realizing the success of that strategy. We are delivering strong growth in operating income and earnings with attractive expansion and return on capital, while volumes are still below prerecession levels despite the heavy distraction of our SAP implementation, the reorganization of our administrative infrastructure and various product supply disruptions that have taken place over the last year. 
Our industry is still very fragmented and we have built the only true national platform in the business for the broadest available product and service offering. The benefits of our customer centric culture and our new sales alignment are just starting to develop and will yield even greater value for the customers, or the 1 million strong to make Airgas their supplier of choice. The combination of favorable business trends, shop -- sharp operating focus and SAP benefits offers Airgas shareholders very attractive future prospects. As I love to remind people, the best time in Airgas is now. Bob will now give you our financial review for the quarter and provide an update for guidance next year."

I'd like to start by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 5. Sales increased to $1.15 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth to 3% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of 7%",1762,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 5. Sales increased to $1.15 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth to 3% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of 7% increase in gas and rent and a 14% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 4% and price was up 5%. Sequentially, total sales declined 3% from our second quarter on 2 fewer selling days and the impact of the holidays. On a daily basis, sales were comparable to the second quarter. Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from last year's gas and rent mix of 64% and slightly below the second quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 54.9%, a decline of 80 basis points from the prior year, reflecting continued out-performance of hardgoods sales, a mixed shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment and sales to large customers that generally carry lower margins and a lower net cost to serve. And they have been the clear leaders in the early stages of the recovery. On a sequential basis, gross margin improved by 140 basis points, reflecting a favorable sales mix within gas and rent towards rent on the strength of sales in our Red-D-Arc rental welder business and the favor impact -- the favorable impact of the December 1 gas and rent price increase. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $135 million, which was up 7% from last year and which included $9 million of incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Not included in adjusted operating income which are outlined in the EPS reconciliation on this slide were pretax charges of approximately $3 million related to the withdraw from the last of our multi-employer pension plans and approximately $2 million related to the previously announced business support center restructuring charges. As well as nearly a $1 million benefit from lower than previously estimated net cost related to the air products unsolicited take over attempt in fiscal 2011. Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of the year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. 
Adjusted operating margins of 11.7% for the quarter included 110 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. The prior year's adjusted operating margin of 12.2% included only 30 basis points of SAP related costs. Excluding incremental SAP costs, adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points year-over-year driven by operating leverage on strong organic sales growth. Including a net $0.04 of special charges, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.97, an increase of 21% from $0.80 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $0.97 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.08 and SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, which were substantially offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. There were approximately $77.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 10% year-over-year driven by share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.3%, an improvement of 100 basis points over last year on the strength of our improving operating income. Year-to-date adjusted cash from operations was $417 million, and free cash flow was $175 million. The decrease in free cash flow from the prior year's $255 million reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support strong sales growth, as well as a major capital projects which I will comment on later. Free cash flow for the current and prior year quarters was $69 million and $67 million, respectively. 
In September, we received A2 and P2 ratings for our new commercial paper program and begin to utilize this program to reduce borrowings under our revolving line of credit during the third quarter. Amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program are classified as short-term debt on our balance sheet and are included in all of our debt related metrics. Total debt increased approximately $551 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion at December 31, reflecting $600 million spent on share repurchase programs and $97 million spent on acquisitions, partially offset by debt pay down of $146 million. Our fixed float debt ratio at the end of December was approximately 52% fixed and our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.6, comfortably within our target range of 2% to 3%. 
In December, we extended the maturity of our AR securitization program from March 2013 to December 2013 and reduced our borrowing rates slightly. We are well-positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx. 
Turning now to Slide 6. We'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. 
Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus prior year to $1.04 billion. Same-store sales for distribution segment were up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7%, and hardgoods were up 14%, with pricing and volume each up 5%. Distribution gross margin was 55.1%, a decrease of 100 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to hardgoods and within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment, as well as sales to larger customers who have led to recovery. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 110 basis points from the second quarter as acceleration in sales of lower margin welding and automation equipment was more than offset by the impact of our pricing actions and a sales mix shift to gas and rent in the third quarter. 
Gas and rent represented 58.7% of distribution sales in the third quarter, down from 60.2% in the prior year, and up from 58.1% in the second quarter. Operating income in the distribution segment which does not included an allocation of SAP implementation costs increased 14% year-over-year to $132 million and operating margin improved 30 basis points to 12.7% driven by operating leverage on strong organic sales growth. All other operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. Sales for all other operations were up 15% from the prior year with same-store sales up 6%. The same-store sales increase was largely driven by a significant increase in Ammonia sales on both the volume and price basis. Sequentially, daily sales at all other operations segment declined by 14% driven by the effect of seasonality in our Refrigerants, CO2, and Dry Ice businesses, from our second to our third quarter. Gross margins for all other operations was 48.9%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by a mixed shift away from lower margin Refrigerants and production efficiencies gained in our CO2 business. Sequentially, the 310 basis points increase in gross margins from the second quarter was driven -- was primarily driven by a continued mixed shift away from lower margin Refrigerants and margin improvements in our CO2 and Ammonia businesses. Operating income for our other operations was $13 million and operating margin of 10.8% was down slightly by 50 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, the 240 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the effect of seasonality in the Refrigerants, CO2 and Dry Ice businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 7, capital expenditures. Year-to-date, our CapEx as a percent of sales was 7.5% through the third quarter. Construction in process was the asset category with the highest year-over-year growth in spending driven by the construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee, an expansion of our hardgoods distribution center in Duluth, Georgia, the build-out of our Business Support Centers and projects to expand or consolidate plans and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. The cylinders in both  tanks category were also a contributor to the year-over-year increase has improved gas and rent same-store sales, reflect improvements in the demand for our core revenue generating assets. Gretel welders increased by $11 million due to the improvement in our Red-D-Arc rental welder business and excluding major business, CapEx as a percent of sales was approximately 5%. 
Slide 8 presents our fiscal 2012 and fourth quarter full-year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.04 dollars to $1.08 dollars, an increase of 18% to 22% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.04 of which is incremental over the prior year. For the full year, we are updating our adjusted earnings expectation to be in the range of $4.03 to $4.07 per diluted share, up 21% to 22% over fiscal '11, and includes $0.33 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, 19 of which are incremental over the last year. The previously announced range was $3.97 to $4.07. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high single digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the 12% to 12.3% range, including the diluted impact of the increased SAP costs. CapEx is expected to be a rate B around 7.5% of sales for the year. Our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continued modest economic expansion and the guidance excludes the impact of restructuring charges. It also excludes the impact of the asset -- of asset impairment charges, the net impact related to the 2011 unsolicited takeover attempt and any multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges. 
Slide 9 presents a walk through the primary elements of our fourth quarter guidance, using third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.97 as the starting point. In the fourth quarter, the addition of 2 selling days and the follow-up of the third quarter holiday impact should provide $0.05 to $0.06 of benefit to EPS. The seasonal nature of our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a modest headwind. SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense are expected to be a slight tailwind compared to the third quarter as we'll be converting only 1 regional distribution company to SAP during the fourth quarter. We expect the core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.02 to $0.04 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and pricing gains. And now, I'll turn it back to Barry to begin our question-and-answer session."

So I was a little surprised by the size of their same-store sales number -- numbers. One other thing I might comment on, they said that sales of equipment -- welding equipment were very, very strong, which I'm glad to hear. That's a good sign for the industry, in general.

But it my best guess right now is that it would be below that number, I wouldn't -- I don't know, I guess somewhere between $100 million and $140 million, or something like that is my best guess. That number, though, is just a plugged number. Acquisitions are -- a lot of small companies are still holding off and waiting to sell off higher numbers. We're still 5% below peak volumes in gases and rent and we have a higher proportion of large customers than the typical independent distributor. And this has been a large customer recovery. So most of the ones we're seeing are more than 5% below peak sales volume that is in both gas and rent, and gas and hardgoods. So I think there's a lot of pent-up demand, I think we're going to have a surge in acquisitions sometime in the next 24 or 30 months. But I can't guarantee it. Pricing has been pretty good. There has been some -- I can't comment on any specific deals because we're parties to confidentiality agreements, but I would say that the general feeling is pricing has moved up in the last year, probably by 1 turn of EBITDA. And -- but then again, it depends -- that I'm talking about for the larger ones. They say pricing does tend to move up at this point early in the recoveries because people are anticipating better sales."

When you get growth in one area that requires certain assets, let's say, like micro bulk and large bulk and in other areas, you still have unused capacity. And we do have a fair amount of unused capacity in some asset categories in our system. So this tends to work out over time. And then there was a couple of things like we had a huge acetylene shortage this year. We had to buy a bunch of propylene tanks, which is a substitute fuel gas and it's going to take a while for us to get all those cylinders utilized and get the acetylene cylinders that came out of the system back into the system as we recover those sales. So there's been some good dislocations, natural ones and some unnatural ones, and I think that's the biggest factor. There's been some inflation in tankage with steel prices but that's kind of leveled off. And we have a lot of different businesses, which use different asset classes and some are growing a lot faster and that also accounts for this."

They're not like some of the Wild West guys that you have in that market. But that was Praxair distributors that they bought the big ones. And a good house, no question about it. But fairly high hardgoods company. And we're doing very well in Houston. We have a very, very strong base there and in the last few years, we built out a lot of our gas capabilities. We have a very strong thrust into the whole Petrochemical sector and the construction work that's taking place in that sector as well, including the broad spectrum of bulk, micro-bulk, specially gases, hydrocarbons. And so we're excited about our prospects in that part of the world. And of course, the low-cost shell gas is really driving a lot of expansion in that area and other areas of the country. But, so I don't think it's -- I think it's probably neutral to our overall growth stance in Houston and acquisition."

Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion. We have once again delivered a strong quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.97, a 21% increase over last year on sales growth of 12%. But",1460,"Thanks, Barry. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion. We have once again delivered a strong quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.97, a 21% increase over last year on sales growth of 12%. But at volumes that are still below prerecession levels. We continue to see evidence of steady economic growth in U.S. manufacturing, as well as in our Petrochemical and Energy customers. Strong growth in welding and automation equipment revenue is outpacing the remainder of our hardgoods portfolio, which is an encouraging indicator of future demand. 
Third quarter sales were $1.15 billion, marked by a strong same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 14%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 3%. During the quarter, we initiated a successful pricing action on both hardgoods and gas and rent. Gross margin improved by 140 basis points sequentially from the second quarter to 54.9% in the third, reflecting the benefit from the price increases and a favorable sales mix within gas to rent -- and rent. The third quarter marked our heaviest quarter of SAP implementation costs to date. 
Because we conferred -- converted 2 business units in the quarter, only 30 days apart, adjusting -- and as a result adjusted operating margin of 11.7% included a 110 basis points of SAP implementation and depreciation expense, making for a difficult comps in the prior year's 12.2%, adjusted operating margin. And that included only 30 basis points of impact related to SAP. Even with the burden of SAP implementation costs, our business continues to demonstrate its strength during a period of modest economic growth.  Our return on capital increased to 100 basis over last year to 12.3% as we continue to leverage our national footprint and our industry-leading platform on rising sales volume. 
Since the beginning of our fiscal year in April, we've acquired 6 businesses with approximately $75 million in aggregate annual revenues. Our acquisition pipeline is far more active than it was last year and our appetite for acquisitions remain strong. We expect opportunities to continue to consolidate the fragmented U.S. package gas industry and those opportunities should increase noticeably in the next 12 to 18 months. 
On the strength of our third quarter results and outlook for sustained volumes in the coming quarters, we have updated our earnings guidance for fiscal '12 to a range of $4.03 to $4.07 per share, representing 21% to 22% growth over fiscal 2011. Sales trends through the holiday period were as expected, and January sales trends suggest a continuation of a modest, steady growth environment. 
Please turn to Slide 3 to review some of our key initiatives. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. In the third quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 11% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fabrication, technology and services, and oil, gas and chemicals customer basis. New and existing Strategic Accounts customers drove particularly strong results in safety products and filler metals this quarter. Strategic Accounts present us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines and locations, and represent more than 20% of our sales. I encourage you to review our strategic products slide in the appendix in detail after our call. 
In the third quarter, strategic products which combined make up over 40% of our revenue increased 9% over the prior year. Safety products delivered the highest growth at 18% driven by business with new and existing large customers. Our Radnor private label products were up 16% for the quarter, long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remain strong. And in addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products were 1.5x greater than those comparable OEM products. 
We would now like to provide an update on the status of our SAP conversion. Please turn to Slide 4. We are progressing very well through our planned phase rollout. Whereby our business units implement the new SAP system in succession. We now have more than 1/3 of our business and 3800 active users running smoothly on SAP. In the initial stages of the rollout implementation risk was a key focus area for us.  Today we remain committed to minimizing implementation risk and converting the remaining business units, but much risk has been abated and we are beginning to focus more on attaining benefits. 
Our hardgoods infrastructure business including Airgas safety and our national buying centers and our distribution centers have been running successfully on SAP since going live in July 2010. Our first regional company, Airgas South, successfully went live on SAP at the beginning of April 2011, followed by Airgas Great Lakes at the beginning of September. During the third quarter, we implemented SAP at our Midsouth and West regional companies, bringing the number of converted regional companies to 4, all of which have been running smoothly. The third quarter marked the first in which we implemented SAP at 2 regional distribution companies in successive months. Both were successful but they required significant resources. 
After due consideration, we've decided to slightly extend our implementation time -- timeline, which will allow our implementation team the time to focus greater attention on pre-conversion date of preparation and post conversion support for each of the regional companies. It will also allow us to dedicate additional resources to the attainment of benefits, and also enable us to more effectively implement our normal pricing actions in the future. All of these factors will better position us to maximize value through this initiative in the near and long-term. 
Under an extended timeline, we will still expect to have 11 of our 12 regional distribution companies converted to SAP by the end of calendar 2012 with the remaining region converted in the first quarter of 2013. We have previously targeted to have all 12 converted by the end of September 2012. We expect incremental implementation costs to be more than offset by accelerated benefits. And we expect the extended timeline to have no material effect on the net EPS impact of implementation costs, benefits and depreciation as we have laid them out for each of the fiscal years 2014 -- 2013, '14 and '15. The next regional company will convert to SAP, 5 weeks from now. 
Importantly, our 4 Business Support Centers into which the remaining regional company administrative functions will be consolidated upon converting to SAP are firmly in place, which should allow future conversions to go even smoother. 
We are actively building our telesales platform, whereby we can more effectively market industrial gases and welding hardgoods to customers who needs -- whose needs don't require an in-person sales representative. In addition, we are building our strategic pricing organization led by Jay Worley and the newly created role of Vice President Strategic Pricing responsible for developing and implementing pricing practices that are consistent with our overall strategic direction and profitability goals. 
Based on our experience today, we are confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits we detail will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income, with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. The areas of benefits we have announced do not represent the full earnings power of our SAP conversion, however, and we expect additional economic benefits after the implementation is completed and we tap into the potential of the new system. 
Our strategy has been to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery. And today, we are realizing the success of that strategy. We are delivering strong growth in operating income and earnings with attractive expansion and return on capital, while volumes are still below prerecession levels despite the heavy distraction of our SAP implementation, the reorganization of our administrative infrastructure and various product supply disruptions that have taken place over the last year. 
Our industry is still very fragmented and we have built the only true national platform in the business for the broadest available product and service offering. The benefits of our customer centric culture and our new sales alignment are just starting to develop and will yield even greater value for the customers, or the 1 million strong to make Airgas their supplier of choice. The combination of favorable business trends, shop -- sharp operating focus and SAP benefits offers Airgas shareholders very attractive future prospects. As I love to remind people, the best time in Airgas is now. 
Bob will now give you our financial review for the quarter and provide an update for guidance next year."
24504,145552728,211617,"Airgas Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2012",2012-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Airgas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 5. Sales increased to $1.15 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 3% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of 7%",1762,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 5. Sales increased to $1.15 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 3% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of 7% increase in gas and rent and a 14% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 4% and price was up 5%. Sequentially, total sales declined 3% from our second quarter on 2 fewer selling days and the impact of the holidays. On a daily basis, sales were comparable to the second quarter. Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from last year's gas and rent mix of 64% and slightly below the second quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 54.9%, a decline of 80 basis points from the prior year, reflecting continued out-performance of hardgoods sales, a mixed shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment and sales to large customers that generally carry lower margins and a lower net cost to serve. And they have been the clear leaders in the early stages of the recovery. On a sequential basis, gross margin improved by 140 basis points, reflecting a favorable sales mix within gas and rent -- towards rent on the strength of sales in our Red-D-Arc rental welder business and the favor impact -- the favorable impact of the December 1 gas and rent price increase. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $135 million, which was up 7% from last year and which included $9 million of incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Not included in adjusted operating income, which are outlined in the EPS reconciliation on this slide, were pretax charges of approximately $3 million related to the withdraw from the last of our multi-employer pension plans and approximately $2 million related to the previously announced business support center restructuring charges, as well as nearly a $1 million benefit from lower than previously estimated net cost related to the air products unsolicited takeover attempt in fiscal 2011. Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of the year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. 
Adjusted operating margins of 11.7% for the quarter included 110 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. The prior year's adjusted operating margin of 12.2% included only 30 basis points of SAP related costs. Excluding incremental SAP costs, adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points year-over-year driven by operating leverage on strong organic sales growth. Including a net $0.04 of special charges, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.97, an increase of 21% from $0.80 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $0.97 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.08 and SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, which were substantially offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. 
There were approximately $77.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 10% year-over-year driven by share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.3%, an improvement of 100 basis points over last year on the strength of our improving operating income. Year-to-date adjusted cash from operations was $417 million, and free cash flow was $175 million. The decrease in free cash flow from the prior year's $255 million reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital to support strong sales growth, as well as some major capital projects which I will comment on later. Free cash flow for the current and prior year quarters was $69 million and $67 million, respectively. 
In September, we received A2 and P2 ratings for our new commercial paper program and begin to utilize this program to reduce borrowings under our revolving line of credit during the third quarter. Amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program are classified as short-term debt on our balance sheet and are included in all of our debt related metrics. Total debt increased approximately $551 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion at December 31, reflecting $600 million spent on share repurchase programs and $97 million spent on acquisitions, partially offset by debt pay down of $146 million. Our fixed float debt ratio at the end of December was approximately 52% fixed and our debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.6, comfortably within our target range of 2% to 3%. 
In December, we extended the maturity of our AR securitization program from March 2013 to December 2013 and reduced our borrowing rates slightly. We are well-positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx. 
Turning now to Slide 6. We'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. 
Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus prior year to $1.04 billion. Same-store sales for distribution segment were up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7%, and hardgoods were up 14%, with pricing and volume each up 5%. Distribution gross margin was 55.1%, a decrease of 100 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to hardgoods and within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment, as well as sales to larger customers who have led to recovery. 
Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased by 110 basis points from the second quarter as acceleration in sales of lower margin welding and automation equipment was more than offset by the impact of our pricing actions and a sales mix shift to gas and rent in the third quarter. 
Gas and rent represented 58.7% of distribution sales in the third quarter, down from 60.2% in the prior year, and up from 58.1% in the second quarter. Operating income in the distribution segment, which does not included an allocation of SAP implementation costs, increased 14% year-over-year to $132 million and operating margin improved 30 basis points to 12.7% driven by operating leverage on strong organic sales growth. All other operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. Sales for all other operations were up 15% from the prior year with same-store sales up 6%. The same-store sales increase was largely driven by a significant increase in Ammonia sales on both a volume and price basis. 
Sequentially, daily sales at all other operations segment declined by 14% driven by the effect of seasonality in our Refrigerants, CO2, and Dry Ice businesses, from our second to our third quarter. Gross margins for all other operations was 48.9%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by a mixed shift away from lower margin Refrigerants and production efficiencies gained in our CO2 business. 
Sequentially, the 310 basis points increase in gross margins from the second quarter was driven -- was primarily driven by a continued mixed shift away from lower margin Refrigerants and margin improvements in our CO2 and Ammonia businesses. Operating income for our other operations was $13 million and operating margin of 10.8% was down slightly by 50 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, the 240 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the effect of seasonality in the Refrigerants, CO2 and Dry Ice businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 7, capital expenditures. Year-to-date, our CapEx as a percent of sales was 7.5% through the third quarter. Construction in process was the asset category with the highest year-over-year growth in spending driven by the construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee, an expansion of our hardgoods distribution center in Duluth, Georgia, the build-out of our Business Support Centers and projects to expand or consolidate plans and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. The cylinders in both  tanks category were also a contributor to the year-over-year increase as improved gas and rent same-store sales, reflect improvements in the demand for our core revenue generating assets. Gretel welders increased by $11 million due to the improvement in our Red-D-Arc rental welder business and excluding major business, CapEx as a percent of sales was approximately 5%. 
Slide 8 presents our fiscal 2012 and fourth quarter full-year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the high single digits, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.04 dollars to $1.08 dollars, an increase of 18% to 22% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.04 of which is incremental over the prior year. 
For the full year, we are updating our adjusted earnings expectation to be in the range of $4.03 to $4.07 per diluted share, up 21% to 22% over fiscal '11, and includes $0.33 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, 19 of which are incremental over the last year. The previously announced range was $3.97 to $4.07. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the high single digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the 12% to 12.3% range, including the diluted impact of the increased SAP costs. 
CapEx is expected to be a rate B around 7.5% of sales for the year. Our fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continued modest economic expansion and the guidance excludes the impact of restructuring charges. It also excludes the impact of the asset -- of asset impairment charges, the net impact related to the 2011 unsolicited takeover attempt and any multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges. 
Slide 9 presents a walk through the primary elements of our fourth quarter guidance, using third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.97 as the starting point. In the fourth quarter, the addition of 2 selling days and the follow-up of the third quarter holiday impact should provide $0.05 to $0.06 of benefit to EPS. The seasonal nature of our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a modest headwind. SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense are expected to be a slight tailwind compared to the third quarter as we'll be converting only 1 regional distribution company to SAP during the fourth quarter. We expect the core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.02 to $0.04 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and pricing gains. 
And now, I'll turn it back to Barry to begin our question-and-answer session."

But I think a lot of those numbers come from Canada and I'm not familiar with the timing of their pricing actions and how much of those sales resulted from pricing actions, I don't really know. So I was a little surprised by the size of their same-store sales number -- numbers. One other thing I might comment on, they said that sales of equipment -- welding equipment were very, very strong, which I'm glad to hear. That's a good sign for the industry, in general.

It's going to be hard for us to hit that number this year, we're at $75 million. I think we have a pretty good chance to getting close to it but, you never know. But it’s my best guess right now is that it would be below that number, I wouldn't -- I don't know, I guess somewhere between $100 million and $140 million, or something like that is my best guess. That number, though, is just a plugged number. Acquisitions are -- a lot of small companies are still holding off and waiting to sell off higher numbers. We're still 5% below peak volumes in gases and rent and we have a higher proportion of large customers than the typical independent distributor. And this has been a large customer recovery. So most of the ones we're seeing are more than 5% below peak sales volume, that is in both gas and rent, and gas and hardgoods. So I think there's a lot of pent-up demand, I think we're going to have a surge in acquisitions sometime in the next 24 or 30 months. But I can't guarantee it. Pricing has been pretty good. There has been some -- I can't comment on any specific deals because we're parties to confidentiality agreements, but I would say that the general feeling is pricing has moved up in the last year, probably by 1 turn of EBITDA. And -- but then again, it depends -- that I'm talking about for the larger ones. They say pricing does tend to move up at this point early in the recoveries because people are anticipating better sales."

When you get growth in one area that requires certain assets, let's say, like micro bulk and large bulk and in other areas, you still have unused capacity. And we do have a fair amount of unused capacity in some asset categories in our system. So this tends to work out over time. And then there was a couple of things like we had a huge acetylene shortage this year. We had to buy a bunch of propylene tanks, which is a substitute fuel gas and it's going to take a while for us to get all those cylinders utilized and get the acetylene cylinders that came out of the system back into the system as we recover those sales. So there's been some good dislocations, natural ones and some unnatural ones, and I think that's the biggest factor. There's been some inflation in tankage with steel prices but that's kind of leveled off. And we have a lot of different businesses, which use different asset classes and some are growing a lot faster and that also accounts for this."

But it's slow and steady and -- but it's nice to see these areas recover.

And that goes into the mix sometimes. But being an old acquisition lawyer and working mostly in the middle market, I used to tell my clients don't take stock. You worked your whole life, it's now time to diversify. And so the preference of these sellers is to take cash. Now, we've given stock out a few deals over the years and we're perfectly willing to do it if it will help. We like to buy asset deals, we don't like tail liabilities. We have very, very clean balance sheet. We've worked very, very hard. Bob made the point today, we're out of our last multi-employer pension plan. So we have no unfunded pension liabilities, no material, environmental or other kind of litigation liabilities and so we work hard on that. So we usually want to buy assets and stock for assets can be complicated and sellers, most sellers don't want it. And so it doesn't happen a lot."

Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion of our quarterly and full year results. 
However, before reviewing our earnings, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss with you the leadership transition announced this morning in conjunction with our financial results. Following our 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, which will be held in mid-August, I will assume the role of Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. At that time, I'm pleased that Mike Molinini, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Airgas since 2005, will succeed me as President and Chief Executive Officer. As part of this leadership transition, our Board has unanimously elected Mike to serve as a Director of the company effective immediately and he will stand for reelection to the Board at the 2012 annual meeting. This transition is a product of extensive leadership succession planning by our Board and is part of an evolutionary process. Consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, the Board has been very involved in the development of our management team over the course of many years and has kept a eye on the career path, leadership capabilities and performance of many outstanding individuals. They have watched and encourage not only Mike's development but the development of a deep and talented bench that is driving the -- that is the driving force behind the growing strength of our business. 
Most of you and Mike and are familiar with his outstanding record of accomplishment. Mike joined Airgas in 1997 as groups Vice President of Airgas Direct Industrial and he led the build out of our hardgoods supply chain including development of the Radnor private label program. He then served as a Senior Vice President of Airgas' hardgoods service responsibility for directing sales and marketing, procurement, and distribution central logistics. Most recently, since 2005, Mike has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, responsible for the day-to-day operations of our company. Over the last couple of years, one of his most notable accomplishments has been leading the successful development and rollout of our new SAP system and he's done that while maintaining a sharp operating focus on the business and delivering robust same-store sales and double-digit earnings growth. 
The Board and I believe in Mike's talents, strategic insight and keen grasp of our business will benefit Airgas as we build on the momentum of our numerous growth initiatives. It's clearly an outstanding fit for the job and we are confident that he will continue to build on our 3-year track record of operational excellence and shareholder value creation. 
In my new role as Executive Chairman, I will continue to oversee some key areas of the business, about which I am very passionate. Business strategy development, acquisitions, risk management and governance. In addition, I will continue to serve as Chairman of the company's management committee. Mike and I, together with Bob McLaughlin and other key executives will continue to be actively engaged with our shareholders in the investment community at large. Our vision and strategy remain unchanged and we have never been stronger. As I always say, the best time at Airgas is now. 
The benefits of our customer-centric culture and our new sales alignment are just starting to develop and we'll yield even greater value for the customers more than 1 million strong to make Airgas their supplier of choice. Furthermore, the combination of favorable business trends, sharp operating focus and SAP benefits offers Airgas shareholders very attractive future prospects. Accordingly, we believe this is an opportune time for Mike to take on increased responsibility. I want to stress that his leadership transition is a natural result of the Board's long-term focus on developing deep management team and it represents the next step in the evolution of Airgas. As Airgas's is founder and largest shareholder, I am committed to making share that this plan is successful and I am looking forward to working with Mike and the entire management team in the years ahead. 
Fiscal 2012 was another outstanding year for Airgas and its shareholders, thanks, to the effort of our more than 15,000 associates. Our record sales and earnings performance this year is a testament to our strong operating culture and customer-centric approach as business. We delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $4.11, representing 23% growth on sales of $4.7 billion and operating margin before SAP costs of 13.1%. And we generated strong free cash flow of $262 million on adjusted cash flow from operations of $593 million. Making these result even more impressive is that we delivered them in the midst of a complex ERP implementation at nearly half of our regional distribution businesses which thus far has been very successful. 
Complementing our 10% same-store sales growth in fiscal 2012 for the acquisitions of 8 businesses with aggregate annual revenues of more than $106 million including our recent purchase of Norton Smith with 17 locations across Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama. Our acquisition pipeline continues to improve and I'm optimistic we'll achieve our annual target of $150 million in acquired sales during fiscal 2013. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings were also a record, $1.11 per share which included $0.09 of SAP headwinds. That represents a 26% increase over the prior year on sales of $1.2 billion and operating margin before the SAP costs of 13.1%. Same-store sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter comprised of 15% in hardgoods and 9% in gas and rent. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, demand was strong in this quarter across most of our core business with particular strength in manufacturing, petrochemical and energy customers and noticeable improvement in our construction customer base despite the lack of large, new construction projects. 
Our product line efficiency business also performed well relative to our expectations, highlighted by strong preseason demand in our Refrigerants business that contributed nicely to our earnings this quarter. The strength of our hardgoods same-store sales growth relative to gas and rent and a sales mix shift within hardgoods to welding automation equipment reflect the continued, modest expansion and reinvestment we're seeing by larger customers in the manufacturing intensive regions of the U.S. While the mix shift has a dilutive effect on our gross margin, we have continued to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform to increase our underlying operating margin and expand our return on capital to 12.5% this quarter, 60 basis points over the prior year. 
As far as sales trends are concerned, we saw a very robust January and February which we really didn't expect because they tend to be muted. And then we saw a flattening of the growth in March. So, maybe that was a seasonal effect of the warm weather, pushing sales or pulling sales to the front of the quarter. March continues steady, April continues steady. We've surveyed all of our business leaders in the last couple of weeks and the outlook is for continued steady growth, slow but steady growth across the economy and customer base. 
As I love to remind people, the best in time at Airgas is now. Now let me hand it off to Mike to review some of our key initiatives."

Before I discuss our results, I'd like to thank Peter and the Board for the confidence they placed on me. I'm honored and energized by this opportunity and look forward to enhancing Airgas this position as one of the premier industrial gas companies in the world. 
Under Peter's stewardship, Airgas has achieved remarkable success over the last 30 years. Both recently, the company weathered the financial crisis and emerged stronger than ever. I'm excited about the challenge of leading Airgas and building upon a solid foundation Peter has established. As CEO, I will continue to lead the company's operations and information technology initiatives while also assuming responsibility for finance and human resources. Peter and I have worked successfully together for many years and I'm pleased that he will stay actively involved in Airgas, continuing to contribute the vision and leadership that have helped make the company what it is today. I plan to continue his tradition of strong, active leadership and nurturing Airgas' entrepreneurial culture in pursuit of the tremendous opportunities ahead. Airgas is the leading package gas company in the U.S. and  a significant expansion of our bulk gas production and distribution capabilities in recent years, combined with our broad offering of hardgoods and value weighted services have created a value proposition for our diverse customer base that is virtually unrivaled in the industry. Our performance over the years and in particular through the recession really demonstrates the resilience of our business model. Our success also demonstrate the loyalty of our customers and the tremendous work ethic and commitment to excellence of all Airgas associates, all resulting in an extremely compelling track record of creating shareholder value. Our more than 15,000 associates are the best in the business, and together, we will continue to focus on operating safely, serving our loyal customers and growing the business for years to come. I intend to hit the ground running on day 1 to continue the success of this great company. And I look forward to working with Peter and all of the other members of our team. 
And now I'd like to continue the discussion of our fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 3. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. Strategic Accounts presents us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities come about in terms of product line and locations and represent more than 20% of total sales. In the fourth quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 11% from the prior year, driven by new account signing across all customer segments and by increased activity on our existing metal fabrication, oil and gas and chemicals customer basis. 
As Peter mentioned, our construction customer base is showing noticeable improvement on the strength of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business which has resulted capacity expansion projects and turnarounds in the oil and gas and chemicals segment, as well as strong turnarounds in the refineries and power sectors. 
I encourage you to review our strategic products slide in the appendix in detail after our call. In the fourth quarter, strategic products which make up about 40% of our revenue increased 10% over the prior year. Safety products once again deliver the highest growth at 17% driven by business with new and existing large customers. Our Radnor private label products were up 14% for the quarter, the long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty, within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor product are 1.5x greater than those of comparable OEM products. 
We are progressing well through our planned base rollout of SAP whereby our business units implement the new system in succession. At this point, we are more than half -- we have more than half of our business running smoothly on SAP and we still expect to have 11 of 12 regions converted by December 2012 with the remaining region converted in the first quarter of calendar 2013. 
On Monday, we successfully converted another region to SAP and Mike back office support functions into 1 of our 4 Business Support Centers. The next region will convert in less than 4 weeks from now. We remain committed to minimizing implementation risk and converting the rest of our business units to SAP, but much risk has been abated and we are shifting our focus to attain benefits. Based on our experience to-date, we're confident by the end of the calendar 2013, the benefits we detail will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income with the likelihood that deed benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. The areas of benefits we have announced do not represent the full earnings power of our SAP conversion. However, and we expect additional economic benefits after the implementation is completed and we tap into the potential of the new system. Thank you. 
And now Bob will now give you our financial review for the quarter and provide an update for guidance next year."

Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results for the fourth quarter. Please note that prior period amounts have been adjusted for the retrospective application of a change in the method of accounting for a portion of our hardgoods inventory from LIFO-to-average-cost method. In conjunction with the rollout of SAP and our operating realignment into 4 divisions, we are merging our distribution businesses into a single LLC which necessitates a standardizing our inventory valuation method. Prior to this change in accounting, only 10% of our inventory was accounted for in the LIFO method. The impact of this change is immaterial to all periods presented. 
Sales increased 13% year-over-year to $1.24 billion reflecting acquisitions growth of 2% and total same-store sales growth of 11% comprised of a 9% increase in gas and rent and a 15% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 7% and price was up 4%. Sequentially, total sales increased 8% from the third quarter on 2 additional selling days and the follow-up of the third quarter holiday impact. On a daily sales basis, sales increased 4% over the third quarter. Gas and rent represented approximately 62% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from approximately 63% in the prior year and in the third quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.9%, a decline of 40 basis points from the prior year, reflecting continued performance of hardgoods sales and a mixed shift within hardgoods to lower margin, welding and automation equipment. On a sequential basis, gross margin declined by 100 basis points as the strong -- as strong performance in our lower margin Refrigerants business and hardgoods mixed shift more than offset the favorable impact of our third quarter pricing actions. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $152 million which was up 13% from last year and which included $5 million of incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Not included in adjusted operating income were pretax charges of approximately $4 million related to the previously announced business support center restructuring and a $2 million impairment charge related to one of our smaller, less efficient separation units. 
Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Adjusted operating margin of 12.2% for the quarter included 90 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. The prior year's adjusted operating margin of 12.2% included only 50 basis points of SAP related costs. Excluding these incremental SAP costs, adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year driven by operating leverage on strong organic sales growth. Excluding $0.06 in tax benefits related to the LLC reorganization and the true up of foreign tax liabilities, net of $0.05 of restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted earnings per share were $1.11, an increase of 26% from $0.88 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.11 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.05 in SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, which were offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. Our adjusted tax -- our adjusted effective tacks rate, which excludes the $0.06 per diluted share income tax benefit resulting from the LLC reorganization was 36.2% for the fourth quarter and 37.3% for the full year. The LLC reorganization enables us to realize certain state tax benefits that previously required evaluation allowance. There were approximately $78.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 7% year-over-year, driven by share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.5%, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year on the strength of our improving operating income. Adjusted cash from operations for the full year was $593 million and free cash flow was $262 million. The decrease in free cash flow from the prior year is $387 million, reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital that supports strong sales growth, as well as a major capital projects which I will comment on later. Total debt increased approximately $398 million year-over-year to $2.16 billion on March 31, reflecting strong operating cash, offset by $300 million spent on share repurchase programs and $160 million spent on acquisitions. Our fixed float debt ratio at the end of December was approximately 52% fixed and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.5 comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. We are well positioned to continue to effectively manage our leverage within our targeted range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in gross CapEx. 
Turning now to Slide 5, we'll  look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results had not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. 
Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1.11 billion. Same-store sales for distribution segments were up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7%, and hardgoods were up 15%, with pricing up 4% and volume up 6%. Distribution gross margin was 54.5%, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to hardgoods and within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment. 
Sequentially, distribution gross margins decreased by 60 basis points from the third quarter, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to lower margin hardgoods. Underlying gross margins excluding the mix impacts on both hardgoods each improved sequentially for the third quarter. 
Gas and rent represented 57.2% of distribution sales in the fourth quarter, down from 59% in the prior year and 58.7% in the third quarter. Operating income in distribution segment increased 12% year-over-year to $146 million and operating income improved to 13.1% comparable to the prior year despite the dilutive effect of the mixed shift hardgoods and a 20 basis points impact of higher SAP depreciation expense. 
All other operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide businesses. Sales for all other operations were up 24% from the prior year with same-store sales up 18%. The same-store sales increased was largely driven by an increase in both Refrigerants and Ammonia sales, each on strong volume and pricing. Sequentially, sales in all other operations segment increased 16% in total and 12% on a daily basis driven by the strength in Refrigerants, partially offset by normal seasonality in our Dry Ice business. Gross margin for all other operations was 45.5%, an increase of 270 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin expansion in our Refrigerants and CO2 businesses. Sequentially, the 340 basis point decrease in gross margins from the third quarter was primarily driven by the mix shift towards lower margin Refrigerants and normal seasonality within our Dry Ice business. Operating income for all other operations was $15 million, an increase of $6 million over the prior year and operating margin of 10.9% was up 330 basis points year-over-year, driven by a margin expansion in our Refrigerants, CO2 and Ammonia businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. Fiscal 2012 CapEx represented 7.5% of sales. Construction in process was the asset category with the highest year-over-year growth in spending driven by the construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee, the expansion of our hardgoods distribution centers in Duluth, Georgia and Bristol, Pennsylvania, the buildout of our Business Support Centers and projects to expand or consolidate plans and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. The cylinder and bulk tanks category also were a contributor to the year-over-year increase has improved gas and rent same-store sales, reflect improvements in demand for our core revenue generating assets. Rental welders increased by $22 million on the improvement of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business that Mike mentioned earlier. 
Excluding major projects, CapEx as a percent of sales was approximately 5%. Slide 7 presents our fiscal 2013 first quarter and full year guidance. For the first quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the mid-to upper single-digits, with adjusted earnings in the range of $1.12 to $1.16 per diluted share, an increase of 12% to 15% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense in both periods. 
For the full year, we expect same-store sales growth in the mid-to upper single-digits, with adjusted earnings in the range of $4.70 to $4.85 per diluted share, up 14% to 18% over fiscal 2012, which includes approximately $0.12 to $0.16 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense net of expected benefits. 
Fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per diluted share included $0.34 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the mid-to upper digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.8% to 13.3%, including the net dilutive impact of SAP costs, partially offset by the expected benefits. This represents a significant expansion in our adjusted operating margin, from 12.2% in fiscal 2012. CapEx is expected to be around 6.5% of sales for the new fiscal year. 
Our fiscal 2013 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continuation of recent business trends including continued outperformance of hardgoods relative to gas and rent on the strength of U.S. manufacturing, particularly metal fabrication which uses a proportionately greater amount of hardgoods in their processes, in addition to broad-based modest improvement across the rest of the base business. The guidance excludes the impact of business support center restructuring and related charges. 
Slide 8 presents a walk from the primarily elements of our first quarter and full year guidance using fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.11 and fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.11, respectively, as the starting point. In the first quarter, we expect headwinds of approximately $0.06 related to our stock-based compensation as the largest portion of our full year stock-based compensation expense follows in the first quarter and $0.02 due to a higher effective tax rate relative to the fourth quarter. 
We expect seasonality in our CO2, Dry Ice and Refrigerants businesses tempered by the fourth quarter strong performance of Refrigerants to provide a net tailwind of approximately $0.06 and we expect our core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.03 to $0.07 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy. For fiscal 2013, the impact of 2 fewer selling days is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.05 and $0.06 and a slightly higher tax rate relative to fiscal 2012 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03. 
SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense net of the ramp-up of benefits are expected to provide a tailwind of $0.18 to $0.22 relative to the $0.34 of net expense in fiscal 2012 with base business growth of $0.50 to $0.60 or 12% to 15% over the prior year adjusted EPS.

And there hasn't been many of them. And it's mostly on the strength of these turnarounds in the power industry and oil and gas business and petrochemical industries and through penetration of the customer segment, we've done a good job penetrating the customer segment. So, I think we're in great shape when the bigger projects do start up.

Well, distributor meaning has a fairly deep product line and our products are very technical, gases and welding equipment, welding to technical activity. So our customers, they are relying on us for a lot of technical support and most of our customers metal fabrication our gas use and furnace in a tire plant or something like that. Our products are inter- built into their operation and they need our technical support. So we think that vast majority of our business could never be touched by an Amazon. There's a certain part of our business, small, retail, walk-in smaller business that's been under assault for years. The Kmarts, the Wal-Marts, the Home Depots, Granger, all kinds of -- Fastenal. And I think over the years that has probably chipped away some of the cash will small business small orders that we would otherwise enjoy. But, we're addressing that with our e-business initiative on the retail side. And, of course, most of our e-business initiative is going to be directed towards our larger customers to use a lot of our products and to make it seamless and to reduce transaction costs and supply chain costs. But, I don't discount Amazon. I mean, they've done a great job with CDs and books and things like that. And they called us up and asked us to sell to them and we just didn't have an interest in that. Their logistics aren't any better than ours. We've been so many times in their effort. I don't see it as a major threat, but we still are going after that small customer market, both with e-business and with our Total Access program and because we want the entire market. Mike?"

We've been watching everybody else for a number of years. We think we know what we want to do. The major thrust of the business for us is our larger, more sophisticated customers that need a deep offering, they need technical support comedy need technical support and things like that. If you look at our small customers, the customers that have been really more likely to be wooed by -- they don't get a lot of attention from us, they're not big enough for a salesman to cover. They are the ones that are more likely to be buying from any number of channels. And if you look at some of our data for that classic customer, about 90% of what they buy from us today is gases. So the hardgoods spending for that classic customer is of very small and I think many of those customers are the ones that are already buying their hardgoods from Granger tractor supply and you can list the names of all the people in the last 15 to 20 years have added welding. However, the ability for those kinds of guys to make traction on somebody that needs a deep product line, as well as somebody they'll teach you how to use it has been very, very, very low. And so a lot of the business that risk of losing, we probably already lost. And I think there will be a real fight among the MRO folks for these vanilla, generic relatively simple items, much more so that it would be for the sophisticated welding user. But we're still committed to being the best-in-class so that we get our fair share of even the small customers."

It's really hard to say because there's so many different times of helium sales, different customers and we've aggressively raised price because of the shortage and because of the extra expense that we've incurred. Transferring helium supplies, where they are available to places where we have demand from critical customers in the petrochemical industries or the medical healthcare or things like that. So I think, net-net, maybe a $0.01 to negative impact in the quarter on helium. And that's just -- it's kind of like a wild -- it's not a wild guess, but it definitely was slightly negative we think. We did get the higher price but our sales suffered and we had extra expense moving helium around. We think this problem is going to stay with us for at least until the fall, could be even longer. And there's one plant that hasn't started up because of the helium comes from natural gas processing and the gas prices is so low. And we think the reason is there's been some shutdowns around the world that is having increased demand for exports. Unfortunately, a lot of the helium that's refined in this country much is owned by U.S. taxpayers is being exported and it's hurting U.S. jobs. And it's a real shame and we're trying to get the word out that, that's not right. The U.S. economy has enough problems without allowing for not giving the U.S. businesses an access to this helium. And so we'll see what happens. We don't expect this to be over soon. We had to some customers but in the long run, you'll see shortage price does offset volume and losses and expenses. And we still have the biggest and best supply chain in the United States for delivering helium to customers. So we don't see permanent damage for our helium business from this but it is a hassle to move all of those helium around for critical customers."

Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion of our quarterly and full year results. 
However, before reviewing our earnings, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss with you the leadership transition announced this morning in conjunction with our financial results. Following our 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, which will be held in mid-August, I will assume the role of Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. At that time, I'm pleased that Mike Molinini, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Airgas since 2005, will succeed me as President and Chief Executive Officer. 
As part of this leadership transition, our Board has unanimously elected Mike to serve as a Director of the company effective immediately and he will stand for reelection to the Board at the 2012 annual meeting. This transition is a product of extensive leadership succession planning by our Board and is part of an evolutionary process. Consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, the Board has been very involved in the development of our management team over the course of many years and has kept a close eye on the career path, leadership capabilities and performance of many outstanding individuals. They have watched and encourage, not only Mike's development, but the development of a deep and talented bench that is driving -- that is the driving force behind the growing strength of our business. 
Most of you know Mike and are familiar with his outstanding record of accomplishment. Mike joined Airgas in 1997, as Group Vice President of Airgas Direct Industrial, and he led the build out of our hardgoods supply chain including development of the Radnor private label program. He then served as a Senior Vice President of Airgas' hardgoods business with company-wide responsibility for directing sales and marketing, procurement and distribution of center logistics. Most recently, since 2005, Mike has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, responsible for the day-to-day operations of our company. Over the last couple of years, one of his most notable accomplishments has been leading the successful development and rollout of our new SAP system and he's done that while maintaining a sharp operating focus on the business and delivering robust same-store sales and double-digit earnings growth. 
The board and I believe that Mike's talents, strategic insight and keen grasp of our business will benefit Airgas as we build on the momentum of our numerous growth initiatives. He is clearly an outstanding fit for the job and we are confident that he will continue to build on our 30-year track record of operational excellence and shareholder value creation. 
In my new role as executive chairman, I will continue to oversee some key areas of the business, about which I am very passionate, business strategy development, acquisitions, risk management and governance. In addition, I will continue to serve as chairman of the company's management committee. Mike and I, together with Bob McLaughlin and other key executives will continue to be actively engaged with our shareholders in the investment community at large. Our vision and strategy remain unchanged and we have never been stronger. As I always say, the best time at Airgas is now. 
The benefits of our customer-centric culture and our new sales alignment are just starting to develop and we'll yield even greater value for the customers, more than 1 million strong, who make Airgas their supplier of choice. Furthermore, the combination of favorable business trends, sharp operating focus and SAP benefits, offers Airgas shareholders very attractive future prospects. Accordingly, we believe this is an opportune time for Mike to take on increased responsibility. 
I want to stress that this leadership transition is a natural result of the Board's long-term focus on developing a deep management team and it represents the next step in the evolution of Airgas. As Airgas' founder and largest shareholder, I am committed to making sure that this plan is successful and I am looking forward to working with Mike and the entire management team in the years ahead. 
Fiscal 2012 was another outstanding year for Airgas and its shareholders, thanks, to the effort of our more than 15,000 associates. Our record sales and earnings performance this year is a testament to our strong operating culture and customer-centric approach to doing business. 
We delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $4.11, representing 23% growth on sales of $4.7 billion and operating margin before SAP costs of 13.1%. And we generated strong free cash flow of $262 million on adjusted cash flow from operations of $593 million. Making these result even more impressive is that we delivered them in the midst of a complex ERP implementation at nearly half of our regional distribution businesses which, thus far, has been very successful. 
Complementing our 10% same-store sales growth in fiscal 2012 for the acquisitions of 8 businesses with aggregate annual revenues of more than $106 million, including our recent purchase of the Nordan Smith, with 17 locations across Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama. Our acquisition pipeline continues to improve and I'm optimistic we'll achieve our annual target of $150 million in acquired sales during fiscal 2013. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings were also a record, $1.11 per share which included $0.09 of SAP headwinds. That represents a 26% increase over the prior year on sales of $1.2 billion and operating margin before the SAP costs of 13.1%. Same-store sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter comprised of 15% in hardgoods and 9% in gas and rent. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, demand was strong this quarter across most of our core business with particular strength in manufacturing, petrochemical and energy customers, and noticeable improvement in our construction customer base despite the lack of large, new construction projects. 
Our product line adjacency businesses  also performed well relative to our expectations, highlighted by strong pre-season demand in our refrigerants business that contributed nicely to our earnings this quarter. 
The strength of our hardgoods same-store sales growth relative to gas and rent, and a sales mix shift within hardgoods to welding and automation equipment reflect the continued, modest expansion and reinvestment we're seeing by larger customers in the manufacturing-intensive regions of the U.S. While the mix shift has a dilutive effect on our gross margin, we've continued to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform to increase our underlying operating margin and expand our return on capital to 12.5% this quarter, 60 basis points over the prior year. 
As far as sales trends are concerned, we saw a very robust January and February which we really didn't expect because they tend to be muted. And then we saw a flattening of the growth in March. So, maybe that was a seasonal effect of the warm weather, pushing sales to, or pulling sales, to the front of the quarter. March continues steady, April continues steady. We surveyed all of our business leaders in the last couple of weeks and the outlook is for continued steady growth, slow but steady growth, across the economy and customer base. 
As I love to remind people, the best in time at Airgas is now. Now let me hand it off to Mike to review some of our key initiatives."

Before I discuss our results, I'd like to thank Peter and the board for the confidence they placed in me. I'm honored and energized by this opportunity and look forward to enhancing Airgas' position as one of the premier industrial gas companies in the world. 
Under Peter's stewardship, Airgas has achieved remarkable success over the last 30 years. Most recently, the company weathered the financial crisis and emerged stronger than ever. I'm excited about the challenge of leading Airgas and about building upon the solid foundation Peter has established. As CEO, I will continue to lead the company's operations and information technology initiatives, while also assuming responsibility for finance and human resources. Peter and I have worked successfully together for many years and I'm pleased that he will stay actively involved in Airgas, continuing to contribute the vision and leadership that have helped make the company what it is today. I plan to continue his tradition of strong, active leadership and nurturing Airgas' entrepreneurial culture in pursuit of the tremendous opportunities ahead. 
Airgas is the leading packaged gas company in the U.S. and a significant expansion of our bulk gas production and distribution capabilities in recent years, combined with our broad offering of hardgoods and value weighted services, have created a value proposition for our diverse customer base that is virtually unrivaled in the industry. Our performance over the years and, in particular, through the recession really demonstrates the resilience of our business model. Our success also demonstrate the loyalty of our customers and the tremendous work ethic and commitment to excellence of all Airgas associates, all resulting in an extremely compelling track record of creating shareholder value. Our more than 15,000 associates are the best in the business and, together, we will continue to focus on operating safely, serving our loyal customers and growing the business for years to come. I intend to hit the ground running on day 1 to continue the success of this great company, and I look forward to working with Peter and all of the other members of our team. 
And now I'd like to continue the discussion of our fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 3. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. Strategic Accounts presents us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and locations and represent more than 20% of total sales. In the fourth quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 11% from the prior year, driven by new account signing across all customer segments and by increased activity on our existing metal fabrication, oil and gas and chemicals customer bases. 
As Peter mentioned, our construction customer base is showing noticeable improvement on the strength of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business which has resulted from some capacity expansion projects and turnarounds in the Oil and Gas and Chemicals segment, as well as strong turnarounds in the refineries and power sectors. 
I encourage you to review our strategic products slide in the appendix in detail after our call. In the fourth quarter, strategic products which make up about 40% of our revenue increased 10% over the prior year. Safety products once again deliver the highest growth at 17%, driven by business with new and existing large customers. 
Our Radnor private label products were up 14% for the quarter, the long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor product are 1.5x greater than those of comparable OEM products. 
We are progressing well through our planned phase rollout of SAP whereby our business units implement the new system in succession. At this point, we are more than half -- we have more than half of our business running smoothly on SAP and we still expect to have 11 of 12 regions converted by December 2012, with the remaining region converted in the first quarter of calendar 2013. 
On Monday, we successfully converted another region to SAP and migrated its back office support functions into one of our 4 Business Support Centers. The next region will convert in less than 4 weeks from now. 
We remain committed to minimizing implementation risk and converting the rest of our business units to SAP, but much risk has been abated and we are shifting our focus to attaining benefits. Based on our experience to date, we're confident by the end of the calendar 2013, the benefits we've detail will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income, with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. The areas of benefits we have announced do not represent the full earnings power of our SAP conversion, however, and we expect additional economic benefits after the implementation is completed and we tap into the potential of the new system. Thank you. 
And now Bob will now give you our financial review for the quarter and provide an update for guidance next year."
24504,184392379,296820,"Airgas Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Airgas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results for the fourth quarter.

Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results for the fourth quarter. Please note that prior period amounts have been adjusted for the retrospective application of a change in the method of accounting for a portion of our hardgoods inventory from LIFO to the average-cost method. 
In conjunction with the rollout of SAP and our operating realignment into 4 divisions, we are merging our distribution businesses into a single LLC which necessitated standardizing our inventory valuation method. Prior to this change in accounting, only 10% of our inventory was accounted for in the LIFO method. The impact of this change was  immaterial to all periods presented. 
Sales increased 13% year-over-year to $1.24 billion reflecting acquisitions growth at 2% and total same-store sales growth of 11%,  comprised of a 9% increase in gas and rent and a 15% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 7% and price was up 4%. Sequentially, total sales increased 8% from the third quarter on 2 additional selling days and the follow-up of the third quarter holiday impact. On a daily sales basis, sales increased 4% over the third quarter. Gas and rent represented approximately 62% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from approximately 63% in the prior year and in the third quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.9%, a decline of 40 basis points from the prior year, reflecting continued outperformance of hardgoods sales and a mixed shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment. On a sequential basis, gross margin declined by 100 basis points as the strong -- as strong performance in our lower margin refrigerants business and hardgoods mixed shift more than offset the favorable impact of our third quarter pricing actions. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $152 million which was up 13% from last year and which included $5 million of incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Not included in adjusted operating income were pretax charges of approximately $4 million related to the previously announced Business Support Center restructuring and a $2 million impairment charge related to one of our smaller, less efficient air separation units.  
Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Adjusted operating margin of 12.2% for the quarter included 90 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. The prior year's adjusted operating margin of 12.2% included only 50 basis points of SAP-related costs. Excluding these incremental SAP costs, adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year, driven by operating leverage on strong organic sales growth. Excluding $0.06 in tax benefits related to the LLC reorganization and the true up of foreign tax liabilities, net of $0.05 of BSC restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted earnings per share were $1.11, an increase of 26% from $0.88 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.11 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.05 in SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, which were offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. Our adjusted tax -- our adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes the $0.06 per diluted share income tax benefit resulting from the LLC reorganization, was 36.2% for the fourth quarter and 37.3% for the full year. The LLC reorganization enables us to realize certain state tax benefits that previously required evaluation allowance. 
There were approximately $78.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 7% year-over-year, driven by share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.5%, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year on the strength of our improving operating income. Adjusted cash from operations for the full year was $593 million and free cash flow was $262 million. The decrease in free cash flow from the prior year is $387 million, reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital that supports strong sales growth, as well as some major capital projects which I will comment on later. 
Total debt increased approximately $308 million year-over-year to $2.16 billion at March 31, reflecting strong operating cash, offset by $300 million spent on the share repurchase program and $160 million spent on acquisitions. Our fixed float debt ratio at the end of December was approximately 52% fixed and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.5, comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. We are well positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our targeted range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx. 
Turning now to Slide 5, we'll  look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. 
Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1.11 billion. Same-store sales for distribution segments were up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7%, and hardgoods were up 15%, with pricing up 4% and volume up 6%. Distribution gross margin was 54.5%, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to hardgoods, and within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment. 
Sequentially, distribution gross margins decreased by 60 basis points from the third quarter, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to lower margin hardgoods. Underlying gross margins excluding the mix impacts on both gases and hardgoods, each improved sequentially from the third quarter. 
Gas and rent represented 57.2% of distribution sales in the fourth quarter, down from 59% in the prior year and 58.7% in the third quarter. 
Operating income in distribution segment increased 12% year-over-year to $146 million and operating income improved to 13.1% comparable to the prior year despite the dilutive effect of the mixed shift to hardgoods and a 20-basis-point impact of higher SAP depreciation expense. 
All other operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia and nitrous oxide businesses. Sales for all other operations were up 24% from the prior year with same-store sales up 18%. The same-store sales increased was largely driven by an increase in both refrigerants and ammonia sales, each on strong volume and pricing. Sequentially, sales in all other operations segment increased 16% in total and 12% on a daily basis driven by the strength in refrigerants, partially offset by normal seasonality in our dry ice business. Gross margin for all other operations was 45.5%, an increase of 270 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants and CO2 businesses. Sequentially, the, 340 basis-point decrease in gross margins from the third quarter was primarily driven by the mix shift towards lower margin refrigerants and normal seasonality within our dry ice business. 
Operating income for all other operations was $15 million, an increase of $6 million over the prior year and operating margin of 10.9% was up 330 basis points year-over-year, driven by a margin expansion in our refrigerants, CO2 and ammonia businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. Fiscal 2012 CapEx represented 7.5% of sales. Construction in process was the asset category with the highest year-over-year growth in spending, driven by the construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee, the expansion of our hardgoods distribution centers in Duluth, Georgia and Bristol, Pennsylvania, the buildout of our Business Support Centers, and projects to expand or consolidate plants and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. The cylinder and bulk tanks category also were a contributor to the year-over-year increase as improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand for our core revenue generating assets. Rental welders increased by $22 million on the improvement of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business that Mike mentioned earlier. Excluding major projects, CapEx as a percent of sales was approximately 5%. 
Slide 7 presents our fiscal 2013 first quarter and full year guidance. For the first quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the mid to upper single digits, with adjusted earnings in the range of $1.12 to $1.16 per diluted share, an increase of 12% to 15% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense in both periods. 
For the full year, we expect same-store sales growth in the mid to upper single digits, with adjusted earnings in the range of $4.70 to $4.85 per diluted share, up 14% to 18% over fiscal 2012, which includes approximately $0.12 to $0.16 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, net of expected benefits. 
Fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per diluted share included $0.34 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the mid to upper digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.8% to 13.3%, including the net dilutive impact of SAP costs, partially offset by the expected benefits. This represents a significant expansion in our adjusted operating margin, from 12.2% in fiscal 2012. CapEx is expected to be around 6.5% of sales for the new fiscal year. 
Our fiscal 2013 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continuation of recent business trends including continued outperformance of hardgoods relative to gas and rent on the strength of U.S. manufacturing, particularly, metal fabrication which uses a proportionately greater amount of hardgoods in their processes, in addition to broad-based modest improvement across the rest of the base business. The guidance excludes the impact of Business Support Center restructuring and related charges. 
Slide 8 presents a walk from the primarily elements of our first quarter and full year guidance using fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.11 and fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.11, respectively, as the starting point. In the first quarter, we expect headwinds of approximately $0.06 related to our stock-based compensation as the largest portion of our full year stock-based compensation expense follows in the first quarter and $0.02 due to a higher effective tax rate relative to the fourth quarter. 
We expect seasonality in our CO2, dry ice and refrigerants businesses tempered by the fourth quarter strong performance of refrigerants to provide a net tailwind of approximately $0.06 and we expect our core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.03 to $0.07 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy. For fiscal 2013, the impact of 2 fewer selling days is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.05 and $0.06 and a slightly higher tax rate relative to fiscal 2012 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03. 
SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense net of the ramp-up of benefits are expected to provide a tailwind of $0.18 to $0.22 relative to the $0.34 of net expense in fiscal 2012 with base business growth of $0.50 to $0.60 or 12% to 15% over the prior year adjusted EPS.

Basically, we're a specialty distributor, meaning we have a very, very deep product line and our products are very technical, gases and welding equipment, welding to technical activity. So our customers rely on us for a lot of technical support and most of our customers, metal fabrication, or gas used in a furnace, or in a tire plant or something like that, our products are integral to their operations and they need our technical support.

The Kmarts, the Wal-Marts, the Home Depots, Grainger, all kinds of -- Fastenal. And I think, over the years that has probably chipped away some of the casual small business that we -- small orders that we would otherwise enjoy. But we're addressing that with our eBusiness initiative on the retail side. And, of course, most of our eBusiness initiative is going to be directed towards the larger customers who use a lot of our products and to make it seamless and to reduce transaction costs and supply chain costs. But as I -- I don't discount Amazon. I mean, they've done a great job with CDs and books and things like that.

If you look at our smaller customers, the customers that have been really more likely to be wooed by -- they don't get a lot of attention from us, they're not big enough for a salesman to cover, they are the ones that are more likely to be buying from any number of channels. And if you look at some of our data, for that class of customer, about 90% of what they buy from us today is gases. So, I mean, the hardgoods spend for that class of customer is already very small and, I think, many of those customers are the ones that are already buying their hardgoods from Grainger tractor supply, I mean, you can list the names of all the people in the last 15 to 20 years have added welding. However, the ability for those kinds of guys to make traction on somebody that needs a deep product line, as well as somebody that'll teach you how to use it has been very, very, very low. And so, I think, a lot of the business that we're at risk of losing, we probably have already lost. And I think there will be a real fight among the MRO folks for these vanilla, generic relatively simple items, much more so than it would be for the sophisticated welding and cutting user.

So this year, kind of April turned out to be like a typical year for us, kind of flat to March and nothing to get excited about. And then regarding the first quarter, I do think the -- some of the margin sales probably got pulled up into January and February. Plus there was some lumpy stuff about construction and things like that, that may have impacted it. We've done the survey, we have every reason to believe, based on the results of those survey, the survey that our business will continue to enjoy the benefits of a slow and steady economic recovery."

Meaning we could get even 5% less on April 1. It's really hard to say because there's so many different kinds of helium sales, different customers and we've aggressively raised price because of the shortage and because of the extra expense that we've incurred. Transferring helium supplies, where they are available to places where we have demand by -- from critical customers, in the petrochemical industries or the health care or things like that. So I think, net-net, maybe a $0.01 negative impact in the quarter on helium. And that's just -- it's kind of like a wild -- it's not a wild guess, but it definitely was slightly negative we think. We did get the higher price but our sales suffered and we had extra expense moving helium around. We think this problem is going to stay with us for at least until the fall, could be even longer. And there's one plant that hasn't started up out west because of the helium comes from natural gas processing and the gas prices is so low. At least that's what we think the reason is.  And there's been summer shutdowns around the world that is having increased demand for exports. Unfortunately, a lot of the helium that's refined in this country, much of which is owned by the U.S. taxpayers is being exported and it's hurting U.S. jobs. And it's a real shame and we're trying to get the word out that, that's not right. The U.S. economy has enough problems without allowing for -- not giving the U.S. businesses an access to this helium. And so we'll see what happens. We don't expect this to be over soon. We've had to shed some customers but in the long run, you'll see when there's a shortage, price does offset volume and losses and expenses. And we still have the biggest and best supply chain in the United States for delivering helium to customers. So we don't see permanent damage for our helium business from this but it is a hassle to move all of those helium around for critical customers."

Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion of our quarterly and full year results. 
However, before reviewing our earnings, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss with you the leadership transition announced this morning in conjunction with our financial results. Following our 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, which will be held in mid-August, I will assume the role of Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. At that time, I'm pleased that Mike Molinini, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Airgas since 2005, will succeed me as President and Chief Executive Officer. 
As part of this leadership transition, our Board has unanimously elected Mike to serve as a Director of the company effective immediately and he will stand for reelection to the Board at the 2012 annual meeting. This transition is a product of extensive leadership succession planning by our Board and is part of an evolutionary process. Consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, the Board has been very involved in the development of our management team over the course of many years and has kept a close eye on the career path, leadership capabilities and performance of many outstanding individuals. They have watched and encourage, not only Mike's development, but the development of a deep and talented bench that is driving -- that is the driving force behind the growing strength of our business. 
Most of you know Mike and are familiar with his outstanding record of accomplishment. Mike joined Airgas in 1997, as Group Vice President of Airgas Direct Industrial, and he led the build out of our hardgoods supply chain including development of the Radnor private label program. He then served as a Senior Vice President of Airgas' hardgoods business with company-wide responsibility for directing sales and marketing, procurement and distribution of center logistics. Most recently, since 2005, Mike has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, responsible for the day-to-day operations of our company. Over the last couple of years, one of his most notable accomplishments has been leading the successful development and rollout of our new SAP systems and he's done that while maintaining a sharp operating focus on the business and delivering robust same-store sales and double-digit earnings growth. 
The board and I believe that Mike's talents, strategic insight and keen grasp of our business will benefit Airgas as we build on the momentum of our numerous growth initiatives. He is clearly an outstanding fit for the job and we are confident that he will continue to build on our 30-year track record of operational excellence and shareholder value creation. 
In my new role as executive chairman, I will continue to oversee some key areas of the business, about which I am very passionate, business strategy development, acquisitions, risk management and governance. In addition, I will continue to serve as chairman of the company's management committee. Mike and I, together with Bob McLaughlin and other key executives will continue to be actively engaged with our shareholders in the investment community at large. Our vision and strategy remain unchanged and we have never been stronger. As I always say, the best time at Airgas is now. 
The benefits of our customer-centric culture and our new sales alignment are just starting to develop and we'll yield even greater value for the customers, more than 1 million strong, who make Airgas their supplier of choice. Furthermore, the combination of favorable business trends, sharp operating focus and SAP benefits, offers Airgas shareholders very attractive future prospects. Accordingly, we believe this is an opportune time for Mike to take on increased responsibility. 
I want to stress that this leadership transition is a natural result of the Board's long-term focus on developing a deep management team and it represents the next step in the evolution of Airgas. As Airgas' founder and largest shareholder, I am committed to making sure that this plan is successful and I am looking forward to working with Mike and the entire management team in the years ahead. 
Fiscal 2012 was another outstanding year for Airgas and its shareholders, thanks, to the effort of our more than 15,000 associates. Our record sales and earnings performance this year is a testament to our strong operating culture and customer-centric approach to doing business. 
We delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $4.11, representing 23% growth on sales of $4.7 billion and operating margin before SAP costs of 13.1%. And we generated strong free cash flow of $262 million on adjusted cash flow from operations of $593 million. Making these results even more impressive is that we delivered them in the midst of a complex ERP implementation at nearly half of our regional distribution businesses which, thus far, has been very successful. 
Complementing our 10% same-store sales growth in fiscal 2012 for the acquisitions of 8 businesses with aggregate annual revenues of more than $106 million, including our recent purchase of the Nordan Smith, with 17 locations across Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama. Our acquisition pipeline continues to improve and I'm optimistic we'll achieve our annual target of $150 million in acquired sales during fiscal 2013. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings were also a record, $1.11 per share which included $0.09 of SAP headwinds. That represents a 26% increase over the prior year on sales of $1.2 billion and operating margin before the SAP costs of 13.1%. Same-store sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter comprised of 15% in hardgoods and 9% in gas and rent. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, demand was strong this quarter across most of our core business with particular strength in manufacturing, petrochemical and energy customers, and noticeable improvement in our construction customer base despite the lack of large, new construction projects. 
Our product line adjacency businesses  also performed well relative to our expectations, highlighted by strong pre-season demand in our refrigerants business that contributed nicely to our earnings this quarter. 
The strength of our hardgoods same-store sales growth relative to gas and rent, and a sales mix shift within hardgoods to welding and automation equipment reflect the continued, modest expansion and reinvestment we're seeing by larger customers in the manufacturing-intensive regions of the U.S. While the mix shift has a dilutive effect on our gross margin, we've continued to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform to increase our underlying operating margin and expand our return on capital to 12.5% this quarter, 60 basis points over the prior year. 
As far as sales trends are concerned, we saw a very robust January and February which we really didn't expect because they tend to be muted. And then we saw a flattening of the growth in March. So, maybe that was a seasonal effect of the warm weather, pushing sales to, or pulling sales, to the front of the quarter. March continues steady, April continues steady. We surveyed all of our business leaders in the last couple of weeks and the outlook is for continued steady growth, slow but steady growth, across the economy and customer base. 
As I love to remind people, the best in time at Airgas is now. Now let me hand it off to Mike to review some of our key initiatives."

Before I discuss our results, I'd like to thank Peter and the board for the confidence they placed in me. I'm honored and energized by this opportunity and look forward to enhancing Airgas' position as one of the premier industrial gas companies in the world. 
Under Peter's stewardship, Airgas has achieved remarkable success over the last 30 years. Most recently, the company weathered the financial crisis and emerged stronger than ever. I'm excited about the challenge of leading Airgas and about building upon the solid foundation Peter has established. As CEO, I will continue to lead the company's operations and information technology initiatives, while also assuming responsibility for finance and human resources. Peter and I have worked successfully together for many years and I'm pleased that he will stay actively involved in Airgas, continuing to contribute the vision and leadership that have helped make the company what it is today. I plan to continue his tradition of strong, active leadership and nurturing Airgas' entrepreneurial culture in pursuit of the tremendous opportunities ahead. 
Airgas is the leading packaged gas company in the U.S. and a significant expansion of our bulk gas production and distribution capabilities in recent years, combined with our broad offering of hardgoods and value weighted services, have created a value proposition for our diverse customer base that is virtually unrivaled in the industry. Our performance over the years and, in particular, through the recession really demonstrates the resilience of our business model. Our success also demonstrate the loyalty of our customers and the tremendous work ethic and commitment to excellence of all Airgas associates, all resulting in an extremely compelling track record of creating shareholder value. Our more than 15,000 associates are the best in the business and, together, we will continue to focus on operating safely, serving our loyal customers and growing the business for years to come. I intend to hit the ground running on day 1 to continue the success of this great company, and I look forward to working with Peter and all of the other members of our team. 
And now I'd like to continue the discussion of our fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 3. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. Strategic Accounts presents us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and locations and represent more than 20% of total sales. In the fourth quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 11% from the prior year, driven by new account signing across all customer segments and by increased activity on our existing metal fabrication, oil and gas and chemicals customer bases. 
As Peter mentioned, our construction customer base is showing noticeable improvement on the strength of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business which has resulted from some capacity expansion projects and turnarounds in the Oil and Gas and Chemicals segment, as well as strong turnarounds in the refineries and power sectors. 
I encourage you to review our strategic products slide in the appendix in detail after our call. In the fourth quarter, strategic products which make up about 40% of our revenue increased 10% over the prior year. Safety products once again deliver the highest growth at 17%, driven by business with new and existing large customers. 
Our Radnor private label products were up 14% for the quarter, the long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor product are 1.5x greater than those of comparable OEM products. 
We are progressing well through our planned phase rollout of SAP whereby our business units implement the new system in succession. At this point, we are more than 1/2 -- we have more than 1/2 of our business running smoothly on SAP and we still expect to have 11 of 12 regions converted by December 2012, with the remaining region converted in the first quarter of calendar 2013. 
On Monday, we successfully converted another region to SAP and migrated its back office support functions into one of our 4 Business Support Centers. The next region will convert in less than 4 weeks from now. 
We remain committed to minimizing implementation risk and converting the rest of our business units to SAP, but much risk has been abated and we are shifting our focus to attaining benefits. Based on our experience to date, we're confident by the end of the calendar 2013, the benefits we've detail will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income, with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. The areas of benefits we have announced do not represent the full earnings power of our SAP conversion, however, and we expect additional economic benefits after the implementation is completed and we tap into the potential of the new system. Thank you. 
And now Bob will now give you our financial review for the quarter and provide an update for guidance next year."
24504,184392379,297208,"Airgas Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Airgas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results for the fourth quarter. Please note that prior period amounts have been adjusted for the retrospective application of a change in the method of ac",1852,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results for the fourth quarter. Please note that prior period amounts have been adjusted for the retrospective application of a change in the method of accounting for a portion of our hardgoods inventory from LIFO to the average-cost method. 
In conjunction with the rollout of SAP and our operating realignment into 4 divisions, we are merging our distribution businesses into a single LLC which necessitated standardizing our inventory valuation method. Prior to this change in accounting, only 10% of our inventory was accounted for in the LIFO method. The impact of this change was  immaterial to all periods presented. 
Sales increased 13% year-over-year to $1.24 billion reflecting acquisitions growth at 2% and total same-store sales growth of 11%,  comprised of a 9% increase in gas and rent and a 15% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 7% and price was up 4%. Sequentially, total sales increased 8% from the third quarter on 2 additional selling days and the follow-up of the third quarter holiday impact. On a daily sales basis, sales increased 4% over the third quarter. Gas and rent represented approximately 62% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from approximately 63% in the prior year and in the third quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.9%, a decline of 40 basis points from the prior year, reflecting continued outperformance of hardgoods sales and a mixed shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment. On a sequential basis, gross margin declined by 100 basis points as the strong -- as strong performance in our lower margin refrigerants business and hardgoods mixed shift more than offset the favorable impact of our third quarter pricing actions. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $152 million which was up 13% from last year and which included $5 million of incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Not included in adjusted operating income were pretax charges of approximately $4 million related to the previously announced Business Support Center restructuring and a $2 million impairment charge related to one of our smaller, less efficient air separation units.  
Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Adjusted operating margin of 12.2% for the quarter included 90 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. The prior year's adjusted operating margin of 12.2% included only 50 basis points of SAP-related costs. Excluding these incremental SAP costs, adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year, driven by operating leverage on strong organic sales growth. Excluding $0.06 in tax benefits related to the LLC reorganization and the true up of foreign tax liabilities, net of $0.05 of BSC restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted earnings per share were $1.11, an increase of 26% from $0.88 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.11 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.05 in SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, which were offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. Our adjusted tax -- our adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes the $0.06 per diluted share income tax benefit resulting from the LLC reorganization, was 36.2% for the fourth quarter and 37.3% for the full year. The LLC reorganization enables us to realize certain state tax benefits that previously required evaluation allowance. 
There were approximately $78.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 7% year-over-year, driven by share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.5%, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year on the strength of our improving operating income. Adjusted cash from operations for the full year was $593 million and free cash flow was $262 million. The decrease in free cash flow from the prior year is $387 million, reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital that supports strong sales growth, as well as some major capital projects which I will comment on later. 
Total debt increased approximately $308 million year-over-year to $2.16 billion at March 31, reflecting strong operating cash, offset by $300 million spent on the share repurchase program and $160 million spent on acquisitions. Our fixed float debt ratio at the end of December was approximately 52% fixed and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.5, comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. We are well positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our targeted range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx. 
Turning now to Slide 5, we'll  look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. 
Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1.11 billion. Same-store sales for distribution segments were up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7%, and hardgoods were up 15%, with pricing up 4% and volume up 6%. Distribution gross margin was 54.5%, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to hardgoods, and within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment. 
Sequentially, distribution gross margins decreased by 60 basis points from the third quarter, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to lower margin hardgoods. Underlying gross margins excluding the mix impacts on both gases and hardgoods, each improved sequentially from the third quarter. 
Gas and rent represented 57.2% of distribution sales in the fourth quarter, down from 59% in the prior year and 58.7% in the third quarter. 
Operating income in distribution segment increased 12% year-over-year to $146 million and operating income improved to 13.1% comparable to the prior year despite the dilutive effect of the mixed shift to hardgoods and a 20-basis-point impact of higher SAP depreciation expense. 
All other operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia and nitrous oxide businesses. Sales for all other operations were up 24% from the prior year with same-store sales up 18%. The same-store sales increased was largely driven by an increase in both refrigerants and ammonia sales, each on strong volume and pricing. Sequentially, sales in all other operations segment increased 16% in total and 12% on a daily basis driven by the strength in refrigerants, partially offset by normal seasonality in our dry ice business. Gross margin for all other operations was 45.5%, an increase of 270 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants and CO2 businesses. Sequentially, the, 340 basis-point decrease in gross margins from the third quarter was primarily driven by the mix shift towards lower margin refrigerants and normal seasonality within our dry ice business. 
Operating income for all other operations was $15 million, an increase of $6 million over the prior year and operating margin of 10.9% was up 330 basis points year-over-year, driven by a margin expansion in our refrigerants, CO2 and ammonia businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. Fiscal 2012 CapEx represented 7.5% of sales. Construction in process was the asset category with the highest year-over-year growth in spending, driven by the construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee, the expansion of our hardgoods distribution centers in Duluth, Georgia and Bristol, Pennsylvania, the buildout of our Business Support Centers, and projects to expand or consolidate plants and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. The cylinder and bulk tanks category also were a contributor to the year-over-year increase as improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand for our core revenue generating assets. Rental welders increased by $22 million on the improvement of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business that Mike mentioned earlier. Excluding major projects, CapEx as a percent of sales was approximately 5%. 
Slide 7 presents our fiscal 2013 first quarter and full year guidance. For the first quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the mid to upper single-digits, with adjusted earnings in the range of $1.12 to $1.16 per diluted share, an increase of 12% to 15% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense in both periods. 
For the full year, we expect same-store sales growth in the mid to upper single-digits, with adjusted earnings in the range of $4.70 to $4.85 per diluted share, up 14% to 18% over fiscal 2012, which includes approximately $0.12 to $0.16 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, net of expected benefits. 
Fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per diluted share included $0.34 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the mid to upper digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.8% to 13.3%, including the net dilutive impact of SAP costs, partially offset by the expected benefits. This represents a significant expansion in our adjusted operating margin, from 12.2% in fiscal 2012. CapEx is expected to be around 6.5% of sales for the new fiscal year. 
Our fiscal 2013 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continuation of recent business trends including continued outperformance of hardgoods relative to gas and rent on the strength of U.S. manufacturing, particularly, metal fabrication which uses a proportionately greater amount of hardgoods in their processes, in addition to broad-based modest improvement across the rest of the base business. The guidance excludes the impact of Business Support Center restructuring and related charges. 
Slide 8 presents a walk from the primarily elements of our first quarter and full year guidance using fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.11 and fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.11, respectively, as the starting point. In the first quarter, we expect headwinds of approximately $0.06 related to our stock-based compensation as the largest portion of our full year stock-based compensation expense follows in the first quarter and $0.02 due to a higher effective tax rate relative to the fourth quarter. 
We expect seasonality in our CO2, dry ice and refrigerants businesses tempered by the fourth quarter strong performance of refrigerants to provide a net tailwind of approximately $0.06 and we expect our core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.03 to $0.07 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy. For fiscal 2013, the impact of 2 fewer selling days is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.05 and $0.06 and a slightly higher tax rate relative to fiscal 2012 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03. 
SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense net of the ramp-up of benefits are expected to provide a tailwind of $0.18 to $0.22 relative to the $0.34 of net expense in fiscal 2012 with base business growth of $0.50 to $0.60 or 12% to 15% over the prior year adjusted EPS.

And our construction sales were up 12% for the quarter and basically that was really good because there were a lot -- there were a few big projects, but they were winding down. And there hasn't been many of them. And it's mostly on the strength of these turnarounds in the power industry and oil and gas business and petrochemical industries, and through penetration of the customer segment, we've done a good job penetrating the customer segment. So, I think we're in great shape when the bigger projects do start up. I think we're going to see them with these pet-chem projects that have been announced, and the LNG projects that have been announced, and a lot of the power projects.

Basically, we're a specialty distributor, meaning we have a very, very deep product line and our products are very technical, gases and welding equipment, welding to technical activity. So our customers rely on us for a lot of technical support and most of our customers, metal fabrication, or gas used in a furnace, or in a tire plant or something like that, our products are integral to their operations and they need our technical support. So we think that a vast majority of our business could never be touched by an Amazon. There's a certain part of our business, small, retail, walk-in, small-order business, that's been under assault for years. The Kmarts, the Wal-Marts, the Home Depots, Grainger, all kinds of -- Fastenal. And I think, over the years that has probably chipped away some of the casual small business that we -- small orders that we would otherwise enjoy. But we're addressing that with our eBusiness initiative on the retail side. And, of course, most of our eBusiness initiative is going to be directed towards the larger customers who use a lot of our products and to make it seamless and to reduce transaction costs and supply chain costs. But as I -- I don't discount Amazon. I mean, they've done a great job with CDs and books and things like that. And they called us up and asked us to sell to them and we just really didn't have an interest in that. Their logistics aren't any better than ours.

We've been watching everybody else for a number of years. We think we know what we want to do. The major thrust of the eBusiness for us is our larger, more sophisticated customers that need a deep offering, they need technical support, the need training and things like that. If you look at our smaller customers, the customers that have been really more likely to be wooed by -- they don't get a lot of attention from us, they're not big enough for a salesman to cover, they are the ones that are more likely to be buying from any number of channels. And if you look at some of our data, for that class of customer, about 90% of what they buy from us today is gases. So, I mean, the hardgoods spend for that class of customer is already very small and, I think, many of those customers are the ones that are already buying their hardgoods from Grainger tractor supply, I mean, you can list the names of all the people in the last 15 to 20 years have added welding. However, the ability for those kinds of guys to make traction on somebody that needs a deep product line, as well as somebody that'll teach you how to use it has been very, very, very low. And so, I think, a lot of the business that we're at risk of losing, we probably have already lost. And I think there will be a real fight among the MRO folks for these vanilla, generic relatively simple items, much more so than it would be for the sophisticated welding and cutting user.

Meaning we could get even 5% less on April 1. It's really hard to say because there's so many different kinds of helium sales, different customers and we've aggressively raised price because of the shortage and because of the extra expense that we've incurred. Transferring helium supplies, where they are available to places where we have demand by -- from critical customers, in the petrochemical industries or the health care or things like that. So I think, net-net, maybe a $0.01 negative impact in the quarter on helium. And that's just -- it's kind of like a wild -- it's not a wild guess, but it definitely was slightly negative we think. We did get the higher price but our sales suffered and we had extra expense moving helium around. We think this problem is going to stay with us for at least until the fall, could be even longer. And there's one plant that hasn't started up out west because of the helium comes from natural gas processing and the gas prices is so low. At least that's what we think the reason is.  And there's been summer shutdowns around the world that is having increased demand for exports. Unfortunately, a lot of the helium that's refined in this country, much of which is owned by the U.S. taxpayers is being exported and it's hurting U.S. jobs. And it's a real shame and we're trying to get the word out that, that's not right. The U.S. economy has enough problems without allowing for -- not giving the U.S. businesses an access to this helium. And so we'll see what happens. We don't expect this to be over soon. We've had to shed some customers but in the long run, you'll see when there's a shortage, price does offset volume and losses and expenses. And we still have the biggest and best supply chain in the United States for delivering helium to customers. So we don't see permanent damage for our helium business from this but it is a hassle to move all of this helium around for critical customers."

The scary thing to me is what's going to happen when all this pet-chem projects and power plant projects and ammonia projects, all this new plants coming in, driven by low-cost natural gas feedstocks.

Please turn to Slide 2 to begin our discussion of our quarterly and full year results. 
However, before reviewing our earnings, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss with you the leadership transition announced this morning in conjunction with our financial results. Following our 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, which will be held in mid-August, I will assume the role of Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. At that time, I'm pleased that Mike Molinini, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Airgas since 2005, will succeed me as President and Chief Executive Officer. 
As part of this leadership transition, our Board has unanimously elected Mike to serve as a Director of the company effective immediately and he will stand for reelection to the Board at the 2012 annual meeting. This transition is a product of extensive leadership succession planning by our Board and is part of an evolutionary process. Consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities, the Board has been very involved in the development of our management team over the course of many years and has kept a close eye on the career path, leadership capabilities and performance of many outstanding individuals. They have watched and encourage, not only Mike's development, but the development of a deep and talented bench that is driving -- that is the driving force behind the growing strength of our business. 
Most of you know Mike and are familiar with his outstanding record of accomplishment. Mike joined Airgas in 1997, as Group Vice President of Airgas Direct Industrial, and he led the build out of our hardgoods supply chain including development of the Radnor private label program. He then served as a Senior Vice President of Airgas' hardgoods business with company-wide responsibility for directing sales and marketing, procurement and distribution of center logistics. Most recently, since 2005, Mike has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, responsible for the day-to-day operations of our company. Over the last couple of years, one of his most notable accomplishments has been leading the successful development and rollout of our new SAP systems and he's done that while maintaining a sharp operating focus on the business and delivering robust same-store sales and double-digit earnings growth. 
The board and I believe that Mike's talents, strategic insight and keen grasp of our business will benefit Airgas as we build on the momentum of our numerous growth initiatives. He is clearly an outstanding fit for the job and we are confident that he will continue to build on our 30-year track record of operational excellence and shareholder value creation. 
In my new role as executive chairman, I will continue to oversee some key areas of the business, about which I am very passionate, business strategy development, acquisitions, risk management and governance. In addition, I will continue to serve as chairman of the company's management committee. Mike and I, together with Bob McLaughlin and other key executives will continue to be actively engaged with our shareholders in the investment community at large. Our vision and strategy remain unchanged and we have never been stronger. As I always say, the best time at Airgas is now. 
The benefits of our customer-centric culture and our new sales alignment are just starting to develop and we'll yield even greater value for the customers, more than 1 million strong, who make Airgas their supplier of choice. Furthermore, the combination of favorable business trends, sharp operating focus and SAP benefits, offers Airgas shareholders very attractive future prospects. Accordingly, we believe this is an opportune time for Mike to take on increased responsibility. 
I want to stress that this leadership transition is a natural result of the Board's long-term focus on developing a deep management team and it represents the next step in the evolution of Airgas. As Airgas' founder and largest shareholder, I am committed to making sure that this plan is successful and I am looking forward to working with Mike and the entire management team in the years ahead. 
Fiscal 2012 was another outstanding year for Airgas and its shareholders, thanks, to the effort of our more than 15,000 associates. Our record sales and earnings performance this year is a testament to our strong operating culture and customer-centric approach to doing business. 
We delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $4.11, representing 23% growth on sales of $4.7 billion and operating margin before SAP costs of 13.1%. And we generated strong free cash flow of $262 million on adjusted cash flow from operations of $593 million. Making these results even more impressive is that we delivered them in the midst of a complex ERP implementation at nearly half of our regional distribution businesses which, thus far, has been very successful. 
Complementing our 10% same-store sales growth in fiscal 2012 for the acquisitions of 8 businesses with aggregate annual revenues of more than $106 million, including our recent purchase of the Nordan Smith, with 17 locations across Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama, our acquisition pipeline continues to improve and I'm optimistic we'll achieve our annual target of $150 million in acquired sales during fiscal 2013. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings were also a record, $1.11 per share which included $0.09 of SAP headwinds. That represents a 26% increase over the prior year on sales of $1.2 billion and operating margin before the SAP costs of 13.1%. Same-store sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter comprised of 15% in hardgoods and 9% in gas and rent. 
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, demand was strong this quarter across most of our core business with particular strength in manufacturing, petrochemical and energy customers, and noticeable improvement in our construction customer base despite the lack of large, new construction projects. 
Our product line adjacency businesses  also performed well relative to our expectations, highlighted by strong pre-season demand in our refrigerants business that contributed nicely to our earnings this quarter. 
The strength of our hardgoods same-store sales growth relative to gas and rent, and a sales mix shift within hardgoods to welding and automation equipment reflect the continued, modest expansion and reinvestment we're seeing by larger customers in the manufacturing-intensive regions of the U.S. While the mix shift has a dilutive effect on our gross margin, we've continued to leverage our national footprint and industry-leading platform to increase our underlying operating margin and expand our return on capital to 12.5% this quarter, 60 basis points over the prior year. 
As far as sales trends are concerned, we saw a very robust January and February which we really didn't expect because they tend to be muted. And then we saw a flattening of the growth in March. So, maybe that was a seasonal effect of the warm weather, pushing sales to, or pulling sales, to the front of the quarter. March continues steady, April continues steady. We surveyed all of our business leaders in the last couple of weeks and the outlook is for continued steady growth, slow but steady growth, across the economy and customer base. 
As I love to remind people, the best in time at Airgas is now. Now let me hand it off to Mike to review some of our key initiatives."

Before I discuss our results, I'd like to thank Peter and the board for the confidence they placed in me. I'm honored and energized by this opportunity and look forward to enhancing Airgas' position as one of the premier industrial gas companies in the world. 
Under Peter's stewardship, Airgas has achieved remarkable success over the last 30 years. Most recently, the company weathered the financial crisis and emerged stronger than ever. I'm excited about the challenge of leading Airgas and about building upon the solid foundation Peter has established. As CEO, I will continue to lead the company's operations and information technology initiatives, while also assuming responsibility for finance and human resources. Peter and I have worked successfully together for many years and I'm pleased that he will stay actively involved in Airgas, continuing to contribute the vision and leadership that have helped make the company what it is today. I plan to continue his tradition of strong, active leadership and nurturing Airgas' entrepreneurial culture in pursuit of the tremendous opportunities ahead. 
Airgas is the leading packaged gas company in the U.S. and a significant expansion of our bulk gas production and distribution capabilities in recent years, combined with our broad offering of hardgoods and value weighted services, have created a value proposition for our diverse customer base that is virtually unrivaled in the industry. Our performance over the years and, in particular, through the recession really demonstrates the resilience of our business model. Our success also demonstrate the loyalty of our customers and the tremendous work ethic and commitment to excellence of all Airgas associates, all resulting in an extremely compelling track record of creating shareholder value. Our more than 15,000 associates are the best in the business and, together, we will continue to focus on operating safely, serving our loyal customers and growing the business for years to come. I intend to hit the ground running on day 1 to continue the success of this great company, and I look forward to working with Peter and all of the other members of our team. 
And now I'd like to continue the discussion of our fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 3. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment continues to gain momentum. Strategic Accounts presents us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and locations and represent more than 20% of total sales. In the fourth quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 11% from the prior year, driven by new account signing across all customer segments and by increased activity on our existing metal fabrication, oil and gas and chemicals customer bases. 
As Peter mentioned, our construction customer base is showing noticeable improvement on the strength of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business which has resulted from some capacity expansion projects and turnarounds in the Oil and Gas and Chemicals segment, as well as strong turnarounds in the refineries and power sectors. 
I encourage you to review our strategic products slide in the appendix in detail after our call. In the fourth quarter, strategic products which make up about 40% of our revenue increased 10% over the prior year. Safety products once again deliver the highest growth at 17%, driven by business with new and existing large customers. 
Our Radnor private label products were up 14% for the quarter, the long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor product are 1.5x greater than those of comparable OEM products. 
We are progressing well through our planned phase rollout of SAP whereby our business units implement the new system in succession. At this point, we are more than half -- we have more than half of our business running smoothly on SAP and we still expect to have 11 of 12 regions converted by December 2012, with the remaining region converted in the first quarter of calendar 2013. 
On Monday, we successfully converted another region to SAP and migrated its back office support functions into one of our 4 Business Support Centers. The next region will convert in less than 4 weeks from now. 
We remain committed to minimizing implementation risk and converting the rest of our business units to SAP, but much risk has been abated and we are shifting our focus to attaining benefits. Based on our experience to date, we're confident by the end of the calendar 2013, the benefits we've detail will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in annual run rate operating income, with the likelihood that these benefits will ultimately reach or exceed $125 million. The areas of benefits we have announced do not represent the full earnings power of our SAP conversion, however, and we expect additional economic benefits after the implementation is completed and we tap into the potential of the new system. Thank you. 
And now Bob will now give you our financial review for the quarter and provide an update for guidance next year."
24504,184392379,297347,"Airgas Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Airgas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone.

Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results for the fourth quarter. Please note that prior period amounts have been adjusted for the retrospective application of a change in the method of accounting for a portion of our hardgoods inventory from LIFO to the average-cost method. 
In conjunction with the rollout of SAP and our operating realignment into 4 divisions, we are merging our distribution businesses into a single LLC which necessitated standardizing our inventory valuation method. Prior to this change in accounting, only 10% of our inventory was accounted for in the LIFO method. The impact of this change was immaterial to all periods presented. 
Sales increased 13% year-over-year to $1.24 billion reflecting acquisitions growth at 2% and total same-store sales growth of 11%,  comprised of a 9% increase in gas and rent and a 15% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 7% and price was up 4%. Sequentially, total sales increased 8% from the third quarter on 2 additional selling days and the follow-up of the third quarter holiday impact. On a daily sales basis, sales increased 4% over the third quarter. Gas and rent represented approximately 62% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from approximately 63% in the prior year and in the third quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 53.9%, a decline of 40 basis points from the prior year, reflecting continued outperformance of hardgoods sales and a mixed shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment. On a sequential basis, gross margin declined by 100 basis points as the strong -- as strong performance in our lower margin refrigerants business and hardgoods mixed shift more than offset the favorable impact of our third quarter pricing actions. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $152 million which was up 13% from last year and which included $5 million of incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Not included in adjusted operating income were pretax charges of approximately $4 million related to the previously announced Business Support Center restructuring and a $2 million impairment charge related to one of our smaller, less efficient air separation units.  
Our underlying operating performance was strong, particularly in light of year-over-year headwinds from incremental SAP costs and depreciation expense. Adjusted operating margin of 12.2% for the quarter included 90 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. The prior year's adjusted operating margin of 12.2% included only 50 basis points of SAP-related costs. Excluding these incremental SAP costs, adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year, driven by operating leverage on strong organic sales growth. Excluding $0.06 in tax benefits related to the LLC reorganization and the true up of foreign tax liabilities, net of $0.05 of BSC restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted earnings per share were $1.11, an increase of 26% from $0.88 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.11 includes a year-over-year increase of $0.05 in SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, which were offset by the accretion from our share repurchase programs. Our adjusted tax -- our adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes the $0.06 per diluted share income tax benefit resulting from the LLC reorganization, was 36.2% for the fourth quarter and 37.3% for the full year. The LLC reorganization enables us to realize certain state tax benefits that previously required evaluation allowance. 
There were approximately $78.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 7% year-over-year, driven by share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.5%, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year on the strength of our improving operating income. Adjusted cash from operations for the full year was $593 million and free cash flow was $262 million. The decrease in free cash flow from the prior year is $387 million, reflects an increase in capital expenditures and working capital that supports strong sales growth, as well as some major capital projects which I will comment on later. 
Total debt increased approximately $308 million year-over-year to $2.16 billion at March 31, reflecting strong operating cash, offset by $300 million spent on the share repurchase program and $160 million spent on acquisitions. Our fixed float debt ratio at the end of December was approximately 52% fixed and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.5, comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. We are well positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our targeted range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx. 
Turning now to Slide 5, we'll  look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results have not been allocated to our business segments nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. 
Distribution sales in the quarter were up 11% versus the prior year to $1.11 billion. Same-store sales for distribution segments were up 10%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 7%, and hardgoods were up 15%, with pricing up 4% and volume up 6%. Distribution gross margin was 54.5%, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to hardgoods, and within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment. 
Sequentially, distribution gross margins decreased by 60 basis points from the third quarter, primarily driven by the sales mix shift to lower margin hardgoods. Underlying gross margins excluding the mix impacts on both gases and hardgoods, each improved sequentially from the third quarter. 
Gas and rent represented 57.2% of distribution sales in the fourth quarter, down from 59% in the prior year and 58.7% in the third quarter. 
Operating income in distribution segment increased 12% year-over-year to $146 million and operating income improved to 13.1% comparable to the prior year despite the dilutive effect of the mixed shift to hardgoods and a 20-basis-point impact of higher SAP depreciation expense. 
All other operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia and nitrous oxide businesses. Sales for all other operations were up 24% from the prior year with same-store sales up 18%. The same-store sales increased was largely driven by an increase in both refrigerants and ammonia sales, each on strong volume and pricing. Sequentially, sales in all other operations segment increased 16% in total and 12% on a daily basis driven by the strength in refrigerants, partially offset by normal seasonality in our dry ice business. Gross margin for all other operations was 45.5%, an increase of 270 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants and CO2 businesses. Sequentially, the, 340 basis-point decrease in gross margins from the third quarter was primarily driven by the mix shift towards lower margin refrigerants and normal seasonality within our dry ice business. 
Operating income for all other operations was $15 million, an increase of $6 million over the prior year and operating margin of 10.9% was up 330 basis points year-over-year, driven by a margin expansion in our refrigerants, CO2 and ammonia businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. Fiscal 2012 CapEx represented 7.5% of sales. Construction in process was the asset category with the highest year-over-year growth in spending, driven by the construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee, the expansion of our hardgoods distribution centers in Duluth, Georgia and Bristol, Pennsylvania, the buildout of our Business Support Centers, and projects to expand or consolidate plants and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. The cylinder and bulk tanks category also were a contributor to the year-over-year increase as improved gas and rent same-store sales reflect improvements in demand for our core revenue generating assets. Rental welders increased by $22 million on the improvement of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business that Mike mentioned earlier. Excluding major projects, CapEx as a percent of sales was approximately 5%. 
Slide 7 presents our fiscal 2013 first quarter and full year guidance. For the first quarter, we expect same-store sales growth in the mid to upper single-digits, with adjusted earnings in the range of $1.12 to $1.16 per diluted share, an increase of 12% to 15% over the prior year, which includes $0.08 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense in both periods. 
For the full year, we expect same-store sales growth in the mid to upper single-digits, with adjusted earnings in the range of $4.70 to $4.85 per diluted share, up 14% to 18% over fiscal 2012, which includes approximately $0.12 to $0.16 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, net of expected benefits. 
Fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per diluted share included $0.34 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. We expect same-store sales growth to land in the mid to upper digits for the full fiscal year and adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.8% to 13.3%, including the net dilutive impact of SAP costs, partially offset by the expected benefits. This represents a significant expansion in our adjusted operating margin, from 12.2% in fiscal 2012. CapEx is expected to be around 6.5% of sales for the new fiscal year. 
Our fiscal 2013 adjusted EPS guidance assumes continuation of recent business trends including continued outperformance of hardgoods relative to gas and rent on the strength of U.S. manufacturing, particularly, metal fabrication which uses a proportionately greater amount of hardgoods in their processes, in addition to broad-based modest improvement across the rest of the base business. The guidance excludes the impact of Business Support Center restructuring and related charges. 
Slide 8 presents a walk from the primarily elements of our first quarter and full year guidance using fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.11 and fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.11, respectively, as the starting point. In the first quarter, we expect headwinds of approximately $0.06 related to our stock-based compensation as the largest portion of our full year stock-based compensation expense follows in the first quarter and $0.02 due to a higher effective tax rate relative to the fourth quarter. 
We expect seasonality in our CO2, dry ice and refrigerants businesses tempered by the fourth quarter strong performance of refrigerants to provide a net tailwind of approximately $0.06 and we expect our core business to expand sequentially contributing $0.03 to $0.07 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy. For fiscal 2013, the impact of 2 fewer selling days is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.05 and $0.06 and a slightly higher tax rate relative to fiscal 2012 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03. 
SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense net of the ramp-up of benefits are expected to provide a tailwind of $0.18 to $0.22 relative to the $0.34 of net expense in fiscal 2012 with base business growth of $0.50 to $0.60 or 12% to 15% over the prior year adjusted EPS.

And our construction sales were up 12% for the quarter and basically that was really good because there were a lot -- there were a few big projects, but they were winding down. And there hasn't been many of them. And it's mostly on the strength of these turnarounds in the power industry and oil and gas business and petrochemical industries, and through penetration of the customer segment, we've done a good job penetrating the customer segment. So, I think we're in great shape when the bigger projects do start up. I think we're going to see them with these pet-chem projects that have been announced, and the LNG projects that have been announced, and a lot of the power projects. And then hopefully, maybe some infrastructure projects. So I think, bottom line, we're very well positioned to grow in the construction business."

But as far as issues, delays, problems, things like that, we have been having very, very few. We're in a cycle now where -- which we weren't in before, where we're actually doing one of these a month. And we'll do one the first week of June, we'll do one the first week of July and then we'll take a month off for some rest and then we're going to be in that one-a-month cycle throughout the fall.

Our Airgas South group which was the first one on SAP and has since integrated Airgas Mid America onto SAP and it's supporting them with the Business Support Center in Atlanta, will be the group to convert that.

Basically, we're a specialty distributor, meaning we have a very, very deep product line and our products are very technical, gases and welding equipment, welding to technical activity. So our customers rely on us for a lot of technical support and most of our customers, metal fabrication, or gas used in a furnace, or in a tire plant or something like that, our products are integral to their operations and they need our technical support. So we think that a vast majority of our business could never be touched by an Amazon. There's a certain part of our business, small, retail, walk-in, small-order business, that's been under assault for years. The Kmarts, the Wal-Marts, the Home Depots, Grainger, all kinds of -- Fastenal. And I think, over the years that has probably chipped away some of the casual small business that we -- small orders that we would otherwise enjoy. But we're addressing that with our eBusiness initiative on the retail side. And, of course, most of our eBusiness initiative is going to be directed towards the larger customers who use a lot of our products and to make it seamless and to reduce transaction costs and supply chain costs. But as I -- I don't discount Amazon. I mean, they've done a great job with CDs and books and things like that. And they called us up and asked us to sell to them and we just really didn't have an interest in that. Their logistics aren't any better than ours.

We've been watching everybody else for a number of years. We think we know what we want to do. The major thrust of the eBusiness for us is our larger, more sophisticated customers that need a deep offering, they need technical support, the need training and things like that. If you look at our smaller customers, the customers that have been really more likely to be wooed by -- they don't get a lot of attention from us, they're not big enough for a salesman to cover, they are the ones that are more likely to be buying from any number of channels. And if you look at some of our data, for that class of customer, about 90% of what they buy from us today is gases. So, I mean, the hardgoods spend for that class of customer is already very small and, I think, many of those customers are the ones that are already buying their hardgoods from Grainger tractor supply, I mean, you can list the names of all the people in the last 15 to 20 years have added welding. However, the ability for those kinds of guys to make traction on somebody that needs a deep product line, as well as somebody that'll teach you how to use it has been very, very, very low. And so, I think, a lot of the business that we're at risk of losing, we probably have already lost. And I think there will be a real fight among the MRO folks for these vanilla, generic relatively simple items, much more so than it would be for the sophisticated welding and cutting user. But we're still committed to being best-in-class so that we get our fair share of even the small customers."

Meaning we could get even 5% less on April 1. It's really hard to say because there's so many different kinds of helium sales, different customers and we've aggressively raised price because of the shortage and because of the extra expense that we've incurred. Transferring helium supplies, where they are available to places where we have demand by -- from critical customers, in the petrochemical industries or the health care or things like that. So I think, net-net, maybe a $0.01 negative impact in the quarter on helium. And that's just -- it's kind of like a wild -- it's not a wild guess, but it definitely was slightly negative we think. We did get the higher price but our sales suffered and we had extra expense moving helium around. We think this problem is going to stay with us for at least until the fall, could be even longer. And there's one plant that hasn't started up out west because of the helium comes from natural gas processing and the gas prices is so low. At least that's what we think the reason is.  And there's been summer shutdowns around the world that is having increased demand for exports. Unfortunately, a lot of the helium that's refined in this country, much of which is owned by the U.S. taxpayers is being exported and it's hurting U.S. jobs. And it's a real shame and we're trying to get the word out that, that's not right. The U.S. economy has enough problems without allowing for -- not giving the U.S. businesses an access to this helium. And so we'll see what happens. We don't expect this to be over soon. We've had to shed some customers but in the long run, you'll see when there's a shortage, price does offset volume and losses and expenses. And we still have the biggest and best supply chain in the United States for delivering helium to customers. So we don't see permanent damage for our helium business from this but it is a hassle to move all of this helium around for critical customers."

Please turn to Slide 2. I would like to start today by giving you my overall view of our quarterly results, the current business landscape and our outlook for the fiscal year. Overall, I think",710,"Thanks, Barry. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Please turn to Slide 2. I would like to start today by giving you my overall view of our quarterly results, the current business landscape and our outlook for the fiscal year. Overall, I think our first quarter record results demonstrate the resilience of our business model. Our adjusted earnings were a record $1.13 per share and while they were within our guided range, albeit at the lower end of that range they were weighed down by the impact of greater-than-anticipated disruption in our helium supply chain during the quarter. Lower helium sales volume driven by the inability of suppliers to meet their helium supply commitments to us during the quarter reduced earnings by $0.04 per diluted share, only $0.01 or $0.02 of which was anticipated when we provided our guidance in early May. While we expect the global helium supply chain to improve in early calendar 2013, the year-over-year headwinds from reduced volumes will continue to be greater than we had originally anticipated for the remainder of the current fiscal year, and it will take some time for us to regain lost business. 
Same-store sales growth in our core distribution business decelerated this quarter to 7%, but very strong performances in all other operational businesses provided nice boost to earnings in a moderating environment. SAP implementation costs were higher than expected this quarter, and will likely be higher than expected for the remainder of the year. However, the most important thing we can do to position ourselves to derive long-term value from this investment is to get the implementation rights and to support our hard-working associates in doing so. The good news is that SAP and the total implementation over all is going very, very well. At this point, nearly 70% of our distribution business is running on SAP, and we think the full year expense net of benefit will be in the well $0.12 to $0.16 net expense range that we projected earlier. Strong cash flow continues to be a hallmark of our business model. Adjusted cash flow from operations increased 12% year-over-year to $155 million in the quarter and free cash flow increased 7% year-over-year to $76 million in the quarter. 
With regard to the current landscape, most of our customer segments appear to be stable or growing slowly. In fact, our metal fabrication customer segment remained a bright spot even through June when daily sales in most of our other segments slowed from May levels. Daily sales in July typically starts slowly due to the holiday then rebound as the month progresses. However, after the normal slow start, daily sales have been somewhat sluggish at this point so it's tough to predict how the end of the month will play out. Coupled with a deceleration in GDP growth, we believe the economic recovery has indeed hit a soft patch. 
With regard to our outlook, we expect most of our customer segments to continue to post modest growth this year, but we're cautious about the near-term outlook. Energy and infrastructure construction could provide some upside later this year if many of the recently announced projects in energy, power and petrochemical industries put shovel to dirt as planned. We've proven in the past that we can reduce costs if appropriate, and we will continue to monitor business trends and make adjustments if needed. We are revising our guidance range slightly downwards from a range of $4.70 to $4.85 to a range of $4.65 to $4.75 to account for the impact of the unexpected further disruption in our helium supply chain over the course of the full year and some near-term caution on current business conditions. Should conditions continue to deteriorate, however, we would have to revisit the outlook. But as I said, I do believe this is just as soft spot in the recovery . We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for U.S. manufacturing and energy industries and in particular, our ability to leverage our unique value proposition, which will only be enhanced by our conversion to SAP and our unrivaled platform to drive growth and needs in other key customer segments. Now I'll hand it off to Mike to review some of our key initiatives."

Helium supply chain problem are something that we have been living with for almost a year. However, the extended duration and increased intensity have had a significant effect in our customers. Most people are unaware that we supply 22% of the helium to end-users in the United States. As of January 2012, we have been able to secure approximately 90% of our historical demand. Knowing additional cuts were underway, we worked throughout Q4 to shed noncontract customers, including many of our most profitable ones in order to preserve product to meet our obligation to those customers with whom we have contracts. We are also forced to begin allocating our contract customers for all but critical use applications. By April, allocations from our major suppliers reduced our available helium to 70% of historical demand. As May progressed, it became evident that some of our suppliers were struggling to deliver the allocated volume, and in one case, we're providing less than 60% of the committed volume. The shortfall was not uniform across the country, causing even more severe shortages in certain local markets. Our aggregate allocation levels remained below 70% for the balance of the first quarter, and effective July 1, one major supply reduced our allocation to 50% where they are projecting it may remain for several months. We are not expecting reductions beyond that, but yet nothing has been predictable in the situation. Our current expectation is that Q2 will be the worst quarter with some relief expected in the fall and some significant relief expected in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Reclaiming lost customers will take more than just having available product once the supply chain is restored, it will take time. 
Now I'd like to move on to review some of our strategic initiatives. Please turn to Slide 3. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on tailoring our value proposition to the unique needs of each major customer segment continues to gain momentum and will be a driving force behind the Airgas organic growth story going forward. Our Strategic Accounts program, which leverages the segment-driven approach presents us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines, services and locations and represents more than 20% of our sales. In the first quarter, our Strategic Accounts business was up 8% from the prior year, driven by new account signings and increased activity in most of our customer segments, most notably in our metal fabrication and oil, gas and chemicals customer base. The retail segment is primary outlier with double-digit sales declines due to the substantial reduction in the helium supply this year compared to last year. Excluding retail, Strategic Accounts were up 11% from the prior year. 
Our construction customer base continues to show noticeable improvement on the strength of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business, which benefited from the continuation of strong spring season in the oil, gas and chemicals and refineries power plants segment and posted first quarter sales growth in excess of 20% over the prior year. 
Strategic products continue to be an important part of our value proposition to customers and from a product standpoint, have a strong growth profile used in favorable customer segment, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross-sell opportunities or a combination of these factors. In the first quarter, sales of strategic products increased 7% over the prior year. Safety products once again delivered the highest growth of 11% driven by business with new and existing large customers. Both gases and rent grew 8% as a result of new customer signings and the strength in the manufacturing and food segments. CO2 and dry ice were flat year-over-year as new customer wins were offset by the loss of major dry ice customer servicing the airlines industry in the summer of 2011, which negatively affected the comp. 
Our Radnor private label sales were up 10% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins at Radnor products are 1.5x are greater than those comparable OEM products. 
As Peter mentioned, the SAP implementation costs are higher than we had anticipated in the first quarter, and will likely be higher than anticipated for the remainder of the year primarily driven by additional post-conversion support cost, including over time, travel and training. The --"

The SAP software is very powerful, but also very complex. One of the key factors for a successful SAP conversion is to process transactions correctly the first time and not fall behind in the daily processing of these transactions. We call it doing daily work daily. We are finding that the post conversion our associates are processing most transactions correctly and they are doing their daily work daily but in many cases due to the newness and the complexity of the software, they're struggling to do it with normally scheduled hours, which is creating overtime and added expense. Although we anticipated this, the length of time to work as efficiently as they did prior to conversion is taking longer than we had anticipated. This expense eases over time, but we are anticipating this to continue in most companies for 3 to 6 months post conversion. Given the magnitude and scope of this project and the significant value-enhancing opportunities that will enable for Airgas and our full-service offering customers for years to come priority #1 has been and will always be to get it done right and to support our associates in doing so and we are doing exactly those things. 
To give you some perspective, in the past 5 months, we have successfully converted 4 regional companies and trained more than 2,000 users, which is a significant accomplishment for which our associates are to be commended. The implementation is on schedule and over $2.9 billion in annualized sales, nearly 70% of the distribution business, are now running through SAP. We remain committed to minimizing implementation risks in converting the rest of our business units to SAP, but much risk has been abated and we are continuing to shift our focus to attaining benefits. We remain confident that we will realize the economic benefit as planned and that this investment will further enhance the value of our full service offerings to customers. The 3 areas of opportunities for value enhancement that we have announced do not represent the full benefit of our investment at SAP, and we expect to explore additional areas of opportunity after the implementation is complete.

Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results. Sales increased 8% year-over-year to $1.26 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth at 7% comprised of a 5% increase in gas and rent and a 9% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 3% and price was up 4%. Sequentially, sales increased 1% from the fourth quarter. Gas and rent represented approximately 62% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from approximately 52% of the prior year and up slightly from the fourth quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 54.8%, an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year as the impact of continued outperformance of lower margin hardgoods relative to gas and rent was more than offset by margin expansion on industrial gases, gases, gases and ammonia. 
On a sequential basis, gross margins improved by 90 basis points due to a favorable mix shift towards gas and rent, the seasonal decline in lower margin fuel gases and underlying margin expansion in several gas categories. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $157 million, up 9% from last year, which included $2 million of incremental SAP implementation costs. Not included in adjusted operating income were pretax charges of approximately $4 million related to the previously announced Business Support Center restructuring and a $1.7 million asset impairment charge. 
Adjusted operating margin of 12.5% for the quarter included 100 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. The prior year's adjusted operating margin of 12.4% included 90 basis points of SAP related cost. 
Excluding a $0.07 gain from the sale of 5 Canadian branches, $0.03 of BSC restructuring charges and a $0.02 impairment charge related to a small hospital pricing construction business adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.13, an increase of 13% over the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $1.13 includes $0.10 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.02 higher than the prior year. 
In addition, lower helium sales volumes driven by helium supply constraints we have discussed reduced year-over-year earnings by $0.04 per diluted share, some of which was anticipated. There were approximately 79 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 2% year-over-year driven by share repurchase program that was completed in the first quarter of last year. 
Return on capital, which is a trailing 4-quarter calculation was 12.6%, an improvement of 50 basis points over last year. We generated strong free cash flow of $76 million in the first quarter, up from $71 million the prior year, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $155 million, which increased 12% over the prior year. 
Total debt decreased by approximately $126 million year-over-year to $2.1 billion at June 30. Our fixed debt ratio at the end of December was approximately 53% fixed and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.4 comfortably within our target range of 2:3. 
We are well positioned to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range, while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx. 
Turning now to Slide 5, we will look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs which are included in our consolidated adjusted operating results has not been allocated to our business segments, nor has the special items that has been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 8% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion. Same-store sales to the distribution segment were up 7%, up 4% and volume up 3%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 5% and hardgoods were up 9%. 
Distribution gross margin was 55%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year as underlying margin expansion in several gas categories was more than offset by the outperformance of hardgoods relative to gas and rent. Sequentially, distributions gross margins increased by 50 basis points for the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a mix shift towards gas and rent, the seasonal decline in lower margin fuel gases and underlying margin expansion in several gas categories. Gas and rent represented 57.4 of distribution sales in the first quarter down from 58.7 the prior year and up from 57.2 in the fourth quarter. 
Operating income in the distribution segment increased 4% year-over-year to $139 million, while operating margins declined 40 basis points to 12.5. The decline in operating margin was largely driven by the significant decline in helium sales due to supply constraints, which also negatively impacted the year-over-year increase in operating income. The sequential decline in operating income is attributable to a $7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, which is front-end loaded in our fiscal year due to retirement eligibility, accelerated vesting and due to approximately $2 million negative impact from the decline in helium sales due to supply constraints. All other operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for all other operations were up 8% from the prior year with same-store sales up 6%. The same-store sales increase was largely driven by an increase in both refrigerants and ammonia sales, each on higher volume and pricing. Refrigerants gas sales have continued to benefit from increased demand ahead of a potential EPA ruling, which would accelerate the phaseout of new production of R-22, the most commonly used refrigerant gas in HVAC systems. Airgas is well positioned in the refrigerants market to reclaim, recycle and distribute R-22 nationwide to satisfy ongoing market demand in a tighter supply environment. Sequentially, sales in all other operations increased by 10%, primarily driven by the normal seasonality of the businesses within that segment. Gross margin for all other operations was 49.7%, an increase of 440 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants, CO2 and ammonia businesses. Sequentially, the 420 basis point increase in gross margins in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants and ammonia businesses. 
Operating income for all other operations was $29 million, an increase of $9 million over the prior year and operating margin of 18.6% was up 470 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by margin expansion and sales volume growth in our refrigerants and ammonia business. 
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. First quarter CapEx represented 6.5% of sales, down slightly from 6.7% of sales in the prior year. Construction and process spend was driven by the final phase of construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee, the construction of a new hardgoods distribution center in Bristol in Pennsylvania, the buildout of our Business Support Centers and projects to expand and consolidate plans, branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. Rental welders increased by $30 million on the impairment of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business as Mike discussed earlier. Excluding major projects, CapEx as a percent of sales was approximately 4%. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Please note that our fiscal 2013 guidance excludes restructuring and other special charges, which were $0.05 in the first quarter and are expected to be approximately $0.03 in the second quarter and $0.11 for the full year, as well as a $0.07 gain from the sales of businesses in the first quarter. Special gains in fiscal '12 were a net total charge of $0.11. 
Slide 7 presents a walk through the primary elements of our second quarter guidance, using first quarter adjusted EPS for $1.13 and fiscal 2012 second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.03, respectively, as starting points. to the sequential walk in the left-hand column, we expect headwinds of $0.03 for the impact of one less selling day. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce sequential earnings growth by $0.01 and normal seasonal decline in our refrigerants and Red-D-Arc rental business create additional headwinds of $0.03 to $0.05. 
On a sequential basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute additional earnings of $0.01 to $0.03. 
The right-hand column on this slide shows the year-over-year walk. Similar to the sequential walk, there are headwinds with respect to one less selling day and the negative impact from helium supply constraints. We estimate the year-over-year negative impact to be approximately $0.03 for 1 less selling day and $0.02 related to helium. We're expecting an incremental year-over-year increase in SAP implementation cost of $0.03, noting that the second quarter of last year was the lowest quarter of SAP cost in fiscal 2012. 
On a year-over-year basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute an incremental $0.10 to $0.14, representing a strong 10% to 14% growth rate. In aggregate, when factoring in the headwinds, we are estimating EPS for our second quarter to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.09. 
Our second quarter guidance assume same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits versus our previous expectations of mid- to upper single digits as well as continued outperformance of hardgoods relative to gas and rent. 
Turning to Slide 8, it walks through the primary elements of our revised full year guidance using 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.11 as the starting point. The impact of 2 less selling days is expected to be a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings by $0.10 and a slightly higher tax rate relative to fiscal 2012 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03. 
SAP implementation cost net of the ramp up of benefits are expected to provide year-over-year improvement in earnings of $0.18 to $0.22 relative to the $0.34 of net expense in fiscal 2012. Base business growth is expected to contribute $0.55 to $0.60 or 13% to 15% over prior year's adjusted EPS. And now I will turn it back to Barry to begin our question-and-answer session."

So our customers are still investing and that's kind of indicative of the early stages of a recovery. It doesn't feel like the end of an expansion because hardgoods is still stronger than gas. And prices are dominating the same-store sales. It's been pretty evenly split between volume and price. And like in 2008, I think it was multi-price and a little bit of volume. And I'm always say that is where the recovery is and I think the last time I said the bottom of the fourth inning or something. I can't really speculate on what's going to happen in Europe and how that could impact this. But it feels like we're still in the early stages of recovery. And this is going to be a very, I think, long and slow recovery and we said that right from the beginning. But other than that, I don't have much to offer."

And that's why helium in total dollars is not that big a percentage of the total from profitability and the portion of the customer that we had to shed, it had a very significant impact. Now keep in mind, we knew this was coming. So we had planned for this. The thing we didn't understand was that we were not that the cuts and the ability for us to get the projected amounts, that we couldn't get them and then across the country some of the individual local shortages haad been greater than the average. That caught us by surprise we were not prepared for that. Now the key to this is we got to have the molecules, obviously.

However, a law was passed in 1996 to provide only 3 companies gets to buy the helium from the government and obviously they export a lot of it or else our customers would have the helium and they're global companies and they've turned this into a global supply chain and market to the detriment of a lot of U.S. businesses and researchers and that's one of the remedies that we're seeking that, that wall it is expiring and Congress is considering some sort of extension of that wall or a different wall and of course we're very much involved in that because we think that as the largest supplier of helium to customers in the U.S., we should have access to taxpayers owned helium.

And that the key to supply and the demand for the next 10 to 15 to 20 years in this country is reclamation, recovery, reprocessing and things like that. And it is only now when supply and demand is getting to the point where it's even unbalanced. The recession really put it out of balance to where there was way more supply than demand and the pricing was very soft. Now as production is being curtailed and demand and supply are imbalanced, pricing is starting to improve. And in the future when production and demand are upside down, it should improve very nicely and continue to improve with more and more of it being supplied by reclamation and recovery of which we have installed a significant additional capacity already to be positioned to handle that. So we were pretty excited about our opportunity going forward in the refrigerants business."

Helium that was purchased by the government after World War I as the strategic resource with taxpayer dollars. And this past, God knows how, we objected to it at the time and it got passed and said that the government would sell off these reserves over time to companies that had refineries on the government's helium pipelines. And so they have been doing that and the proceeds of these sales from net profit were meant to pay off the debt that the government incurred by the helium. So that debt is almost paid off and the question is what would happen now? And the Act needs to be extended. There's no question because it represents 50% of the world's helium supply right now. But we wanted it extended on the basis of open access to all companies, especially companies like us who is 99% of our customer base our U.S. customers, welders, medical researchers and things like that. So that's why only 3 companies have access to this taxpayer-owned helium. Now there's some other helium that's produced by private companies in the U.S. and that helium is -- those happen to be controlled by many of the same companies. Although there are a few other companies that have contracts with these private sources, but that represent a small portion of the total U.S. production."

With the flatlining, we haven't seen small customer have started to come back in the spring and with the flatlining, that kind of stalled. And most of the growth is still coming from the big customers as a result. And at some point, I think a lot of these small customers I guess makes things for residential construction. That's about our only to that. And there are also subcontractors for nonresidential construction and construction across the board has been pretty bad. And so I would imagine some of that will pick up when construction comes back. The rest will pick up when capacity utilization moves up a few more notches because the big customers when they start ramping up against capacity, they start outsourcing. It seems like the economy, although it was better than a few years ago, it hasn't reached lift off figures. It really hasn't lifted off like it has in other recovery. So I think overall, I'm pretty happy with how we did in the quarter. Our EPS was up 13% and that included 10% of SAP expenses. And we made our range and although we missed the street by 2 pennies, we set a pretty high bar unlike a lot of other companies who are recording 3% and 5% earnings growth. And the amazing thing is that we did this in the midst of this SAP implementation. And as we said, that is going very well, but that's not say it's not a monumental undertaking. And the reason we're going back and spending extra money to get it right is because it does require changes in business processes that you can't. We knew about a lot of them but it's hard to comprehend until you're right in the middle of it. It is our fifth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We just delivered guidance that's going to give us earnings growth of 13% to 16% for the full year, and we're pretty confident in that right now unless with the one caveat if the economy turns down. I think I'm pretty pleased where we are right now."

Please turn to Slide 2. I'd like to start today by giving you my overall view of our quarterly results, the current business landscape and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.On the",715,"Thanks, Barry. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Please turn to Slide 2. I'd like to start today by giving you my overall view of our quarterly results, the current business landscape and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.
On the whole, I think our first quarter record results demonstrate the resilience of our business model. Our adjusted earnings were a record $1.13 per share. And while they were within our guided range, albeit at the lower end of that range, they were weighed down by the impact of greater-than-anticipated disruption in our helium supply chain during the quarter. Lower helium sales volumes, driven by the inability of suppliers to meet their helium supply commitments to us during the quarter, reduced earnings by $0.04 per diluted share, only $0.01 or $0.02 of which was anticipated when we provided our guidance in early May. While we expect the global helium supply chain to improve in early calendar 2013, the year-over-year headwinds from reduced volumes will continue to be greater than we had originally anticipated for the remainder of the current fiscal year, and it will take some time for us to regain lost business.
Same-store sales growth in our core distribution business decelerated this quarter to 7%, but very strong performances by our all other operations businesses provided a nice boost to earnings in a moderating environment.
SAP implementation costs were higher than expected this quarter and will likely be higher than expected for the remainder of the year. However, the most important thing we can do to position ourselves to derive long-term value from this investment is to get the implementation right and to support our hardworking associates in doing so. The good news is that SAP and the total implementation overall is going very, very well. At this point, nearly 70% of our distribution business is running on SAP, and we think the full year expense, net of benefits, will be in the $0.12 to $0.16 net expense range that we projected earlier.
Strong cash flow continues to be a hallmark of our business model. Adjusted cash flow from operations increased 12% year-over-year to $155 million in the quarter, and free cash flow increased 7% year-over-year to $76 million in the quarter.
With regard to the current landscape, most of our customer segments appear to be stable or growing slowly. In fact, our metal fabrication customer segment remained a bright spot even through June when daily sales in most of our other segments slowed from May levels. Daily sales in July typically starts slowly due to the holiday then rebound as the month progresses. However, during -- however, after the normal slow start, daily sales have been somewhat sluggish to this point, so it's tough to predict how the end of the month will play out. Coupled with the deceleration in GDP growth, we believe the economic recovery has indeed hit a soft patch.
With regard to our outlook, we expect most of our customer segments to continue to post modest growth this year, but we are cautious about the near-term outlook. Energy and infrastructure construction could provide some upside later this year if many of the recently announced projects in energy, power and petrochemical industries put shovel to dirt as planned. We've proven in the past we can reduce costs if appropriate, and we'll continue to monitor business trends and make adjustments if needed.
We are revising our guidance range slightly downward from a range of $4.70 to $4.85 to a range of $4.65 to $4.75 to account for the impact of the unexpected further disruption in our helium supply chain over the course of the full year and some near-term caution on current business conditions. Should conditions deteriorate further, however, we will have to revisit the outlook. But as I said, I do believe this is just as soft spot in the recovery . We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for U.S. manufacturing and energy industries and in particular, our ability to leverage our unique value proposition, which will only be enhanced by our conversion to SAP and our unrivaled platform to drive growth and needs and other key customer segments.
Now I'll hand it off to Mike to review some of our key initiatives."

Helium supply chain problems are something we have been living with for almost a year. However, the extended duration and increased intensity have had a significant effect in our customers. Most people are unaware that we supply 22% of the helium to end users in United States.
As for January 2012, we have been able to secure approximately 90% of our historical demand. Knowing additional cuts were on the way, we worked throughout Q4 to shed noncontract customers, including many of our most profitable ones in order to preserve product to meet our obligation to those customers with whom we had contracts. We were also forced to begin allocating our contract customers for all but critical use applications.
By April, allocations from our major suppliers reduced our available helium to 70% of historical demand. As May progressed, it became evident that some of our suppliers were struggling to deliver the allocated volumes and in one case, were providing less than 60% of the committed volume. The shortfall was not uniform across the country, causing even more severe shortages in certain local markets. Our aggregate allocation levels remained below 70% for the balance of the first quarter, and effective July 1, one major supplier reduced our allocation to 50%, where they are projecting it will remain for several months. We are not expecting reductions beyond that, but nothing has been predictable in this situation.
Our current expectation is that Q2 will be the worst quarter with some relief expected in the fall and significant relief expected in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Reclaiming lost customers will take more than just having available product once the supply chain is restored. It will take time.
Now I'd like to move on to review some of our strategic initiatives. Please turn to Slide 3. Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on tailoring our value proposition to the unique needs of each major customer segment, continues to gain momentum and will be a driving force behind the Airgas organic growth story going forward.
Our Strategic Accounts program, which leverages the segment-driven approach, presents us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines, services and locations and represents more than 20% of our sales. In the first quarter, our Strategic Accounts business was up 8% from the prior year, driven by new account signings and increased activity in most of our customer segments, most notably in our metal fabrication and oil, gas and chemicals customer bases.
The retail segment is the primary outlier with double-digit sales declines due to the substantial reduction in helium supply this year compared to last year. Excluding retail, Strategic Accounts were up 11% from the prior year.
Our construction customer base continues to show noticeable improvement on the strength of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business, which benefited from the continuation of a strong spring outage season in the oil, gas, chemicals and refineries and power plants segments. It posted first quarter sales growth in excess of 20% over the prior year.
Strategic Products continue to be an important part of our value proposition to customers and from a product standpoint, have a strong growth profile due to their use in favorable customer segments, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross-sell opportunities or a combination of these factors.
In the first quarter, sales of Strategic Products increased 7% over the prior year. Safety Products once again delivered the highest growth at 11%, driven by business with new and existing large customers. Bulk gases and rent grew 8% as a result of new customer signings and the strength in the manufacturing and food segments.

Our Radnor private label sales were up 10% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins at Radnor products are 1.5x or greater than those on comparable OEM products.
As Peter mentioned, SAP implementation costs were higher than we had anticipated in the first quarter and will likely be higher than anticipated for the remainder of the year, primarily driven by additional post-conversion support cost, including overtime, travel and training."

The SAP software is very powerful but also very complex. One of the key factors for a successful SAP conversion is to process transactions correctly the first time and not fall behind in the daily processing of these transactions. We call it doing daily work daily. We are finding that our -- that post conversion, our associates are processing most transactions correctly and they are doing their daily work daily but in many cases due to the newness and the complexity of the software, they're struggling to do it within normally scheduled hours, which is creating overtime and added expense.
Although we anticipated this, the length of time to work as efficiently as they did prior to conversion is taking longer than we had anticipated. This expense eases over time, but we are anticipating this to continue at most companies for 3 to 6 months post conversion. Given the magnitude and scope of this project and the significant value-enhancing opportunities that will enable for Airgas and our full-service offering to customers for years to come, priority #1 has been and will always be to get it done right and to support our associates in doing so, and we are doing exactly those things.
To give you some perspective, in the past 5 months, we have successfully converted 4 regional companies and trained more than 2,000 users, which is a significant accomplishment for which our associates are to be commended. The implementation is on schedule and over $2.9 billion in annualized sales, nearly 70% of the distribution business, are now running through SAP.
We remain committed to minimizing implementation risks in converting the rest of our business units to SAP, but much risk has been abated, and we are continuing to shift our focus to attaining benefits. We remain confident that we will realize the economic benefit as planned and that this investment will further enhance the value of our full service offering to customers. The 3 areas of opportunities for value enhancement that we have announced do not represent the full benefit of our investment in SAP, and we expect to explore additional areas of opportunity after the implementation is complete.
Thank you, and now Bob will give you our financial review of the quarter and provide updated guidance for the year."

Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results. Sales increased 8% year-over-year to $1.26 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth at 7%, comprised of a 5% increase in gas and rent and a 9% increase in hardgoods.
Total volume was up 3%, and price was up 4%. Sequentially, sales increased 1% from the fourth quarter. Gas and rent represented approximately 62% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from approximately 63% in the prior year and up slightly from the fourth quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter was 54.8%, an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year as the impact of continued outperformance of lower margin hardgoods relative to gas and rent was more than offset by margin expansion on industrial gases, refrigerant gases and ammonia.
On a sequential basis, gross margins improved by 90 basis points due to a favorable mix shift towards gas and rent, a seasonal decline in lower margin fuel gases and underlying margin expansion in several gas categories.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $157 million, up 9% from last year, which included $2 million of incremental SAP implementation costs. Not included in adjusted operating income were pretax charges of approximately $4 million related to the previously announced Business Support Center restructuring and a $1.7 million asset impairment charge.
Adjusted operating margin of 12.5% for the quarter included 100 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. The prior year's adjusted operating margin of 12.4% included 90 basis points of SAP-related cost.
Excluding a $0.07 gain from the sale of 5 Canadian branches, $0.03 of BSC restructuring charges and a $0.02 impairment charge related to a small hospital pricing construction business adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.13, an increase of 13% over the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $1.13 includes $0.10 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.02 higher than the prior year.
In addition, lower helium sales volumes, driven by helium supply constraints we have discussed, reduced year-over-year earnings by $0.04 per diluted share, some of which was anticipated. There were approximately 79 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, driven by share repurchase program that were completed in the first quarter of last year.
Return on capital, which is a trailing 4-quarter's calculation was 12.6%, an improvement of 50 basis points over last year. We generated strong free cash flow of $76 million in the first quarter, up from $71 million in the prior year, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $155 million, which increased 12% over the prior year.
Total debt decreased by approximately $126 million year-over-year to $2.1 billion at June 30. Our fixed float debt ratio at the end of December was approximately 53% fixed, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.4, comfortably within our target range of 2:3.
We are well positioned to continue -- to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx.
Turning now to Slide 5, we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusting operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments nor has the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results.
Distribution sales in the quarter were up 8% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion. Same-store sales for the distribution segment were up 7%; the pricing, up 4%; and volume, up 3%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 5%, and hardgoods were up 9%. Distribution gross margin was 55%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year as underlying margin expansion in several gas categories was more than offset by the outperformance of hardgoods relative to gas and rent. Sequentially, distribution gross margins increased by 50 basis points for the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a mix shift towards gas and rent, the seasonal decline in lower margin fuel gases and underlying margin expansion in several gas categories. Gas and rent represented 57.4% of distribution sales in the first quarter, down from 58.7% in the prior year and up from 57.2% in the fourth quarter.
Operating income in the distribution segment increased 4% year-over-year to $139 million, while operating margin declined 40 basis points to 12.5%. The decline in operating margin was largely driven by the significant decline in helium sales due to supply constraints, which also negatively impacted the year-over-year increase in operating income. The sequential decline in operating income is attributable to a $7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, which is front-end loaded in our fiscal year due to retirement eligibility accelerated vesting and due to approximately $2 million negative impact from the decline in helium sales due to supply constraints.
All other operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for all other operations were up 8% from the prior year with same-store sales up 6%. The same-store sales increase was largely driven by an increase in both refrigerants and ammonia sales, each on higher volume and pricing. Refrigerant gas sales have continued to benefit from increased demand ahead of a potential EPA ruling, which would accelerate the phaseout of new production of R-22, the most commonly used refrigerant gas in HVAC systems.
Airgas is well positioned in the refrigerants market to reclaim, recycle and distribute R-22 nationwide to satisfy ongoing market demand in a tighter supply environment. Sequentially, sales in all other operations segment increased by 10%, primarily driven by the normal seasonality of the businesses within that segment. Gross margin for all other operations was 49.7%, an increase of 440 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants, CO2 and ammonia businesses. Sequentially, 420 basis point increase in gross margins from the fourth quarter was primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants and ammonia businesses.
Operating income for all other operations was $29 million, an increase of $9 million over the prior year, and operating margin of 18.6% was up 470 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by margin expansion and sales volume growth in our refrigerants and ammonia business.
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. First quarter CapEx represented 6.5% of sales, down slightly from 6.7% of sales in the prior year. Construction-in-process spend was driven by the final stage of construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee; the construction of a new hardgoods distribution center in Bristol, Pennsylvania; the buildout of our Business Support Centers and projects to expand or consolidate plants, branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations.
Rental welders increased by $30 million on the improvement in our Red-D-Arc rental welder business, as Mike discussed earlier. Excluding major projects, CapEx as a percent of sales was approximately 4%.
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Please note that our fiscal 2013 guidance excludes restructuring and other special charges, which were $0.05 in the first quarter, and are expected to be approximately $0.03 in the second quarter and $0.11 for the full year, as well as a $0.07 gain from the sale of businesses in the first quarter. Special gains and charges in fiscal '12 were a net total charge of $0.11.
Slide 7 presents a walk through the primary elements of our second quarter guidance, using first quarter adjusted EPS for $1.13 and fiscal 2012 second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.03, respectively, as starting points. In the sequential walk in the left-hand column, we expect headwinds of $0.03 for the impact of one less selling day. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce sequential earnings growth by $0.01, and normal seasonal declines in our refrigerants and welder rental business create additional headwinds of $0.03 to $0.05. On a sequential basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute additional earnings of $0.01 to $0.03.
The right-hand column on the slide shows the year-over-year walk. Similar to the sequential walk, there are headwinds with respect to one less selling day and the negative impact from helium supply constraints. We estimate the year-over-year negative impact to be approximately $0.03 for one less selling day and $0.02 related to helium. We're expecting an incremental year-over-year increase in SAP implementation cost of $0.03, noting that the second quarter of last year was the lowest quarter of SAP cost in fiscal 2012.
On a year-over-year basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute an incremental $0.10 to $0.14, representing a strong 10% to 14% growth rate. In aggregate, when factoring in the headwinds, we are estimating EPS for our second quarter to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.09. Our second quarter guidance assume same-store sales growth in the mid-single-digits versus our previous expectations of mid- to upper-single digits, as well as continued outperformance of hardgoods relative to gas and rent.
Turning to Slide 8, it walks through the primary elements of our revised full year guidance using 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.11 as the starting point. The impact of 2 less selling days is expected to be a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings by $0.10, and a slightly higher tax rate relative to fiscal 2012 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03. SAP implementation cost, net of the ramp up of benefits, are expected to provide year-over-year improvement in earnings of $0.18 to $0.22 relative to the $0.34 of net expense in fiscal 2012. Base business growth is expected to contribute $0.55 to $0.60 or 13% to 15% over prior year's adjusted EPS.

The Bureau of Land Management said where I think about 70% of the helium in the U.S. comes from has had its mechanical issues with the pipeline compressors and things like that as well, and that's simply a compounded problem. There's plenty of helium in the U.S. to supply the U.S. customers. However, there -- a law was passed in 1996 that provide -- and only 3 companies get to buy that helium from the government and obviously, they export a lot of it or else our customers would have the helium, and they're global companies and they've turned this into a global supply chain and market to the detriment of a lot of U.S. businesses and researchers. And that's one of the remedies that we're seeking that, that wall is under -- it's expiring, and Congress is considering some sort of extension of that law or a different law. And of course, we're very much involved in that because we think that as the largest supplier of helium to customers in the U.S., we should have access to taxpayer-owned helium. But that's just one thing we're doing. We're also looking at other sources. We're talking now to suppliers. We've obtained a small amount of relief by trading helium with other suppliers.

Now as production is being curtailed and demand and supply are imbalanced, pricing is starting to improve. And in the future, when production and demand are upside down, it should improve very nicely and continue to improve with more and more of it being supplied by reclamation and recovery, of which we had installed a significant additional capacity already to be positioned to handle that.

And this law got passed, God knows how, we objected to it at the time, but it got passed, and it said that the government would sell off these reserves over time to companies that had refineries on the government's helium pipeline. And so they've been doing that, and the proceeds of these sales or net profit were meant to pay off the debt that the government incurred by the helium. And so that debt is almost paid off, and the question is what happens now? And the Act needs to be extended. There's no question because it represents like 50% of the world's helium supply right now. But we wanted to extended it on a basis of open access to all companies, especially companies like us who's 99% of our customer base are U.S. customers, welders, medical researchers, things like that.

With the flatlining, we haven't see -- the small customer had started to come back in the spring, and with the flatlining, that's kind of stalled. And most of the growth is still coming from the big customers as a result. And at some point, I think a lot of these small customers I guess makes things for residential construction. That's about our only eye to that. And they're also subcontractors for nonresidential construction, and construction across the board has been pretty bad. So I would imagine some of that will pick up when construction comes back. The rest will pick up when capacity utilization moves up a few more notches because the big customers, when they start pumping up against capacity, they start outsourcing. So that will -- and the -- it seems like the economy, although it's better than it was a few years ago, it's not -- it hasn't reached lift-off speed here. It really hasn't lifted off like it has in other recovery. So I think overall, I'm pretty happy with how we did in the quarter. Our EPS was up 13%, and that included 10% of SAP expenses. And we made our range and although we missed the street by $0.02, we made our range and we set a pretty high bar, unlike a lot of other companies who were recording 3% and 5% earnings growth. And the amazing thing is that we did this in the midst of this SAP implementation. And as we said, that's going very well, but that's not to say it's not a monumental undertaking. And the reason we're going back and spending extra money to get it right is because it does require changes in business processes that you can't -- we knew about a lot of them, but it's hard to comprehend until you're right in the middle of it. And it's our fifth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth. And we just delivered guidance that's going to give us earnings growth of 13% to 16% for the full year, and we're pretty confident in that right now unless with the one caveat if the economy turns down. So I think -- I'm pretty pleased where we are right now."

Please turn to Slide 2. I'd like to start today by giving you my overall view of our quarterly results, the current business landscape and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.On the",714,"Thanks, Barry. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Please turn to Slide 2. I'd like to start today by giving you my overall view of our quarterly results, the current business landscape and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.
On the whole, I think our first quarter record results demonstrate the resilience of our business model. Our adjusted earnings were a record $1.13 per share. And while they were within our guided range, albeit at the lower end of that range, they were weighed down by the impact of greater-than-anticipated disruption in our helium supply chain during the quarter. Lower helium sales volumes, driven by the inability of suppliers to meet their helium supply commitments to us during the quarter, reduced earnings by $0.04 per diluted share, only $0.01 or $0.02 of which was anticipated when we provided our guidance in early May. While we expect the global helium supply chain to improve in early calendar 2013, the year-over-year headwinds from reduced volumes will continue to be greater than we had originally anticipated for the remainder of the current fiscal year, and it will take some time for us to regain lost business.
Same-store sales growth in our core distribution business decelerated this quarter to 7%, but very strong performances by our All Other Operations businesses provided a nice boost to earnings in a moderating environment.
SAP implementation costs were higher than expected this quarter and will likely be higher than expected for the remainder of the year. However, the most important thing we can do to position ourselves to derive long-term value from this investment is to get the implementation right and to support our hardworking associates in doing so. The good news is that SAP and the total implementation overall is going very, very well. At this point, nearly 70% of our distribution business is running on SAP, and we think the full year expense, net of benefits, will be in the $0.12 to $0.16 net expense range that we projected earlier.
Strong cash flow continues to be a hallmark of our business model. Adjusted cash flow from operations increased 12% year-over-year to $155 million in the quarter, and free cash flow increased 7% year-over-year to $76 million in the quarter.
With regard to the current landscape, most of our customer segments appear to be stable or growing slowly. In fact, our metal fabrication customer segment remained a bright spot, even through June, when daily sales in most of our other segments slowed from May levels. Daily sales in July typically start slowly due to the holiday, then rebound as the month progresses. However, during -- however, after the normal slow start, daily sales have been somewhat sluggish to this point, so it's tough to predict how the end of the month will play out. Coupled with the deceleration in GDP growth, we believe the economic recovery has indeed hit a soft patch.
With regard to our outlook, we expect most of our customer segments to continue to post modest growth this year, but we are cautious about the near-term outlook. Energy and infrastructure construction could provide some upside later this year if many of the recently announced projects in energy, power and petrochemical industries put shovel to dirt as planned. We've proven in the past we can reduce costs if appropriate, and we'll continue to monitor business trends and make adjustments if needed.
We are revising our guidance range slightly downward from a range of $4.70 to $4.85 to a range of $4.65 to $4.75 to account for the impact of the unexpected further disruption in our helium supply chain over the course of the full year and some near-term caution on current business conditions. Should conditions deteriorate further, however, we will have to revisit the outlook. But as I said, I do believe this is just as soft spot in the recovery. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for U.S. manufacturing and energy industries and in particular, our ability to leverage our unique value proposition, which will only be enhanced by our conversion to SAP and our unrivaled platform to drive growth in these and other key customer segments.
Now I'll hand it off to Mike to review some of our key initiatives."

Helium supply chain problems are something we have been living with for almost a year. However, the extended duration and increased intensity have had a significant effect in our customers. Most people are unaware that we supply 22% of the helium to end users in the United States.
Through January 2012, we had been able to secure approximately 90% of our historical demand. Knowing additional cuts were on the way, we worked throughout Q4 to shed noncontract customers, including many of our most profitable ones, in order to preserve product to meet our obligation to those customers with whom we had contracts. We were also forced to begin allocating our contract customers for all but critical use applications.
By April, allocations from our major suppliers reduced our available helium to 70% of historical demand. As May progressed, it became evident that some of our suppliers were struggling to deliver the allocated volumes and in one case, were providing less than 60% of the committed volume. The shortfall was not uniform across the country, causing even more severe shortages in certain local markets. Our aggregate allocation levels remained below 70% for the balance of the first quarter, and effective July 1, one major supplier reduced our allocation to 50%, where they are projecting it will remain for several months. We are not expecting reductions beyond that, but nothing has been predictable in this situation.
Our current expectation is that Q2 will be the worst quarter, with some relief expected in the fall and significant relief expected in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Reclaiming lost customers will take more than just having available product once the supply chain is restored. It will take time.
Now I'd like to move on to review some of our strategic initiatives. Please turn to Slide 3. Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on tailoring our value proposition to the unique needs of each major customer segment, continues to gain momentum and will be a driving force behind the Airgas organic growth story going forward.
Our Strategic Accounts program, which leverages this segment-driven approach, presents us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines, services and locations, and represents more than 20% of our sales. In the first quarter, our Strategic Accounts business was up 8% from the prior year, driven by new account signings and increased activity in most of our customer segments, most notably in our metal fabrication and oil, gas and chemicals customer bases.
The retail segment is the primary outlier, with double-digit sales declines due to the substantial reduction in helium supply this year compared to last year. Excluding retail, Strategic Accounts were up 11% from the prior year.
Our construction customer base continues to show noticeable improvement on the strength of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business, which benefited from the continuation of a strong spring outage season in the oil, gas, chemicals and refineries and power plants segments. It posted first quarter sales growth in excess of 20% over the prior year.
Strategic Products continued to be an important part of our value proposition to customers and from a product standpoint, have a strong growth profile due to their use in favorable customer segments, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross-sell opportunities or a combination of these factors.
In the first quarter, sales of Strategic Products increased 7% over the prior year. Safety products once again delivered the highest growth at 11%, driven by business with new and existing large customers. Bulk gases and rent grew 8% as a result of new customer signings and the strength in the manufacturing and food segments. CO2 and dry ice were flat year-over-year as new customer wins were offset by the loss of a major dry ice customer servicing the airline industry in the summer of 2011, which negatively impacted the comp.
Our Radnor private label sales were up 10% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins of Radnor products are 1.5x or greater than those on comparable OEM products.
As Peter mentioned, SAP implementation costs were higher than we had anticipated in the first quarter and will likely be higher than anticipated for the remainder of the year, primarily driven by additional post-conversion support cost, including overtime, travel and training."

The SAP software is very powerful but also very complex. One of the key factors for a successful SAP conversion is to process transactions correctly the first time and not fall behind in the daily processing of these transactions. We call it doing daily work daily. We are finding that our -- that post-conversion, our associates are processing most transactions correctly and they are doing their daily work daily, but in many cases due to the newness and the complexity of the software, they're struggling to do it within normally scheduled hours, which is creating overtime and added expense.
Although we anticipated this, the length of time to work as efficiently as they did prior to conversion is taking longer than we had anticipated. This expense eases over time, but we are anticipating this to continue at most companies for 3 to 6 months post-conversion. Given the magnitude and scope of this project and the significant value-enhancing opportunities it will enable for Airgas and our full-service offering to customers for years to come, priority #1 has been and will always be to get it done right and to support our associates in doing so, and we are doing exactly those things.
To give you some perspective, in the past 5 months, we have successfully converted 4 regional companies and trained more than 2,000 users, which is a significant accomplishment for which our associates are to be commended. The implementation is on schedule and over $2.9 billion in annualized sales, nearly 70% of the distribution business, are now running through SAP.
We remain committed to minimizing implementation risk in converting the rest of our business units to SAP, but much risk has been abated, and we are continuing to shift our focus to attaining benefits. We remain confident that we will realize the economic benefits as planned and that this investment will further enhance the value of our full service offering to customers. The 3 areas of opportunities for value enhancement that we have announced do not represent the full benefit of our investment in SAP, and we expect to explore additional areas of opportunity after the implementation is complete.
Thank you, and now Bob will give you our financial review of the quarter and provide updated guidance for the year."

Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results.
Sales increased 8% year-over-year to $1.26 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 7%, comprised of a 5% increase in gas and rent and a 9% increase in hardgoods. Total volume was up 3%, and price was up 4%. Sequentially, sales increased 1% from the fourth quarter. Gas and rent represented approximately 62% of our sales mix in the quarter, down from approximately 63% in the prior year and up slightly from the fourth quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter was 54.8%, an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year, as the impact of continued outperformance of lower margin hardgoods relative to gas and rent was more than offset by margin expansion on industrial gases, refrigerant gases and ammonia. On a sequential basis, gross margins improved by 90 basis points due to a favorable mix shift towards gas and rent, a seasonal decline in lower margin fuel gases and underlying margin expansion in several gas categories.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $157 million, up 9% from last year, which included $2 million of incremental SAP implementation costs. Not included in adjusted operating income were pretax charges of approximately $4 million related to the previously announced Business Support Center restructuring and a $1.7-million asset impairment charge.
Adjusted operating margin of 12.5% for the quarter included 100 basis points of impact from SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. The prior year's adjusted operating margin of 12.4% included 90 basis points of SAP-related cost.
Excluding a $0.07 gain from the sale of 5 Canadian branches, $0.03 of BSC restructuring charges and a $0.02 impairment charge related to a small hospital piping construction business, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.13, an increase of 13% over the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $1.13 includes $0.10 of SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense, $0.02 higher than the prior year.
In addition, lower helium sales volumes, driven by helium supply constraints we have discussed, reduced year-over-year earnings by $0.04 per diluted share, some of which was anticipated. There were approximately 79 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, driven by share repurchase programs that were completed in the first quarter of last year.
Return on capital, which is a trailing 4-quarters calculation, was 12.6%, an improvement of 50 basis points over last year. We generated strong free cash flow of $76 million in the first quarter, up from $71 million in the prior year, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $155 million, which increased 12% over the prior year.
Total debt decreased by approximately $126 million year-over-year to $2.1 billion at June 30. Our fixed/float debt ratio at the end of December was approximately 53% fixed, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.4, comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. We are well positioned to continue -- to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage within our target range while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment and investing in growth CapEx.
Turning now to Slide 5, we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusting operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments, nor have the special items that have been excluded from consolidated adjusted operating results.
Distribution sales in the quarter were up 8% versus the prior year to $1.1 billion. Same-store sales for the distribution segment were up 7%, with pricing up 4% and volume up 3%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 5%, and hardgoods were up 9%. Distribution gross margin was 55%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year, as underlying margin expansion in several gas categories was more than offset by the outperformance of hardgoods relative to gas and rent. Sequentially, distribution gross margins increased by 50 basis points from the fourth quarter, driven primarily by a mix shift towards gas and rent, the seasonal decline in lower-margin fuel gases and underlying margin expansion in several gas categories. Gas and rent represented 57.4% of distribution sales in the first quarter, down from 58.7% in the prior year and up from 57.2% in the fourth quarter.
Operating income in the distribution segment increased 4% year-over-year to $139 million, while operating margin declined 40 basis points to 12.5%. The decline in operating margin was largely driven by the significant decline in helium sales due to supply constraints, which also negatively impacted the year-over-year increase in operating income. The sequential decline in operating income is attributable to a $7-million increase in stock-based compensation expense, which is front-end loaded in our fiscal year due to retirement eligibility, accelerated vesting, and due to approximately $2-million negative impact from the decline in helium sales due to supply constraints.
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 8% from the prior year, with same-store sales up 6%. The same-store sales increase was largely driven by an increase in both refrigerants and ammonia sales, each on higher volume and pricing. Refrigerant gas sales have continued to benefit from increased demand ahead of a potential EPA ruling which would accelerate the phaseout of new production of R-22, the most commonly used refrigerant gas in HVAC systems. Airgas is well positioned in the refrigerants market to reclaim, recycle and distribute R-22 nationwide to satisfy ongoing market demand in a tighter supply environment. Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations segment increased by 10%, primarily driven by the normal seasonality of the businesses within that segment.
Gross margin for All Other Operations was 49.7%, an increase of 440 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants, CO2 and ammonia businesses. Sequentially, the 420-basis-point increase in gross margins from the fourth quarter primarily -- was primarily driven by a margin expansion in our refrigerants and ammonia businesses.
Operating income for All Other Operations was $29 million, an increase of $9 million over the prior year, and operating margin of 18.6% was up 470 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by the margin expansion and sales volume growth in our refrigerants and ammonia business.
Please turn to Slide 6, Capital Expenditures. First quarter CapEx represented 6.5% of sales, down slightly from 6.7% of sales in the prior year. Construction-in-process spend was driven by the final stage of construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee; the construction of a new hardgoods distribution center in Bristol, Pennsylvania; the build out of our Business Support Centers; and projects to expand or consolidate plants, branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations.
Rental welders increased by $13 million on the improvement in our Red-D-Arc rental welder business, as Mike discussed earlier. Excluding major projects, CapEx as a percent of sales was approximately 4%.
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year. Please note that our fiscal 2013 guidance excludes restructuring and other special charges, which were $0.05 in the first quarter, and are expected to be approximately $0.03 in the second quarter and $0.11 for the full year, as well as a $0.07 gain from the sale of businesses in the first quarter. Special gains and charges in fiscal '12 were a net total charge of $0.11.
Slide 7 presents a walk through the primary elements of our second quarter guidance, using first quarter adjusted EPS of $1.13 and fiscal 2012 second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.03, respectively, as starting points. In the sequential walk in the left-hand column, we expect headwinds of $0.03 for the impact of one less selling day. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce sequential earnings growth by $0.01, and normal seasonal declines in our refrigerants and welder rental business create additional headwinds of $0.03 to $0.05. On a sequential basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute additional earnings of $0.01 to $0.03.
The right-hand column on the slide shows the year-over-year walk. Similar to the sequential walk, there are headwinds with respect to one less selling day and the negative impact from helium supply constraints. We estimate the year-over-year negative impact to be approximately $0.03 for one less selling day and $0.02 related to helium. We're expecting an incremental year-over-year increase in SAP implementation cost of $0.03, noting that the second quarter of last year was the lowest quarter of SAP cost in fiscal 2012. On a year-over-year basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute an incremental $0.10 to $0.14, representing a strong 10% to 14% growth rate.
In aggregate, when factoring in the headwinds, we are estimating EPS for our second quarter to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.09. Our second quarter guidance assumes same-store sales growth in the mid-single-digits versus our previous expectations of mid- to upper-single digits, as well as continued outperformance of hardgoods relative to gas and rent.
Turning to Slide 8, it walks through the primary elements of our revised full year guidance using 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.11 as the starting point. The impact of 2 less selling days is expected to be a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind, helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings by $0.10, and a slightly higher tax rate relative to fiscal 2012 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03. SAP implementation cost, net of the ramp up of benefits, are expected to provide year-over-year improvement in earnings of $0.18 to $0.22 relative to the $0.34 of net expense in fiscal 2012. Base business growth is expected to contribute $0.55 to $0.60 or 13% to 15% over prior year's adjusted EPS.
And now I'll turn it back to Barry to begin our question-and-answer session."

And that's why helium in total dollars is not that big a percentage of the total, but from a profitability and from the portion of the customers that we had to shed, it had a very significant impact. And -- but keep in mind, we knew this was coming, okay? So we were -- we had planned for this. The thing we didn't understand was that we were not -- that the cuts and the ability for us to get the projected amounts, that we couldn't get them and then across the country, some of the individual local shortages were even greater than the average. We -- that caught us by a surprise. We were not prepared for that. Now the key to this is we got to have the molecules, obviously. And helium is a whole story unto itself about the number of places around the world and the issues in other countries and with production plants and when they're going to come back on and to what level, et cetera, et cetera. And a lot of our information is supplied to us by our suppliers. And I think we've had obviously many, many, many discussions on this subject with our suppliers, and it feels reasonable to expect that come the fall, we will start to see the trickle of additional molecules start to come in.

The Bureau of Land Management said -- where I think about 70% of the helium in the U.S. comes from, has had its mechanical issues with the pipeline compressors and things like that as well, and that's simply compounded the problem. There's plenty of helium in the U.S. to supply the U.S. customers. However, there -- a law was passed in 1996 that provides that only 3 companies get to buy that helium from the government and obviously, they export a lot of it or else our customers would have the helium, and they're global companies and they've turned this into a global supply chain and market to the detriment of a lot of U.S. businesses and researchers. And that's one of the remedies that we're seeking, is that law is under -- it's expiring, and Congress is considering some sort of extension of that law or a different law.

Energy has been -- it's not across-the-board strong like it was 6 to 9 months ago, but there's still some very, very strong energy markets that are still going very well. So overall, it's still growing. And I said now, fab is still pretty good and projecting growth, but that's mixed. There's some -- some of the metal fab customers we surveyed have seen somewhat of a slowing, but overall it's growing. I think most of our customer segments are growing but fairly slowly, and medical's come back nicely from the recession. Food and beverage has been slower to come back. That got really hammered in the Great Recession, but we're starting to see signs of life there too. So I'd say across the board, most of our customer segments are growing slowly. I don't see any particular one that's weak, with the one exception was -- and it's not -- we're doing well in construction, but it's because we've expanded our products and service offering, and we've added new business. But the overall construction market for nonresidential construction did go down with the completion of a lot of big jobs that were completed in the first calendar quarter or thereabout, and they have yet to be replaced by new jobs even though there's been a lot of announcements.

And that the key to supplying the demand for the next 10 to 15 to 20 years in this country is reclamation, recovery, reprocessing and things like that. And it's only now when supply and demand is getting to the point where it's even in balance. The recession really put it out of balance to where there was way more supply than demand, and the pricing was very soft. Now as production is being curtailed and demand and supply are in balance, pricing is starting to improve. And in the future, when production and demand are upside down, it should improve very nicely and continue to improve with more and more of it being supplied by reclamation and recovery, of which we have installed significant additional capacity already to be positioned to handle that. So we were pretty excited about our opportunity going forward in the refrigerants business."

And this law got passed, God knows how. We objected to it at the time, but it got passed, and it said that the government would sell off these reserves over time to companies that had refineries on the government's helium pipeline. And so they've been doing that, and the proceeds of these sales, the net profits were meant to pay off the debt that the government incurred to buy the helium. And so that debt is almost paid off, and the question is what happens now? And the act needs to be extended, there's no question, because it represents like 50% of the world's helium supply right now. But we wanted to extend it on a basis of open access to all companies, especially companies like us who's 99% of our customer base are U.S. customers: welders, medical researchers, things like that. So that's why only 3 companies have access to this taxpayer-owned helium.

With the flatlining, we haven't seen -- the small customer had started to come back in the spring, and with the flatlining, that kind of stalled. And most of the growth is still coming from the big customers as a result. And at some point, I think a lot of these small customers, I guess, make things for residential construction. That's about our only eye to that. And they're also subcontractors for nonresidential construction, and construction across the board has been pretty bad. So I would imagine some of that will pick up when construction comes back. The rest will pick up when capacity utilization moves up a few more notches because the big customers, when they start bumping up against capacity, they start outsourcing. So that will -- and the -- it seems like the economy, although it's better than it was a few years ago, it's not -- it hasn't reached lift-off speed here. It hasn't really lifted off like it has in other recoveries. So I think overall, I'm pretty happy with how we did in the quarter. Our EPS was up 13%, and that included 10% of SAP expenses. And we made our range and although we missed the Street's by $0.02, we made our range and we set a pretty high bar, unlike a lot of other companies who were recording 3% and 5% earnings growth. And the amazing thing is that we did this in the midst of this SAP implementation. And as we said, that's going very well, but that's not to say it's not a monumental undertaking. And the reason we're going back and spending extra money to get it right is because it does require changes in business processes that you can't -- we knew about a lot of them, but it's hard to comprehend until you're right in the middle of it. And it's our fifth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth. And we just delivered guidance that's going to give us earnings growth of 13% to 16% for the full year, and we're pretty confident in that right now, unless -- with the one caveat if the economy turns down.

Please turn to Slide 2. I'm going to begin today by giving an overall view of our quarterly results, the current business landscape and our outlook for the rest of this fiscal year. Our second qu",568,"Thanks, Barrie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 2. I'm going to begin today by giving an overall view of our quarterly results, the current business landscape and our outlook for the rest of this fiscal year. Our second quarter adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share and same store sales growth of 3% were solid in what were moderating macroeconomic conditions across our customer base and in light of the year-over-year impacts of incremental SAP cost, one less selling day and helium supply constraint, which in the aggregate reduced our earnings growth by $0.07 or 700 basis points. 
Same-store sales in our core distribution business agree grew 2% this quarter with the hardgoods growth of 1%, decelerating to a greater extent than we had expected. And gas and rent flow into 3% growth. The sluggish conditions were broad-based, reflecting an overall slower pace of bid activity in the industrial economy. July was weak throughout the month. August started off well but finished weak, coming in below our expectations overall. And September improved overall but remains sluggish and was overall weaker than we had expected. The relative strength of the U.S. metal fabrication and energy sectors, which had been bright spots for the economy earlier this year appeared to have softened of late, tampering our growth even in those areas. But we continue to win new business in the sectors in the strength of our Strategic Accounts program, technical support of customers, breadth of our product and service offering and outstanding customer service. From our vantage point, smaller customers in particular seem to be impacted most profoundly by a slowing industrial activity levels. The overall slowing has continued during October and is very difficult to predict when activity levels will pick up to support the growth rates we had expected when we entered the fiscal year. Accordingly, we're revising our guidance range down from a range of $4.65 to $4.75 to a range of $4.45 to $4.50 to reflect the slower base growth environment than we previously assumed. Though we are appropriately cautious about the near-term business environment, we are very optimistic about the long-term prospects for U.S. manufacturing and energy industries, the related infrastructure built to support those industries that will drive improvement in our nonresidential construction customer base and our ability to leverage our unique value proposition, which would only be enhanced by our conversion to SAP and unrivaled platform to drive growth in these and other key customer segments. 
This morning, we announced the $600 million share repurchase authorization by our board, which reflects the confidence we have in the future of Airgas. Our balance sheet is solid, and our strong cash flow continues to be a hallmark of our business model. 
Year-to-date, our adjusted cash flow from operations increased 8% year-over-year to $277 million, and free cash flow increased 15% year-over-year to $121 million. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation affords us the opportunity to repurchase shares and realize attractive earnings accretion, while continuing to fund our growth strategies including our acquisition program. Since the beginning of this fiscal year, we've acquired 8 businesses with aggregate annual revenues of around $19 million. The pipeline remains solid and I'm optimistic we will see greater activity in the next 6 to 9 months. Now I'll hand it off to Mike to review some of our key initiatives."

I'd like to start by providing a piece update on the helium supply chain constraint that we highlighted on our last earnings call. While we did start to see some relief in certain areas of the country during the quarter, supply is still very tight and is expected to remain tight well into the next calendar year. At this time, the year-over-year negative impacts of lower sales due to helium supply constraints for the remainder of this fiscal year remain as we projected last quarter, which Bob Weatherly visit as part of the guidance discussion. 
Please turn to Slide 3. As Peter said, current business conditions indeed present some near-term challenges, but we will continue to invest in our long-term growth strategy, including the further development of our sales and marketing strategies focused on key customer segment, our Strategic Accounts program, infrastructure enhancement and leveraging our SAP platform. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on tailoring our value proposition to the unique needs of each major customer segment continues to gain momentum and is a driving force behind the Airgas organic growth story going forward. Our Strategic Account program, which leverages the segment-driven approach presents us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines, services and locations and represents more than 20% of total sales. In the second quarter, our Strategic Accounts business was up 3% over the prior year as continued new account signings and cross-selling to existing customers was tempered by broad based slowing and general activity across most of our customer segments. 
Our large metal fabrication customers continue to post the strongest growth on a relative basis, though showing modest deceleration from first quarter growth rates. 
The retail segment again posted double-digit sales decline due to the substantial reduction in helium supply this year compared to last year. Excluding retail, Strategic Accounts, in aggregate, were up 4% over the prior year. Strategic Products continue to be an important part of our value proposition to customers and from a product standpoint have strong growth profiles due to their use in favorable customer segment, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross sell opportunities or a combination of these factors. In the second quarter, growth in sales of Strategic Products also decelerated to 3% over the prior year, with each product category posing sales growth in the 2% to 3% range, driven by broad-based economic softening. 
Deceleration in strategic products growth rates were most pronounced in our safety product sales, driven by general slowing in activity levels in our core industrial customer base. Our Radnor private label sales were up 1% over the prior year, consistent with total hardgoods same-store sales growth. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong in addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base and gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or greater than those of comparable OEM products. In September, we announced plans to build a new 400-ton per day air separation unit in the Chicago area in order to meet increasing demand from merchant gases in the region, which we fully expect to be the long-term trend in the Midwest. The ASU will produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon and is expected to begin production in the fall of 2014. With our strong base load of packaged and merchant gas customers in the region and the potential to idle a smaller less efficient plant in Wisconsin in favor of this new plant that is also closer to our customer base, we expect capacity utilization on this new plant to be strong at the time of start-up. 
Moving on to SAP. The implementation is on schedule with 10 out of 12 regional distribution companies now running successfully on the new platform. We expect the 11th region to be converted this quarter with the last region converted by March. The rollout of our expanded telesales channel, Airgas Total Access, continues to gain momentum across the Airgas regions that have converted to SAP. We now have more than 70 full-time total access telesales representatives trained and deployed and calling on customers in the target size and span range selling gases and welding related hardgoods in addition to our traditional telesales offering of safety products. About half of our regional companies have begun to leverage the data mining and functionality of SAP to take a more strategic approach to product pricing and discount management. The earlier results of our efforts in both of these areas reinforces our confidence that we will realize the economic benefits as planned and that this investment will further enhance the value of our full-service offering to customers, which will be clear as Bob walks through the guidance. The 3 areas of opportunity for value enhancement that we have announced do not represent the full benefit of our investment in SAP, and we expect to explore additional areas of opportunity after the implementation is completed. 
Thank you, and now Bob will now give our financial review of the quarter and provide an updated guidance for the year."

Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results for the second quarter. Sales increased 4% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and same-store sales growth of 3%,",2009,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results for the second quarter. Sales increased 4% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and same-store sales growth of 3%, comprised of a 4% increase in gas and rent and a 1% increase in hardgoods. Total price was up 4% and volumes were down 1%. Same-store sales in volumes for both gas and rent and hardgoods were reduced by approximately 1% due to one less selling day in the current quarter versus the prior year, with helium supply constraints also reducing gas volumes by an additional 1%. The gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, up slightly from the prior year and up 100 basis points from the first quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 55.1%, an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year, driven by the sales mix shift towards higher-margin gas and rent, as well as margin expansions on underlying gases and hardgoods. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was up $148 million, up 2% from last year, including nearly $3 million of incremental SAP implementation costs and depreciation expense. Not included in adjusted operating income were pretax charges of approximately $2.4 million related to the previously announced Business Support Center restructuring. Adjusted operating margin of 12% for the quarter included 90 basis points of impact from SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense. The prior year adjusted operating margin of 12.2% included 70 basis points of SAP-related cost. Excluding $0.02 of the BSC restructuring and other special charges, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.05, an increase of 2% from $1.03 the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $1.05 included $0.09 of SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense, which were $0.02 higher than the prior year. One less selling day in the current year compared to the prior year reducing EPS by approximately $0.03. And as expected, lower helium sales volumes driven by the inability of the suppliers to meet their helium supply commitments to us during the quarter reduced year-over-year earnings by $0.02 per diluted share. There were approximately 78.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation was 12.5%, an improvement of 20 basis points over last year. 
We generated strong free cash flow of $121 million year-to-date from the second quarter, an increase of 15% from the prior year driven by adjusted cash from operations of $277 million, which increased 8% over the prior year. Total debt decreased by $122 million year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion at September 30. Our fixed load debt ratio at the end of September was approximately 53% fixed and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined to 2.4 comfortably within our target range of 2% to 3%. As Peter noted, this morning we announced that the board has authorized the repurchase of up to $600 million of our common stock. A repurchase program now appropriate since our leverage has been declining, cash flow has been strong, we have confidence in our future and we have yet to realize the full benefits from our implementation of SAP. We're well positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage, while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment, investing in growth CapEx and executing the share repurchase program. 
Now turn to Slide 5 and we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusted earnings operating result have not been allocated to our business segment nor has special items that have been extended to the consolidated adjusted operating results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 3% versus the prior year to nearly $1.1 billion. Same-store sales for distribution were up 2% with pricing up 4% and volume down 2%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 3% and hardgoods were up 1% with volume down 2% in both categories. Distribution same-store sales and volumes for both gas and hardgoods were reduced by approximately 1% due to one less selling day in the current quarter versus the prior year with helium supply constraints also reducing gas volumes by an additional 1%. As Peter and Mike noted, the deceleration in the sales growth rate has been broad based reflecting an overall slower pace of activity in the industrial economy. Gas and rent represented 58.4% of distribution sales in the second quarter, up from 50.1% the prior year and up from 57.4% in the first quarter. Distribution gross margin was 55.8%, an increase of 180 basis points from the prior year, driven by the sales mix shift towards gas and rent and margin improvements in both gases and hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased 80 basis points from the first quarter, primarily driven by the sales mix shift towards gas and rent. Operating income in the distribution segment increased 2% year-over-year to $134 million, while operating margin declined slightly 10 basis points to 12.4%. 
Operating margin was pressured by moderating sales growth and the year-over-year decline in helium sales due to supply constraints, which also negatively impacted the year-over-year increase in operating income. 
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia, nitrous and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 7% from the prior year with same-store sales also up 7%, largely driven by an increase in R-22 prices in our refrigerant business and by both volume and pricing in our ammonia and CO2 businesses. Refrigerant sales have continued to benefit from increased demand ahead of a potential EPA ruling, which would accelerate the phase out of new production of R-22, the most commonly used refrigerants in HVAC systems. Airgas is well positioned in the refrigerants market to reclaim, recycle and distribute R-22 nationwide to satisfy ongoing market demand in a tighter supply environment. Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations increased by 1% as increases in our CO2, dry ice and ammonia businesses were partially offset by seasonality in the refrigerants business. Gross margin for All Other Operations was 47.1%, an increase of 130 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants and CO2 businesses. Sequentially, the 260 basis point decline in gross margins from the first quarter was primarily driven by margin compression in our ammonia businesses due to rising feedstock cost. Operating income in all other operations was $22 million, an increase of $3 million over the prior year and operating margin of 14.2%, which was up 100 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by the margin expansion in our refrigerants and CO2 businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. Year-to-date CapEx represented 6.5% of sales, down from 7.1% of sales in the prior year. Construction and process spend was driven by the final stage of construction of our new in Clarksville, Tennessee, the construction of our new hardgoods distribution center in Bristol, PA, the buildout of our Business Support Centers and the project to expand and consolidate plants and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. 
Rental welder spend increased by $21 million on the improvement of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business, which continues to be a strong business for us. Excluding major projects, CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4%. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year. Please note that our fiscal 2013 guidance excludes restructuring and other special charges, which were $0.05 in the first quarter, $0.02 in the second quarter and are expected to be approximately $0.02 for the third quarter and $0.10 for the full fiscal year as well as a $0.07 gain on the sale of businesses in the first quarter. Special gains and charges in fiscal 2012 were a net total charge of $0.11. 
Please also note that our guidance does not include the potential impact from share repurchases under the new authorization announced this morning. 
Slide 7 presents a walk through the primary elements of our third quarter guidance using second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.05 and fiscal 2012 third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.97, respectively, as the starting points. In the sequentially walk in the left hand column, we expect headwinds of $0.04 from the impact of 1 less selling day during the holidays, an additional $0.05 headwind from normal seasonal declines in our CO2, dry ice and refrigerants businesses, partially offset by Red-D-Arc. SAP benefits net of expenses are expected to contribute $0.07 to $0.08, which represents the difference between $0.09 of net expense in the second quarter and an expected $0.01 to $0.02 of expense net of expected benefits in the third quarter. On a sequentially basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute additional earnings of $0.02 to $0.07. The right hand of the column on this slide shows the year-over-year walk. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings by $0.03. We are expecting year-over-year SAP benefits, net of implementation cost, to contribute $0.08 to $0.09 which represents the difference between the $0.10 of net expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and the expected $0.01 to $0.02 of expense net of benefits in the third quarter of this year. And on a year-over-year basis, our base business growth to contribute an incremental $0.03 to $0.08, representing 3% to 8% of growth. In aggregate, when factoring in the headwind and the contributions from incremental SAP and base business growth, we're estimating adjusted EPS for our third quarter to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.11, representing year-over-year growth of 8% to 14%. Third quarter guidance assume same-store sales growth in the low single digits. 
Slide 8 presents a year-over-year walk through the primary elements of our fourth quarter and devised full year guidance using 2012 fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.11 and fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.11, respectively, as the starting points. For the fourth quarter, we expect a headwind of $0.20 for the impact of a one less selling day in the fourth quarter of fiscal '13 compared to the prior year. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings growth by $0.01. A higher-than-expected tax rate is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.02. We are expecting year-over-year SAP benefits net of implementation cost to contribute $0.14 to $0.17, which represents the difference between $0.09 of net expense in the fourth quarter of last year and $0.05 to $0.08 of net benefit in the fourth quarter this year. And on a year-over-year basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute an incremental $0.03 to $0.09, representing 3% to 8% growth. In aggregate, when factoring in the headwinds and contributions from incremental SAP and base business growth, we're estimating adjusted EPS for our fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.22 to $1.31, representing year-over-year growth of 10% to 18%. Implied fourth quarter guidance assume same-store sales growth in the low single digits. 
The right hand of the slide show a year-over-year walk to our full year device guidance. The impact of 2 less selling days is expected to be a headwind of $0.06. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings by $0.10, which is consistent with expectations we provided on our first quarter earnings call. And a slightly higher tax rate relative to fiscal 2012 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.02. 
SAP implementation cost, net of the ramp up of benefits, are expected to provide year-over-year improvement in earnings of $0.18 to $0.22, which represents the difference between $0.34 of net expense in fiscal 2012 and an expected net expense of $0.12 to $0.16 in fiscal 2013, which is consistent with expectations we provided in our original guidance in May. Base business growth is expected to contribute $0.34 to $0.45 or 8% to 11% over prior year's adjusted EPS. And now I'll turn it back to Barrie to begin our question-and-answer session."

And we have a full pipeline and so we're trying to get it going. But as I said in the last 30 calls, these companies that are selling are still a long way from getting back to even. I mean Airgas' gas guess volumes, they are 10% below our peak volumes back in 2009 still. And this recession has impacted smaller customers, which are the mainstay of a lot of these acquisitions. So even though we're going over a fiscal class cliff and bus tax cuts are the cap gains is going from 15 to 20, and we have the pharma tax and all that stuff. It's not enough to drive people. Now there has been an increase in activity, and I'm hopeful I think we have a good shot at making our $150 million in sales acquired by the end of March, which was our goal every year. But I can't really explain it except to say that people are waiting to get back to even. And they aren't looking forward to taking the next and putting in the stock market either I think.

We did get some relief in beginning of this quarter. We were advised and we were going to get some relief. But as of the estate, neither of our supplier, our main suppliers has been able to meet the increased amount that we are going to increase do. It has gotten somewhat better in talking with those companies, both of whom several months ago have indicated that by beginning of the calendar year, things might be running normally, things have changed for them. At this point, we don't see an increase above the level that they've raised us to now for the foreseeable future. And when I say the foreseeable future, I'm kind of leaning toward mid-calendar 2013. And that's whether it's related to plans in Wyoming that are not going to even start to continue additional problems in Algeria to whatever, there are new issues in the horizon that are going to prevent them getting back for production. Now with that said, prices on helium have definitely significantly increased over the past year. In the long-term view, meaning 2014 and beyond, the shortfall -- the U.S. production of helium going forward will always be a very tenuous supply chain that we have an aging infrastructure a declining reserve. It will have to be made up by other sources. Those other sources are not located in the U.S. for most part so there will be to make up the shortfall helium will be imported into this country from all parts of the world. It will be expensive helium. So the likelihood that we're going to see major declines in helium prices and in my opinion is very low."

I'm going to begin today by giving you an overall view of our quarterly results, the current business landscape and our outlook for the rest of this fiscal year. 
Our second quarter adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share and same-store sales growth of 3% were solid and what we were -- and were moderating macroeconomic conditions across our customer base and in light of the year-over-year impacts of the incremental SAP cost, one less selling day and helium supply constraints, which in the aggregate reduced our earnings growth by $0.07 or 700 basis points. 
Same-store sales in our core distribution business grew 2% this quarter, with hardgoods growth of 1%, decelerating to a greater extent than we had expected, and gas and rent slowing the 3% growth. The sluggish conditions were broad-based, reflecting an overall slower pace of daily activity in the industrial economy. July was weak throughout the month. August started off well but finished weak, coming in below our expectations overall. And September improved over August but remained sluggish and was overall weaker than we had expected. 
The relative strength of the U.S. metal fabrication and energy sectors, which had been bright spots for the economy earlier this year, appeared to have softened of late, tampering our growth even in those areas. But we continue to win new business in these sectors on the strength of our Strategic Accounts program, technical support of customers, breadth of our product and service offering and outstanding customer service. From our vantage point, smaller customers in particular seemed to be impacted most profoundly by slowing industrial activity levels. The overall slowing has continued during October, and it's very difficult to predict when activity levels will pick up to support the growth rates we had expected when we entered the fiscal year. 
Accordingly, we're revising our guidance range down from a range of $4.65 to $4.75 to a range of $4.45 to $4.60 to reflect the slower base business growth environment than we previously assumed. Though we're appropriately cautious about the near-term business environment, we're very optimistic about the long-term prospects for U.S. manufacturing and energy industries, the related infrastructure built to support those industries that will drive improvement in our nonresidential construction customer base and our ability to leverage our unique value proposition, which will only be enhanced by our conversion to SAP and unrivaled platform to drive growth in these and other key customer segments. 
This morning, we announced the $600 million share repurchase authorization by our board, which reflects the confidence we have in the future of Airgas. Our balance sheet is solid, and our strong cash flow continues to be a hallmark of our business model. 
Year-to-date, our adjusted cash flow from operations increased 8% year-over-year to $277 million. And free cash flow increased 15% year-over-year to $121 million. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation afford us the opportunity to repurchase shares and realize attractive earnings accretion while continuing to fund our growth strategies, including our acquisition program. Since the beginning of this fiscal year, we've acquired 8 businesses with aggregate annual revenues of around $19 million. The pipeline remains solid, and I'm optimistic we'll see greater activity in the next 6 to 9 months. 
Now I'll hand it over to Mike to review some of our key initiatives."

I'd like to start by providing a brief update on the helium supply chain constraints that we highlighted on our last earnings call.

I'd like to start by providing a brief update on the helium supply chain constraints that we highlighted on our last earnings call. While we did start to see some relief in certain areas of the country during the quarter, supply is still very tight and is expected to remain tight well into the next calendar year. At this time, the year-over-year negative impacts of lower sales due to helium supply constraints for the remainder of this fiscal year remain as we projected last quarter, which Bob will revisit as part of the guidance discussion. 
Please turn to Slide 3. As Peter said, current business conditions indeed present some near-term challenges, but we will continue to invest in our long-term growth strategies, including the further development of our sales and marketing strategies focused on key customer segments, our Strategic Accounts program, infrastructure enhancement and leveraging our SAP platform. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on tailoring our value proposition to the unique needs of each major customer segment continues to gain momentum, and it's a driving force behind the Airgas organic growth story going forward. 
Our Strategic Account program, which leverages this segment-driven approach, presents us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines, services and locations, and represents more than 20% of total sales. In the second quarter, our Strategic Accounts business was up 3% over the prior year as we -- as continued new account signings and cross-selling to existing customers was tempered by broad-based slowing in general activity across most of our customer segments. Our large metal fabrication customers continued to post the strongest growth on a relative basis, though showing modest deceleration from first quarter growth rates. The retail segment again posted double-digit sales decline due to the substantial reduction in helium supply this year compared to last year. Excluding retail, Strategic Accounts, in aggregate, were up 4% over the prior year. 
Strategic Products continued to be an important part of our value proposition to customers and from a product standpoint have strong growth profiles due to their use in favorable customer segments, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross-sell opportunities or a combination of these factors. In the second quarter, growth in sales of Strategic Products also decelerated to 3% over the prior year, with each product category posting sales growth in the 2% to 3% range, driven by broad-based economic softening. 
Deceleration in Strategic Products growth rates was most pronounced in our safety product sales, driven by general slowing in activity levels in our core industrial customer base. 
Our Radnor private label sales were up 1% over the prior year, consistent with total hardgoods same-store sales growth. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or greater than those of comparable OEM products. 
In September, we announced the plan to build a new 400 ton-per-day air separation unit in the Chicago area in order to meet increasing demand for merchant gases in the region, which we fully expect to be the long-term trend in the Midwest. The ASU will produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon and is expected to begin production in the fall of 2014. With our strong base load of packaged and merchant gas customers in the region and the potential to idle a smaller, less efficient plant in Wisconsin in favor of this new plant that is also closer to our customer base, we expect capacity utilization on this new plant to be strong at the time of start-up. 
Moving on to SAP. The implementation is on schedule, with 10 out of 12 regional distribution companies now running successfully on the new platform. We expect the 11th region to be converted this quarter, with the last region converted by March. The rollout of our expanded telesales channel, Airgas Total Access, continues to gain momentum across the Airgas regions that have converted to SAP. We now have more than 70 full-time Total Access telesales representatives trained and deployed and calling on customers in the target size and span range selling gases and welding-related hardgoods in addition to our traditional telesales offering of safety products. About half of our regional companies have begun to leverage the data mining and functionality of SAP to take a more strategic approach to product pricing and discount management. The early results of our efforts in both of these areas reinforces our confidence that we'll realize the economic benefits as planned and that this investment will further enhance the value of our full-service offering to customers, which will be clear as Bob walks through the guidance. The 3 areas of opportunity for value enhancement that we have announced do not represent the full benefit of our investment in SAP. And we expect to explore additional areas of opportunity after the implementation is completed. 
Thank you. And now Bob will now give our financial review of the quarter and provide an updated guidance for the year."

Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, up slightly from the prior year and up 100 basis points from the first quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.1%, an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year, driven by the sales mix shift towards higher-margin gas and rent, as well as margin expansions on underlying gases and hardgoods. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $148 million, up 2% from last year, including nearly $3 million of incremental SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense. Not included in adjusted operating income were pretax charges of approximately $2.4 million related to the previously announced Business Support Center restructuring. 
Adjusted operating margin of 12% for the quarter included 90 basis points of impact from SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense. The prior year adjusted operating margin of 12.2% included 70 basis points of SAP-related cost. Excluding $0.02 of the BSC restructuring and other special charges, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.05, an increase of 2% from $1.03 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $1.05 included $0.09 of SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense, which were $0.02 higher than the prior year. One less selling day in the current year compared to the prior year reducing EPS by approximately $0.03. 
And as expected, lower helium sales volumes driven by the inability of suppliers to meet their helium supply commitments to us during the quarter reduced year-over-year earnings by $0.02 per diluted share. There were approximately 78.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.5%, an improvement of 20 basis points over last year. 
We generated strong free cash flow of $121 million year-to-date through the second quarter, an increase of 15% over the prior year, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $277 million, which increased 8% over the prior year. 
Total debt decreased by $122 million year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion at September 30. Our fixed load debt ratio at the end of September was approximately 53% fixed, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined to 2.4, comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. 
As Peter noted, this morning we announced that the board has authorized the repurchase of up to $600 million of our common stock. A repurchase program now is appropriate since our leverage has been declining, cash flow has been strong, we have confidence in our future, and we have yet to realize the full benefits from our implementation of SAP. We are well positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment, investing in growth CapEx and executing the share repurchase program. 
Now turn to Slide 5, and we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusted earnings operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments, nor has special items that have been excluded from the consolidated adjusted operating results. 
Distribution sales in this quarter were up 3% versus the prior year to nearly $1.1 billion. Same-store sales for distribution were up 2%, with pricing up 4% and volume down 2%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 3%, and hardgoods were up 1%, with volume down 2% in both categories. Distribution, same-store sales and volumes for both gas and hardgoods were reduced by approximately 1% due to one less selling day in the current quarter versus the prior year, with helium supply constraints also reducing gas volumes by an additional 1%. 
As Peter and Mike noted, the deceleration in the sales growth rate has been broad-based, reflecting an overall slower pace of activity in the industrial economy. Gas and rent represented 58.4% of distribution sales in the second quarter, up from 58.1% in the prior year and up from 57.4% in the first quarter. Distribution gross margin was 55.8%, an increase of 180 basis points from the prior year, driven by the sales mix shift towards gas and rent and margin improvements in both gases and hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased 80 basis points from the first quarter, primarily driven by the sales mix shift towards gas and rent. Operating income in the distribution segment increased 2% year-over-year to $134 million, while operating margin declined slightly, 10 basis points to 12.4%. Operating margin was pressured by moderating sales growth and the year-over-year decline in helium sales due to supply constraints, which also negatively impacted the year-over-year increase in operating income. 
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia, nitrous and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 7% from the prior year, with same-store sales also up 7%, largely driven by an increase in R-22 prices in our refrigerant business and by both volume and price in our ammonia and CO2 businesses. Refrigerant sales had continued to benefit from increased demand ahead of a potential EPA ruling, which would accelerate the phaseout of new production of R-22, the most commonly used refrigerants in HVAC systems. Airgas is well positioned in the refrigerants market to reclaim, recycle and distribute R-22 nationwide to satisfy ongoing market demand in a tighter supply environment. Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations increased by 1%, as increases in our CO2, dry ice and ammonia businesses were partially offset by seasonality in the refrigerants business. Gross margin for All Other Operations was 47.1%, an increase of 130 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants and CO2 businesses. Sequentially, the 260-basis-point decline in gross margin from the first quarter was primarily driven by margin compression in our ammonia business due to rising feedstock cost. Our operating income in All Other Operations was $22 million, an increase of $3 million over the prior year, and operating margin of 14.2%, which was up 100 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by the margin expansion in our refrigerants and CO2 businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. Year-to-date, CapEx represented 6.5% of sales, down from 7.1% of sales in the prior year. Construction and process spend was driven by the final stage of construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee, the construction of our new hardgood distribution center in Bristol, PA, the buildout of our Business Support Centers and projects to expand or consolidate plants and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. 
Rental welder spend increased by $21 million on the improvement of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business, which continues to be a strong business for us. Excluding major projects, CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4%. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year. Please note that our fiscal 2013 guidance excludes restructuring and other special charges, which were $0.05 in the first quarter, $0.02 in the second quarter and are expected to be approximately $0.02 in the -- for the third quarter and $0.10 for the full fiscal year, as well as the $0.07 gain on the sale of businesses in the first quarter. Special gains and charges in fiscal 2012 were a net total charge of $0.11. Please also note that our guidance does not include the potential impact from share repurchases under the new authorization announced this morning. 
Slide 7 presents a walk through the primary elements of our third quarter guidance using second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.05 and fiscal 2012 third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.97, respectively, as the starting points. In the sequential walk in the left-hand column, we expect headwinds of $0.04 from the impact of one less selling day in the holidays; an additional $0.05 headwinds from normal seasonal declines in our CO2, dry ice and refrigerants businesses, partially offset by Red-D-Arc; SAP benefits, net of expenses, are expected to contribute $0.07 to $0.08, which represents the difference between $0.09 of net expense in the second quarter and an expected $0.01 to $0.02 of expense, net of expected benefits, in the third quarter. On a sequential basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute additional earnings of $0.02 to $0.07. 
The right hand of the column on this slide shows the year-over-year walk. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings by $0.03. We are expecting year-over-year SAP benefits, net of implementation cost, to contribute $0.08 to $0.09, which represents the difference between the $0.10 of net expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and the expected $0.01 to $0.02 of expense, net of benefits, in the third quarter of this year. And on a year-over-year basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute an incremental $0.03 to $0.08, representing 3% to 8% of growth. 
In aggregate, when factoring in the headwinds and the contributions from incremental SAP and base business growth, we are estimating adjusted EPS for our third quarter to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.11, representing year-over-year growth of 8% to 14%. Third quarter guidance assumes same-store sales growth in the low single digits. 
Slide 8 presents a year-over-year walk through the primary elements of our implied fourth quarter and revised full year guidance using 2012 fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.11 and fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.11, respectively, as the starting points. For the fourth quarter, we expect the headwind of $0.03 for the impact of one less selling day in the fourth quarter of fiscal '13 compared to the prior year. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year our earnings growth by $0.01. A higher expected tax rate is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.02. We're expecting year-over-year SAP benefits, net of implementation cost, to contribute $0.14 to $0.17, which represents the difference between $0.09 of net expense in the fourth quarter of last year and $0.05 to $0.08 of net benefit in the fourth quarter of this year. And on a year-over-year basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute an incremental $0.03 to $0.09, representing 3% to 8% growth. 
In aggregate, when factoring in the headwinds and contributions from incremental SAP and base business growth, we're estimating adjusted EPS for our fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.22 to $1.31, representing year-over-year growth of 10% to 18%. Implied fourth quarter guidance assumes same-store sales growth in the low single digits. 
The right hand of the slide shows a year-over-year walk through our full year revised guidance. The impact of 2 less selling days is expected to be a headwind of $0.06. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings by $0.10, which is consistent with the expectations we provided on our first quarter earnings call. And a slightly higher tax rate relative to fiscal 2012 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.02. SAP implementation costs, net of the ramp-up of benefits, are expected to provide year-over-year improvement in earnings of $0.18 to $0.22, which represents the difference between $0.34 of net expense in fiscal 2012 and as expected, net expense of $0.12 to $0.16 in fiscal 2013, which is consistent with the expectation we provided in our original guidance in May. Base business growth is expected to contribute $0.34 to $0.45 or 8% to 11% over prior year's adjusted EPS. 
And now I'll turn it back to Barry to begin our question-and-answer session."

And when I say the foreseeable future, I'm kind of leaning toward mid-calendar 2013. And that whether it's related to plans in Wyoming that are not even going to start to continue, additional problems in Algeria to whatever, there are new issues on the horizon that are going to prevent them from getting back to full production. Now with that said, prices on helium have definitely significantly increased over the past year. In the long-term -- the longer-term view, meaning 2014 and beyond, the shortfalls, the U.S. production of helium in the -- going forward will always be a very tenuous supply chain. We have an aging infrastructure, a declining reserve. It will have to be made up by other sources. Those other sources are not located in the U.S. for the most part, so there will be helium -- to make up the shortfall helium will be imported into this country from other parts of the world. It will be expensive helium. So the likelihood that we're going to see major declines in helium prices, in my opinion, is very low."

The refrigerants business, on the other hand, is very dynamic, and there is a lot of things happening in the refrigerants business. The supply-demand curves are getting very much -- are getting very closer to each other. The EPA is studying a potential acceleration in the phaseout of Refrigerant 22, which has firmed [ph] and increased prices, which, depending on what they say, could create even more significant shortage and opportunities for expanding margins. So the reclamation business, the pounds and quantities of product that we are buying back to reclaim continue to increase.

Our seco",569,"Thanks, Barry. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 2. I'm going to begin today by giving you an overall view of our quarterly results, the current business landscape and our outlook for the rest of this fiscal year. 
Our second quarter adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share and same-store sales growth of 3% were solid and what we were -- and were moderating macroeconomic conditions across our customer base and in light of the year-over-year impacts of the incremental SAP cost, one less selling day and helium supply constraints, which in the aggregate reduced our earnings growth by $0.07 or 700 basis points. 
Same-store sales in our core distribution business grew 2% this quarter, with hardgoods growth of 1%, decelerating to a greater extent than we had expected, and gas and rent slowing the 3% growth. The sluggish conditions were broad-based, reflecting an overall slower pace of daily activity in the industrial economy. July was weak throughout the month. August started off well but finished weak, coming in below our expectations overall. And September improved over August but remained sluggish and was overall weaker than we had expected. 
The relative strength of the U.S. metal fabrication and energy sectors, which had been bright spots for the economy earlier this year, appeared to have softened of late, tampering our growth even in those areas. But we continue to win new business in these sectors on the strength of our Strategic Accounts program, technical support of customers, breadth of our product and service offering and outstanding customer service. From our vantage point, smaller customers in particular seemed to be impacted most profoundly by slowing industrial activity levels. The overall slowing has continued during October, and it's very difficult to predict when activity levels will pick up to support the growth rates we had expected when we entered the fiscal year. 
Accordingly, we're revising our guidance range down from a range of $4.65 to $4.75 to a range of $4.45 to $4.60 to reflect the slower base business growth environment than we previously assumed. Though we're appropriately cautious about the near-term business environment, we're very optimistic about the long-term prospects for U.S. manufacturing and energy industries, the related infrastructure built to support those industries that will drive improvement in our nonresidential construction customer base and our ability to leverage our unique value proposition, which will only be enhanced by our conversion to SAP and unrivaled platform to drive growth in these and other key customer segments. 
This morning, we announced the $600 million share repurchase authorization by our board, which reflects the confidence we have in the future of Airgas. Our balance sheet is solid, and our strong cash flow continues to be a hallmark of our business model. 
Year-to-date, our adjusted cash flow from operations increased 8% year-over-year to $277 million. And free cash flow increased 15% year-over-year to $121 million. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation afford us the opportunity to repurchase shares and realize attractive earnings accretion while continuing to fund our growth strategies, including our acquisition program. Since the beginning of this fiscal year, we've acquired 8 businesses with aggregate annual revenues of around $19 million. The pipeline remains solid, and I'm optimistic we'll see greater activity in the next 6 to 9 months. 
Now I'll hand it off to Mike to review some of our key initiatives."

I'd like to start by providing a brief update on the helium supply chain constraints that we highlighted on our last earnings call. While we did start to see some relief in certain areas of the country during the quarter, supply is still very tight and is expected to remain tight well into the next calendar year. At this time, the year-over-year negative impacts of lower sales due to helium supply constraints for the remainder of this fiscal year remain as we projected last quarter, which Bob will revisit as part of the guidance discussion. 
Please turn to Slide 3. As Peter said, current business conditions indeed present some near-term challenges, but we will continue to invest in our long-term growth strategies, including the further development of our sales and marketing strategies focused on key customer segments, our Strategic Accounts program, infrastructure enhancement and leveraging our SAP platform. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on tailoring our value proposition to the unique needs of each major customer segment continues to gain momentum, and it's a driving force behind the Airgas organic growth story going forward. 
Our Strategic Account program, which leverages this segment-driven approach, presents us with tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product lines, services and locations, and represents more than 20% of total sales. In the second quarter, our Strategic Accounts business was up 3% over the prior year as we -- as continued new account signings and cross-selling to existing customers was tempered by broad-based slowing in general activity across most of our customer segments. Our large metal fabrication customers continued to post the strongest growth on a relative basis, though showing modest deceleration from first quarter growth rates. The retail segment again posted double-digit sales decline due to the substantial reduction in helium supply this year compared to last year. Excluding retail, Strategic Accounts, in aggregate, were up 4% over the prior year. 
Strategic Products continued to be an important part of our value proposition to customers and from a product standpoint have strong growth profiles due to their use in favorable customer segments, application development, increasing environmental regulation, strong cross-sell opportunities or a combination of these factors. In the second quarter, growth in sales of Strategic Products also decelerated to 3% over the prior year, with each product category posting sales growth in the 2% to 3% range, driven by broad-based economic softening. 
Deceleration in Strategic Products growth rates was most pronounced in our safety product sales, driven by general slowing in activity levels in our core industrial customer base. 
Our Radnor private label sales were up 1% over the prior year, consistent with total hardgoods same-store sales growth. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or greater than those of comparable OEM products. 
In September, we announced plans to build a new 400 ton-per-day air separation unit in the Chicago area in order to meet increasing demand for merchant gases in the region, which we fully expect to be the long-term trend in the Midwest. The ASU will produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon and is expected to begin production in the fall of 2014. With our strong base load of packaged and merchant gas customers in the region and the potential to idle a smaller, less efficient plant in Wisconsin in favor of this new plant that is also closer to our customer base, we expect capacity utilization on this new plant to be strong at the time of start-up. 
Moving on to SAP. The implementation is on schedule, with 10 out of 12 regional distribution companies now running successfully on the new platform. We expect the 11th region to be converted this quarter, with the last region converted by March. The rollout of our expanded telesales channel, Airgas Total Access, continues to gain momentum across the Airgas regions that have converted to SAP. We now have more than 70 full-time Total Access telesales representatives trained and deployed and calling on customers in the target size and span range selling gases and welding-related hardgoods in addition to our traditional telesales offering of safety products. About half of our regional companies have begun to leverage the data mining and functionality of SAP to take a more strategic approach to product pricing and discount management. The early results of our efforts in both of these areas reinforces our confidence that we'll realize the economic benefits as planned and that this investment will further enhance the value of our full-service offering to customers, which will be clear as Bob walks through the guidance. The 3 areas of opportunity for value enhancement that we have announced do not represent the full benefit of our investment in SAP. And we expect to explore additional areas of opportunity after the implementation is completed. 
Thank you. And now Bob will now give our financial review of the quarter and provide an updated guidance for the year."

Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results for the second quarter. Sales increased 4% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and same-store sales growth of 3%,",2013,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 for a review of our consolidated results for the second quarter. Sales increased 4% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and same-store sales growth of 3%, comprised of a 4% increase in gas and rent and a 1% increase in hardgoods. Total price was up 4%, and volumes were down 1%. Same-store sales and volumes for both gas and rent and hardgoods were reduced by approximately 1% due to one less selling day in the current quarter versus the prior year, with helium supply constraints also reducing gas volumes by an additional 1%. 
Gas and rent represented approximately 63% of our sales mix in the quarter, up slightly from the prior year and up 100 basis points from the first quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.1%, an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year, driven by the sales mix shift towards higher-margin gas and rent, as well as margin expansions on underlying gases and hardgoods. 
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $148 million, up 2% from last year, including nearly $3 million of incremental SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense. Not included in adjusted operating income were pretax charges of approximately $2.4 million related to the previously announced Business Support Center restructuring. 
Adjusted operating margin of 12% for the quarter included 90 basis points of impact from SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense. The prior year adjusted operating margin of 12.2% included 70 basis points of SAP-related cost. Excluding $0.02 of the BSC restructuring and other special charges, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.05, an increase of 2% from $1.03 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS of $1.05 included $0.09 of SAP implementation cost and depreciation expense, which were $0.02 higher than the prior year. One less selling day in the current year compared to the prior year reducing EPS by approximately $0.03. 
And as expected, lower helium sales volumes driven by the inability of suppliers to meet their helium supply commitments to us during the quarter reduced year-over-year earnings by $0.02 per diluted share. There were approximately 78.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Return on capital, which is a trailing 4 quarters calculation, was 12.5%, an improvement of 20 basis points over last year. 
We generated strong free cash flow of $121 million year-to-date through the second quarter, an increase of 15% over the prior year, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $277 million, which increased 8% over the prior year. 
Total debt decreased by $122 million year-over-year to approximately $2.1 billion at September 30. Our fixed load debt ratio at the end of September was approximately 53% fixed, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined to 2.4, comfortably within our target range of 2 to 3. 
As Peter noted, this morning we announced that the board has authorized the repurchase of up to $600 million of our common stock. A repurchase program now is appropriate since our leverage has been declining, cash flow has been strong, we have confidence in our future, and we have yet to realize the full benefits from our implementation of SAP. We are well positioned to continue to effectively manage our balance sheet leverage while capitalizing on an improving acquisition environment, investing in growth CapEx and executing the share repurchase program. 
Now turn to Slide 5, and we'll look at our segment results. SAP implementation costs, which are included in our consolidated adjusted earnings operating results, have not been allocated to our business segments, nor has special items that have been excluded from the consolidated adjusted operating results. 
Distribution sales in this quarter were up 3% versus the prior year to nearly $1.1 billion. Same-store sales for distribution were up 2%, with pricing up 4% and volume down 2%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 3%, and hardgoods were up 1%, with volume down 2% in both categories. Distribution, same-store sales and volumes for both gas and hardgoods were reduced by approximately 1% due to one less selling day in the current quarter versus the prior year, with helium supply constraints also reducing gas volumes by an additional 1%. 
As Peter and Mike noted, the deceleration in the sales growth rate has been broad-based, reflecting an overall slower pace of activity in the industrial economy. Gas and rent represented 58.4% of distribution sales in the second quarter, up from 58.1% in the prior year and up from 57.4% in the first quarter. Distribution gross margin was 55.8%, an increase of 180 basis points from the prior year, driven by the sales mix shift towards gas and rent and margin improvements in both gases and hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin increased 80 basis points from the first quarter, primarily driven by the sales mix shift towards gas and rent. Operating income in the distribution segment increased 2% year-over-year to $134 million, while operating margin declined slightly, 10 basis points, to 12.4%. Operating margin was pressured by moderating sales growth and the year-over-year decline in helium sales due to supply constraints, which also negatively impacted the year-over-year increase in operating income. 
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, dry ice, refrigerants, ammonia, nitrous and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 7% from the prior year, with same-store sales also up 7%, largely driven by an increase in R-22 prices in our refrigerant business and by both volume and price in our ammonia and CO2 businesses. Refrigerant sales had continued to benefit from increased demand ahead of a potential EPA ruling, which would accelerate the phaseout of new production of R-22, the most commonly used refrigerants in HVAC systems. Airgas is well positioned in the refrigerants market to reclaim, recycle and distribute R-22 nationwide to satisfy ongoing market demand in a tighter supply environment. Sequentially, sales in All Other Operations increased by 1%, as increases in our CO2, dry ice and ammonia businesses were partially offset by seasonality in the refrigerants business. Gross margin for All Other Operations was 47.1%, an increase of 130 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by margin expansion in our refrigerants and CO2 businesses. Sequentially, the 260-basis-point decline in gross margin from the first quarter was primarily driven by margin compression in our ammonia business due to rising feedstock cost. Operating income in All Other Operations was $22 million, an increase of $3 million over the prior year, and operating margin of 14.2%, which was up 100 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by the margin expansion in our refrigerants and CO2 businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. Year-to-date, CapEx represented 6.5% of sales, down from 7.1% of sales in the prior year. Construction and process spend was driven by the final stage of construction of our new ASU in Clarksville, Tennessee, the construction of our new hardgood distribution center in Bristol, PA, the buildout of our Business Support Centers and projects to expand or consolidate plants and branches across the country as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. 
Rental welder spend increased by $21 million on the improvement of our Red-D-Arc rental welder business, which continues to be a strong business for us. Excluding major projects, CapEx as a percentage of sales was approximately 4%. 
Now I'd like to discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year. Please note that our fiscal 2013 guidance excludes restructuring and other special charges, which were $0.05 in the first quarter, $0.02 in the second quarter and are expected to be approximately $0.02 in the -- for the third quarter and $0.10 for the full fiscal year, as well as the $0.07 gain on the sale of businesses in the first quarter. Special gains and charges in fiscal 2012 were a net total charge of $0.11. Please also note that our guidance does not include the potential impact from share repurchases under the new authorization announced this morning. 
Slide 7 presents a walk through the primary elements of our third quarter guidance using second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.05 and fiscal 2012 third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.97, respectively, as the starting points. In the sequential walk in the left-hand column, we expect headwinds of $0.04 from the impact of one less selling day in the holidays; an additional $0.05 headwinds from normal seasonal declines in our CO2, dry ice and refrigerants businesses, partially offset by Red-D-Arc; SAP benefits, net of expenses, are expected to contribute $0.07 to $0.08, which represents the difference between $0.09 of net expense in the second quarter and an expected $0.01 to $0.02 of expense, net of expected benefits, in the third quarter. On a sequential basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute additional earnings of $0.02 to $0.07. 
The right hand of the column on this slide shows the year-over-year walk. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings by $0.03. We are expecting year-over-year SAP benefits, net of implementation cost, to contribute $0.08 to $0.09, which represents the difference between the $0.10 of net expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and the expected $0.01 to $0.02 of expense, net of benefits, in the third quarter of this year. And on a year-over-year basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute an incremental $0.03 to $0.08, representing 3% to 8% of growth. 
In aggregate, when factoring in the headwinds and the contributions from incremental SAP and base business growth, we are estimating adjusted EPS for our third quarter to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.11, representing year-over-year growth of 8% to 14%. Third quarter guidance assumes same-store sales growth in the low single digits. 
Slide 8 presents a year-over-year walk through the primary elements of our implied fourth quarter and revised full year guidance using 2012 fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.11 and fiscal 2012 adjusted EPS of $4.11, respectively, as the starting points. For the fourth quarter, we expect the headwind of $0.03 for the impact of one less selling day in the fourth quarter of fiscal '13 compared to the prior year. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings growth by $0.01. A higher expected tax rate is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.02. We're expecting year-over-year SAP benefits, net of implementation cost, to contribute $0.14 to $0.17, which represents the difference between $0.09 of net expense in the fourth quarter of last year and $0.05 to $0.08 of net benefit in the fourth quarter of this year. And on a year-over-year basis, our base business growth is expected to contribute an incremental $0.03 to $0.09, representing 3% to 8% growth. 
In aggregate, when factoring in the headwinds and contributions from incremental SAP and base business growth, we're estimating adjusted EPS for our fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.22 to $1.31, representing year-over-year growth of 10% to 18%. Implied fourth quarter guidance assumes same-store sales growth in the low single digits. 
The right hand of the slide shows a year-over-year walk through our full year revised guidance. The impact of 2 less selling days is expected to be a headwind of $0.06. Helium supply constraints are estimated to reduce year-over-year earnings by $0.10, which is consistent with the expectations we provided on our first quarter earnings call. And a slightly higher tax rate relative to fiscal 2012 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.02. SAP implementation costs, net of the ramp-up of benefits, are expected to provide year-over-year improvement in earnings of $0.18 to $0.22, which represents the difference between $0.34 of net expense in fiscal 2012 and an expected net expense of $0.12 to $0.16 in fiscal 2013, which is consistent with the expectation we provided in our original guidance in May. Base business growth is expected to contribute $0.34 to $0.45 or 8% to 11% over prior year's adjusted EPS. 
And now I'll turn it back to Barry to begin our question-and-answer session."

And we have a full pipeline, and so we're trying to get it going. But as I said on the last 3 calls, these companies that are selling are still a long way from getting back to even. I mean, Airgas' gas volumes, they are 10% below our peak volumes back in 2009 still. And this recession has impacted smaller customers, which are the mainstay of a lot of these acquisitions. So even though we're going over a fiscal cliff and the Bush tax cuts are going to -- the cap gains, that's going from 15 to 20, and we have Obamatax and all that stuff, it's not enough to drive people. Now there has been an increase in activity, and I'm hopeful that -- I think we have a good shot at making our $150 million in sales acquired by the end of March, which was our -- which is our plugged goal every year.

And when I say the foreseeable future, I'm kind of leaning toward mid-calendar 2013. And that whether it's related to plants in Wyoming that are not even going to start, to continued additional problems in Algeria, to whatever, there are new issues on the horizon that are going to prevent them from getting back to full production. Now with that said, prices on helium have definitely significantly increased over the past year. In the long-term, the longer-term view, meaning 2014 and beyond, the shortfalls, the U.S. production of helium in the -- going forward, will always be a very tenuous supply chain. We have an aging infrastructure, a declining reserve. It will have to be made up by other sources. Those other sources are not located in the U.S. for the most part, so there will be helium -- to make up the shortfall, helium will be imported into this country from other parts of the world. It will be expensive helium. So the likelihood that we're going to see major declines in helium prices, in my opinion, is very low."

The refrigerants business, on the other hand, is very dynamic, and there is a lot of things happening in the refrigerants business. ^^ The supply-demand curves are getting very much -- are getting very closer to each other. The EPA is studying a potential acceleration in the phaseout of Refrigerant 22, which has firmed and increased prices, which, depending on what they say, could create even more significant shortage and opportunities for expanding margins. So the reclamation business, the pounds and quantities of product that we are buying back to reclaim continue to increase. So all of the dynamics of what we said we thought were going to happen with the refrigerants business are happening. The point -- problem is, we can't be absolutely precise on when these things occur because a lot of it has to do with government regulations and the phaseout and the timing."

And at this point, we're in Round 1 of -- maybe not 1, Round 1a of learning how to do this, and to find out exactly what we can get.
