Before we get underway let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and, when filed, Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the quarter ended December 31, 2011.
Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation.
Turning to Slide 4, with today's earnings release, we are providing a number of new disclosures related to our network platforms. We are providing this new closure to give you a better understanding of the underlying trends of our operations and the growth of our core Sprint platform business. In our disclosure and throughout today's call, Nextel platform refers to our iDEN business, which will begin decommissioning in 2012 and Sprint platform refers to our core ongoing business, which includes CDMA, WiMax, LTE and other network technologies.
Let's move to earnings per share on Slide 5. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the fourth quarter were $0.43 compared to $0.10 in the third quarter and $0.31 in the year-ago period. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the full year 2011 were $0.96 compared to $1.16 in the full-year 2010. The loss per share increased as compared to the third quarter, partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call. In addition, loss per share increased sequentially due to higher equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other, as well as higher net tax expense. The current period net loss per share includes $0.04 pretax loss per share related to an impairment of our holding in Clearwire, as well as $0.03 pretax loss per share related to the impairment of certain network assets related to Network Vision. The fourth quarter net loss per share also included a $0.01 pretax loss per share impact due to severance costs.
We recorded a net tax expense of $106 million in 4Q '11, which included $6 million related to changes in corporate income tax laws enacted in the quarter. For the full year 2012, we expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. Also, please keep in mind that Clearwire's fourth quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. Please refer to the press release and our form 10-K when it is filed for additional detail. I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

Sprint has shown continued momentum in recent quarters and Q4 is no exception. Before I recap our overall performance in 2011 in the context of our broader turnaround effort, let me take a moment and touch on some of the key highlights from the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. I am pleased to report today that we had a very successful launch of the iPhone, with total activations in the quarter of over 1.8 million, above our expectations. 40% of those activations were new customers to Sprint, a proved point of the renewed strengths of the Sprint brand. I'm also pleased to report today a year-over-year growth of $3.69 in our Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate, which is the largest increase on record in U.S. wireless industry history. This historic ARPU growth was achieved in the same quarter that we delivered our best postpaid voluntary churn number for any quarter since 2005 and in which we also delivered our highest postpaid gross add volume for any quarter in 4 years. As you know, voluntary churn is churn based on the customers' choice. Churn determined by the strength of the brand, the customer experience and comparative pricing. To improve postpaid churn in 2011, more than any major U.S. carrier and delivering the best annual postpaid churn in Sprint history while simultaneously increasing prices to an extent that delivered industry record-breaking ARPU in the same year is nothing short of remarkable.
The significant upfront costs associated with the introduction of the iPhone in the beginning of the ramp-up in Network Vision operating expense lowered adjusted OIBDA below historical levels but the $842 million of adjusted OIBDA in the quarter topped the high-end of our forecast and analysts estimates. This marked the third time in 2011 that quarterly OIBDA exceeded Street consensus estimates and on a pro forma basis full year 2011 adjusted OIBDA topped analyst consensus by over 5%.
Finally, I'm also pleased to announce continued progress on our Network Vision deployment. Today we're adding Baltimore and Kansas City to the list of cities that are expected to have Sprint LTE service, plus improved 3G service by the middle of this year, bringing the major cities to be launched by midyear to 6. 
As we close the fourth quarter of 2011, I completed my fourth year at Sprint. I told you on my first call that our turnaround would be difficult and not quick. Although we're far from finished, our progress nevertheless has been very significant. 2011 caps what I would consider the first phase of our turnaround, the recovery and strengthening of the business to the point that we are ready to enter the second phase in 2012, investment for future growth. I will organize the balance of my remarks today as usual around our 3 unchanging priorities: Improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash.  Given our special focus on OIBDA and cash generation, I'm going to change the order today however and start with cash. Please turn to Slide 8. 
We maintained our strong liquidity position by generating $275 million of positive free cash flow for the quarter in addition to raising $4 billion of cash through our recent debt offerings. Joe will provide more details on the impacts of Network Vision and iPhone on this quarter's OIBDA but absent the estimated impacts of these 2 investments and excluding 2006 which had a onetime blip associated with adding the first year over full-year Nextel results. 2011 full-year pro forma or the performance reflects a year-over-year improvement for the first time in 7 years. The growth in our core Sprint platform business finally overtook the declines on the Nextel platform and wireline. Driven by strength in postpaid ARPU Q4 represents our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in total operating revenues and the 4.7% growth from Q3 to Q4 represents our largest sequential increase in over 5 years. As mentioned, the Sprint platform postpaid ARPU increase of $3.69 for the fourth quarter of 2010 is the largest quarterly year-over-year improvement on record for the U.S. wireless industry.
Please turn to Slide 9. 2011 culminates the efforts of our cash strategy over the last 4 years as we prepared for the investment that lies ahead with Network Vision. We focused first from 2008 to 2010 on slowing down the subscriber and top line revenue declines that followed the merger. We also focused intensely on reducing both capital and operating expenses these past 4 years. We minimized our CapEx investments in 2G and early 3G radio technology to keep our powder dry for investment in our new world-class Sprint direct connect service and in 4G LTE. Compared to our CapEx run rate in 2007, between 2008 and 2011, we saved an estimated $15 billion in capital. Even when you consider our cash investments in Clearwire and the increase in OIBDA reducing roaming expenses we incurred over this period, which are effectively a trade-off with our decision to spend less on 2G and 3G CapEx, we achieved estimated savings in the last 4 years of over $10 billion of cash. Whether the accountants classify a dollars OpEx or CapEx, it's all cash in our view. From 2008 to 2011, our wireless CapEx investments were approximately 1/3 the spend of Verizon, 1/3 of AT&T spend and 1/2 the spend of T-Mobile U.S.A. Additionally, compared to our run rate in 2007, our total cost of service and SG&A in 2011, excluding roaming expense and subsidy which is really driven by competitive pricing versus spending behavior, are down by approximately $5 billion per year with G&A expenses down almost 50%, marketing and product down 32% even though we have invested more in increasing and improving Sprint retail and IT and billing expenses are down by 1/3. Over the same time period, our total labor expense is down by 33%.
A primary tool in previous years used to satisfy customers churn was for our care organizations to provide credits on customer bills. Not only did Sprint offer the lowest level of care credits in our history in 2011, but customer care credits have decreased by $1 billion on an annual basis since 2007. So we're not buying improvements in customer satisfaction in churn. During 2011, based on the improvements in our customer experience and in our brand, we were in a position for the first time to increase prices. We implemented an increase of $10 for our smartphone data plans in the first quarter of 2011. We also increased our other prices in fees during the year, illuminated our loyalty program and lengthened upgrade eligibility, all actions aimed in improving our OIBDA and cash generation.
Please turn to Slide 10. Improving the customer experience has been our top objective and the most important contributor to our turnaround. In the 2011 American Customer Satisfaction Index, we are the most improved U.S. company across all 47 industries studied by the ACSI over the past 3 years. Sprint was an statistical tie for first place for best overall choice by Consumer Reports in 2011, up from a distant last place in 2007 and in 2008, among major wireless carriers. Sprint was recognized 5x in 2011 by J.D. Power and Associates, and we were recently informed that Virgin will receive the J.D. Power award for the highest customer satisfaction among noncontract brands. Boost placed second. ATLANTIC-ACM just awarded Sprint a network award for global wholesale excellence and Frost and Sullivan just awarded Sprint the North American customer value enhancement award for the machine to machine space.
Our customer service organization continued their momentum to achieve customer service excellence. Sprint achieved best ever results in 2011 for customer satisfaction with Customer Care, customer satisfaction with repair and customer satisfaction with retail. We also achieved best ever results for the number of calls per subscriber to care and for First Call Resolution in addition to the best ever performance in fewest care credits given as previously mentioned.
In spite of some temporary pressure on involuntary churn, which we mentioned on last quarter's call and which Joe will describe in more detail, we continue to make steady progress on postpaid voluntary churn, which is an important indicator of customer satisfaction. 2011 represents our best ever annual total postpaid churn at 1.86%. In Q4, we delivered our best postpaid voluntary churn performance for any quarter since 2005. Like we did in 2010, we again improved voluntary postpaid churn year-over-year in every quarter of 2011. Prepaid churn of 4.05% for the year is also best ever and Q4 prepaid churn was Sprint's best in the last 24 quarters. Churn improved sequentially for each of our prepaid brands, Boost, Virgin and Assurance.
Turning now to brand on slide 11. I'm very pleased to report that once again all Sprint brand metrics or health metrics are record highs. As measured by an outside third party, most want to investigate Purchase Consideration, positive brand momentum and first brand preference are all at best ever levels in 2011. In a well known independent survey, Net Promoter scores again indicates Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major carriers to show improvement sequentially, and our improvement has been so significant we have moved up 2 spots in the major carrier rankings in the past 2 years.
Perhaps Q4 2011 will be most remembered for the collapse in December of AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile U.S.A. We believe the industry outlook will have been bleak had this take over succeeded, and we also believe that Sprint's successful championing of a healthy industry and customer choice will have lasting benefits for the way business customers and consumers use Sprint.
Please turn to slide 12. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, our total net subscriber additions in the fourth quarter of 1.6 million are the best in 6 years, bringing our full-year number to 5.1 million net adds, which is Sprint's highest number of net adds since 2001. Total customer served Sprint and Nextel network platforms reached 55 million at the end of 2011, yet another new all-time company record. I'm pleased to report that for the Sprint postpaid platform, 2011 is our second consecutive year of being net port positive against our competition, which means more customers switched to Sprint from our competitors than switched from Sprint to competitors. And total postpaid net adds are best since 2006. Our 161,000 postpaid net adds in the quarter represent our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We entered the fourth quarter expecting an even better performance, but during the quarter we saw unprecedented discounting on devices, especially for Apple products, which we decided not to participate in. We made a conscious decision not to chase meeting our net add guidance under these unforeseen circumstances, believing it was more prudent to shoot for delivering an OIBDA result exceeding the top end of the OIBDA guidance range we have provided instead. This was a tough decision for us to make during the fourth quarter. Not only had Sprint never missed a single guidance metric in the past 4 years, but for me personally, I had never missed one guidance number during my long career. So Sprint streak and my streak are now broken, but we believe we made the right decision.
Sprint's 40% iPhone gross add mix far outpaced our competitors. The gross add mix of sales is the best early indicator of long-term profitability with the iPhone, and we are pleased with the early results. We continue to believe the iPhone will bring significant value to Sprint over the long-term and early results are in line or better than our business case assumptions.
Turning to Slide 13. In addition to success with the iPhone, we continue to see strong demand for other compelling devices including our industry-leading portfolio of 4G devices. The Samsung Galaxy SII Epic 4G Touch not only has the longest device name in wireless industry history, but it was recently named the best Android phone by Keplinger's Personal Finance and America's #1 smartphone by PC World. In the fourth quarter, 86% of our Sprint postpaid handset sales were smartphones, and penetration of our Sprint platform base reached 66%, both all-time highs. We also had a strong quarter and year in wholesale and in prepaid, which Joe will cover later.
Turning to slide 14. In conclusion, we've come a long way in 4 years. Our top line is growing again. Our customer experience has gone from worst to arguably the best in the industry and our once battered brand is strengthening and gaining momentum. Offsetting the downward revenue in earnings pressures of a subscale wireline business and a declining business on Nextel platform, we have a vibrant growing Sprint platform that will fuel our continued growth. Since 2007, Nextel platform annual revenues are down approximately $9 billion annually and wireline revenues are down another approximately $2 billion annually, but our Sprint platform revenues are up over $4 billion annually since 2007. We've exercised financial discipline in the past 4 years, including large reductions in CapEx and OpEx to gain the financial stability to give us the confidence to begin the investment phase of our turnaround. 2011 marks not only the first annual service revenue increase but also our first positive operating income since 2006. And as mentioned, excluding the onetime events of the Nextel acquisition of last quarter's iPhone and Network Vision release and in spite the continued decline associated with our Nextel platform and wireline, 2011 delivered our first sequential improvement in pro forma adjusted OIBDA in 7 years. Since I arrived 4 years ago, we have known we eventually needed to deal with the ever increasing cost string of running an additional 2G network. During this period, we simultaneously improved network performance but also saved every dollar possible so we can invest our money not in the technology available in those years, but in new technology not available till now. To help buy time, we launched Boost Unlimited in the first quarter of 2009 using our spare item capacity. Boost has generated $5 billion in incremental revenues on the iDEN platform since that time. We waited until network infrastructure was developed that was one multimodal so that we could refarm the valuable iDEN 800 megahertz frequencies, two that could also provide an iDEN quality push-to-talk experience on the new network what we now call Sprint Direct Connect. And three, which was capable of providing 4G LTE service on FD or frequency division spectrum. 
Steve Elfman will speak next to give an update on our deployment status and plans for this year. But I am pleased with our progress today. By periodically discussing Network Vision support with my CEO peers and our key partners and I am very confident in their commitment to this effort and the significant opportunities that provide Sprint. I am proud of the accomplishments we've made in this first phase of our turnaround and I look forward to the call 2 years from now when we'll be looking back on the second turnaround phase or investment phase, the successful deployment of Network Vision and looking forward to Phase III, the margin expansion which will follow. I will now turn the call over to Steve to discuss our Network Vision progress. Steve?"

We are pleased with the progress of Network Vision which continues to be on schedule and on budget. In fact, as Dan mentioned, I'm pleased that we announced today the launch of our fifth and sixth major cities, Kansas City and Baltimore by midyear 2012. i want to remind you of the objective of Network Vision and then discuss our progress and some milestones. Network Vision is expected to allow us to achieve several key objectives. First, we expect to greatly improve our cost structure to the consolidation of our networks, as well as improving the coverage within our 3G footprint and reducing our in footprint roaming expenses. Second, we expect the program will allow us to optimize our Spectrum assets through the redeployment of 800 spectrum to both 3G and ultimately 4G LTE, which is expected to improve the performance of our network and improve customer experience.
Third, our multimodal technology is both more cost-effective and provides the flexibility to enable spectrum hosting. Lastly, through the implementation of new BTT push-to-talk technology and devices on Sprint platform we can maintain our leadership and eliminate Nextel platform.
Turning to slide 17. We are excited about the improvements to the customers experience and the technological flexibility that Network Vision is expected to produce. But the greatest advantage to the company and to our shareholders is the expected financial benefits. The project should finally remove some of the duplicative fixed costs that come with running 2 wireless networks. We expect to reduce our total tower position by more than 44% from approximately 68,000 towers down to 38,000 towers and at the same time greatly reduce both 3G and 4G roaming costs. The consolidation is not only expected to improve our operating cost, it should also significantly improve Sprint's carbon footprint, reinforcing its commitment to our green initiative is integral to cost efficiency. And Network Vision is expected to improve our capital efficiency, reducing our per unit costs of both gigabytes and minutes by approximately 50%.
I also want to remind everyone of the high degree of cost certainty we have written into our vendor contracts to support Network Vision. Essentially, all labor and execution costs in our contracts are predetermined. In other words, the majority of the expense risk associated with getting the bill done lies with our vendors and our only exposure to additional costs are scope changes.
Turning to Slide 17. So where are we? We are on track with our 2012 goals for deployment and things are going very well. We have executed against all of our major 3G and 4G technical milestones. The detailed deployment and resource plans have been completed by our 3 vendors and they have been staffing up to meet the buildout demand. We are well underway on leasing, zoning and tower power construction on our 38,000 sites with the goal of having 12,000 higher density sites on air by the end of this year. In addition, we expect that approximately 9,600 Nextel platform sites will be decommissioned by the end of 2012. We continue to expect that the build will be largely completed by the end of 2013, with some overflow of smaller markets in the first half of 2014.
During the fourth quarter, our first true multimodal permanent site went on air and the first cluster of cell sites launched in Illinois and they are meeting our performance and coverage targets. The development and deployment is proceeding within our budget targets. Our agreements with the major tower companies were finalized in Q4. In January, we announced 4 major markets scheduled to launch LTE by midyear, to which we added 2 more today. In addition, we announced our first 3 LTE devices which are coming by midyear 2012. And we have been launching phones that are 800 band class 10 compatible since the middle of last year. This means that as we redeploy our 800 spectrum, many of our 3G customers should get an immediate and very noticeable benefit. And in the fourth quarter, we launched our Sprint Direct Connect product including 3 new phones on the Sprint platform, which we are confident is the best push-to-talk product that's available in the market today and is central to our customer recapture strategy as we decommission the Nextel platform. And while people are focused on buildout of LTE, it is important to remember that every site we build is expected to provide immediate improvement in the network experience for all our customers and roaming cost reduction for Sprint. Going forward, in 2012, we plan to provide an update each quarter on cell sites on air, sites decommissioned on the Nextel platform and any significant build milestones. My entire team and I and our 3 vendors have a strong focus on cost containment and capital efficiency and will continue to drive the program forward to remain on schedule and on budget and I look forward to updating you next quarter with milestones achieved and new markets in the bill plan. Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Joe to review our detailed financial results."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Dan outlined, the past 4 years culminating with 2011 have been years of recovery in which Sprint has worked hard to put in place the operational and financial improvements we needed to support our next phase of investment. The recovery effort has been very successful. In a highly competitive market, these successes were hard won and do not come without a huge amount of work and ingenuity. We have effectively turned our core business around, producing the financial and operational stability and now allows us to invest for future OIBDA growth and margin expansion. I will go through the detailed Q4 results in a moment, but first I want to discuss how we are looking at 2012. As 2011 was a year of continued year-over-year improvement, 2012 will be a year of even greater focus on the bottom line. We expect to continue to grow the customer base in our core business on the Sprint platform while focusing on hitting our bottom-line numbers as we invest in network architecture, which we expect will be the foundation of future margin expansion. We will provide additional visibility into our key metrics in 2012 to give you more detailed information on the operational components of our business. With the launch of the iPhone, the implementation of Network Vision and the thinning of the Nextel network, we have a lot of moving parts, and we want to give you more tools to understand the underlying dynamics of our business. This commitment is reflected in the new disclosures we have provided today. With that, I will review the fourth quarter and full year 2011 results.
Total service revenue for the fourth quarter were $7.8 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 5% for the fourth quarter of 2010. The growth of our total net service revenues is primarily due to the growth in postpaid subscribers and ARPU on the Sprint platform as well as the strong growth of prepaid subscribers on the Sprint platform, partially offset by declines in our Nextel platform postpaid and prepaid subscriber basis and Nextel platform postpaid ARPU, as well as wireline revenues. In the full year 2011, wireline revenues declined by approximately $714 million and revenues from the Nextel platform declined by almost $2 billion, which means that service revenues from our core ongoing Sprint platform wireless business grew by nearly $3.5 billion or 17%. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter was $842 million, which includes approximately $54 million in Network Vision-related expenses and an estimated $630 million in net OIBDA impact related to the launch of the iPhone. In order to provide appropriate comparables to our numbers, we have estimated the incremental impact of the iPhone launch to our adjusted OIBDA results for the fourth quarter. The estimate of $630 million includes only the cost of estimated incremental gross adds and upgrades, as well as the subsidy rate variance resulting from the mix shift from other handsets and backs out the estimated incremental revenue benefit that comes from additional customers.
Going forward, it will become increasingly difficult to estimate the incremental impact as the iPhone becomes an integrated part of our handset sales. Thus, in the future, we will only provide the total impact of the iPhone on the quarter and will not attempt to estimate the incremental impact. Excluding the estimated $684 million of Network Vision and iPhone costs in Q4, pro forma adjusted OIBDA was over $1.5 billion, up $211 million or 16% year-over-year and up $89 million or 6% sequentially. Excluding these investments, consolidated pro forma adjusted OIBDA margin was 19.6% of net service revenues, a 100-basis point sequential improvement and a 200-basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Now let's turn to Slide 23 and discuss our wireless results in more detail. Total wireless service revenues for the fourth quarter were $7 billion, which is a 2% sequential increase and a 7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the revenues from the Nextel platform, fourth quarter wireless service revenues from our core Sprint platform were $6.2 billion, up $207 million or 3% sequentially and up $912 million or 17% over the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Dan has taken you through the trajectory of our very strong subscriber improvements over the past year and historically. And now I'd like to review our Q4 results in more detail.
Total company postpaid gross adds for the fourth quarter were just over 2.1 million, a 275,000 improvement sequentially and a 213,000 or 11% improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010. Total postpaid churn was 1.98%, which was 7 basis points higher than the third quarter and 12 basis points higher than the same period a year ago. As Dan mentioned, postpaid voluntary churn was at its best level for any quarter since 2005. So over 100% of the churn increase is involuntary churn. The vast majority of the increase in involuntary churn was due to 2 related items. First, in the second and third quarters, some of our indirect partners self-funded the retail price points of certain handsets down to 0. We tightened our credit standards during the third and fourth quarters to stem further impacts of these types of promotional activity. In the second and third quarters, we also launched an instant rebate promotion in the direct channel. While these actions were taken separately and attracted both prime and subprime customers, they both had the effect of significantly reducing the out-of-pocket expense for customers at the point of sale, which for subprime customers has a high correlation with early life involuntary churn. Another lesser impact was due to higher customer balances. As we have steadily increased ARPU throughout the year, we have seen some increase in customers churning because they are unable to make their monthly payments. This is the expected impact of the strong ARPU growth we have seen and with these increases and ongoing customer revenues, we understood we would see some negative impact to customer churn. However, as expected, the strong ongoing revenue growth of the subscriber base more than offset this impact.
So let me be clear. While we are experiencing some temporary impact to our involuntary churn due to the actions taken in the second and third quarters and due to our extraordinary ARPU growth, we believe the underlying fundamentals of our business are extremely sound, and we expect them to continue to improve. Our voluntary churn is the lowest since 2005, and we expect to see involuntary churn improve after Q1, once the impact of these items has had the time to move through our subscriber base. Going forward, we expect the launch of the iPhone will continue to have a positive impact on our core Sprint platform postpaid churn. This benefit will happen over time as our customers hit their upgrade eligibility and the iPhone becomes available to them. As Dan mentioned, ahead of the iPhone launch, we strategically standardized the term of upgrade eligibility for 20 months and we increased smartphone early termination fees in order to smooth the impact of upgrades and reduce the financial impact of the iPhone investment. This means that the churn benefits of the iPhone will layer in overtime but also that the profitability profile of our broader customer base should be improved as changes to ETFs and upgrade eligibility have been applied to many other devices, not just the iPhone.
The company's total postpaid net adds for the quarter were 161,000 comprised of 539,000 Sprint platform postpaid net adds, which included approximately 168,000 customers recaptured from the Nextel platform. This was offset by a net loss of 378,000 postpaid customers on the Nextel platform. We expect this negative trend on the Nextel platform to continue and to accelerate throughout 2012 as we commence decommissioning of the Nextel network and work to recapture customers on our core Sprint platform.
Concurrent with the strong postpaid subscriber growth we have seen on our core Sprint platform, we have also been very successful in growing our Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU is now over $61, which is 6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 due largely to the adoption of our $10 premium data smartphone charge. 86% of postpaid Sprint platform handset sales in the fourth quarter were smartphones, and the Sprint platform postpaid handset base penetration has now reached 66%, which means we expect to continue to see additional ARPU improvement in our core Sprint platform postpaid business throughout 2012.
Moving onto Slide 24. Prepaid ARPU for the full year 2011 was over $27, which was 1% lower than for the full year 2010. While total prepaid ARPU for 2011 was lower, the prepaid business had strong ARPU growth throughout the year on the Boost and Virgin be on top brands, offset by the growing mix of Assurance customers, which while lower in ARPU have a very favorable churn and profitability profile. Boost, in particular, had very strong ARPU growth of 5% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. One of the most positive trends in the prepaid business is our very strong results in prepaid churn. In the fourth quarter for 2011, total prepaid churn was 3.68% compared to 4.93% in the fourth quarter of 2010. While the growing mix of Assurance customers helps to keep our total prepaid churn rate low, it was not the biggest factor in the year-over-year decline in rate. Larger impacts were due to year-over-year rate reductions in both the Boost and the Virgin brand due to the shift from the Nextel platform to the Sprint platform on Boost and the shift from paid-by-the-minute customers to monthly smartphone customers on Virgin. The prepaid business has been a strong and important growth mechanism for our company, and we expect to continue to show growth in subscribers and revenues in our prepaid business in the coming year.
We have also seen very strong growth during the year in our wholesale business. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we had 954,000 wholesale and affiliate net adds, which is 143% growth from the fourth quarter 2010 and a 14% sequential increase. This very strong growth in the fourth quarter was fueled by prepaid NVNO agreements made in 2011, which represents profitable growth for Sprint with little to no upfront investment. 
Let's move on to wireless expenses on Slide 25. Sprint platform variable network expenses, which consists of roaming, long-distance, backhaul and premium service expense, were $845 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and were up approximately 20% over the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase is due to an increase in 3G and particularly 4G roaming costs. 3G roaming costs in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $215 million, up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2010. 3G roaming cost increases are primary the result of the growth in the number of Sprint platform postpaid customers, the growth of data usage by our customer base and our strategic decision over the past 4 years to decrease our capital spending on legacy network improvements in order to reserve investment dollars for Network Vision. 4G WiMAX roaming costs in the fourth quarter were $162 million, up more than 500% from just the $26 million versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Because of the launch of Network Vision, our 2012 3G roaming expenses are expected to be capped at 2011 levels. As a result of the Clearwire agreements we announced in the fourth quarter, we now have cost certainties on our quarterly 4G roaming expense, which will decrease by approximately 25% from our 4Q exiting expense to Q1 and is expected to remain constant for the year. Despite these increases to roaming costs in the current period and because of our strong Sprint platform ARPU
growth, we have been able to maintain stable variable network margins on the Sprint platform. With cost certainty on our WiMax-related 4G expenses in the next couple of years, as well as significant 3G roaming savings as we light up Network Vision markets, we believe we have a clear pathway to margin improvement as we execute on our network improvement plan.
Total wireless cost of service in the fourth quarter was $2.3 billion, a $41 million or 2% improvement sequentially, due largely to seasonally lower data roaming costs and lower service and repair costs. Of our total cost of service in the fourth quarter, approximately $352 million or 15% were network costs related to Nextel platform, which we expect will be eliminated upon the completion of Network Vision. Total wireless subsidy expense increased $540 million or 46% from the fourth quarter of 2010 and $561 million or 48% sequentially. Approximately 20% of the sequential increase was due to higher volumes and approximately 80% of the sequential increase was rate-related, largely associated with the launch of the iPhone. While the upfront investment in the iPhone is substantial, we expect that these customers will produce a strong return on investment in the later years. Wireless selling general and administrative costs increased to $136 million sequentially and $65 million over the fourth quarter of 2010. The sequential increase was largely associated with a $76 million higher cost in sales, $75 million of which was in new expense in the sales line due to reimbursements for point of sale discounts for iPhone, which are directly sourced by distributors being accounted for as a sales expense. These kinds of handset discounts were not directly sourced by the retailer are recognized as subsidy. For the full year 2011, wireless SG&A increased by $257 million, due largely to an increase in selling expense as a result of higher postpaid and prepaid gross adds, as well as the direct source iPhone sales costs. This was offset by $120 million decrease in customer care costs, which we have been able to streamline even as we've been making huge strides in the quality of our service. While total wireless SG&A has increased year-over-year, wireless SG&A as a percent of revenue has improved 100 basis points even with higher variable cost associated with higher volumes reflecting our continued strong cost discipline.
Wireless adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter was $668 million, which was $546 million lower than the third quarter and $378 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the estimated impacts of the iPhone and Network Vision, pro forma wireless segment adjusted OIBDA improved sequentially by 8% and showed year-over-year improvement of $306 million or 29%. Pro forma wireless adjusted OIBDA margins excluding the impact of the iPhone and Network Vision were 19.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 16% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Wireline OIBDA in the fourth quarter declined $89 million or 33% from the fourth quarter of 2010 and $290 million or 27% for the full year 2010. Approximately 78% of the wireline OIBDA decrease is due to a decline in revenues related to resetting of our intercompany transfer rate to reflect current market prices at the beginning of 2011, which is neutral at the consolidated level. Wireline OIBDA in 2012 is expected to decline by approximately $350 million, approximately $180 million to $220 million of this decline is expected to be due to intercompany rate changes, which are neutral to consolidated OIBDA and approximately $70 million to $80 million is related to cable, Voice over IP migrations.
Moving onto cash and liquidity on Slide 26. We ended the fourth quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $6.7 billion, including $5.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolver. During the quarter, we raised approximately $4 billion in private placement, including $1 billion of 11.5% unsecured notes during 2021 and approximately $3 billion of 9% guaranteed Notes due in 2018. The proceeds of these notes significantly enhance our liquidity position, allowing us to pay down $2.25 billion of notes due in March 2012 ahead of schedule. Our next loan maturity totaling $300 million is due in May of 2013, followed by a $1.5 billion maturity in the fourth quarter of 2013.
We believe we have a clear runway to allow us to continue the investments in the iPhone and in Network Vision. I previously gave you guidance that we would be raising approximately $5 billion to $7 billion, excluding the Clearwire investment we announced in Q4 and this remains our intention. Our discussions regarding vendor financing are progressing well with all of our vendors. It is a time-consuming process because it involves multiple parties, but we are pleased with our progress to date. Our continued expectation is that we will have an agreement in place before the end of the second quarter. In the meantime, we continue to watch the debt market, and we will be opportunistic with our options.
Our accrued capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest of $109 million and including $370 million of Network Vision capital were $900 million in the fourth quarter compared to $760 million in the third quarter and $608 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Total capital expense for the full year 2011 were approximately $2.9 billion, which includes $590 million in capital expenses related to Network Vision. Re-banding spend for the calendar year 2011 was approximately $123 million, net of $135 million MSS settlement from Dish TerraStar. Inclusive of the settlement, total spent on the rebanding project to date has been approximately $2.95 billion. We estimate that we have approximately $600 million to $700 million of rebanding work remaining expected to be split between 2012 and 2013, and with the possibility of going into 2014 depending on the timing of the Mexican rebanding plan. 
Free cash flow was $257 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to negative $273 million in the third quarter of 2011 and to $913 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The year-over-year decrease in free cash flow is primarily associated with lower OIBDA and higher capital expenditures. Free cash flow sequentially improvement of $530 million was primarily associated with the sequential decline in working capital of $1 billion, primarily associated with the timing of vendor payments and lower accrued dealer commissions and rebate reserves as we wound down our instant rebate promotions in our retail stores during Q3. Free cash flow in Q4 also benefited from the onetime payment of $135 million for the MSS settlement.
Finally, I want to outline our expectations for 2012. Total adjusted OIBDA for the full year 2012 is expected to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, including the impact of the iPhone and approximately $1.1 billion of dilution associated with Network Vision. To achieve this, we expect total net service revenue growth of approximately 4% to 6%. With the Network Vision project ramping up, the quarterly timing of OIBDA is expected to be somewhat fluid. However, our expectation is that OIBDA in the first half of the year will be slightly lower than in the second half. In general, our quarterly OIBDA will also be affected by the timing of the launch of any subsequent versions of the iPhone. The expectation is that our OIBDA trough will be U-shaped through 2012 and then will start to ramp in 2013 followed by strong margin expansion in 2014. As we've discussed previously, we expect that 2012 will be an aggressive investment year with regard to capital expenditures as we pursue a rapid and efficient execution of Network Vision. Total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $6 billion, excluding capitalized interest. In addition, based on the plans outlined by Steve earlier, in the first quarter of 2012, we have revised our estimates of the expected useful life of certain Nextel platform assets through the end of 2013. Accordingly, approximately $2 billion in net book value of these assets is expected to be accelerated through depreciation expense, of which a disproportionate amount is expected to be recognized during the 2012. The exact timing of the acceleration is dependent upon when the assets are expected to be phased out of service. These estimates are derived from our internal decommissioning plan, which is still evolving. We estimate the incremental effect of accelerated depreciation related to Nextel assets in our 2012 results to be in the range of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, of which approximately $450 million to $550 million will be recognized in the first quarter of 2012. We will continue to update you on these amounts quarterly as we refine our plans for Nextel decommissioning.
I want to end by reiterating my confidence in the strength of our core underlying business and in the pathway we believe we have created to future OIBDA growth and margin expansion. We are confident in the steps we are taking to improve our profitability and in our ability to execute on our strategic plan. The entire management team has a sharp focus on execution and profitability through the next few quarters of investment, and we are excited about the future. I want to thank you for all your support, and I'll turn the call over back to Brad for Q&A."

And then, Dan, turning over to strategic side, Slide 14 that you went through, the operational progress for Sprint, can you talk more about where Sprint is positioned strategically? With T-Mobile still in the market, Cable choosing to work with Verizon, it seems you have some real competition to go after the remaining partners through a spectrum capital or both. So can you just put in perspective for us what Sprint is doing to put the company in the best position to either partner or by Spectrum as you move forward over the next 12 to 24 months?"

I think as far as the churn is concerned on the postpaid side really Sprint platform that we described is -- we saw some impact as we mentioned in Q3 involuntary that continuing, if you will, increasing in Q4 and then in Q1. And then we would expect to see that begin to lower. You asked a question about credit. We tightened credit in Q3 and Q4 after we saw what was going on in the channels. So what we have taken actions in that regard. With respect to the iPhone and churn, that obviously a very important element of we call it the overall profitability of the iPhone, the customer lifetime value. And we will see that over time. But we've seen early on in terms of the profitability metrics are first of all very high gross add percentage. The other thing from a churn perspective is again you have lifetime churn but you also see historically what happens to Sprint voluntary churn in the quarters where iPhones are launched. And in each of the previous 5 quarters when iPhones have been launched, our voluntary churn has gone in the wrong direction. And so this quarter, this past quarter, is the first quarter of the 6 quarters where the new iPhone has been launched where we've seen both a sequential and a year-over-year improvement in voluntary churn. So early on, we are definitely are seeing those churn characteristics. The other thing I would say is that from a cost of service perspective, not only are we seeing lower usage of the network on iPhone and Android, so our business case is continuing to perform there. But our calls to care early on, again it's only a first few months, is lower than it's been for any of our high-end devices in the early months. So if you will, our operating costs are also looking good in terms of the investments and compared to our business case. So, and again, the last piece on the iPhone is also we sold more of them than our initial plans had indicated as well 1.8 million. So we see at least early on no reason to be concerned at all about our volume commitments, which has come up on previous calls. So we feel good about the early indications of the iPhone, especially the 40% gross add number which is almost 2x the rate that we've seen on the other 2 major carriers."

And then Joe, just quickly on the EBITDA guidance, just helping us think through the pacing through 2012. I think you're implying an average of about 950 a quarter, you mentioned first half lower than second half, just maybe to put some parameters around it. Do you think the fourth quarter results that we just had the 842 represent sort of a trough company EBITDA?"

First part is again kind of getting back to the iPhone discussion as well. What we did in advance of the iPhone is we extended, if you will, the period of time the customers would have to stay with us before they'll be eligible for upgrades, and we did away with our loyalty program. In addition, what we did in the later part of the year and that we will continue that discipline in 2012 is be selective in terms of we'll call it customer outreach on upgrades. That has traditionally been a way that we keep churn low is to get customers to sign new 2-year contracts. But our customers on contract is at a very strong level compared to historical levels, so we feel good about that. So you're exactly right. There's a discipline associated with upgrades, and that's another reason why 40% gross add makes on the iPhone is good to see. We'll watch this in 2012, but we're not providing any specific guidance with respect to what our upgrade percentages will be in 2012."

But what we saw in Q4 in 2011 was unusual even by traditional seasonality, history in that. Generally, you just don't see any discounting on iPhones, and we saw very common both Verizon and AT&T to see $30 per device and up discounts from the if you will the normal pricing, the $200 or the $100 or what have you, $170 and $70 instead, and that was unusual. We saw some 4 4G LTE devices at very low rates that we don't normally see.

A lot of customers have currently used that if you will the Clearwire or the WiMax platform and will continue to market devices this year that operate on that platform. And as you know, it really distinguishes Sprint as well is the fact that our pricing for handsets is unlimited. It is not unlimited on data cards or mobile hotspots, but it is on handsets. So the pricing arrangement that we have with Clearwire is very helpful in that regard, that clarity, that's assurety, that ability for us to continue to offer with these devices for the next couple of years. Our focus with Clearwire really going forward in terms of handsets and technologies has to do with LTE TD, which they've announced they'll be putting into their networks. So expect we hope again these things are fluid but probably in the 2013 timeframe you begin to see devices that will start offering, that will work on Clearwire's new LTE network, that they will begin to build in 2013, so we would be, if you will, using Clearwire's WiMax network for a number of years as we have a lot of devices that are out there but we'll begin introducing and 13 devices on the new LTE network that we'll utilize that capability that Clearwire will be bringing to market. So we have a mix of those over time. And yes, that was all, if you will, considered as we built our OIBDA plan for '12 and going forward. But the big element is what Joe mentioned in his remarks was if you will both a reduction and derisking, if you will, the roaming expenses associated with Clearwire's 4G service in 2012 because it's a fixed amount."

Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K and when filed, Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation.
Turning to Slide 4, with today's earnings release, we are providing a number of new disclosures related to our network platforms. We are providing this new disclosure to give you a better understanding of the underlying trends of our operations and the growth of our core Sprint platform business. In our disclosure and throughout today's call, Nextel platform refers to our iDEN business, which will begin decommissioning in 2012 and Sprint platform refers to our core ongoing business, which includes CDMA, WiMAX, LTE and other network technologies.
Let's move to earnings per share on Slide 5. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the fourth quarter were $0.43 compared to $0.10 in the third quarter and $0.31 in the year-ago period. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the full year 2011 were $0.96 compared to $1.16 in the full year 2010. The loss per share increased as compared to the third quarter partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call. In addition, loss per share increased sequentially due to higher equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other as well as higher net tax expense. The current period net loss per share includes $0.04 pretax loss per share related to an impairment of our holding in Clearwire as well as $0.03 pretax loss per share related to the impairment of certain network assets related to Network Vision. The fourth quarter net loss per share also included a $0.01 pretax loss per share impact due to severance costs.
We recorded a net tax expense of $106 million in 4Q '11, which included $6 million related to changes in corporate income tax laws enacted in the quarter. For the full year 2012, we expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. Also, please keep in mind that Clearwire's fourth quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. Please refer to the press release and our form 10-K, when it is filed, for additional detail.

Sprint has shown continued momentum in recent quarters, and Q4 is no exception. Before I recap our overall performance in 2011 in the context of our broader turnaround effort, let me take a moment and touch on some of the key highlights from the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. I am pleased to report today that we had a very successful launch of the iPhone, with total activations in the quarter of over 1.8 million, above our expectations. 40% of those activations were new customers to Sprint, a proof point of the renewed strength of the Sprint brand. I'm also pleased to report today a year-over-year growth of $3.69 in our Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate, which is the largest increase on record in U.S. wireless industry history. This historic ARPU growth was achieved in the same quarter that we delivered our best postpaid voluntary churn number for any quarter since 2005 and in which we also delivered our highest postpaid gross add volume for any quarter in 4 years. 
As you know, voluntary churn is churn based on the customers' choice, churn determined by the strength of the brand, the customer experience and comparative pricing. To improve postpaid churn in 2011 more than any major U.S. carrier and delivering the best annual postpaid churn in Sprint history while simultaneously increasing prices to an extent that delivered industry record-breaking ARPU in the same year is nothing short of remarkable.
The significant upfront costs associated with the introduction of the iPhone in the beginning of the ramp-up in Network Vision operating expense lowered adjusted OIBDA below historical levels, but the $842 million of adjusted OIBDA in the quarter topped the high end of our forecast and analyst estimates. This marked the third time in 2011 that quarterly OIBDA exceeded Street consensus estimates and, on a pro forma basis, full year 2011 adjusted OIBDA topped analyst consensus by over 5%.
Finally, I'm also pleased to announce continued progress on our Network Vision deployment. Today we're adding Baltimore and Kansas City to the list of cities that are expected to have Sprint LTE service plus improved 3G service by the middle of this year, bringing the major cities to be launched by midyear to 6. 
As we close the fourth quarter of 2011, I completed my fourth year at Sprint. I told you on my first call that our turnaround would be difficult and not quick. Although we're far from finished, our progress, nevertheless, has been very significant. 2011 caps what I would consider the first phase of our turnaround, the recovery and strengthening of the business to the point that we're ready to enter the second phase in 2012, investment for future growth. I will organize the balance of my remarks today, as usual, around our 3 unchanging priorities: improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash.  Given our special focus on OIBDA and cash generation, I'm going to change the order today, however, and start with cash. Please turn to Slide 8. 
We maintained our strong liquidity position by generating $275 million of positive free cash flow for the quarter in addition to raising $4 billion of cash through our recent debt offerings. Joe will provide more details on the impacts of Network Vision and iPhone on this quarter's OIBDA. But absent the estimated impacts of these 2 investments and excluding 2006, which had a onetime blip associated with adding the first year of full year Nextel results, 2011 full year pro forma OIBDA performance reflects year-over-year improvement for the first time in 7 years. The growth in our core Sprint platform business finally overtook the declines on the Nextel platform and wireline. 
Driven by strength in postpaid ARPU, Q4 represents our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in total operating revenues, and the 4.7% growth from Q3 to Q4 represents our largest sequential increase in over 5 years. As mentioned, the Sprint platform postpaid ARPU increase of $3.69 for the fourth quarter of 2010 is the largest quarterly year-over-year improvement on record for the U.S. wireless industry.
Please turn to Slide 9. 2011 culminates the efforts of our cash strategy over the last 4 years as we prepared for the investment that lies ahead with Network Vision. We focused first, from 2008 to 2010, on slowing down the subscriber and top line revenue declines that followed the merger. We also focused intensely on reducing both capital and operating expenses these past 4 years. We minimized our CapEx investments in 2G and early 3G radio technology to keep our powder dry for investment in our new world-class Sprint Direct Connect service and in 4G LTE. 
Compared to our CapEx run rate in 2007, between 2008 and 2011, we saved an estimated $15 billion in capital. Even when you consider our cash investments in Clearwire and the increase in OIBDA-reducing roaming expenses we incurred over this period, which are effectively a tradeoff with our decision to spend less on 2G and 3G CapEx, we achieved estimated savings in the last 4 years of over $10 billion of cash. Whether the accountants classify $1 as OpEx or CapEx, it's all cash in our view. From 2008 to 2011, our wireless CapEx investments were approximately 1/3 the spend of Verizon, 1/3 of AT&T spend and 1/2 the spend of T-Mobile U.S.A. 
Additionally, compared to our run rate in 2007, our total cost of service and SG&A in 2011, excluding roaming expense and subsidy, which is really driven by competitive pricing versus spending behavior, are down by approximately $5 billion per year with G&A expenses down almost 50%, marketing and product down 32% even though we have invested more in increasing and improving Sprint retail and IT and billing expenses are down by 1/3. Over the same time period, our total labor expense is down by 33%.
A primary tool in previous years used to satisfy customers and stem churn was for our care organization to provide credits on customer bills. Not only did Sprint offer the lowest level of care credits in our history in 2011, but customer care credits have decreased by $1 billion on an annual basis since 2007. So we're not buying improvements in customer satisfaction in churn. During 2011, based on the improvements in our customer experience and in our brand, we were in a position for the first time to increase prices. We implemented an increase of $10 for our smartphone data plans in the first quarter of 2011. We also increased our other prices and fees during the year, eliminated our loyalty program and lengthened upgrade eligibility, all actions aimed at improving our OIBDA and cash generation.
Please turn to Slide 10. Improving the customer experience has been our top objective and the most important contributor to our turnaround. In the 2011 American Customer Satisfaction Index, we're the most improved U.S. company, period, across all 47 industries studied by the ACSI over the past 3 years. Sprint was in a statistical tie for first place for best overall choice by Consumer Reports in 2011, up from a distant last place in 2007 and in 2008, among major wireless carriers. Sprint was recognized 5 times in 2011 by J.D. Power and Associates, and we were recently informed that Virgin will receive the J.D. Power award for the highest customer satisfaction among non-contract brands. Boost placed second. ATLANTIC-ACM just awarded Sprint a network award for global wholesale excellence, and Frost & Sullivan just awarded Sprint the North American Customer Value Enhancement Award for the machine-to-machine space.
Our customer service organization continued their momentum to achieve customer service excellence. Sprint achieved best ever results in 2011 for customer satisfaction with customer care, customer satisfaction with repair and customer satisfaction with retail. We also achieved best ever results for the number of calls per subscriber to Care and for First Call Resolution in addition to the best ever performance in fewest care credits given, as previously mentioned.
In spite of some temporary pressure on involuntary churn, which we mentioned on last quarter's call and which Joe will describe in more detail, we continue to make steady progress on postpaid voluntary churn, which is an important indicator of customer satisfaction. 2011 represents our best ever annual total postpaid churn at 1.86%. And in Q4, we delivered our best postpaid voluntary churn performance for any quarter since 2005. Like we did in 2010, we again improved voluntary postpaid churn year-over-year in every quarter of 2011. Prepaid churn of 4.05% for the year is also best ever, and Q4 prepaid churn was Sprint's best in the last 24 quarters. Churn improved sequentially for each of our prepaid brands: Boost, Virgin and Assurance.
Turning now to brand on Slide 11. I'm very pleased to report that once again, all Sprint brand metrics or health metrics are record highs. As measured by an outside third party, most want to investigate, purchase consideration, positive brand momentum and first brand preference are all at best ever levels in 2011. In a well-known independent survey, net promoter scores again indicate Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major carriers to show improvement sequentially. And our improvement has been so significant, we have moved up 2 spots in the major carrier rankings in the past 2 years.
Perhaps Q4 2011 will be most remembered for the collapse in December of AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile U.S.A. We believe the industry outlook would have been bleak had this takeover succeeded, and we also believe that Sprint's successful championing of a healthy industry and customer choice will have lasting benefits for the way business customers and consumers use Sprint.
Please turn to Slide 12. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, our total net subscriber additions in the fourth quarter of 1.6 million are the best in 6 years, bringing our full year number to 5.1 million net adds, which is Sprint's highest number of net adds since 2001. Total customer served in the Sprint and Nextel network platforms reached 55 million at the end of 2011, yet another new all-time company record. I'm pleased to report that for the Sprint postpaid platform, 2011 is our second consecutive year of being net port positive against our competition, which means more customers switched to Sprint from our competitors than switched from Sprint to competitors. And total postpaid net adds are our best since 2006. 
Our 161,000 postpaid net adds in the quarter represent our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We entered the fourth quarter expecting an even better performance, but during the quarter we saw unprecedented discounting on devices, especially for Apple products, which we decided not to participate in. We made a conscious decision not to chase meeting our net add guidance under these unforeseen circumstances, believing it was more prudent to shoot for delivering an OIBDA result exceeding the top end of the OIBDA guidance range we had provided instead. This was a tough decision for us to make during the fourth quarter. Not only had Sprint never missed a single guidance metric in the past 4 years, but for me, personally, I had never missed one guidance number during my long career. So the Sprint streak and my streak are now broken, but we believe we made the right decision.
Sprint's 40% iPhone gross add mix far outpaced our competitors. The gross add mix of sales is the best early indicator of long-term profitability with the iPhone, and we are pleased with the early results. We continue to believe the iPhone will bring significant value to Sprint over the long term, and early results are in line with or better than our business case assumptions.
Turning to Slide 13. In addition to success with the iPhone, we continue to see strong demand for other compelling devices, including our industry-leading portfolio of 4G devices. The Samsung Galaxy SII Epic 4G Touch not only has the longest device name in wireless industry history, but it was recently named the best Android phone by Kiplinger's Personal Finance and America's #1 smartphone by PC World. In the fourth quarter, 86% of our Sprint postpaid handset sales were smartphones, and penetration of our Sprint platform base reached 66%, both all-time highs. We also had a strong quarter and year in wholesale and in prepaid, which Joe will cover later.
Turning to Slide 14. In conclusion, we've come a long way in 4 years. Our top line is growing again. Our customer experience has gone from the worst to arguably the best in the industry, and our once battered brand is strengthening and gaining momentum. Offsetting the downward revenue and earnings pressures of a subscale wireline business and a declining business on Nextel platform, we have a vibrant growing Sprint platform that will fuel our continued growth. Since 2007, Nextel platform annual revenues are down approximately $9 billion annually, and wireline revenues are down another approximately $2 billion annually, but our Sprint platform revenues are up over $4 billion annually since 2007. 
We've exercised financial discipline in the past 4 years, including large reductions in CapEx and OpEx, to gain the financial stability to give us the confidence to begin the investment phase of our turnaround. 2011 marks not only the first annual service revenue increase but also our first positive operating income since 2006. And as mentioned, excluding the onetime events of the Nextel acquisition of last quarter's iPhone and Network Vision overlays and in spite of the continued declines associated with our Nextel platform and wireline, 2011 delivered our first sequential improvement in pro forma adjusted OIBDA in 7 years. 
Since I arrived 4 years ago, we have known we eventually needed to deal with the ever increasing cost string of running an additional 2G network. During this period, we simultaneously improved network performance but also saved every dollar possible so we can invest our money, not in the technology available in those years but in the new technology not available till now. To help buy time, we launched Boost Unlimited in the first quarter of 2009 using our spare item capacity. Boost has generated $5 billion in incremental revenues on the iDEN platform since that time. We waited until network infrastructure was developed that was one, multimodal so that we could re-farm the valuable iDEN 800 megahertz frequencies; two, that could also provide an iDEN-quality push-to-talk experience on the new network, what we now call Sprint Direct Connect; and three, which was capable of providing 4G LTE service on our FD or frequency division spectrum. 
Steve Elfman will speak next to give an update on our deployment status and plans for this year, but I am pleased with our progress today. I periodically discussing Network Vision support with my CEO peers and our key partners, and I am very confident in their commitment to this effort and the significant opportunities it provides Sprint. I'm proud of the accomplishments we have made in this first phase of our turnaround, and I look forward to the call 2 years from now when we'll be looking back on the second turnaround phase or investment phase, the successful deployment of Network Vision and looking forward to Phase 3, the margin expansion, which will follow. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve to discuss our Network Vision progress. Steve?"

We are pleased with the progress of Network Vision, which continues to be on schedule and on budget. In fact, as Dan mentioned, I'm pleased that we announced today the launch of our fifth and sixth major cities, Kansas City and Baltimore by midyear 2012. 
I want to remind you of the objective of Network Vision and then discuss our progress and some milestones. Network Vision is expected to allow us to achieve several key objectives. First, we expect to greatly improve our cost structure through the consolidation of our networks as well as improving the coverage within our 3G footprint and reducing our in-footprint roaming expenses. Second, we expect the program will allow us to optimize our spectrum assets through the redeployment of our 800 spectrum to both 3G and ultimately, 4G LTE, which is expected to improve the performance of our network and improve customer experience. Third, our multimodal technology is both more cost effective and provides the flexibility to enable spectrum hosting. Lastly, through the implementation of new PTT, push-to-talk technology and devices on the Sprint platform, we can maintain our leadership and eliminate the Nextel platform.
Turning to Slide 17. We're excited about the improvements to the customers' experience and the technological flexibility that Network Vision is expected to produce, but the greatest advantage to the company and to our shareholders is the expected financial benefits. The project should finally remove some of the duplicative fixed costs that come with running 2 wireless networks. We expect to reduce our total tower position by more than 44%, from approximately 68,000 towers down to 38,000 towers and at the same time, greatly reduce both 3G and 4G roaming costs. The consolidation is not only expected to improve our operating cost, it should also significantly improve Sprint's carbon footprint, reinforcing that Sprint's commitment to our green initiative is integral to cost efficiency. And Network Vision is expected to improve our capital efficiency, reducing our per-unit cost of both gigabytes and minutes by approximately 50%.
I also want to remind everyone of the high degree of cost certainty we have written into our vendor contracts to support Network Vision. Essentially, all labor and execution costs in our contracts are predetermined. In other words, the majority of the expense risk associated with getting the bill done lies with our vendors, and our only exposure to additional costs are scope changes.
Turning to Slide 17. So where are we? We are on track with our 2012 goals for deployment, and things are going very well. We have executed against all of our major 3G and 4G technical milestones. The detailed deployment and resource plans have been completed by our 3 vendors, and they have been staffing up to meet the build-out demand. We are well underway on leasing, zoning and tower construction on our 38,000 sites with the goal of having 12,000 higher-density sites on air by the end of this year. In addition, we expect that approximately 9,600 Nextel platform sites will be decommissioned by the end of 2012. We continue to expect that the build will be largely completed by the end of 2013 with some overflow of smaller markets in the first half of 2014.
During the first -- fourth quarter, our first true multimodal permanent site went on air, and the first cluster of cell sites launched in Kankakee, Illinois. And they are meeting our performance and coverage targets. The development and deployment is proceeding within our budget targets. Our agreements with the major tower companies were finalized in Q4. In January, we announced 4 major markets scheduled to launch LTE by midyear, to which we added 2 more today. In addition, we announced our first 3 LTE devices, which are coming by midyear 2012. And we have been launching phones that are ""800 Band Class 10"" compatible since the middle of last year. This means that as we redeploy our 800 spectrum, many of our 3G customers should get an immediate and very noticeable benefit. 
And in the fourth quarter, we launched our Sprint Direct Connect product, including 3 new phones, on the Sprint platform, which we are confident is the best push-to-talk product that is available in the market today and is central to our customer recapture strategy as we decommission the Nextel platform. And while people are focused on build-out of LTE, it is -- it's important to remember that every site we build is expected to provide immediate improvement in the network experience for all our customers and roaming cost reduction for Sprint. 
Going forward, in 2012, we plan to provide an update each quarter on cell sites on air, sites decommissioned on the Nextel platform and any significant build milestones. My entire team and I and our 3 vendors have a strong focus on cost containment and capital efficiency, and we'll continue to drive the program forward to remain on schedule and on budget. And I look forward to updating you next quarter with milestones achieved and new markets in the bill plan. 
Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Joe to review our detailed financial results."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Dan outlined, the past 4 years, culminating with 2011, have been years of recovery and which Sprint has worked hard to put in place the operational and financial improvements we needed to support our next phase of investment. The recovery effort has been very successful. In a highly competitive market, these successes were hard won and do not come without a huge amount of work and ingenuity. We have effectively turned our core business around, producing the financial and operational stability and now allows us to invest for future OIBDA growth and margin expansion. 
I will go through the detailed Q4 results in a moment, but first, I want to discuss how we are looking at 2012. As 2011 was a year of continued year-over-year improvement, 2012 will be a year of even greater focus on the bottom line. We expect to continue to grow the customer base in our core business on the Sprint platform while focusing on hitting our bottom line numbers as we invest in network architecture, which we expect will be the foundation of future margin expansion. We will provide additional visibility into our key metrics in 2012 to give you more detailed information on the operational components of our business. With the launch of the iPhone, the implementation of Network Vision and the thinning of the Nextel network, we have a lot of moving parts, and we want to give you more tools to understand the underlying dynamics of our business. This commitment is reflected in the new disclosures we have provided today. With that, I will review the fourth quarter and full year 2011 results.
Total service revenue for the fourth quarter were $7.8 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 5% for the fourth quarter of 2010. The growth of our total net service revenues is primarily due to the growth in postpaid subscribers and ARPU on the Sprint platform and as well as the strong growth of prepaid subscribers on the Sprint platform, partially offset by declines in our Nextel platform postpaid and prepaid subscriber basis and Nextel platform postpaid ARPU as well as wireline revenues. 
In the full year 2011, wireline revenues declined by approximately $714 million, and revenues from the Nextel platform declined by almost $2 billion, which means that service revenues from our core ongoing Sprint platform wireless business grew by nearly $3.5 billion or 17%. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter was $842 million, which includes approximately $54 million in Network Vision-related expenses and an estimated $630 million in net OIBDA impact related to the launch of the iPhone. In order to provide appropriate comparables to our numbers, we have estimated the incremental impact of the iPhone launch to our adjusted OIBDA results for the fourth quarter. The estimate of $630 million includes only the cost of estimated incremental gross adds and upgrades as well as the subsidy rate variance resulting from the mix shift from other handsets and backs out the estimated incremental revenue benefit that comes from additional customers.
Going forward, it will become increasingly difficult to estimate the incremental impact as the iPhone becomes an integrated part of our handset sales. Thus, in the future, we will only provide the total impact of the iPhone on the quarter and will not attempt to estimate the incremental impact. Excluding the estimated $684 million of Network Vision and iPhone cost in Q4, pro forma adjusted OIBDA was over $1.5 billion, up $211 million or 16% year-over-year and up $89 million or 6% sequentially. Excluding these investments, consolidated pro forma adjusted OIBDA margin was 19.6% of net service revenues, a 100-basis-point sequential improvement and a 200-basis-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Now let's turn to Slide 23 and discuss our wireless results in more detail. Total wireless service revenues for the fourth quarter were $7 billion, which is a 2% sequential increase and a 7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the revenues from the Nextel platform, fourth quarter wireless service revenues from our core Sprint platform were $6.2 billion, up $207 million or 3% sequentially and up $912 million or 17% over the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Dan has taken you through the trajectory of our very strong subscriber improvements over the past year and historically, and now I'd like to review our Q4 results in more detail.
Total company postpaid gross adds for the fourth quarter were just over 2.1 million, a 275,000 improvement sequentially and a 213,000 or 11% improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010. Total postpaid churn was 1.98%, which was 7 basis points higher than the third quarter and 12 basis points higher than the same period a year ago. As Dan mentioned, postpaid voluntary churn was at its best level for any quarter since 2005, so over 100% of the churn increase is involuntary churn. 
The vast majority of the increase in involuntary churn was due to 2 related items. First, in the second and third quarters, some of our indirect partners self funded the retail price points of certain handsets down to 0. We tightened our credit standards during the third and fourth quarters to stem further impacts of these types of promotional activity. In the second and third quarters, we also launched an instant rebate promotion in the direct channel. While these actions were taken separately and attracted both prime and subprime customers, they both had the effect of significantly reducing the out-of-pocket expense for customers at the point of sale, which for subprime customers has a high correlation with early life involuntary churn. 
Another lesser impact was due to higher customer balances. As we have steadily increased ARPU throughout the year, we have seen some increase in customers churning, because they are unable to make their monthly payments. This is the expected impact of the strong ARPU growth we have seen, and with these increases and ongoing customer revenues, we understood we would see some negative impact to customer churn. However, as expected, the strong ongoing revenue growth of the subscriber base more than offsets this impact.
So let me be clear. While we are experiencing some temporary impact to our involuntary churn due to the actions taken in the second and third quarters and due to our extraordinary ARPU growth, we believe the underlying fundamentals of our business are extremely sound, and we expect them to continue to improve. Our voluntary churn is the lowest since 2005, and we expect to see involuntary churn improve after Q1 once the impact of these items has had the time to move through our subscriber base. 
Going forward, we expect the launch of the iPhone will continue to have a positive impact on our core Sprint platform postpaid churn. This benefit will happen over time as our customers hit their upgrade eligibility and the iPhone becomes available to them. As Dan mentioned, ahead of the iPhone launch, we strategically standardized the term of upgrade eligibility for 20 months, and we increased smartphone early termination fees in order to smooth the impact of upgrades and reduce the financial impact of the iPhone investment. This means that the churn benefits of the iPhone will layer in over time but also, that the profitability profile of our broader customer base should be improved as changes to ETFs and upgrade eligibility have been applied to many other devices, not just the iPhone.
The company's total postpaid net adds for the quarter were 161,000, comprised of 539,000 Sprint platform postpaid net adds, which included approximately 168,000 customers recaptured from the Nextel platform. This was offset by a net loss of 378,000 postpaid customers on the Nextel platform. We expect this negative trend on the Nextel platform to continue and to accelerate throughout 2012 as we commence decommissioning of the Nextel network and work to recapture customers on our core Sprint platform.
Concurrent with the strong postpaid subscriber growth we have seen on our core Sprint platform, we have also been very successful in growing our Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU is now over $61, which is 6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 due largely to the adoption of our $10 premium data smartphone charge. 86% of postpaid Sprint platform handset sales in the fourth quarter were smartphones. And the Sprint platform postpaid handset base penetration has now reached 66%, which means we expect to continue to see additional ARPU improvement in our core Sprint platform postpaid business throughout 2012.
Moving on to Slide 24. Prepaid ARPU for the full year 2011 was over $27, which was 1% lower than for the full year 2010. While total prepaid ARPU for 2011 was lower, the prepaid business had strong ARPU growth throughout the year on the Boost and Virgin Beyond Talk brands, offset by the growing mix of Assurance customers, which while lower in ARPU, have a very favorable churn and profitability profile. Boost, in particular, had very strong ARPU growth of 5% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. 
One of the most positive trends in the prepaid business is our very strong results in prepaid churn. In the fourth quarter for 2011, total prepaid churn was 3.68% compared to 4.93% in the fourth quarter of 2010. While the growing mix of Assurance customers helps to keep our total prepaid churn rate low, it was not the biggest factor in the year-over-year decline in rate. Larger impacts were due to year-over-year rate reductions in both the Boost and the Virgin brands due to the shift from the Nextel platform to the Sprint platform on Boost and the shift from ""pay by the minute"" customers to monthly smartphone customers on Virgin. The prepaid business has been a strong and important growth mechanism for our company, and we expect to continue to show growth in subscribers and revenues in our prepaid business in the coming year.
We have also seen very strong growth during the year in our wholesale business. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we had 954,000 wholesale and affiliate net adds, which is a 143% growth from the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 14% sequential increase. This very strong growth in the fourth quarter was fueled by prepaid MVNO agreements made in 2011, which represents profitable growth for Sprint with little to no upfront investment. 
Let's move on to wireless expenses on Slide 25. Sprint platform variable network expenses, which consists of roaming, long distance, backhaul and premium service expense, were $845 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and were up approximately 20% over the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase is due to an increase in 3G and particularly, 4G roaming costs. 3G roaming costs in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $215 million, up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2010. 3G roaming cost increases are primary the result of the growth in the number of Sprint platform postpaid customers, the growth of data usage by our customer base and our strategic decision over the past 4 years to decrease our capital spending on legacy network improvements in order to reserve investment dollars for Network Vision. 
4G WiMAX roaming costs in the fourth quarter were $162 million, up more than 500% from just the $26 million versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Because of the launch of Network Vision, our 2012 3G roaming expenses are expected to be capped at 2011 levels. As a result of the Clearwire agreements we announced in the fourth quarter, we now have cost certainty on our quarterly 4G roaming expense, which will decrease by approximately 25% from our 4Q exiting expense to Q1 and is expected to remain constant for the year. Despite these increases to roaming cost in the current period and because of our strong Sprint platform ARPU
growth, we have been able to maintain stable variable network margins on the Sprint platform. With cost certainty on our WiMax-related 4G expenses in the next couple of years as well as significant 3G roaming savings as we light up Network Vision markets, we believe we have a clear pathway to margin improvement as we execute on our network improvement plan.
Total wireless cost of service in the fourth quarter was $2.3 billion, a $41 million or 2% improvement sequentially, due largely to seasonally lower data roaming cost and lower service and repair cost. Of our total cost of service in the fourth quarter, approximately $352 million or 15% were network costs related to Nextel platform, which we expect will be eliminated upon the completion of Network Vision. Total wireless subsidy expense increased $540 million or 46% from the fourth quarter of 2010 and $561 million or 48% sequentially. Approximately 20% of the sequential increase was due to higher volumes and approximately 80% of the sequential increase was rate related, largely associated with the launch of the iPhone. While the upfront investment in the iPhone is substantial, we expect that these customers will produce a strong return on investment in the later years. 
Wireless selling general and administrative cost increased $136 million sequentially and $65 million over the fourth quarter of 2010. The sequential increase was largely associated with a $76 million higher cost in sales, $75 million of which was in new expense in the sales line due to reimbursements for point-of-sale discounts for iPhone, which are directly sourced by distributors, being accounted for as a sales expense. These kinds of handset discounts were not directly sourced by the retailer, are recognized as subsidy. 
For the full year 2011, wireless SG&A increased by $257 million, due largely to an increase in selling expense as a result of higher postpaid and prepaid gross adds as well as the direct-sourced iPhone sales costs. This was offset by a $120 million decrease in customer care cost, which we have been able to streamline even as we've been making huge strides in the quality of our service. While total wireless SG&A has increased year-over-year, wireless SG&A, as a percent of revenue, has improved 100 basis points even with higher variable cost associated with higher volumes, reflecting our continued strong cost discipline.
Wireless adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter was $668 million, which was $546 million lower than the third quarter and $378 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the estimated impacts of the iPhone and Network Vision, pro forma wireless segment adjusted OIBDA improved sequentially by 8% and showed year-over-year improvement of $306 million or 29%. Pro forma wireless adjusted OIBDA margins, excluding the impact of the iPhone and Network Vision, were 19.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 16% in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Wireline OIBDA in the fourth quarter declined $89 million or 33% from the fourth quarter of 2010 and $290 million or 27% for the full year 2010. Approximately 78% of the wireline OIBDA decrease is due to a decline in revenues related to resetting of our intercompany transfer rate to reflect current market prices at the beginning of 2011, which is neutral at the consolidated level. Wireline OIBDA in 2012 is expected to decline by approximately $350 million. Approximately $180 million to $220 million of this decline is expected to be due to intercompany rate changes, which are neutral to consolidated OIBDA and approximately $70 million to $80 million is related to cable, Voice over IP migrations.
Moving on to cash and liquidity on Slide 26. We ended the fourth quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $6.7 billion, including $5.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolver. During the quarter, we raised approximately $4 billion in private placement, including $1 billion of 11.5% unsecured notes due in 2021 and approximately $3 billion of 9% guaranteed Notes due in 2018. The proceeds of these notes significantly enhanced our liquidity position, allowing us to pay down $2.25 billion of notes due in March 2012 ahead of schedule. Our next loan maturity totaling $300 million is due in May of 2013, followed by a $1.5 billion maturity in the fourth quarter of 2013.
We believe we have a clear runway to allow us to continue the investments in the iPhone and in Network Vision. I previously gave you guidance that we would be raising approximately $5 billion to $7 billion, excluding the Clearwire investment we announced in Q4, and this remains our intention. Our discussions regarding vendor financing are progressing well with all of our vendors. It is a time-consuming process because it involves multiple parties, but we are pleased with our progress to date. Our continued expectation is that we will have an agreement in place before the end of the second quarter. In the meantime, we continue to watch the debt markets, and we will be opportunistic with our options.
Our accrued capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest of $109 million and including $370 million of Network Vision capital, were $900 million in the fourth quarter compared to $760 million in the third quarter and $608 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Total capital expense for the full year 2011 were approximately $2.9 billion, which includes $590 million in capital expenses related to Network Vision. 
Re-banding spend for the calendar year 2011 was approximately $123 million, net of $135 million MSS settlement from Dish, TerreStar. Inclusive of this settlement, total spend on the re-banding project to date has been approximately $2.95 billion. We estimate that we have approximately $600 million to $700 million of re-banding work remaining expected to be split between 2012 and 2013 and with the possibility of going into 2014 depending on the timing of the Mexican re-banding plan. 
Free cash flow was $257 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to negative $273 million in the third quarter of 2011 and to $913 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The year-over-year decrease in free cash flow is primarily associated with lower OIBDA and higher capital expenditures. Free cash flow sequentially impaved -- improvement of $530 million was primarily associated with the sequential decline in working capital of $1 billion, primarily associated with the timing of vendor payments and lower accrued dealer commissions and rebate reserves as we wound down our instant rebate promotions in our retail stores during Q3. Free cash flow in Q4 also benefited from the onetime payment of $135 million for the MSS settlement.
Finally, I want to outline our expectations for 2012. Total adjusted OIBDA for the full year 2012 is expected to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, including the impact of the iPhone and approximately $1.1 billion of dilution associated with Network Vision. To achieve this, we expect total net service revenue growth of approximately 4% to 6%. 
With the Network Vision project ramping up, the quarterly timing of OIBDA is expected to be somewhat fluid. However, our expectation is that OIBDA in the first half of the year will be slightly lower than in the second half. In general, our quarterly OIBDA will also be affected by the timing of the launch of any subsequent versions of the iPhone the expectation is that our OIBDA trough will be u-shaped through 2012 and then will start to ramp in 2013 followed by strong margin expansion in 2014. 
As we've discussed previously, we expect that 2012 will be an aggressive investment year with regard to capital expenditures as we pursue a rapid and efficient execution of Network Vision. Total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $6 billion, excluding capitalized interest. In addition, based on the plans outlined by Steve earlier, in the first quarter of 2012, we have revised our estimates of the expected useful life of certain Nextel platform assets through the end of 2013. 
Accordingly, approximately $2 billion in net book value of these assets is expected to be accelerated through depreciation expense, of which a disproportionate amount is expected to be recognized during 2012. The exact timing of the acceleration is dependent upon when the assets are expected to be phased out of service. These estimates are derived from our internal decommissioning plan, which is still evolving. We estimate the incremental effect of accelerated depreciation related to Nextel assets in our 2012 results to be in the range of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, of which approximately $450 million to $550 million will be recognized in the first quarter of 2012. We will continue to update you on these amounts quarterly as we refine our plans for Nextel decommissioning.
I want to end by reiterating my confidence in the strength of our core underlying business and in the pathway we believe we have created to future OIBDA growth and margin expansion. We are confident in the steps we are taking to improve our profitability and in our ability to execute on our strategic plan. The entire management team has a sharp focus on execution and profitability through the next few quarters of investment, and we are excited about the future. 
I want to thank you for all your support, and I'll turn the call over back to Brad for Q&A."

You went through a lot of the operational progress for Sprint, but can you talk more about where Sprint is positioned strategically? With T-Mobile still in the market, cable choosing to work with Verizon, it seems like you have some real competition to go after the remaining partners through a spectrum capital or both. So can you just put in perspective for us what Sprint is doing to put the company in the best position to either partner or by spectrum as you move forward over the next 12 to 24 months?"

This will be the year that we really begin -- it already has begun but much more aggressive active migration of customers off of the iDEN platform. So what you're going to expect is continued strong performance in growth on the Sprint platform. That momentum will continue, but you'll see larger than historical declines on the iDEN platform as we start working toward -- we're going to be decommissioning iDEN cell sites during the year, which will save money, and we'll be overtly proactively migrating customers off the iDEN platform. So you'll see, if you will, iDEN platform churn go up. So you've really -- like what we've been describing today, you have these -- we fuel these 3 buckets at Sprint. You've got a very healthy strong growing Sprint platform, and you have, if you will, declines on -- year-over-year on the wireline and on the iDEN platform or Nextel platform side. And those declines on the Nextel platform side will accelerate in '13 as we aggressively begin the migration efforts."

So it sounds like there's quite a bit of work to do in 2013. But Joe, it sounds like you're expecting kind of the benefits to start coming through in 2013 even though the bulk of the work is still being done. I wonder if you guys could just kind of tie out the thought about how to think about Vision pacing and spending and how it all ties with guidance. And I think if I could just -- the second question, Joe. In the fourth quarter, you did a lot of work to try to pull out the Vision spend and the iPhone subsidies. It looked like something clearly had changed in the underlying cost structure of the company in 4Q versus 3Q, and I was wondering if you could talk about what levers got pulled to try and get the margins where they were net of those things."

So that's why the pacing is as it is in '12. But also, we will be decommissioning, as I said, 9,600 sites this year from our Nextel platform and getting the associated benefit in utilities and maintenance and certain amount of rent also in '12. So we're going to see good benefits starting to accrue this year, and we'll also improve in 2013 as a lot of our sites begin to go on air as well in 2013. Hopefully, that helps."

I think as far as the churn is concerned on the postpaid side, what -- and this, again, is really Sprint platform -- that we described is we saw some impact, as we mentioned, in Q3 involuntary that continuing, if you will, increasing in Q4 and then in Q1, and then we would expect to see that begin to lower. You asked a question about credit. We tightened credit in Q3 and in Q4 after we saw what was going on in the channels. So we have taken actions in that regard. With respect to the iPhone and churn, that obviously is a very important element of we call it the overall profitability of the iPhone, the customer lifetime value, and we won't see that over time. What we've seen early on in terms of the profitability metrics are, first of all, a very high gross add percentage. The other thing from a churn perspective is, again, you have lifetime churn, but you also see, historically, what happens to Sprint voluntary churn in the quarters where iPhones are launched. And in each of the previous 5 quarters where -- when iPhones have been launched, our voluntary churn has gone in the wrong direction. And so this quarter, this past quarter, is the first quarter of the 6 quarters where the new iPhone has been launched, where we've seen both a sequential and a year-over-year improvement in voluntary churn. So early on, we definitely are seeing those churn characteristics. The other thing I would say is that from a cost to service perspective, not only are we seeing lower usage of the network on iPhone and Android, so our business case is continuing to perform there, but our calls to care, early on -- again, it's only the first few months -- is lower than it's been for any of our high-end devices in the early months. So if you will, our operating costs are also looking good in terms of the investment and compared to our business case. So -- and again, the last piece on the iPhone is we also sold more of them than our initial plans had indicated as well, 1.8 million. So we see, at least early on, no reason to be concerned at all about our volume commitments, which has come up on previous calls. So we feel good about the early indications of the iPhone, especially the 40% gross add number, which is almost 2x the rate that we've seen on the other 2 major carriers."

In addition, what we did in the later part of the year and that we will continue that discipline in 2012 is be selective in terms of we'll call it customer outreach on upgrades. That has traditionally been a way that we keep churn low, is to get customers to sign new 2-year contracts. But our customers on contract is at a very strong level compared to historical levels, so we feel good about that. So you're exactly right. There's a discipline associated with upgrades, and that's another reason why 40% gross add mix on the iPhone is good to see.

But what we saw in Q4 of 2011 was unusual even by traditional seasonality's history in that. Generally, you just don't see any discounting on iPhones, and we saw it be very common in both Verizon and AT&T to see $30 per device and up discounts from the -- if you will, the normal pricing, the $200 or the $100 or what have you. They would be, if you will, $170 and $70 instead, and that was unusual. We saw some 4G LTE devices at very low rates that we wouldn't -- that we don't normally see.

A lot of customers that currently use that use the -- if you will, the Clearwire or the WiMAX platform, and we'll continue to market and sell devices this year that operate on that platform. And as you know, what really distinguishes Sprint as well is the fact that our pricing for handsets is unlimited. It's not unlimited on data cards or on mobile hotspots, but it is on handsets. So this -- the pricing arrangement that we have with Clearwire is very helpful in that regard, that clarity, that assurety, that ability for us to continue that offer with these devices for the next couple of years. Our focus with Clearwire, really, going forward in terms of handsets and technologies has to do with LTE-TD, which they've announced that they'll be putting into their networks. So expect -- we hope, again, these things are fluid. But probably, in the 2013 timeframe, you'd begin to see devices that we'll start offering that will work on Clearwire's new LTE network that they will begin to build in 2013. So we would be, if you will, using Clearwire's WiMAX network for a number of years as we have a lot of devices that are out there, but we'll begin introducing, in '13, devices on the new LTE network that will utilize that capability that Clearwire will be bringing to market. So we have a mix of those over time. And yes, that was all, if you will, considered as we built our OIBDA plan for '12 and going forward. But the big element, as what Joe mentioned in his remarks, was, if you will, both a reduction and a de-risking, if you will, the roaming expenses associated with Clearwire's 4G service in 2012, because it's a fixed amount.

Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 and when filed, Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation.
Turning to Slide 4, with today's earnings release, we are providing a number of new disclosures related to our network platforms. We are providing this new disclosure to give you a better understanding of the underlying trends of our operations and the growth of our core Sprint platform business. In our disclosure and throughout today's call, Nextel platform refers to our iDEN business, which we’ll begin decommissioning in 2012 and Sprint platform refers to our core ongoing business, which includes CDMA, WiMAX, LTE and other network technologies.
Let's move to earnings per share on Slide 5. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the fourth quarter were $0.43 compared to $0.10 in the third quarter and $0.31 in the year-ago period. Basic and diluted loss per common share for the full year 2011 were $0.96 compared to $1.16 in the full year 2010. The loss per share increased as compared to the third quarter partly due to drivers that also impacted the sequential change in adjusted OIBDA, which Joe will discuss in more detail later on the call. In addition, loss per share increased sequentially due to higher equity losses in unconsolidated investments and other, as well as higher net tax expense. The current period net loss per share includes $0.04 pretax loss per share related to an impairment of our holding in Clearwire as well as $0.03 pretax loss per share related to the impairment of certain network assets related to Network Vision. The fourth quarter net loss per share also included a $0.01 pretax loss per share impact due to severance costs.
We recorded a net tax expense of $106 million in 4Q '11, which included $6 million related to changes in corporate income tax laws enacted in the quarter. For the full year 2012, we expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. Also, please keep in mind that Clearwire's fourth quarter 2011 results from operations have not yet been finalized. Please refer to the press release and our form 10-K, when it is filed, for additional detail. 
I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

Sprint has shown continued momentum in recent quarters, and Q4 is no exception. Before I recap our overall performance in 2011 in the context of our broader turnaround effort, let me take a moment and touch on some of the key highlights from the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. I am pleased to report today that we had a very successful launch of the iPhone, with total activations in the quarter of over 1.8 million, above our expectations. 40% of those activations were new customers to Sprint, a proof point of the renewed strength of the Sprint brand. I'm also pleased to report today a year-over-year growth of $3.69 in our Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate, which is the largest increase on record in U.S. wireless industry history. This historic ARPU growth was achieved in the same quarter that we delivered our best postpaid voluntary churn number for any quarter since 2005 and in which we also delivered our highest postpaid gross add volume for any quarter in 4 years. 
As you know, voluntary churn is churn based on the customers' choice, churn determined by the strength of the brand, the customer experience and comparative pricing. To improve postpaid churn in 2011 more than any major U.S. carrier and delivering the best annual postpaid churn in Sprint history while simultaneously increasing prices to an extent that delivered industry record-breaking ARPU in the same year is nothing short of remarkable.
The significant upfront costs associated with the introduction of the iPhone in the beginning of the ramp-up in Network Vision operating expense lowered adjusted OIBDA below historical levels, but the $842 million of adjusted OIBDA in the quarter topped the high end of our forecast and analyst estimates. This marked the third time in 2011 that quarterly OIBDA exceeded Street consensus estimates and, on a pro forma basis, full year 2011 adjusted OIBDA topped analyst consensus by over 5%.
Finally, I'm also pleased to announce continued progress on our Network Vision deployment. Today we're adding Baltimore and Kansas City to the list of cities that are expected to have Sprint LTE service plus improved 3G service by the middle of this year, bringing the major cities to be launched by midyear to 6. 
As we closed the fourth quarter of 2011, I completed my fourth year at Sprint. I told you on my first call that our turnaround would be difficult and not quick. Although we're far from finished, our progress, nevertheless, has been very significant. 2011 caps what I would consider the first phase of our turnaround, the recovery and strengthening of the business to the point that we're ready to enter the second phase in 2012, investment for future growth. I will organize the balance of my remarks today, as usual, around our 3 unchanging priorities: improving the customer experience, strengthening the brand and generating cash.  Given our special focus on OIBDA and cash generation, I'm going to change the order today, however, and start with cash. Please turn to Slide 8. 
We maintained our strong liquidity position by generating $275 million of positive free cash flow for the quarter in addition to raising $4 billion of cash through our recent debt offerings. Joe will provide more details on the impacts of Network Vision and iPhone on this quarter's OIBDA. But absent the estimated impacts of these 2 investments and excluding 2006, which had a onetime blip associated with adding the first year of full year Nextel results, 2011 full year pro forma OIBDA performance reflects year-over-year improvement for the first time in 7 years. The growth in our core Sprint platform business finally overtook the declines on the Nextel platform and wireline. 
Driven by strength in postpaid ARPU, Q4 represents our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in total operating revenues, and the 4.7% growth from Q3 to Q4 represents our largest sequential increase in over 5 years. As mentioned, the Sprint platform postpaid ARPU increase of $3.69 for the fourth quarter of 2010 is the largest quarterly year-over-year improvement on record for the U.S. wireless industry.
Please turn to Slide 9. 2011 culminates the efforts of our cash strategy over the last 4 years as we prepared for the investment that lies ahead with Network Vision. We focused first, from 2008 to 2010, on slowing down the subscriber and top line revenue declines that followed the merger. We also focused intensely on reducing both capital and operating expenses these past 4 years. We minimized our CapEx investments in 2G and early 3G radio technology to keep our powder dry for investment in our new world-class Sprint Direct Connect service and in 4G LTE. 
Compared to our CapEx run rate in 2007, between 2008 and 2011, we saved an estimated $15 billion in capital. Even when you consider our cash investments in Clearwire and the increase in OIBDA-reducing roaming expenses we incurred over this period, which are effectively a tradeoff with our decision to spend less on 2G and 3G CapEx, we achieved estimated savings in the last 4 years of over $10 billion of cash. Whether the accountants classify $1 as OpEx or CapEx, it's all cash in our view. From 2008 to 2011, our wireless CapEx investments were approximately 1/3 the spend of Verizon, 1/3 of AT&T’s spend and 1/2 the spend of T-Mobile U.S.A. 
Additionally, compared to our run rate in 2007, our total cost of service and SG&A in 2011, excluding roaming expense and subsidy, which is really driven by competitive pricing versus spending behavior, are down by approximately $5 billion per year with G&A expenses down almost 50%, marketing and product down 32% even though we have invested more in increasing and improving Sprint retail and IT and billing expenses are down by 1/3. Over the same time period, our total labor expense is down by 33%.
A primary tool in previous years used to satisfy customers and stem churn was for our care organization to provide credits on customer bills. Not only did Sprint offer the lowest level of care credits in our history in 2011, but customer care credits have decreased by $1 billion on an annual basis since 2007. So we're not buying improvements in customer satisfaction in churn. During 2011, based on the improvements in our customer experience and in our brand, we were in a position for the first time to increase prices. We implemented an increase of $10 for our smartphone data plans in the first quarter of 2011. We also increased our other prices and fees during the year, eliminated our loyalty program and lengthened upgrade eligibility, all actions aimed at improving our OIBDA and cash generation.
Please turn to Slide 10. Improving the customer experience has been our top objective and the most important contributor to our turnaround. In the 2011 American Customer Satisfaction Index, we're the most improved U.S. company, period, across all 47 industries studied by the ACSI over the past 3 years. Sprint was in a statistical tie for first place for best overall choice by Consumer Reports in 2011, up from a distant last place in 2007 and in 2008, among major wireless carriers. Sprint was recognized 5 times in 2011 by J.D. Power and Associates, and we were recently informed that Virgin will receive the J.D. Power award for the highest customer satisfaction among non-contract brands. Boost placed second. ATLANTIC-ACM just awarded Sprint a network award for global wholesale excellence, and Frost & Sullivan just awarded Sprint the North American Customer Value Enhancement Award for the machine-to-machine space.
Our customer service organization continued their momentum to achieve customer service excellence. Sprint achieved best ever results in 2011 for customer satisfaction with customer care, customer satisfaction with repair and customer satisfaction with retail. We also achieved best ever results for the number of calls per subscriber to Care and for First Call Resolution in addition to the best ever performance in fewest care credits given, as previously mentioned.
In spite of some temporary pressure on involuntary churn, which we mentioned on last quarter's call and which Joe will describe in more detail, we continued to make steady progress on postpaid voluntary churn, which is an important indicator of customer satisfaction. 2011 represents our best ever annual total postpaid churn at 1.86%. And in Q4, we delivered our best postpaid voluntary churn performance for any quarter since 2005. Like we did in 2010, we again improved voluntary postpaid churn year-over-year in every quarter of 2011. Prepaid churn of 4.05% for the year is also best ever, and Q4 prepaid churn was Sprint's best in the last 24 quarters. Churn improved sequentially for each of our prepaid brands: Boost, Virgin and Assurance.
Turning now to brand on Slide 11. I'm very pleased to report that once again, all Sprint brand metrics or health metrics are record highs. As measured by an outside third party, most want to investigate, purchase consideration, positive brand momentum and first brand preference are all at best ever levels in 2011. In a well-known independent survey, net promoter scores again indicate Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major carriers to show improvement sequentially. And our improvement has been so significant, we have moved up 2 spots in the major carrier rankings in the past 2 years.
Perhaps Q4 2011 will be most remembered for the collapse in December of AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile U.S.A. We believe the industry outlook would have been bleak had this takeover succeeded, and we also believe that Sprint's successful championing of a healthy industry and customer choice will have lasting benefits for the way business customers and consumers view Sprint.
Please turn to Slide 12. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, our total net subscriber additions in the fourth quarter of 1.6 million are the best in 6 years, bringing our full year number to 5.1 million net adds, which is Sprint's highest number of net adds since 2001. Total customer served in the Sprint and Nextel network platforms reached 55 million at the end of 2011, yet another new all-time company record. I'm pleased to report that for the Sprint postpaid platform, 2011 is our second consecutive year of being net port positive against our competition, which means more customers switched to Sprint from our competitors than switched from Sprint to competitors. And total postpaid net adds are our best since 2006. 
Our 161,000 postpaid net adds in the quarter represent our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We entered the fourth quarter expecting an even better performance, but during the quarter we saw unprecedented discounting on devices, especially for Apple products, which we decided not to participate in. We made a conscious decision not to chase meeting our net add guidance under these unforeseen circumstances, believing it was more prudent to shoot for delivering an OIBDA result exceeding the top end of the OIBDA guidance range we had provided instead. This was a tough decision for us to make during the fourth quarter. Not only had Sprint never missed a single guidance metric in the past 4 years, but for me, personally, I had never missed one guidance number during my long career. So Sprint’s streak and my streak are now broken, but we believe we made the right decision.
Sprint's 40% iPhone gross add mix far outpaced our competitors. The gross add mix of sales is the best early indicator of long-term profitability with the iPhone, and we are pleased with the early results. We continue to believe the iPhone will bring significant value to Sprint over the long term, and early results are in line with or better than our business case assumptions.
Turning to Slide 13. In addition to success with the iPhone, we continue to see strong demand for other compelling devices, including our industry-leading portfolio of 4G devices. The Samsung Galaxy SII Epic 4G Touch not only has the longest device name in wireless industry history, but it was recently named the best Android phone by Kiplinger's Personal Finance and America's #1 smartphone by PC World. In the fourth quarter, 86% of our Sprint postpaid handset sales were smartphones, and penetration of our Sprint platform base reached 66%, both all-time highs. We also had a strong quarter and year in wholesale and in prepaid, which Joe will cover later.
Turning to Slide 14. In conclusion, we've come a long way in 4 years. Our top line is growing again. Our customer experience has gone from the worst to arguably the best in the industry, and our once battered brand is strengthening and gaining momentum. Offsetting the downward revenue and earnings pressures of a subscale wireline business and a declining business on Nextel platform, we have a vibrant growing Sprint platform that will fuel our continued growth. Since 2007, Nextel platform annual revenues are down approximately $9 billion annually, and wireline revenues are down another approximately $2 billion annually, but our Sprint platform revenues are up over $4 billion annually since 2007. 
We've exercised financial discipline in the past 4 years, including large reductions in CapEx and OpEx, to gain the financial stability to give us the confidence to begin the investment phase of our turnaround. 2011 marks not only the first annual service revenue increase but also our first positive operating income since 2006. And as mentioned, excluding the onetime events of the Nextel acquisition of last quarter's iPhone and Network Vision overlays and in spite of the continued declines associated with our Nextel platform and wireline, 2011 delivered our first sequential improvement in pro forma adjusted OIBDA in 7 years. 
Since I arrived 4 years ago, we have known we eventually needed to deal with the ever increasing cost string of running an additional 2G network. During this period, we simultaneously improved network performance but also saved every dollar possible so we can invest our money, not in the technology available in those years but in new technology not available till now. To help buy time, we launched Boost Unlimited in the first quarter of 2009 using our spare item capacity. Boost has generated $5 billion in incremental revenues on the iDEN platform since that time. We waited until network infrastructure was developed that was one, multimodal so that we could re-farm the valuable iDEN 800 megahertz frequencies; two, that could also provide an iDEN-quality push-to-talk experience on the new network, what we now call Sprint Direct Connect; and three, which was capable of providing 4G LTE service on our FD or frequency division spectrum. 
Steve Elfman will speak next to give an update on our deployment status and plans for this year, but I am pleased with our progress today. I periodically discussing Network Vision support with my CEO peers at our key partners, and I am very confident in their commitment to this effort and the significant opportunities it provides Sprint. I'm proud of the accomplishments we have made in this first phase of our turnaround, and I look forward to the call 2 years from now when we'll be looking back on the second turnaround phase or investment phase, the successful deployment of Network Vision and looking forward to Phase 3, the margin expansion, which will follow. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve to discuss our Network Vision progress. Steve?"

We are pleased with the progress of Network Vision, which continues to be on schedule and on budget. In fact, as Dan mentioned, I'm pleased that we announced today the launch of our fifth and sixth major cities, Ka",865,"Thank you, Dan, and turning to Slide 16. We are pleased with the progress of Network Vision, which continues to be on schedule and on budget. In fact, as Dan mentioned, I'm pleased that we announced today the launch of our fifth and sixth major cities, Kansas City and Baltimore by midyear 2012. 
I want to remind you of the objective of Network Vision and then discuss our progress and some milestones. Network Vision is expected to allow us to achieve several key objectives. First, we expect to greatly improve our cost structure through the consolidation of our networks as well as improving the coverage within our 3G footprint and reducing our in-footprint roaming expenses. Second, we expect the program will allow us to optimize our spectrum assets through the redeployment of our 800 spectrum to both 3G and ultimately, 4G LTE, which is expected to improve the performance of our network and improve customer experience. Third, our multimodal technology is both more cost effective and provides the flexibility to enable spectrum hosting. Lastly, through the implementation of new PTT, push-to-talk technology and devices on the Sprint platform, we can maintain our leadership and eliminate the Nextel platform.
Turning to Slide 17. We're excited about the improvements to the customers' experience and the technological flexibility that Network Vision is expected to produce, but the greatest advantage to the company and to our shareholders is the expected financial benefits. The project should finally remove some of the duplicative fixed costs that come with running 2 wireless networks. We expect to reduce our total tower position by more than 44%, from approximately 68,000 towers down to 38,000 towers and at the same time, greatly reduce both 3G and 4G roaming costs. The consolidation is not only expected to improve our operating cost, it should also significantly improve Sprint's carbon footprint, reinforcing that Sprint's commitment to our green initiative is integral to cost efficiency. And Network Vision is expected to improve our capital efficiency, reducing our per-unit cost of both gigabytes and minutes by approximately 50%.
I also want to remind everyone of the high degree of cost certainty we have written into our vendor contracts to support Network Vision. Essentially, all labor and execution costs in our contracts are predetermined. In other words, the majority of the expense risk associated with getting the bill done lies with our vendors, and our only exposure to additional costs are scope changes.
Turning to Slide 17. So where are we? We are on track with our 2012 goals for deployment, and things are going very well. We have executed against all of our major 3G and 4G technical milestones. The detailed deployment and resource plans have been completed by our 3 vendors, and they have been staffing up to meet the build-out demand. We are well underway on leasing, zoning and tower construction on our 38,000 sites with the goal of having 12,000 higher-density sites on air by the end of this year. In addition, we expect that approximately 9,600 Nextel platform sites will be decommissioned by the end of 2012. We continue to expect that the build will be largely completed by the end of 2013 with some overflow of smaller markets in the first half of 2014.
During the first -- fourth quarter, our first true multimodal permanent site went on air, and the first cluster of cell sites launched in Kankakee, Illinois. And they are meeting our performance and coverage targets. The development and deployment is proceeding within our budget targets. Our agreements with the major tower companies were finalized in Q4. In January, we announced 4 major markets scheduled to launch LTE by midyear, to which we added 2 more today. In addition, we announced our first 3 LTE devices, which are coming by midyear 2012. And we have been launching phones that are ""800 Band Class 10"" compatible since the middle of last year. This means that as we redeploy our 800 spectrum, many of our 3G customers should get an immediate and very noticeable benefit. 
And in the fourth quarter, we launched our Sprint Direct Connect product, including 3 new phones, on the Sprint platform, which we are confident is the best push-to-talk product that is available in the market today and is central to our customer recapture strategy as we decommission the Nextel platform. And while people are focused on build-out of LTE, it is -- it's important to remember that every site we build is expected to provide immediate improvement in the network experience for all our customers and roaming cost reduction for Sprint. 
Going forward, in 2012, we plan to provide an update each quarter on cell sites on air, sites decommissioned on the Nextel platform and any significant build milestones. My entire team and I and our 3 vendors have a strong focus on cost containment and capital efficiency, and we'll continue to drive the program forward to remain on schedule and on budget. And I look forward to updating you next quarter with milestones achieved and new markets in the build plan. 
Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Joe to review our detailed financial results."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Dan outlined, the past 4 years, culminating with 2011, have been years of recovery and which Sprint has worked hard to put in place the operational and financial improvements",3530,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As Dan outlined, the past 4 years, culminating with 2011, have been years of recovery and which Sprint has worked hard to put in place the operational and financial improvements we needed to support our next phase of investment. The recovery effort has been very successful. In a highly competitive market, these successes were hard won and do not come without a huge amount of work and ingenuity. We have effectively turned our core business around, producing the financial and operational stability and now allows us to invest for future OIBDA growth and margin expansion. 
I will go through the detailed Q4 results in a moment, but first, I want to discuss how we are looking at 2012. As 2011 was a year of continued year-over-year improvement, 2012 will be a year of even greater focus on the bottom line. We expect to continue to grow the customer base in our core business on the Sprint platform while focusing on hitting our bottom line numbers as we invest in network architecture, which we expect will be the foundation of future margin expansion. We will provide additional visibility into our key metrics in 2012 to give you more detailed information on the operational components of our business. With the launch of the iPhone, the implementation of Network Vision and the thinning of the Nextel network, we have a lot of moving parts, and we want to give you more tools to understand the underlying dynamics of our business. This commitment is reflected in the new disclosures we have provided today. With that, I will review the fourth quarter and full year 2011 results.
Total service revenue for the fourth quarter were $7.8 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 5% for the fourth quarter of 2010. The growth of our total net service revenues is primarily due to the growth in postpaid subscribers and ARPU on the Sprint platform and as well as the strong growth of prepaid subscribers on the Sprint platform, partially offset by declines in our Nextel platform postpaid and prepaid subscriber basis and Nextel platform postpaid ARPU as well as wireline revenues. 
In the full year 2011, wireline revenues declined by approximately $714 million, and revenues from the Nextel platform declined by almost $2 billion, which means that service revenues from our core ongoing Sprint platform wireless business grew by nearly $3.5 billion or 17%. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter was $842 million, which includes approximately $54 million in Network Vision-related expenses and an estimated $630 million in net OIBDA impact related to the launch of the iPhone. In order to provide appropriate comparables to our numbers, we have estimated the incremental impact of the iPhone launch to our adjusted OIBDA results for the fourth quarter. The estimate of $630 million includes only the cost of estimated incremental gross adds and upgrades as well as the subsidy rate variance resulting from the mix shift from other handsets and backs out the estimated incremental revenue benefit that comes from additional customers.
Going forward, it will become increasingly difficult to estimate the incremental impact as the iPhone becomes an integrated part of our handset sales. Thus, in the future, we will only provide the total impact of the iPhone on the quarter and will not attempt to estimate the incremental impact. Excluding the estimated $684 million of Network Vision and iPhone cost in Q4, pro forma adjusted OIBDA was over $1.5 billion, up $211 million or 16% year-over-year and up $89 million or 6% sequentially. Excluding these investments, consolidated pro forma adjusted OIBDA margin was 19.6% of net service revenues, a 100-basis-point sequential improvement and a 200-basis-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010.
Now let's turn to Slide 23 and discuss our wireless results in more detail. Total wireless service revenues for the fourth quarter were $7 billion, which is a 2% sequential increase and a 7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the revenues from the Nextel platform, fourth quarter wireless service revenues from our core Sprint platform were $6.2 billion, up $207 million or 3% sequentially and up $912 million or 17% over the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Dan has taken you through the trajectory of our very strong subscriber improvements over the past year and historically, and now I'd like to review our Q4 results in more detail.
Total company postpaid gross adds for the fourth quarter were just over 2.1 million, a 275,000 improvement sequentially and a 213,000 or 11% improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010. Total postpaid churn was 1.98%, which was 7 basis points higher than the third quarter and 12 basis points higher than the same period a year ago. As Dan mentioned, postpaid voluntary churn was at its best level for any quarter since 2005, so over 100% of the churn increase is involuntary churn. 
The vast majority of the increase in involuntary churn was due to 2 related items. First, in the second and third quarters, some of our indirect partners self funded the retail price points of certain handsets down to 0. We tightened our credit standards during the third and fourth quarters to stem further impacts of these types of promotional activity. In the second and third quarters, we also launched an instant rebate promotion in the direct channel. While these actions were taken separately and attracted both prime and subprime customers, they both had the effect of significantly reducing the out-of-pocket expense for customers at the point of sale, which for subprime customers has a high correlation with early life involuntary churn. 
Another lesser impact was due to higher customer balances. As we have steadily increased ARPU throughout the year, we have seen some increase in customers churning, because they are unable to make their monthly payments. This is the expected impact of the strong ARPU growth we have seen, and with these increases and ongoing customer revenues, we understood we would see some negative impact to customer churn. However, as expected, the strong ongoing revenue growth of the subscriber base more than offsets this impact.
So let me be clear. While we are experiencing some temporary impact to our involuntary churn due to the actions taken in the second and third quarters and due to our extraordinary ARPU growth, we believe the underlying fundamentals of our business are extremely sound, and we expect them to continue to improve. Our voluntary churn is the lowest since 2005, and we expect to see involuntary churn improve after Q1 once the impact of these items has had the time to move through our subscriber base. 
Going forward, we expect the launch of the iPhone will continue to have a positive impact on our core Sprint platform postpaid churn. This benefit will happen over time as our customers hit their upgrade eligibility and the iPhone becomes available to them. As Dan mentioned, ahead of the iPhone launch, we strategically standardized the term of upgrade eligibility for 20 months, and we increased smartphone early termination fees in order to smooth the impact of upgrades and reduce the financial impact of the iPhone investment. This means that the churn benefits of the iPhone will layer in over time but also, that the profitability profile of our broader customer base should be improved as changes to ETFs and upgrade eligibility have been applied to many other devices, not just the iPhone.
The company's total postpaid net adds for the quarter were 161,000, comprised of 539,000 Sprint platform postpaid net adds, which included approximately 168,000 customers recaptured from the Nextel platform. This was offset by a net loss of 378,000 postpaid customers on the Nextel platform. We expect this negative trend on the Nextel platform to continue and to accelerate throughout 2012 as we commence decommissioning of the Nextel network and work to recapture customers on our core Sprint platform.
Concurrent with the strong postpaid subscriber growth we have seen on our core Sprint platform, we have also been very successful in growing our Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU is now over $61, which is 6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2010 due largely to the adoption of our $10 premium data smartphone charge. 86% of postpaid Sprint platform handset sales in the fourth quarter were smartphones. And the Sprint platform postpaid handset base penetration has now reached 66%, which means we expect to continue to see additional ARPU improvement in our core Sprint platform postpaid business throughout 2012.
Moving on to Slide 24. Prepaid ARPU for the full year 2011 was over $27, which was 1% lower than for the full year 2010. While total prepaid ARPU for 2011 was lower, the prepaid business had strong ARPU growth throughout the year on the Boost and Virgin Beyond Talk brands, offset by the growing mix of Assurance customers, which while lower in ARPU, have a very favorable churn and profitability profile. Boost, in particular, had very strong ARPU growth of 5% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. 
One of the most positive trends in the prepaid business is our very strong results in prepaid churn. In the fourth quarter for 2011, total prepaid churn was 3.68% compared to 4.93% in the fourth quarter of 2010. While the growing mix of Assurance customers helps to keep our total prepaid churn rate low, it was not the biggest factor in the year-over-year decline in rate. Larger impacts were due to year-over-year rate reductions in both the Boost and the Virgin brands due to the shift from the Nextel platform to the Sprint platform on Boost and the shift from ""pay by the minute"" customers to monthly smartphone customers on Virgin. The prepaid business has been a strong and important growth mechanism for our company, and we expect to continue to show growth in subscribers and revenues in our prepaid business in the coming year.
We have also seen very strong growth during the year in our wholesale business. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we had 954,000 wholesale and affiliate net adds, which is a 143% growth from the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 14% sequential increase. This very strong growth in the fourth quarter was fueled by prepaid MVNO agreements made in 2011, which represents profitable growth for Sprint with little to no upfront investment. 
Let's move on to wireless expenses on Slide 25. Sprint platform variable network expenses, which consists of roaming, long distance, backhaul and premium service expense, were $845 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and were up approximately 20% over the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase is due to an increase in 3G and particularly, 4G roaming costs. 3G roaming costs in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $215 million, up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2010. 3G roaming cost increases are primary the result of the growth in the number of Sprint platform postpaid customers, the growth of data usage by our customer base and our strategic decision over the past 4 years to decrease our capital spending on legacy network improvements in order to reserve investment dollars for Network Vision. 
4G WiMAX roaming costs in the fourth quarter were $162 million, up more than 500% from just the $26 million versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Because of the launch of Network Vision, our 2012 3G roaming expenses are expected to be capped at 2011 levels. As a result of the Clearwire agreements we announced in the fourth quarter, we now have cost certainty on our quarterly 4G roaming expense, which will decrease by approximately 25% from our 4Q exiting expense to Q1 and is expected to remain constant for the year. Despite these increases to roaming cost in the current period and because of our strong Sprint platform ARPU growth, we have been able to maintain stable variable network margins on the Sprint platform. With cost certainty on our WiMax-related 4G expenses in the next couple of years as well as significant 3G roaming savings as we light up Network Vision markets, we believe we have a clear pathway to margin improvement as we execute on our network improvement plans.
Total wireless cost of service in the fourth quarter was $2.3 billion, a $41 million or 2% improvement sequentially, due largely to seasonally lower data roaming cost and lower service and repair cost. Of our total cost of service in the fourth quarter, approximately $352 million or 15% were network costs related to Nextel platform, which we expect will be eliminated upon the completion of Network Vision. Total wireless subsidy expense increased $540 million or 46% from the fourth quarter of 2010 and $561 million or 48% sequentially. Approximately 20% of the sequential increase was due to higher volumes and approximately 80% of the sequential increase was rate related, largely associated with the launch of the iPhone. While the upfront investment in the iPhone is substantial, we expect that these customers will produce a strong return on investment in the later years. 
Wireless selling general and administrative cost increased $136 million sequentially and $65 million over the fourth quarter of 2010. The sequential increase was largely associated with a $76 million higher cost in sales, $75 million of which was in new expense in the sales line due to reimbursements for point-of-sale discounts for iPhone, which are directly sourced by distributors, being accounted for as a sales expense. These kinds of handset discounts were not directly sourced by the retailer, are recognized as subsidy. 
For the full year 2011, wireless SG&A increased by $257 million, due largely to an increase in selling expense as a result of higher postpaid and prepaid gross adds as well as the direct-sourced iPhone sales costs. This was offset by a $120 million decrease in customer care cost, which we have been able to streamline even as we've been making huge strides in the quality of our service. While total wireless SG&A has increased year-over-year, wireless SG&A, as a percent of revenue, has improved 100 basis points even with higher variable cost associated with higher volumes, reflecting our continued strong cost discipline.
Wireless adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter was $668 million, which was $546 million lower than the third quarter and $378 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the estimated impacts of the iPhone and Network Vision, pro forma wireless segment adjusted OIBDA improved sequentially by 8% and showed year-over-year improvement of $306 million or 29%. Pro forma wireless adjusted OIBDA margins, excluding the impact of the iPhone and Network Vision, were 19.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 16% in the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Wireline OIBDA in the fourth quarter declined $89 million or 33% from the fourth quarter of 2010 and $290 million or 27% for the full year 2010. Approximately 78% of the wireline OIBDA decrease is due to a decline in revenues related to resetting of our intercompany transfer rate to reflect current market prices at the beginning of 2011, which is neutral at the consolidated level. Wireline OIBDA in 2012 is expected to decline by approximately $350 million. Approximately $180 million to $220 million of this decline is expected to be due to intercompany rate changes, which are neutral to consolidated OIBDA and approximately $70 million to $80 million is related to cable, Voice over IP migrations.
Moving on to cash and liquidity on Slide 26. We ended the fourth quarter with a total liquidity position of approximately $6.7 billion, including $5.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.1 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolver. During the quarter, we raised approximately $4 billion through private placement, including $1 billion of 11.5% unsecured notes due in 2021 and approximately $3 billion of 9% guaranteed Notes due in 2018. The proceeds of these notes significantly enhanced our liquidity position, allowing us to pay down $2.25 billion of notes due in March 2012 ahead of schedule. Our next loan maturity totaling $300 million is due in May of 2013, followed by a $1.5 billion maturity in the fourth quarter of 2013.
We believe we have a clear runway to allow us to continue the investments in the iPhone and in Network Vision. I previously gave you guidance that we would be raising approximately $5 billion to $7 billion, excluding the Clearwire investment we announced in Q4, and this remains our intention. Our discussions regarding vendor financing are progressing well with all of our vendors. It is a time-consuming process because it involves multiple parties, but we are pleased with our progress to date. Our continued expectation is that we will have an agreement in place before the end of the second quarter. In the meantime, we continue to watch the debt markets, and we will be opportunistic with our options.
Our accrued capital expenditures, excluding capitalized interest of $109 million and including $370 million of Network Vision capital, were $900 million in the fourth quarter compared to $760 million in the third quarter and $608 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Total capital expense for the full year 2011 were approximately $2.9 billion, which includes $590 million in capital expenses related to Network Vision. 
Re-banding spend for the calendar year 2011 was approximately $123 million, net of $135 million MSS settlement from Dish, TerreStar. Inclusive of this settlement, total spend on the re-banding project to date has been approximately $2.95 billion. We estimate that we have approximately $600 million to $700 million of re-banding work remaining expected to be split between 2012 and 2013 and with the possibility of going into 2014 depending on the timing of the Mexican re-banding plan. 
Free cash flow was $257 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to negative $273 million in the third quarter of 2011 and to $913 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The year-over-year decrease in free cash flow is primarily associated with lower OIBDA and higher capital expenditures. Free cash flow sequentially improved -- improvement of $530 million was primarily associated with the sequential decline in working capital of $1 billion, primarily associated with the timing of vendor payments and lower accrued dealer commissions and rebate reserves as we wound down our instant rebate promotions in our retail stores during Q3. Free cash flow in Q4 also benefited from the onetime payment of $135 million for the MSS settlement.
Finally, I want to outline our expectations for 2012. Total adjusted OIBDA for the full year 2012 is expected to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, including the impact of the iPhone and approximately $1.1 billion of dilution associated with Network Vision. To achieve this, we expect total net service revenue growth of approximately 4% to 6%. 
With the Network Vision project ramping up, the quarterly timing of OIBDA is expected to be somewhat fluid. However, our expectation is that OIBDA in the first half of the year will be slightly lower than in the second half. In general, our quarterly OIBDA will also be affected by the timing of the launch of any subsequent versions of the iPhone the expectation is that our OIBDA trough will be u-shaped through 2012 and then will start to ramp in 2013 followed by strong margin expansion in 2014. 
As we've discussed previously, we expect that 2012 will be an aggressive investment year with regard to capital expenditures as we pursue a rapid and efficient execution of Network Vision. Total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $6 billion, excluding capitalized interest. In addition, based on the plans outlined by Steve earlier, in the first quarter of 2012, we have revised our estimates of the expected useful lives of certain Nextel platform assets through the end of 2013. 
Accordingly, approximately $2 billion in net book value of these assets is expected to be accelerated through depreciation expense, of which a disproportionate amount is expected to be recognized during 2012. The exact timing of the acceleration is dependent upon when the assets are expected to be phased out of service. These estimates are derived from our internal decommissioning plan, which is still evolving. We estimate the incremental effect of accelerated depreciation related to Nextel assets in our 2012 results to be in the range of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, of which approximately $450 million to $550 million will be recognized in the first quarter of 2012. We will continue to update you on these amounts quarterly as we refine our plans for Nextel decommissioning.
I want to end by reiterating my confidence in the strength of our core underlying business and in the pathway we believe we have created to future OIBDA growth and margin expansion. We are confident in the steps we are taking to improve our profitability and in our ability to execute on our strategic plan. The entire management team has a sharp focus on execution and profitability through the next few quarters of investment, and we are excited about the future. 
I want to thank you for all your support and I'll turn the call over back to Brad for Q&A."

And then Dan, turning over to the strategic side, Slide 14 that you went through. You went through a lot of the operational progress for Sprint, but can you talk more about where Sprint is positioned strategically? With T-Mobile still in the market, cable choosing to work with Verizon, it seems like you have some real competition to go after the remaining partners through a spectrum capital or both. So can you just put in perspective for us what Sprint is doing to put the company in the best position to either partner or buy spectrum as you move forward over the next 12 to 24 months?"

So that's why the pacing is as it is in '12. But also, we will be decommissioning, as I said, 9,600 sites this year from our Nextel platform and getting the associated benefit in utilities and maintenance and certain amount of rent also in '12.

I think as far as the churn is concerned on the postpaid side, what -- and this, again, is really Sprint platform -- that we described is we saw some impact, as we mentioned, in Q3 involuntary that continuing, if you will, increasing in Q4 and then in Q1, and then we would expect to see that begin to lower. You asked a question about credit. We tightened credit in Q3 and in Q4 after we saw what was going on in the channels. So we have taken actions in that regard. With respect to the iPhone and churn, that obviously is a very important element of, we’ll call it, the overall profitability of the iPhone, the customer lifetime value, and we won't see that over time. What we've seen early on in terms of the profitability metrics are, first of all, a very high gross add percentage. The other thing from a churn perspective is, again, you have lifetime churn, but you also see, historically, what happens to Sprint voluntary churn in the quarters where iPhones are launched. And in each of the previous 5 quarters where -- when iPhones have been launched, our voluntary churn has gone in the wrong direction. And so this quarter, this past quarter, is the first quarter of the 6 quarters where the new iPhone has been launched, where we've seen both a sequential and a year-over-year improvement in voluntary churn. So early on, we definitely are seeing those churn characteristics. The other thing I would say is that from a cost to service perspective, not only are we seeing lower usage of the network on iPhone and Androids, so our business case is continuing to perform there, but our calls to care, early on -- again, it's only the first few months -- is lower than it's been for any of our high-end devices in the early months. So if you will, our operating costs are also looking good in terms of the investment and compared to our business case. So -- and again, the last piece on the iPhone is we also sold more of them than our initial plans had indicated as well, 1.8 million. So we see, at least early on, no reason to be concerned at all about our volume commitments, which has come up on previous calls. So we feel good about the early indications of the iPhone, especially the 40% gross add number, which is probably almost 2x the rate that we've seen on the other 2 major carriers."

But our customers on contract is at a very strong level compared to historical levels, so we feel good about that. So you're exactly right.

And we generally -- we'll probably see some of it come back in this Q4 as well in '12, but things get a little bit more rational now in Q1 and Q2 and perhaps in Q3. But what we saw in Q4 of 2011 was unusual even by traditional seasonality's history in that. Generally, you just don't see any discounting on iPhones, and we saw it be very common in both Verizon and AT&T to see $30 per device and up discounts from the -- if you will, the normal pricing, the $200 or the $100 or what have you. They would be, if you will, $170 and $70 instead, and that was unusual. We saw some 4G LTE devices at very low rates that we wouldn't -- that we don't normally see. So the device pricing in Q4 was much lower than we had anticipated and discounting on devices that traditionally have not been discounted, and we just decided that we weren't going to go there."

A lot of customers that currently use that use the -- if you will, the Clearwire or the WiMAX platform, and we'll continue to market and sell devices this year that operate on that platform. And as you know, what really distinguishes Sprint as well is the fact that our pricing for handsets is unlimited. It's not unlimited on data cards or on mobile hotspots, but it is on handsets. So this -- the pricing arrangement that we have with Clearwire is very helpful in that regard, that clarity, that assurety, that ability for us to continue that offer with these devices for the next couple of years. Our focus with Clearwire, really, going forward in terms of handsets and technologies has to do with LTE-TD, which they've announced that they'll be putting into their networks. So expect -- we hope, and these things are fluid. But probably, in the 2013 timeframe, you'd begin to see devices that we'll start offering that will work on Clearwire's new LTE network that they will begin to build in 2013. So we would be, if you will, using Clearwire's WiMAX network for a number of years as we have a lot of devices that are out there, but we'll begin introducing, in '13, devices on the new LTE network that will utilize that capability that Clearwire will be bringing to market. So we have a mix of those over time. And yes, that was all, if you will, considered as we built our OIBDA plan for '12 and going forward. But the big element, as what Joe mentioned in his remarks, was, if you will, both a reduction and a de-risking, if you will, the roaming expenses associated with Clearwire's 4G service in 2012, because it's a fixed amount.

Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our annual report on Form 10-K.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the first quarter can be found on the attachments to the earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors. 
Let's move onto earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the first quarter were $0.29 compared to $0.43 in the fourth quarter and $0.15 in the year-ago period. The loss per share in the current period include the depreciation of approximately $543 million, a negative $0.18 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform, of which approximately 9,600 sites are expected to occur by the end of the third quarter this year. The current period also included a onetime benefit of $170 million or approximately $0.06 per share related to the spectrum hosting contract termination with LightSquared.
We recorded a net tax expense of $37 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

As I discussed on last quarter's call, 2012 marks the second phase in our company's turnaround effort investment for future growth while we maintain our focus on our operations and execution of the Network Vision program. As we will describe this morning, we've made progress against our goals. If you turn to Slide 6, please, I'll recap some of the quarter's highlights before reviewing performance across our 3 key priorities: Generating cash, improving the customer experience and building the brand. 
Adjusted OIBDA of just over $1.2 billion exceeded both our internal projections and Street consensus. Adjusted OIBDA margin of 15.2% represents a sequential improvement 440 basis points from the fourth quarter. We delivered another successful iPhone quarter. We activated over 1.5 million devices in the quarter, with 44% of those being new customers to Sprint, continuing proof point of the strength of the Sprint brand and the compelling combination of unsurpassed customer experience with the only truly unlimited data, talk and text plan. 
I can also report another record quarter for ARPU rate growth for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Year-over-year, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU grew $4.03, the highest increase on record for any major U.S. wireless company. Today we're announcing our sixth consecutive quarter of over 1 million total net customer additions and our eighth consecutive quarter of positive net additions on our Sprint platform postpaid business. Our 56 million total customers establishes a new all-time Sprint record. 
And finally, we made continued progress on the Network Vision deployment. We announced plant to launch 6 major LTE markets by midyear.
If you would please turn to Slide 7. I will organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities, which I just mentioned. Let me begin with cash. We improved our liquidity position by generating $138 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter and by completing a $2 billion debt raise. Joe will provide more details on our liquidity and capital structure, and we ended first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.6 billion, adequate to address the short-term needs. Higher than expected quarterly adjusted OIBDA performance was aided a strong top line growth, fueled largely by strength in our postpaid ARPU rate. This quarter represents our seventh consecutive quarter year-over-year growth in total operating revenues and our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Total operating revenues are up 5% year-over-year. Sprint platform service revenues reached their highest ever levels at $6.5 billion, an increase of approximately 16% over the year ago period and approximately 5% sequentially, driven by the growth in the postpaid ARPU rate, as well as growth in subscribers across all areas of the business: Postpaid, prepaid and wholesale. 
As I said earlier, the Sprint brand postpaid quarterly ARPU rate grew year-over-year by $4.03 or approximately 7% year-over-year and $1.33 sequentially or approximately 2% as we continue to see the benefits of smartphone adoption and the $10 premium data charge implemented in 2011. 
As I transition to a discussion for customer experience and brand results, I'd like to begin with an overview of the iPhone, which benefits both areas. Turning to Slide 8, an important near-term financial success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that our new customers to Sprint because they represent new sources of revenue. In the first quarter, 44% of our iPhone activations were new customers, up from 40% in the fourth quarter, above our internal expectations and well in excess of our competitors' results. Additionally, 40% of new Sprint iPhone users reported breaking a contract with their prior carrier to switch to Sprint, evidence that our Sprint hallmarks value and simplicity are resonating with consumers.  Our study also found that over 60% of our iPhone customers who left another carrier to come to Sprint wouldn't have considered switching to us if we did not carry the iPhone. Longer-term, the most important indicator of success with the iPhone is the anticipated lower churn rate of iPhone customers. All of our early life iPhone customer experience metrics are positive, potential early indicators of longer-term churn benefits. To date, we are experiencing low early life calls to Care and less than half of the returns in exchanges for iPhone users compared to other smartphone users. The evidence so far supports our decision to carry the iPhone.
Turning to Slide 9. In the customer experience, I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter we achieved a new best ever level for customer calls to Care across our customer base. Calls for postpaid subscriber are down over 10% from last year, also making notable improvements with our prepaid base with calls per subscriber down 19% than last year. Third-party overall customer satisfaction measures remain at best ever levels, and we're not buying satisfaction. Customer care credits in the first quarter were the lowest or best for any quarter on record. Third-party accolades continue to validate success across our brand and product portfolios. In the quarter, 2 of our prepaid brands, Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile, were named 2012 Customer Service Champions by J.D. Power and Associates among 800 brands considered. And our brands recognized 3x by J.D. Power. Sprint, highest satisfaction with the purchase experience among full-service wireless providers, Virgin Mobile for highest-ranked customer service performance among noncontract wireless providers; and Boost Mobile, for highest satisfaction with the purchase experience among noncontract wireless providers. Sprint was recently recognized by ATLANTIC-ACM for excellence in our wholesale business, network, provisioning, customer service and sales force. And finally, Frost & Sullivan identified Sprint as an excellent example of an end-to-end mobile solution provider for the small business sector.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, Sprint platform postpaid churn remained elevated in the first quarter at 2%, largely due to the involuntary churn impact of some acquisition activities in the second and third quarters of 2011. We continue to expect a step-down in Sprint platform postpaid involuntary churn beginning in the second quarter and improvements in voluntary churn longer term driven by the ongoing improvements in our customer experience, the iPhone and the fact that our percentage of postpaid base on contract is the highest it has been in 4 years. 
As we discussed last quarter, Nextel platform churn is ramping up as we inform customers of our plans to decommission the Nextel platform. In the first quarter, we recaptured 46% of the postpaid customers who left the Nextel platform for our Sprint postpaid platform, better than our expectations. Unique Sprint Direct Connect devices and other Sprint devices give customers strong choices as they make their decision to leave Nextel platform. We're also pleased to report that prepaid churn for the quarter is down both year-over-year and sequentially and at 3.61% represents our best prepaid churn performance in 6.5 years.
Turning to Slide 10. As I've mentioned before, perhaps the most important brand metric is the Net Promoter score. A well-known independent survey, Net Promoter score again indicates Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major wireless carriers to show improvement year-over-year. One of the most tangible proof points of our brand improvement is our net porting position for the Sprint platform postpaid business, being net port positive means more of our competitors' customers switch to Sprint than switch from Sprint to a competitor. Before the third quarter of 2010, the Sprint platform had never been net port positive, and now we've done it for 7 quarters in a row. We were also net port positive for our entire postpaid business for Sprint and Nextel and we've now achieved being net port positive for all of our postpaid business for 4 of the last 6 quarters, the only 4 quarters of postpaid net port positive performance in company history.
Please turn to Slide 11. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience in the brand, Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 263,000 represent our eighth consecutive quarter of positive net adds. Sprint platform postpaid gross add performance is also particularly noteworthy. First quarter represents a 10% year-over-year growth and our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Even though the iPad contributed materially to Verizon's and AT&T's postpaid performance, barring an unanticipated number from T-Mobile U.S.A., our first quarter Sprint platform postpaid share of gross adds or so that is the company's best quarter ever. 
We're also pleased with the continued growth of our prepaid business, the Q1 being our ninth consecutive quarter of over 2 million gross adds. Finally, we had another quarter of strong growth in our wholesale business with our fourth consecutive quarter of at least 500,000 net adds. Our total company net adds of 1.1 million in the quarter brings us to over 56 million customers served, another all-time company record.
Turning to Slide 12. Another pillar of the Sprint brand is innovation. We recently announced the upcoming availability of some impressive new devices, including the LG Viper 4G LTE, a feature-packed ULE platinum eco-friendly smartphone that will operate on our new LTE network. Jeep, Android phone at a compelling price point of $19.99 and of course the HTC EVO 4G LTE, with the first ever HD voice capability. We also continue to innovate in business solutions, evidenced by the recent launch of Sprint Complete Collaboration a the MacLeod hosted Unified Communications offering for our enterprise customers. This quarter we also created new ventures and organization focused on bringing new solutions with successful open ecosystem platforms to the wholesale and global marketplace. We recently announced an agreement with Chrysler to act as a strategic wireless partner for the Chrysler Group, LLC you connect program. 
Our Q1 report from the patent board recognizes Sprint as 1 of the top 10 innovators in the global telecom and communications industry with over 450 U.S. patents granted in the last year. We were 1 of only 2 wireless carriers to be named to the top 10.
Turning to Slide 13, I'm pleased to announce that 4G WiMAX is coming to both Virgin Mobile U.S.A. and Boost Mobile later this quarter, and we will announce more details at a later date. 
Please turn to my final slide, #14. Last quarter's call I discussed the end of Phase I with the Sprint turnaround in 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 began in Phase II . It's been a tough road these past 4 years and there are still much hard work left to do. Everyone at Sprint realizes we have a long way to go to deliver the level of financial performance we aspire to, but I am pleased with our progress and in particular with our OIBDA performance and our Network Vision progress Steve Elfman will now report on. Thank you."
417206,183739602,288227,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2012",2012-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dan.

The Network Vision project is progressing well and I'm confident about hitting the targets we communicated to you. The next slide is a Network Vision score card we developed, which I'll be sharing you every quarter throughout the implementation in a similar to my daily inter flash report. We have made good progress during the first quarter and the project is hitting its stride. We have ramped the resources and currently have over 6,000 people working on the project both internal and through our vendor partners. We expect no issues with resources in any market. A critical part of this project is building a good pipeline of sites for construction To date, we have completed zoning on approximately 9,700 sites and leasing on close to 7,700 sites. As we have discussed with you, the zoning and leasing process have the potential for the greatest unknowns, so we are pleased with the pipeline. Over 3,200 sites are now in notice to proceed status, meaning we have completed all steps required prior to starting actual construction of the site. And we have started work on approximately 3,000 sites in 17 markets.
We continue to expect to launch LTE coverage in 6 metro areas by midyear and have 12,000 new Network Vision sites on air by the end of the year. We now have over 600 new Network Vision sites on air and the early results of site performance are meeting our expectations. Our Network Vision size we are seeing a double of coverage range compared to the legacy network. And when we light up the Network Vision tower and about 80% of the cases we are re-purposing about 2.5 to 3 megahertz of our 800 megahertz spectrum to voice on the Sprint platform. So our customers in those markets are beginning to see improvements in their service. 
In early stages, we are seeing a reduction to in-footprint roaming, which is meeting our expectations or performance. As we build out the network and retune the individual sites to their clusters, we'd expect this performance to further improve.
We are completely done with the field testing and the technology works. For sites on air, we're seeing improved performance of radios, antenna and backhaul, all of which are meeting our performance objectives. Based on the testing of our 5 by 5 megahertz network and the size of our customer base, we expect our network speeds to be competitive.
If we turn to the next slide. The other and equally important project within Network Vision is the thinning of the Nextel network prior to the complete shutdown in 2013. We began the process of the trial in Walmart in the first quarter and now are underway nationally. The network thinning process is essentially a process of shutting down sites and recalibrating the network to support lower traffic volumes. The Nextel platform was built to support approximately 20 million customers, and as of the end of the first quarter supports approximately 5.4 million customers. Through the network thinning process, we go into market and turn off certain sites overnight and then return the network with the expectation that we continue to provide equivalent, on-street coverage quality in the majority of cases. To date, we have nearly 1,300 Nextel sites off air. The process is going well, and we now expect that we will have 9,600 sites planned for this year off air by the end of Q3. The process is not in itself expected to have any meaningful churn or migration impact but should provide immediate savings on utilities and maintenance and on rent going forward, all of which are in the Network Vision forecast. 
I'm very pleased with the progress we have made, and I'm confident that over the coming quarters, we will be able to continue to report strong progress and performance on the build while remaining on schedule and on budget. I will now turn it over to Joe to go through the financial results."
417206,183739602,288227,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2012",2012-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Across all areas of the business, the first quarter showed steady execution. I am pleased to say we are progressing well against our plan for the year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2012 is a year of",2280,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Across all areas of the business, the first quarter showed steady execution. I am pleased to say we are progressing well against our plan for the year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2012 is a year of execution and continued focus on profitability. And our first quarter results reflect this commitment and discipline. We are pleased with our results in the first quarter which show progress against the 3 most important financial measures of our business. Both the subscribers and revenues and our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong conversion of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. Our core business is showing growth in both subscribers and service revenues. Sprint platform postpaid gross adds of 1.98 million grew 10% year-over-year, showing a growing market share in a soft quarter for acquisition throughout the industry. This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to smart growth, producing steadily improving results in our ongoing core business in a disciplined manner. Not only did we increase gross adds year-over-year, we did so  while taking actions to support a significant shift in gross add volume to our most cost-effective channels, which helps to improve our variable selling expense. Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 263,000 grew 4% year-over-year. As we expected, net adds number during the quarter continued to be affected at a carryover of the churn bubble we discussed on last quarter's call. We be believe the impact of the higher churn we have seen in recent quarters is largely behind us. And we have seen involuntary churn begin to improve in Q2. Now that we are largely past this issue, we expect to approach normal seasonality in involuntary churn. Just based on our historical trends, it's typically worth approximately 10 basis points in the second quarter. And we would expect our sequential improvement in Q2 to be better than this.
I want to make sure everyone understands the expected dynamics of customer growth in 2012. Our momentum in the core business is expected to continue, and we expect to show positive postpaid net adds on the Sprint platform in every quarter in 2012. We will remain disciplined in our pursuit of subscriber growth, and we will not chase unprofitable or marginally profitable gross adds. And we will continue to look for opportunities to improve the cost of customer acquisition as we grow our core business. 
Regarding the Nextel platform, we expect the trend of negative postpaid net adds to increase every quarter throughout the year as we continue our migration efforts. Exact timing of the churn or migration of larger accounts is somewhat unpredictable as we go through the process with our business customers. However, consistent with our Network Vision plan, we expect the negative trend on the Nextel platform to increase throughout the year as we prepare to fully decommission the network in 2013.
When looking at the Nextel platform, the most important metric to measure, the health and strength of our ongoing business, is the recapture rate. I am pleased to say we did better than our business plan in the first quarter, recapturing approximately 46% of postpaid customers leaving the Nextel platform compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The majority of the retail and smaller business customers that we are currently recapturing to the Sprint postpaid platform are purchasing smartphones and so are incurring the $10 premium data add-on charge as they move. This means that ARPU for the customers should increase, however, their data usage is also expected to increase. So these customers are expected to achieve a similar gross margin to our Sprint postpaid platform base over time. 
While we are pleased with the current successes we are seeing in bringing the Nextel platform postpaid customers over to the Sprint platform, I do want to caution that the recapture rate could show large fluctuations over the next several quarters and therefore it is a challenge to predict. The reason for this is that of the 3.8 million postpaid customers remaining on the Nextel platform at the end of the first quarter, approximately 3 million of those customers are corporate customers and the timing of the migration or deactivation of larger accounts may cause large swings in the recapture rate. However, we expect that in total our Nextel recapture rate of our postpaid customers should be slightly better than our approximately 30% that was in our original business case.
As Dan discussed, the most significant growth we are seeing in the business is in postpaid ARPU. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU grew by over $4 or 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. 86% of Sprint platform postpaid handset sales were smartphones in the quarter, and approximately 69% of the Sprint postpaid handset base now have smartphones. We expect Sprint postpaid ARPU to show sequential growth each quarter throughout the year.
Turning to Slide 20. We are seeing growth not just in Sprint banded postpaid, but across the entire Sprint platform. Prepaid net adds on the Sprint platform were 870,000, with churn of just 2.92%, our lowest since the launch of prepaid on that platform in 2007. Prepaid has been a significant growth engine for our business, and in the first quarter those trends continued. Because of pricing actions taken last year, particularly in the Boost business, with the $5 smartphone data charge implemented in October 2011, Sprint platform prepaid ARPU grew by almost 2% sequentially in the first quarter, despite the offsetting impacts of the Boost Bill shrinkage program and Assurance mix. The combination of growing ARPU and improving churn in the Boost and Virgin Mobile brands translated into very strong revenue growth of 9% sequentially and 43% year-over-year in prepaid on the Sprint platform. 
Now onto our wholesale and affiliate businesses, which is 100% on the Sprint platform. We are also seeing growth. Wholesale and affiliate net adds were 785,000 in the first quarter, up 102% for the first quarter a year ago. Wholesale affiliate and other revenues grew 39% sequentially in the first quarter and 49% year-over-year, reflecting both volume and ARPU rate improvements. The core business has good momentum. Our total customers on the Sprint platform increased by more than 1.9 million during the quarter or by 4% from the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. The growth across all our businesses on the Sprint platform contributed to nearly 5% sequential growth in total Sprint platform service revenues and 16% growth year-over-year. This positive performance continues to exceed our expectations and is contributing to our strong adjusted OIBDA results.
Let's move onto our wireless operating expenses on Slide 21. Total wireless cost of service in the first quarter was $2.3 billion or 32% of service revenues, which was flat on an absolute dollar basis and a 1 percentage point gross margin improvement sequentially. This was primarily due to an improvement in Sprint platform variable network expenses of 9% sequentially from $881 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential improvement in Sprint platform variable network expenses is due to a $40 million reduction in 4G roaming expenses as we shift to the flat rate unlimited use model with Clearwire, as well as a $15 million sequential decline in 3G roaming expenses. Sprint platform variable network expenses increased by just 10% year-over-year, whilst Sprint platform service revenues increased by 16%. It is these trends along with the expected future removal of significant fixed costs associated with the Nextel platform that gives us the confidence in our long-term margin expansion goals.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the first quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $158 million or 9%. The sequential change was due to seasonally lower postpaid gross adds and upgrades. Our subsidy expense was also helped on a year-over-year basis by changes to our upgrade eligibility program made throughout last year, which helped reduced our total postpaid upgrade rate from almost 9% in the year-ago period to 7% in the first quarter. While growing handset subsidies continue to be an industrywide issue, we are continually taking steps to improve our cost structure and the profitability of our customers. In the first quarter, we saw improvements in our variable selling expenses, resulting from efforts to drive customers to our Sprint banded channels., which provides a better customer experience and could reduce our cost per acquisition by as much as $200. This is an example of our commitment to smart growth. On a year-over-year basis, we were able to increase Sprint platform postpaid gross adds by 10%, even as we reduce our total gross add volumes and third-party national retailers by 19%. 
Wireless selling, general and administrative cost improved by $90 million sequentially, an increase by $40 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. This year-over-year increase was primarily related to a $59 million incremental expense, which we discussed on the fourth quarter call. There is a full description in the 10-Q but simply put, when the third-party channels buy handsets direct from an OEM, the expense get reported as a selling expense rather than in subsidy. This activity is incremental in the first quarter 2012 year-over-year comparative. Excluding this new expense, wireless selling expenses would have improved by 4% year-over-year despite a 10% increase in postpaid gross adds for the Sprint platform compared to the first quarter of 2011. 
Network Vision operating expenses were $104 million during the quarter compared to $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect that our Network Vision-related costs will show substantial sequential increases through the remainder of 2012.
Turning to Slide 22, wireless adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, a 57% sequential improvement. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was $1.2 billion, which was a 44% sequential improvement. Both results include $104 million of Network Vision expenses, which, which was a sequential increase in expense of $50 million. This performance was due to ARPU in subscriber growth, as well as lower overall volumes, particularly in upgrades, and improvements to certain variable expenses. While we continue to expect to grow revenues and improve our cost structure, our expectation is that second quarter consolidated adjusted OIBDA will be lower than the first quarter due to an approximate doubling of Network Vision expenses in the second quarter.
Now switching to wireline. Adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter was $161 million, a 10% sequential decline and a 29% decline from a year ago. As you know, at the beginning of each year, we adjust the intercompany transfer rate between wireless and wireline to adhere to the current market prices. And this resulted in a $53 million year-over-year decline in wireline revenues. 
Now let's move to cash and liquidity on Slide 23. We ended the first quarter with a total liquidity position of $8.8 billion, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.6 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility. During the quarter, we raised approximately $2 billion to private placements. The combined offering was oversubscribed. And the price of the guaranteed notes was roughly 200 basis points, better than comparable notes issued in the fourth quarter. This vote of confidence from debt holders enhance our liquidity position and strengthens our belief in our ability to raise capital to support our investment in Network Vision and other high-return projects.
We also continue to pursue vendor financing in the range of $1 billion to $3 billion, and our discussions are growing well. Our accrued capital expenditures were $800 million in the first quarter, which excluded $115 million in capitalized interest and included $315 million of Network Vision capital compared to $900 million in the fourth quarter and $555 million in the first quarter of 2011. Re-banding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was $58 million in the first quarter of 2012. We estimate that we have approximately $550 million to $650 million in re-banding spend left, which will be split between 2012 and 2013 and will be focused on the U.S. borders. Free cash flow was $138 million in the first quarter 2012 compared to $257 million in the fourth quarter and $178 million in the first quarter of 2011. Going forward, we expect that free cash flow will be negative as investments in Network Vision accelerate the inventory increases as a result of new LTE handset launches. 
Moving to Slide 24, I'll close with our updated outlook for the year. Positive revenue and subscriber trends in our core business, as well as continued steps towards margin improvement, give us confidence in our outlook for the year, and we expect that adjusted OIBDA will be at the high-end of the $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion range that we discussed with you on the fourth quarter call. Second quarter adjusted OIBDA is expected to be lower than the first quarter due to increasing Network Vision spend. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $6 billion. We believe we have made positive progress against our business plan in the first quarter, executing well on Network Vision and making the kind of steady, ongoing progress toward our goals as we invest in the future of our business. Our balanced approach to top line growth and profitability is demonstrated by our subscriber and revenue growth on the Sprint platform. We continue to make progress on improving our cost structure and Network Vision. We are very optimistic about the future and, we want to thank the Sprint workforce, both in-house and contracted labor for their hard work and dedication to meeting our goals. I'll turn the call back over to Brad for Q&A."

What we've said is, Jonathan, how are you? This is Dan.

One of the challenges on churn has been the fact that as you know, in 2011, part of what's driving our profitability performance and our ARPU growth is we've been increasing prices, increasing fees. We did away with loyalty programs, which of course drove more upgrades, so you're seeing more favorability on the upgrade side, which has an impact on the bottom line. But of course, you'll see some pressure on the churn side. So what we're trying to do, Jonathan, is find kind of that optimal point, knowing it will give us some pressure on churn to do some things that are more creative to the bottom line and give us more revenue and profitability. But generally, you should exceed -- you should see postpaid churn on the Sprint platform begin to improve going forward. Now on the Nextel postpaid platform, it will go into other direction as we accelerate decommissioning of the iDEN network, you'll see that, if you will, as a churn point of view as a headwind but continued improvement on the Sprint platform."

With respect to the, I think it's going to be the question has to do with potential ARPU uptick or what have you, given smartphone penetration, roughly 69% of our customer base currently has a smartphone. So there's an opportunity obviously to take that north of 69%, and some of those customers actually have smartphones but don't yet pay the $10 additional data charge because they bought those smartphones before we implemented the increase. Of course the increase only went to new customers and customers that upgraded. So there is potential there, but also keep in mind that in the year-over-year comps, it will get harder later in the year in terms of looking to things like revenue growth or ARPU growth because the increases will it affected i n the first quarter 2011. So we began to see the ARPU increases all through '11. So anyway as you get later in the year, the comps get more difficult. But net-net, and we have about 30% of our subscriber base on phones that still don't have smartphones, and there's obviously a potential to have them upgrade to smart devices, as well as obviously the lion's share of our gross adds, new customers coming in are on the iPhone and other smartphones."

Looking at that Slide 16 on that Vision scorecard, as we look these constructions underways, getting the sites on air and then noticed receipts, how do you look at this chart and then try to anticipate how it's going to change? And then, if you can kind of talk a little bit about some of the headwinds and tailwinds that you've been seeing for instance are you seeing zoning us a lot less of an issue. We've heard others maybe some problems some month in brackets that haven't been engineered for some of the things. If you could talk about kind of the nuts and bolts of how we're getting from zoning to sites on air, timing that would be great? And just a quick housekeeping,, Joe, I think last quarter you were saying that the variable expenses related iDEN were $350 million, and that was going to be the thing that we're going to mind out not as we shut down the iDEN sites. It could you kind of update on that number?"

In terms of our zoning czar ahead but one of the things you find in some jurisdictions you don't need to do specific zoning. Leasing, a couple of things on that. We did do the deals with the major tower companies last year, and that makes approximately 50% of our  tower portfolio. And what we have to do there to get a leasing complete is we have to submit basically drawings that is more paperwork with them. We don't have to negotiate rates and rent or timing. And so those generally go quite a bit smoother and faster in terms of the leasing. So we see that going well. It's the other 50% that are out and let's say on the top of a fast food restaurant or in a farmers field, that's where we have to go out and negotiate both rate and then go back with drawings. So those take a little bit longer, and you can have a headwind if there's difficulty in negotiating a lease, right. That's one. The other question you had about some headwinds. On a daily basis, those things that go very, very well and on a daily basis, there's things that made keep put your head on your hands. But there's been any significant issue that causes a setback. There are some daily ones. And so just to react to the one that I know it out there that we have that towers have been falling down, we had -- early on some of our towers that we determined we needed to have stronger brackets, and we ended up going back to those and putting in some tighter criteria for certification before we would go and do a mount. And so, yes, that caused a brief delay, but nothing that would affect the overall outcome of the project. So you have this pop up generally, this one got an awful lot of press I think and it doesn't affect the overall program, but sure enough, we did have to put tighter certification."

Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I do want to point out that in our remarks this morning we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our annual report on Form 10-K.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the first quarter can be found on the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors. 
Let's move onto earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the first quarter were $0.29 compared to $0.43 in the fourth quarter and $0.15 in the year-ago period. The loss per share in the current period included depreciation of approximately $543 million, a negative $0.18 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform, of which approximately 9,600 sites are expected to occur by the end of the third quarter of this year. The current period also included a onetime benefit of $170 million or approximately $0.06 per share related to the spectrum hosting contract termination with LightSquared.
We recorded a net tax expense of $37 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

As I discussed on last quarter's call, 2012 marks the second phase in our company's turnaround effort, investment for future growth while we maintain our focus on our operations and execution of the Network Vision program. 
As we will describe this morning, we've made progress against our goals. If you turn to Slide 6, please, I'll recap some of the quarter's highlights before reviewing performance across our 3 key priorities, which are generating cash, improving the customer experience and building the brand. 
Adjusted OIBDA of just over $1.2 billion exceeded both our internal projections and Street consensus. The adjusted OIBDA margin of 15.2% represents a sequential improvement of 440 basis points from the fourth quarter. We delivered another successful iPhone quarter. We activated over 1.5 million devices in the quarter with 44% of those being new customers to Sprint, a continuing proof point of the strength of the Sprint brand and the compelling combination of an unsurpassed customer experience with the only truly unlimited data, talk and text plan. 
I can also report another record quarter for ARPU rate growth for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Year-over-year, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU grew $4.03, the highest increase on record for any major U.S. wireless company. Today we're announcing our sixth consecutive quarter of over 1 million total net customer additions and our eighth consecutive quarter of positive net additions on our Sprint platform postpaid business. Our 56 million total customers establishes a new all-time Sprint record. 
And finally, we made continued progress on the Network Vision deployment. We announced and we're on plan to launch 6 major LTE markets by mid-year.
If you would please turn to Slide 7. I'll organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities, which I just mentioned. Let me begin with cash. We improved our liquidity position by generating $138 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter and by completing a $2 billion debt raise. Joe will provide more details on our liquidity and capital structure, and we ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.6 billion, adequate to address our short-term needs. 
Higher than expected quarterly adjusted OIBDA performance was aided by strong top line growth, fueled largely by strength in our postpaid ARPU rate. This quarter represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total operating revenues and our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Total operating revenues are up 5% year-over-year. Sprint platform service revenues reached their highest ever levels at $6.5 billion, an increase of approximately 16% over the year-ago period and approximately 5% sequentially, driven by the growth in the postpaid ARPU rate, as well as growth in subscribers across all areas of the business: Postpaid, prepaid and wholesale. 
As I said earlier, the Sprint brand postpaid quarterly ARPU rate grew year-over-year by $4.03 or approximately 7% year-over-year and $1.33 sequentially or approximately 2% as we continue to see the benefits of smartphone adoption and the $10 premium data charge implemented in 2011. 
As I transition to a discussion of our customer experience and brand results, I'd like to begin with an overview of the iPhone, which benefits both areas. Turning to Slide 8. An important near-term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that our new customers to Sprint because they represent new sources of revenue. In the first quarter, 44% of our iPhone activations were new customers, up from 40% in the fourth quarter, above our internal expectations and well in excess of our competitors' results. Additionally, 40% of new Sprint iPhone users reported breaking a contract with their prior carrier to switch to Sprint, evidence that our Sprint brand hallmarks of value and simplicity are resonating with consumers. Our study also found that over 60% of our iPhone customers who left another carrier to come to Sprint wouldn't have considered switching to us if we did not carry the iPhone. Longer-term, the most important indicator of success with the iPhone is the anticipated lower churn rate of iPhone customers. All of our early-life iPhone customer experience metrics are positive, potential early indicators of longer-term churn benefits. To date, we are experiencing low early-life calls to care and less than half of the returns and exchanges for iPhone users compared to other smartphone users. The evidence so far supports our decision to carry the iPhone.
Turning to Slide 9. In the customer experience, I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter we achieved a new best ever level for customer calls to care across our customer base. Calls for postpaid subscriber are down over 10% from last year. We're also making notable improvements with our prepaid base with calls per subscriber down 19% from last year. Third-party overall customer satisfaction measures remain at best ever levels, and we're not buying satisfaction. Customer care credits in the first quarter were the lowest or best for any quarter on record. 
Third-party accolades continue to validate success across our brand and product portfolios. In the quarter, 2 of our prepaid brands, Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile, were named 2012 Customer Service Champions by J.D. Power and Associates among 800 brands considered. And our brands were recognized 3 times by J.D. Power: Sprint, for highest satisfaction with the purchase experience among full-service wireless providers; Virgin Mobile, for highest-ranked customer service performance among noncontract wireless providers; and Boost Mobile, for highest satisfaction with the purchase experience among noncontract wireless providers. Sprint was recently recognized by ATLANTIC-ACM for excellence in our wholesale business, for network, provisioning, customer service and sales force. And finally, Frost & Sullivan identified Sprint as an excellent example of an end-to-end mobile solution provider for the small business sector.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, Sprint platform postpaid churn remained elevated in the first quarter at 2%, largely due to the involuntary churn impact of some acquisition activities in the second and third quarters of 2011. We continue to expect a step-down in Sprint platform postpaid involuntary churn beginning in the second quarter and improvements in voluntary churn longer term driven by the ongoing improvements in our customer experience, the iPhone and the fact that our percentage of postpaid base on contract is the highest it has been in 4 years. 
As we discussed last quarter, Nextel platform churn is ramping up as we inform customers of our plans to decommission the Nextel platform. In the first quarter, we recaptured 46% of the postpaid customers who left the Nextel platform for our Sprint postpaid platform, better than our expectations. Unique Sprint Direct Connect devices and other Sprint devices give customers strong choices as they make their decision to leave the Nextel platform. 
We're also pleased to report that prepaid churn for the quarter is down both year-over-year and sequentially and at 3.61%, represents our best prepaid churn performance in 6.5 years.
Turning to Slide 10. As I've mentioned before, perhaps the most important brand metric is the Net Promoter Score. And a well-known independent survey, Net Promoter Scores again indicate Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major wireless carriers to show improvement year-over-year. One of the most tangible proof points of our brand improvement is our net porting position for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Being net port positive means more of our competitors' customers switch to Sprint than switch from Sprint to a competitor. Before the third quarter of 2010, the Sprint platform had never been net port positive, and now we've done it for 7 quarters in a row. We were also net port positive for our entire postpaid business for Sprint and Nextel, and we've now achieved being net port positive for all of our postpaid business for 4 of the last 6 quarters, the only 4 quarters of postpaid net port positive performance in company history.
Please turn to Slide 11. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience in the brand, Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 263,000 represent our eighth consecutive quarter of positive net adds. Sprint platform postpaid gross add performance is also particularly noteworthy. The first quarter represents a 10% year-over-year growth and our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. And even though the iPad contributed materially to Verizon's and AT&T's postpaid performance. Borrowing an unanticipated number from T-Mobile U.S.A., our first quarter Sprint platform postpaid share of gross adds or SoGA is the company's best quarter ever. We're also pleased with the continued growth of our prepaid business with Q1 being our ninth consecutive quarter of over 2 million gross adds. 
Finally, we had another quarter of strong growth in our wholesale business with our fourth consecutive quarter of at least 500,000 net adds. Our total company net adds of 1.1 million in the quarter brings us to over 56 million customers served, another all-time company record.
Turning to Slide 12. Another pillar of the Sprint brand is innovation. We recently announced the upcoming availability of some impressive new devices, including the LG Viper 4G LTE, a feature-packed ULE platinum, eco-friendly smartphone that will operate on our new LTE network; ZTE Fury, a kid-friendly Android phone at a compelling price point of $19.99; and of course, the HTC EVO 4G LTE, with the first-ever HD voice capability. 
We also continue to innovate in business solutions, evidenced by the recent launch of Sprint Complete Collaboration, a cloud-hosted unified communications offering for our enterprise customers. This quarter we also created new ventures, an organization focused on bringing new solutions with successful open ecosystem platforms to the wholesale and global marketplace. We recently announced an agreement with Chrysler to act as a strategic wireless partner for the Chrysler Group LLC's Uconnect Program. 
A Q1 report from the patent board recognizes Sprint as 1 of the top 10 innovators in the global telecom and communications industry with over 450 U.S. patents granted in the last year. We were 1 of only 2 wireless carriers to be named to the top 10.
Turning to Slide 13, I'm pleased to announce that 4G WiMAX is coming to both Virgin Mobile USA and Boost Mobile later this quarter, and we will announce more details at a later date. 
Please turn to my final slide, #14. On last quarter's call I discussed the end of Phase 1 of the Sprint turnaround in 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 began Phase 2. It has been a tough road these past 4 years and there are still much hard work left to do. Everyone at Sprint realizes we have a long way to go to deliver the level of financial performance we aspire to, but I am pleased with our progress and in particular, with our OIBDA performance and our Network Vision progress, which Steve Elfman will now report on. Thank you."

The Network Vision project is progressing well, and I'm confident about hitting the targets we've communicated to you. The next slide is a Network Vision score card we developed, which I'll be sharing with you every quarters throughout the implementation and is similar to my daily internal flash report. We have made good progress during the first quarter, and the project is hitting its stride. We have ramped the resources and currently have over 6,000 people working on the project both internal and through our vendor partners. We expect no issues with resources in any market. A critical part of this project is building a good pipeline of sites for construction. To date, we completed zoning on approximately 9,700 sites and leasing on close to 7,700 sites. As we have discussed with you, the zoning and leasing process have the potential for the greatest unknowns, so we are pleased with the pipeline. Over 3,200 sites are now in notice-to-proceed status, meaning we have completed all steps required prior to starting actual construction of the site. And we have started work on approximately 3,000 sites in 17 markets.
We continue to expect to launch LTE coverage in 6 metro areas by mid-year and have 12,000 new Network Vision sites on air by the end of the year. We now have over 600 new Network Vision sites on air and the early results of site performance are meeting our expectations. On Network Vision sites, we are seeing a doubling of coverage range compared to the legacy network. And when we light up the Network Vision tower, in about 80% of the cases we are repurposing about 2.5 to 3 megahertz of our 800 megahertz spectrum to voice on the Sprint platform. So our customers in those markets are beginning to see improvements in their service. 
In the early stages, we are seeing a reduction to in-footprint roaming, which is meeting our expectations of performance. As we build out the network and retune the individual sites to their clusters, we'd expect this performance to further improve.
We are completely done with the field testing and the technology works. For sites on air, we're seeing improved performance of radios, antenna and backhaul, all of which are meeting our performance objectives. Based on the testing of our 5 by 5 megahertz network and the size of our customer base, we expect our network speeds to be competitive.
If we turn to the next slide. The other and equally important project within Network Vision is the thinning of the Nextel network prior to the complete shutdown in 2013. We began the process with a trial in one market in the first quarter and now are underway nationally. The network thinning process is essentially a process of shutting down sites and recalibrating the network to support lower traffic volumes. 
The Nextel platform was built to support approximately 20 million customers, and as of the end of the first quarter supports approximately 5.4 million customers. Through the network thinning process, we go into market and turn off certain sites overnight and then return the network with the expectation that we continue to provide equivalent, on-street coverage quality in the majority of cases. To date, we have nearly 1,300 Nextel sites off air. The process is going well, and we now expect that we will have 9,600 sites planned for this year off air by the end of Q3. The process is not in itself expected to have any meaningful churn or migration impact but should provide immediate savings on utilities and maintenance and on rent going forward, all of which are in the Network Vision forecast. 
I'm very pleased with the progress we have made, and I'm confident that over the coming quarters, we will be able to continue to report strong progress and performance on the build while remaining on schedule and on budget. 
I will now turn it over to Joe to go through the financial results."
417206,183739602,288548,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2012",2012-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Across all areas of the business, the first quarter showed steady execution. I am pleased to say we are progressing well against our plan for the year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2012 is a year of",2285,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Across all areas of the business, the first quarter showed steady execution. I am pleased to say we are progressing well against our plan for the year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2012 is a year of execution and continued focus on profitability. And our first quarter results reflect this commitment and discipline. We are pleased with our results in the first quarter, which show progress against the 3 most important financial measures of our business: Both the subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong conversion of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. 
Our core business is showing growth in both subscribers and service revenues. Sprint platform postpaid gross adds of 1.8 million grew 10% year-over-year, showing a growing market share in a soft quarter for acquisition throughout the industry. This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to smart growth, producing steadily improving results in our ongoing core business in a disciplined manner. Not only did we increase gross adds year-over-year, we did so while taking actions to support a significant shift in gross add volume to our most cost-effective channels, which helps to improve our variable selling expense. Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 263,000 grew 4% year-over-year. 
As we expected, the net adds number during the quarter continued to be affected by the carryover of the churn bubble we discussed on last quarter's call. We believe the impact of the higher churn we have seen in recent quarters is largely behind us. And we have seen involuntary churn begin to improve in Q2. Now that we are largely past this issue, we expect to approach normal seasonality for involuntary churn which, based on our historical trends, is typically worth approximately 10 basis points in the second quarter. And we would expect our sequential improvement in Q2 to be better than this.
I want to make sure everyone understands the expected dynamics of customer growth in 2012. Our momentum in the core business is expected to continue, and we expect to show positive postpaid net adds on the Sprint platform in every quarter in 2012. We will remain disciplined in our pursuit of subscriber growth, and we will not chase unprofitable or marginally profitable gross adds. And we will continue to look for opportunities to improve the cost of customer acquisition as we grow our core business. 
Regarding the Nextel platform, we expect the trend of negative postpaid net adds to increase every quarter throughout the year as we continue our migration efforts. The exact timing of the churn or migration of larger accounts is somewhat unpredictable as we go through the process with our business customers. However, consistent with our Network Vision plan, we expect the negative trend on the Nextel platform to increase throughout the year as we prepare to fully decommission the network in 2013.
When looking at the Nextel platform, the most important metric to measure, the health and strength of our ongoing business, is the recapture rate. I am pleased to say we did better than our business plan in the first quarter, recapturing approximately 46% of postpaid customers leaving the Nextel platform compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The majority of the retail and smaller business customers that we are currently recapturing to the Sprint postpaid platform are purchasing smartphones and so are incurring the $10 premium data add-on charge as they move. This means that ARPU for the customers should increase, however, their data usage is also expected to increase. So these customers are expected to achieve a similar gross margin to our Sprint postpaid platform base over time. 
While we are pleased with the current successes we are seeing in bringing the Nextel platform postpaid customers over to the Sprint platform, I do want to caution that the recapture rate could show large fluctuations over the next several quarters and therefore, it is a challenge to predict. The reason for this is that of the 3.8 million postpaid customers remaining on the Nextel platform at the end of the first quarter, approximately 3 million of those customers are corporate customers, and the timing of the migration or deactivation of larger accounts may cause large swings in the recapture rate. However, we expect that in total our Nextel recapture rate of our postpaid customers should be slightly better than our approximately 30% that was in our original business case.
As Dan discussed, the most significant growth we are seeing in the business is in postpaid ARPU. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU grew by over $4 or 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. 86% of Sprint platform postpaid handset sales were smartphones in the quarter, and approximately 69% of the Sprint postpaid handset base now have smartphones. We expect Sprint postpaid ARPU to show sequential growth each quarter throughout the year.
Turning to Slide 20. We are seeing growth not just in Sprint banded postpaid, but across the entire Sprint platform. Prepaid net adds on the Sprint platform were 870,000 with churn of just 2.92%, our lowest since the launch of prepaid on that platform in 2007. Prepaid has been a significant growth engine for our business, and in the first quarter those trends continued. Because of pricing actions taken last year, particularly in the Boost business with the $5 smartphone data charge implemented in October 2011, Sprint platform prepaid ARPU grew by almost 2% sequentially in the first quarter, despite the offsetting impacts of the Boost bill shrinkage program and assurance mix. The combination of growing ARPU and improving churn in the Boost and Virgin Mobile brands translated into very strong revenue growth of 9% sequentially and 43% year-over-year in prepaid on the Sprint platform. 
Now onto our wholesale and affiliate businesses, which is 100% on the Sprint platform. We are also seeing growth. Wholesale and affiliate net adds were 785,000 in the first quarter, up 102% for the first quarter a year ago. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues grew 39% sequentially in the first quarter and 49% year-over-year, reflecting both volume and ARPU rate improvements. 
The core business has good momentum. Our total customers on the Sprint platform increased by more than 1.9 million during the quarter or by 4% from the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. The growth across all our businesses on the Sprint platform contributed to nearly 5% sequential growth in total Sprint platform service revenues and 16% growth year-over-year. This positive performance continues to exceed our expectations and is contributing to our strong adjusted OIBDA results.
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on Slide 21. Total wireless cost of service in the first quarter was $2.3 billion or 32% of service revenues, which was flat on an absolute dollar basis and a 1 percentage point gross margin improvement sequentially. This was primarily due to an improvement in Sprint platform variable network expenses of 9% sequentially from $881 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential improvement in Sprint platform variable network expenses is due to a $40 million reduction in 4G roaming expenses as we shift to the flat rate unlimited use model with Clearwire, as well as a $15 million sequential decline in 3G roaming expenses. Sprint platform variable network expenses increased by just 10% year-over-year while Sprint platform service revenues increased by 16%. It is these trends along with the expected future removal of significant fixed costs associated with the Nextel platform that gives us the confidence in our long-term margin expansion goals.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the first quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $158 million or 9%. This sequential change was due to seasonally lower postpaid gross adds and upgrades. Our subsidy expense was also helped on a year-over-year basis by changes to our upgrade eligibility program made throughout last year, which helped reduced our total postpaid upgrade rate from almost 9% in the year-ago period to 7% in the first quarter. While growing handset subsidies continue to be an industry-wide issue, we are continually taking steps to improve our cost structure and the profitability of our customers. And in the first quarter, we saw improvements in our variable selling expenses, resulting from efforts to drive customers to our Sprint banded channels, which provides a better customer experience and could reduce our cost per acquisition by as much as $200. This is an example of our commitment to smart growth. On a year-over-year basis, we were able to increase Sprint platform postpaid gross adds by 10%, even as we reduce our total gross add volumes in third-party national retailers by 19%. 
Wireless selling, general and administrative costs improved by $90 million sequentially, an increase by $40 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. This year-over-year increase was primarily related to a $59 million incremental expense, which we discussed on the fourth quarter call. There is a full description in the 10-Q but simply put, when the third-party channels buy handsets direct from an OEM, the expense gets reported as a selling expense rather than in subsidy. This activity is incremental in the first quarter 2012 year-over-year comparative. Excluding this new expense, wireless selling expenses would have improved by 4% year-over-year despite a 10% increase in postpaid gross adds for the Sprint platform compared to the first quarter of 2011. 
Network Vision operating expenses were $104 million during the quarter compared to $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect that our Network Vision-related costs will show substantial sequential increases through the remainder of 2012.
Turning to Slide 22, wireless adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, a 57% sequential improvement. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was $1.2 billion, which was a 44% sequential improvement. Both results include $104 million of Network Vision expenses, which, which was a sequential increase in expense of $50 million. This performance was due to ARPU and subscriber growth, as well as lower overall volumes, particularly in upgrades and improvements to certain variable expenses. While we continue to expect to grow revenues and improve our cost structure, our expectation is that second quarter consolidated adjusted OIBDA will be lower than the first quarter due to an approximate doubling of Network Vision expenses in the second quarter.
Now switching to wireline. Adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter was $161 million, a 10% sequential decline and a 29% decline from a year ago. As you know, at the beginning of each year, we adjust the intercompany transfer rate between wireless and wireline to adhere to current market prices. And this resulted in a $53 million year-over-year decline in wireline revenues. 
Now let's move to cash and liquidity on Slide 23. We ended the first quarter with a total liquidity position of $8.8 billion, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.6 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility. During the quarter, we raised approximately $2 billion through private placements. The combined offering was oversubscribed and the price of the guaranteed notes was roughly 200 basis points, better than comparable notes issued in the fourth quarter. This vote of confidence from debt holders enhanced our liquidity position and strengthens our belief in our ability to raise capital to support our investment in Network Vision and other high-return projects.
We also continue to pursue vendor financing in the range of $1 billion to $3 billion, and our discussions are going well. Our accrued capital expenditures were $800 million in the first quarter, which excluded $115 million in capitalized interest and included $315 million of Network Vision capital compared to $900 million in the fourth quarter and $555 million in the first quarter of 2011. 
Rebanding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was $58 million in the first quarter of 2012. We estimate that we have approximately $550 million to $650 million in rebanding spend left, which will be split between 2012 and 2013 and will be focused on the U.S. borders. 
Free cash flow was $138 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $257 million in the fourth quarter and $178 million in the first quarter of 2011. Going forward, we expect that free cash flow will be negative as investments in Network Vision accelerate and inventory increases as a result of new LTE handset launches. 
Moving to Slide 24, I'll close with our updated outlook for the year. The positive revenue and subscriber trends in our core business, as well as continued steps towards margin improvement, give us confidence in our outlook for the year, and we expect that adjusted OIBDA will be at the high end of the $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion range that we discussed with you on the fourth quarter call. Second quarter adjusted OIBDA is expected to be lower than the first quarter due to increasing Network Vision spend. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $6 billion. We believe we have made positive progress against our business plan in the first quarter, executing well on Network Vision and making the kind of steady, ongoing progress toward our goals as we invest in the future of our business. 
Our balanced approach to top line growth and profitability was demonstrated by our subscriber and revenue growth on the Sprint platform. We continue to make progress on improving our cost structure in Network Vision. We are very optimistic about the future and, we want to thank the Sprint workforce, both in-house and contracted labor for their hard work and dedication to meeting our goals.

There are clearly seasonal benefits in the second quarter. We'll have more benefits also from the iPhone, a higher percentage of our customers being on contract than we've had traditionally continuing improving overall CSAT and what have you. One of the challenges on churn has been the fact that as you know, in 2011, part of what's driving our profitability performance and our ARPU growth is we've been increasing prices, increasing fees. We did away with loyalty programs, which of course, drove more upgrades, so you're seeing more favorability on the upgrade side, which has an impact on the bottom line. But of course, you'll see some pressure on the churn side. So what we're trying to do, Jonathan, is find kind of that optimal point, knowing it will give us some pressure on churn to do some things that are, if you will, more creative to the bottom line and give us more revenue and profitability. But generally, you should see postpaid churn on the Sprint platform begin to improve going forward. Now on the Nextel postpaid platform, it will go in the other direction. As we accelerate the decommissioning of the iDEN network, you'll see that, if you will, as a -- from a churn point of view as a headwind but continued improvement on the Sprint platform."

With respect to the, I think, it's kind of the -- the question has to do with potential ARPU uptick or what have you given smartphone penetration. Roughly 69% of our customer base currently has a smartphone. So there's an opportunity, obviously, to take that north of 69%, and some of those customers actually have smartphones but don't yet pay the $10 additional data charge because they bought those smartphones before we implemented the increase. And of course, the increase only went to new customers and customers that upgraded. So there is potential there, but also keep in mind that in the year-over-year comps, it will get harder later in the year in terms of looking at things like revenue growth or ARPU growth because you'll be -- because the increases went into effect in the first quarter of 2011. So we began to see the ARPU increases all through '11. So anyway, as you get later in the year, the comps get more difficult. But net-net, we have about 30% of our subscriber base on phones that still don't have smartphones, and there's obviously a potential to have them upgrade to smart devices, as well as, obviously, the lion's share of our gross adds, new customers coming in are on the iPhone and other smartphones."

In terms of our zonings are ahead, but one of the things you find in some jurisdictions you don't need to do specific zoning. Leasing, a couple of things on that. We did do the deals with the major tower companies last year, and that makes approximately 50% of our tower portfolio. And what we have to do there to get a leasing complete is we have to submit basically, drawings that is more paperwork with them. We don't have to negotiate rates and rent so -- or timing. And so those generally go quite a bit smoother and faster in terms of the leasing. So we see that going well. It's the other 50% that are out and, let's say, on the top of a fast food restaurant or in a farmer's field, that's where we have to go out and negotiate both rate and then go back with drawings. So those take a little bit longer, and you can have a headwind if there's difficulty in negotiating a lease, right? That's one. The other question you had about some headwinds. On a daily basis, there's things that go very, very well; and on a daily basis, there's things that make you put your head in your hands. But there's not been any significant issue that causes a setback. There are some daily ones. And so just to react to the one that I know is out there that we've -- that towers have been falling down, we had early on some of our towers that we determined we needed to have stronger brackets, and we ended up going back to those and putting in some tighter criteria for certification before we would go and do a mount. And so, yes, that caused a brief delay, but nothing that would affect the overall outcome of the project. So you have this -- the pop up; generally, this one got an awful lot of press, I think, and it doesn't affect the overall program, but sure enough, we did have to put tighter certification."

Then Steve Elfman, our President of Network Operations and Wholesale, will provide an update on Network Vision. And finally, our CFO, Joe Euteneuer, will cover financial results. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I do want to point out that in our remarks this morning we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our annual report on Form 10-K.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the first quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors. 
Let's move onto earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the first quarter were $0.29 compared to $0.43 in the fourth quarter and $0.15 in the year-ago period. The loss per share in the current period included depreciation of approximately $543 million, or negative $0.18 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform, of which approximately 9,600 sites are expected to occur by the end of the third quarter of this year. The current period also included a onetime benefit of $170 million or approximately $0.06 per share related to the spectrum hosting contract termination with LightSquared.
We recorded a net tax expense of $37 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."

As I discussed on last quarter's call, 2012 marks the second phase in our company's turnaround effort, investment for future growth while we maintain our focus on our operations and execution of the Network Vision program. 
As we will describe this morning, we've made progress against our goals. If you turn to Slide 6, please, I'll recap some of the quarter's highlights before reviewing performance across our 3 key priorities, which are generating cash, improving the customer experience and building the brand. 
Adjusted OIBDA of just over $1.2 billion exceeded both our internal projections and Street consensus. Adjusted OIBDA margin of 15.2% represents a sequential improvement of 440 basis points from the fourth quarter. We delivered another successful iPhone quarter. We activated over 1.5 million devices in the quarter with 44% of those being new customers to Sprint, a continuing proof point of the strength of the Sprint brand and the compelling combination of an unsurpassed customer experience with the only truly unlimited data, talk and text plan. 
I can also report another record quarter for ARPU rate growth for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Year-over-year, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU grew $4.03, the highest increase on record for any major U.S. wireless company. Today we're announcing our sixth consecutive quarter of over 1 million total net customer additions and our eighth consecutive quarter of positive net additions on our Sprint platform postpaid business. Our 56 million total customers establishes a new all-time Sprint record. 
And finally, we made continued progress on the Network Vision deployment. We announced and we're on plan to launch 6 major LTE markets by mid-year.
If you would please turn to Slide 7. I'll organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities, which I just mentioned. Let me begin with cash. We improved our liquidity position by generating $138 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter and by completing a $2 billion debt raise. Joe will provide more details on our liquidity and capital structure, and we ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.6 billion, adequate to address our short-term needs. 
Higher than expected quarterly adjusted OIBDA performance was aided by strong top line growth, fueled largely by strength in our postpaid ARPU rate. This quarter represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total operating revenues and our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Total operating revenues are up 5% year-over-year. Sprint platform service revenues reached their highest-ever levels at $6.5 billion, an increase of approximately 16% over the year-ago period and approximately 5% sequentially, driven by the growth in the postpaid ARPU rate, as well as growth in subscribers across all areas of the business: Postpaid, prepaid and wholesale. 
As I said earlier, the Sprint brand postpaid quarterly ARPU rate grew year-over-year by $4.03 or approximately 7% year-over-year and $1.33 sequentially or approximately 2% as we continue to see the benefits of smartphone adoption and the $10 premium data charge implemented in 2011. 
As I transition to a discussion of our customer experience and brand results, I'd like to begin with an overview of the iPhone, which benefits both areas. Turning to Slide 8. An important near-term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that are new customers to Sprint because they represent new sources of revenue. In the first quarter, 44% of our iPhone activations were new customers, up from 40% in the fourth quarter, above our internal expectations and well in excess of our competitors' results.
Additionally, 40% of new Sprint iPhone users reported breaking a contract with their prior carrier to switch to Sprint, evidence that our Sprint brand hallmarks of value and simplicity are resonating with consumers. Our study also found that over 60% of our iPhone customers who left another carrier to come to Sprint wouldn't have considered switching to us if we did not carry the iPhone.
Longer-term, the most important indicator of success with the iPhone is the anticipated lower churn rate of iPhone customers. All of our early-life iPhone customer experience metrics are positive, potential early indicators of longer-term churn benefits. To date, we are experiencing low early-life calls to care and less than half of the returns and exchanges for iPhone users compared to other smartphone users. The evidence so far supports our decision to carry the iPhone.
Turning to Slide 9. In the customer experience, I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter we achieved a new best-ever level for customer calls to care across our customer base. Calls for postpaid subscriber are down over 10% from last year. We're also making notable improvements with our prepaid base with calls per subscriber down 19% from last year. Third-party overall customer satisfaction measures remain at best-ever levels. And we're not buying satisfaction. Customer care credits in the first quarter were the lowest or best for any quarter on record. 
Third-party accolades continue to validate success across our brand and product portfolios. In the quarter, 2 of our prepaid brands, Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile, were named 2012 Customer Service Champions by J.D. Power and Associates among 800 brands considered. And our brands were recognized 3 times by J.D. Power: Sprint, for highest satisfaction with the purchase experience among full-service wireless providers; Virgin Mobile, for highest-ranked customer service performance among noncontract wireless providers; and Boost Mobile, for highest satisfaction with the purchase experience among noncontract wireless providers. Sprint was recently recognized by ATLANTIC-ACM for excellence in our wholesale business, for network, provisioning, customer service and sales force. And finally, Frost & Sullivan identified Sprint as an excellent example of an end-to-end mobile solution provider for the small business sector.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, Sprint platform postpaid churn remained elevated in the first quarter at 2%, largely due to the involuntary churn impact of some acquisition activities in the second and third quarters of 2011. We continue to expect a step-down in Sprint platform postpaid involuntary churn beginning in the second quarter and improvements in voluntary churn longer term driven by the ongoing improvements in our customer experience, the iPhone and the fact that our percentage of postpaid base on contract is the highest it has been in 4 years. 
As we discussed last quarter, Nextel platform churn is ramping up as we inform customers of our plans to decommission the Nextel platform. In the first quarter, we recaptured 46% of the postpaid customers who left the Nextel platform for our Sprint postpaid platform, better than our expectations. Unique Sprint Direct Connect devices and other Sprint devices give customers strong choices as they make their decision to leave the Nextel platform. 
We're also pleased to report that prepaid churn for the quarter is down both year-over-year and sequentially and at 3.61%, represents our best prepaid churn performance in 6.5 years.
Turning to Slide 10. As I've mentioned before, perhaps the most important brand metric is the Net Promoter Score. In a well-known independent survey, Net Promoter Scores again indicate Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major wireless carriers to show improvement year-over-year. One of the most tangible proof points of our brand improvement is our net porting position for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Being net port positive means more of our competitors' customers switch to Sprint than switch from Sprint to a competitor. Before the third quarter of 2010, the Sprint platform had never been net port positive, and now we've done it for 7 quarters in a row. We were also net port positive for our entire postpaid business for Sprint and Nextel, and we've now achieved being net port positive for all of our postpaid business for 4 of the last 6 quarters, the only 4 quarters of postpaid net port positive performance in company history.
Please turn to Slide 11. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience in the brand, Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 263,000 represent our eighth consecutive quarter of positive net adds. Sprint platform postpaid gross add performance is also particularly noteworthy. The first quarter represents a 10% year-over-year growth and our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Even though the iPad contributed materially to Verizon's and AT&T's postpaid performance, barring an unanticipated number from T-Mobile U.S.A., our first quarter Sprint platform postpaid share of gross adds or SoGA is the company's best quarter ever. We're also pleased with the continued growth of our prepaid business with Q1 being our ninth consecutive quarter of over 2 million gross adds. 
Finally, we had another quarter of strong growth in our wholesale business with our fourth consecutive quarter of at least 500,000 net adds. Our total company net adds of 1.1 million in the quarter brings us to over 56 million customers served, another all-time company record.
Turning to Slide 12. Another pillar of the Sprint brand is innovation. We recently announced the upcoming availability of some impressive new devices, including the LG Viper 4G LTE, a feature-packed ULE platinum, eco-friendly smartphone that will operate on our new LTE network; ZTE Fury, a kid-friendly Android phone at a compelling price point of $19.99; and of course, the HTC EVO 4G LTE, with the first-ever HD voice capability. 
We also continue to innovate in business solutions, evidenced by the recent launch of Sprint Complete Collaboration, a cloud-hosted unified communications offering for our enterprise customers. This quarter we also created New Ventures, an organization focused on bringing new solutions with successful open ecosystem platforms to the wholesale and global marketplace. We recently announced an agreement with Chrysler to act as a strategic wireless partner for the Chrysler Group LLC's Uconnect Program. 
A Q1 report from the patent board recognizes Sprint as one of the top 10 innovators in the global telecom and communications industry with over 450 U.S. patents granted in the last year. We were one of only 2 wireless carriers to be named to the top 10.
Turning to Slide 13. I'm pleased to announce that 4G WiMAX is coming to both Virgin Mobile USA and Boost Mobile later this quarter, and we will announce more details at a later date. 
Please turn to my final slide, #14. On last quarter's call I discussed the end of Phase 1 of the Sprint turnaround in 2011, and the first quarter of 2012 began Phase 2. It has been a tough road these past 4 years and there is still much hard work left to do. Everyone at Sprint realizes we have a long way to go to deliver the level of financial performance we aspire to, but I am pleased with our progress and in particular, with our OIBDA performance and our Network Vision progress, which Steve Elfman will now report on. Thank you."
417206,183739602,289033,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2012",2012-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Dan. I'm pleased to be here to discuss our progress to date. The Network Vision project is progressing well, and I'm confident about hitting the targets we've communicated to you.

The Network Vision project is progressing well, and I'm confident about hitting the targets we've communicated to you. 
The next slide is a Network Vision scorecard we developed, which I'll be sharing with you every quarter throughout the implementation, and is similar to my daily internal flash report. We have made good progress during the first quarter, and the project is hitting its stride. We have ramped the resources and currently have over 6,000 people working on the project both internal and through our vendor partners. We expect no issues with resources in any market. 
A critical part of this project is building a good pipeline of sites for construction. To date, we have completed zoning on approximately 9,700 sites and leasing on close to 7,700 sites. As we have discussed with you, the zoning and leasing process had the potential for the greatest unknowns, so we are pleased with the pipeline. Over 3,200 sites are now in notice-to-proceed status, meaning we have completed all steps required prior to starting actual construction of the site. And we have started work on approximately 3,000 sites in 17 markets.
We continue to expect to launch LTE coverage in 6 metro areas by mid-year and have 12,000 new Network Vision sites on air by the end of the year. We now have over 600 new Network Vision sites on air, and the early results of site performance are meeting our expectations. On Network Vision sites, we are seeing a doubling of coverage range compared to the legacy network. And when we light up the Network Vision tower, in about 80% of the cases we are repurposing about 2.5 to 3 megahertz of our 800 megahertz spectrum to voice on the Sprint platform. So our customers in those markets are beginning to see improvements in their service. 
In the early stages, we are seeing a reduction to in-footprint roaming, which is meeting our expectations of performance. As we build out the network and retune the individual sites to their clusters, we'd expect this performance to further improve.
We are completely done with the field testing and the technology works. For sites on air, we're seeing improved performance of radios, antenna and backhaul, all of which are meeting our performance objectives. Based on the testing of our 5-by-5 megahertz network and the size of our customer base, we expect our network speeds to be competitive.
If we turn to the next slide. The other and equally important project within Network Vision is the thinning of the Nextel network prior to the complete shutdown in 2013. We began the process with a trial in one market in the first quarter and now are underway nationally. The network thinning process is essentially a process of shutting down sites and recalibrating the network to support lower traffic volumes.  The Nextel platform was built to support approximately 20 million customers, and as of the end of the first quarter supports approximately 5.4 million customers. 
Through the network thinning process, we go into market and turn off certain sites overnight and then retune the network with the expectation that we continue to provide equivalent on-street coverage quality in the majority of cases. To date, we have nearly 1,300 Nextel sites off air. The process is going well, and we now expect that we will have the 9,600 sites planned for this year off air by the end of Q3. The process is not in itself expected to have any meaningful churn or migration impact but should provide immediate savings on utilities and maintenance and on rent going forward, all of which are in the Network Vision forecast. 
I'm very pleased with the progress we have made and am confident that over the coming quarters, we will be able to continue to report strong progress and performance on the build while remaining on schedule and on budget. 
I'll now turn it over to Joe to go through the financial results."
417206,183739602,289033,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2012",2012-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Across all areas of the business, the first quarter showed steady execution. I am pleased to say we are progressing well against our plan for the year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2012 is a year of",2286,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Across all areas of the business, the first quarter showed steady execution. I am pleased to say we are progressing well against our plan for the year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2012 is a year of execution and continued focus on profitability. And our first quarter results reflect this commitment and discipline. We are pleased with our results in the first quarter, which show progress against the 3 most important financial measures of our business: Growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong conversion of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. 
Our core business is showing growth in both subscribers and service revenues. Sprint platform postpaid gross adds of 1.8 million grew 10% year-over-year, showing a growing market share in a soft quarter for acquisition throughout the industry. This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to smart growth, producing steadily improving results in our ongoing core business in a disciplined manner. Not only did we increase gross adds year-over-year, we did so while taking actions to support a significant shift in gross add volume to our most cost-effective channels, which helps to improve our variable selling expense. Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 263,000 grew 4% year-over-year. 
As we expected, the net adds number during the quarter continued to be affected by the carryover of the churn bubble we discussed on last quarter's call. We believe the impact of the higher churn we have seen in recent quarters is largely behind us. And we have seen involuntary churn begin to improve in Q2. Now that we are largely past this issue, we expect to approach normal seasonality for involuntary churn, which based on our historical trends, is typically worth approximately 10 basis points in the second quarter. And we would expect our sequential improvement in Q2 to be better than this.
I want to make sure everyone understands the expected dynamics of customer growth in 2012. Our momentum in the core business is expected to continue, and we expect to show positive postpaid net adds on the Sprint platform in every quarter in 2012. We will remain disciplined in our pursuit of subscriber growth, and we will not chase unprofitable or marginally profitable gross adds. And we will continue to look for opportunities to improve the cost of customer acquisition as we grow our core business. 
Regarding the Nextel platform, we expect the trend of negative postpaid net adds to increase every quarter throughout the year as we continue our migration efforts. The exact timing of the churn for migration of larger accounts is somewhat unpredictable as we go through the process with our business customers. However, consistent with our Network Vision plan, we expect the negative trend on the Nextel platform to increase throughout the year as we prepare to fully decommission the network in 2013.
When looking at the Nextel platform, the most important metric to measure, the health and strength of our ongoing business, is the recapture rate. I am pleased to say we did better than our business plan in the first quarter, recapturing approximately 46% of postpaid customers leaving the Nextel platform compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The majority of the retail and smaller business customers that we are currently recapturing to the Sprint postpaid platform are purchasing smartphones and so are incurring the $10 premium data add-on charge as they move. This means that ARPU for the customers should increase.  However, their data usage is also expected to increase. So these customers are expected to achieve a similar gross margin to our Sprint postpaid platform base over time. 
While we are pleased with the current successes we are seeing in bringing the Nextel platform postpaid customers over to the Sprint platform, I do want to caution that the recapture rate could show large fluctuations over the next several quarters, and therefore, it is a challenge to predict. The reason for this is that of the 3.8 million postpaid customers remaining on the Nextel platform at the end of the first quarter, approximately 3 million of those customers are corporate customers, and the timing of the migration or deactivation of larger accounts may cause large swings in the recapture rate. However, we expect that in total our Nextel recapture rate of our postpaid customers should be slightly better than our approximately 30% that was in our original business case.
As Dan discussed, the most significant growth we are seeing in the business is in postpaid ARPU. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU grew by over $4 or 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. 86% of Sprint platform postpaid handset sales were smartphones in the quarter, and approximately 69% of the Sprint postpaid handset base now have smartphones. We expect Sprint postpaid ARPU to show sequential growth each quarter throughout the year.
Turning to Slide 20. We are seeing growth not just in Sprint banded postpaid, but across the entire Sprint platform. Prepaid net adds on the Sprint platform were 870,000 with churn of just 2.92%, our lowest since the launch of prepaid on that platform in 2007. Prepaid has been a significant growth engine for our business, and in the first quarter those trends continued. Because of pricing actions taken last year, particularly in the Boost business with the $5 smartphone data charge implemented in October of 2011, Sprint platform prepaid ARPU grew by almost 2% sequentially in the first quarter, despite the offsetting impacts of the Boost bill shrinkage program and assurance mix. The combination of growing ARPU and improving churn in the Boost and Virgin Mobile brands translated into very strong revenue growth of 9% sequentially and 43% year-over-year in prepaid on the Sprint platform. 
Now on to our wholesale and affiliate businesses, which is 100% on the Sprint platform. We are also seeing growth. Wholesale and affiliate net adds were 785,000 in the first quarter, up 102% for the first quarter a year ago. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues grew 39% sequentially in the first quarter and 49% year-over-year, reflecting both volume and ARPU rate improvements. 
The core business has good momentum. Our total customers on the Sprint platform increased by more than 1.9 million during the quarter or by 4% from the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. The growth across all our businesses on the Sprint platform contributed to nearly 5% sequential growth in total Sprint platform service revenues and 16% growth year-over-year. This positive performance continues to exceed our expectations and is contributing to our strong adjusted OIBDA results.
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on Slide 21. Total wireless cost of service in the first quarter was $2.3 billion or 32% of service revenues, which was flat on an absolute dollar basis and a 1 percentage point gross margin improvement sequentially. This was primarily due to an improvement in Sprint platform variable network expenses of 9% sequentially from $881 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential improvement in Sprint platform variable network expenses is due to a $40 million reduction in 4G roaming expenses as we shift to the flat rate unlimited use model with Clearwire, as well as a $15 million sequential decline in 3G roaming expenses. Sprint platform variable network expenses increased by just 10% year-over-year while Sprint platform service revenues increased by 16%. It is these trends along with the expected future removal of significant fixed cost associated with the Nextel platform that gives us the confidence in our long-term margin expansion goals.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the first quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $158 million or 9%. This sequential change was due to seasonally lower postpaid gross adds and upgrades. Our subsidy expense was also helped on a year-over-year basis by changes to our upgrade eligibility program made throughout last year, which helped reduce our total postpaid upgrade rate from almost 9% in the year-ago period to 7% in the first quarter. While growing handset subsidies continue to be an industry-wide issue, we are continually taking steps to improve our cost structure and the profitability of our customers. And in the first quarter, we saw improvements in our variable selling expenses, resulting from efforts to drive customers to our Sprint banded channels, which provides a better customer experience and could reduce our cost per acquisition by as much as $200. This is an example of our commitment to smart growth. On a year-over-year basis, we were able to increase Sprint platform postpaid gross adds by 10%, even as we reduced our total gross add volumes in third-party national retailers by 19%. 
Wireless selling, general and administrative cost improved by $19 million sequentially, and increased by $40 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. This year-over-year increase was primarily related to a $59 million incremental expense, which we discussed on the fourth quarter call. There is a full description in the 10-Q, but simply put, when the third-party channels buy handsets direct from an OEM, the expense gets reported as a selling expense rather than in subsidy. This activity is incremental in the first quarter 2012 year-over-year comparative. Excluding this new expense, wireless selling expenses would have improved by 4% year-over-year despite a 10% increase in postpaid gross adds for the Sprint platform compared to the first quarter of 2011. 
Network Vision operating expenses were $104 million during the quarter compared to $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect that our Network Vision-related cost will show substantial sequential increases through the remainder of 2012.
Turning to Slide 22. Wireless adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, a 57% sequential improvement. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was $1.2 billion, which was a 44% sequential improvement. Both results include $104 million of Network Vision expenses, which was a sequential increase in expense of $50 million. This performance was due to ARPU and subscriber growth, as well as lower overall volumes, particularly in upgrades, and improvements to certain variable expenses. While we continue to expect to grow revenues and improve our cost structure, our expectation is that second quarter consolidated adjusted OIBDA will be lower than the first quarter due to an approximate doubling of Network Vision expenses in the second quarter.
Now switching to wireline. Adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter was $161 million, a 10% sequential decline and a 29% decline from a year ago. As you know, at the beginning of each year, we adjust the intercompany transfer rate between wireless and wireline to adhere to current market prices. And this resulted in a $53 million year-over-year decline in wireline revenues. 
Now let's move to cash and liquidity on Slide 23. We ended the first quarter with a total liquidity position of $8.8 billion, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.6 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility. During the quarter, we raised approximately $2 billion through private placements. The combined offering was oversubscribed, and the price of the guaranteed notes was roughly 200 basis points, better than comparable notes issued in the fourth quarter. This vote of confidence from debt holders enhanced our liquidity position and strengthens our belief in our ability to raise capital to support our investment in Network Vision and other high-return projects.
We also continue to pursue vendor financing in the range of $1 billion to $3 billion, and our discussions are going well. Our accrued capital expenditures were $800 million in the first quarter, which excluded $115 million in capitalized interest and included $315 million of Network Vision capital compared to $900 million in the fourth quarter and $555 million in the first quarter of 2011. 
Rebanding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was $58 million in the first quarter of 2012. We estimate that we have approximately $550 million to $650 million in rebanding spend left, which will be split between 2012 and 2013 and will be focused on the U.S. borders. 
Free cash flow was $138 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $257 million in the fourth quarter and $178 million in the first quarter of 2011. Going forward, we expect that free cash flow will be negative as investments in Network Vision accelerate and inventory increases as a result of new LTE handset launches. 
Moving to Slide 24. I'll close with our updated outlook for the year. The positive revenue and subscriber trends in our core business, as well as continued steps towards margin improvement, give us confidence in our outlook for the year, and we expect that adjusted OIBDA will be at the high end of the $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion range that we discussed with you on the fourth quarter call. Second quarter adjusted OIBDA is expected to be lower than the first quarter due to increasing Network Vision spend. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $6 billion. We believe we have made positive progress against our business plan in the first quarter, executing well on Network Vision and making the kind of steady, ongoing progress toward our goals as we invest in the future of our business. 
Our balanced approach to top line growth and profitability was demonstrated by our subscriber and revenue growth on the Sprint platform. We continue to make progress on improving our cost structure in Network Vision. We are very optimistic about the future and, we want to thank the Sprint workforce, both in-house and contracted labor, for their hard work and dedication to meeting our goals. 
I'll turn the call back over to Brad for Q&A."

That we haven't given specific guidance with respect to churn in the second quarter but just said that you could expect more than, let's say, a 10 basis point improvement in Q2 from Q1.  Because number one, if you will, the -- most of the pig is through the python on this involuntary churn issue that we have. There are clearly seasonal benefits in the second quarter. We'll have more benefits also from the iPhone, a higher percentage of our customers being on contract than we've had traditionally, continuing improving overall CSAT and what have you. One of the challenges on churn has been the fact that as you know, in 2011, part of what's driving our profitability performance and our ARPU growth is we've been increasing prices, increasing fees. We did away with loyalty programs, which, of course, drove more upgrades, so you're seeing more favorability on the upgrade side, which has an impact on the bottom line. But of course, you'll see some pressure on the churn side. So what we're trying to do, Jonathan, is find kind of that optimal point, knowing it will give us some pressure on churn to do some things that are, if you will, more accretive to the bottom line and give us more revenue and profitability. But generally, you should see postpaid churn on the Sprint platform begin to improve going forward. Now on the Nextel postpaid platform, it'll go in the other direction. As we accelerate the decommissioning of the iDEN network, you'll see that, if you will, as a -- from a churn point of view as a headwind but continued improvement on the Sprint platform."

We're right on plan as far as we're concerned on Network Vision, so we're not adjusting any of our guidance yet, even though things are going well. With respect to the -- I think it's kind of the -- the question has to do with potential ARPU uptick or what have you given smartphone penetration. Roughly 69% of our customer base currently has a smartphone. So there's an opportunity, obviously, to take that north of 69%.  And some of those customers actually have smartphones but don't yet pay the $10 additional data charge because they bought those smartphones before we implemented the increase. And of course, the increase only went to new customers and customers that upgraded. So there is potential there, but also keep in mind that in the year-over-year comps, it'll get harder later in the year in terms of looking at things like revenue growth or ARPU growth because you'll be -- because the increases went into effect in the first quarter of 2011. So we began to see the ARPU increases all through '11. So anyway, as you get later in the year, the comps get more difficult. But net-net, we have about 30% of our subscriber base on phones that still don't have smartphones, and there's obviously a potential to have them upgrade to smart devices, as well as, obviously, the lion's share of our gross adds, new customers coming in, are on the iPhone and other smartphones."

In terms of -- our zonings are ahead, but one of the things you find, in some jurisdictions you don't need to do specific zoning. Leasing, a couple of things on that. We did do the deals with the major tower companies last year, and that makes up approximately 50% of our tower portfolio. And what we have to do there to get a leasing complete is we have to submit basically drawings that is more paperwork with them. We don't have to negotiate rates and rent, so -- or timing. And so those generally go quite a bit smoother and faster in terms of the leasing. So we see that going well. It's the other 50% that are out and, let's say, on the top of a fast-food restaurant or in a farmer's field, that's where we have to go out and negotiate both rate and then go back with drawings. So those take a little bit longer, and you can have a headwind if there's difficulty in negotiating a lease, right? That's one. The other question you had about some headwinds. On a daily basis, there's things that go very, very well. And on a daily basis, there's things that make you put your head in your hands. But there's not been any significant issue that causes a setback. There are some daily ones. And so just to react to the one that I know is out there that we've -- that towers have been falling down, we had early on some of our towers that we determined we needed to have stronger brackets, and we ended up going back to those and putting in some tighter criteria for certification before we would go and do a mount. And so, yes, that caused a brief delay, but nothing that would affect the overall outcome of the project. So you have these that pop up, generally. This one got an awful lot of press, I think, and it doesn't affect the overall program, but sure enough, we did have to put tighter certification in."

Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I do want to point out that in our remarks this morning we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our annual report on Form 10-K.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the first quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors. 
Let's move onto earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the first quarter were $0.29 compared to $0.43 in the fourth quarter and $0.15 in the year-ago period. The loss per share in the current period included depreciation of approximately $543 million, or negative $0.18 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform, of which approximately 9,600 sites are expected to occur by the end of the third quarter of this year. The current period also included a onetime benefit of $170 million or approximately $0.06 per share related to the spectrum hosting contract termination with LightSquared.
We recorded a net tax expense of $37 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."

As I discussed on last quarter's call, 2012 marks the second phase in our company's turnaround effort, investment for future growth while we maintain our focus on our operations and execution of the Network Vision program. 
As we will describe this morning, we've made progress against our goals. If you turn to Slide 6, please, I'll recap some of the quarter's highlights before reviewing performance across our 3 key priorities, which are generating cash, improving the customer experience and building the brand. 
Adjusted OIBDA of just over $1.2 billion exceeded both our internal projections and Street consensus. Adjusted OIBDA margin of 15.2% represents a sequential improvement of 440 basis points from the fourth quarter. We delivered another successful iPhone quarter. We activated over 1.5 million devices in the quarter with 44% of those being new customers to Sprint, a continuing proof point of the strength of the Sprint brand and the compelling combination of an unsurpassed customer experience with the only truly unlimited data, talk and text plan. 
I can also report another record quarter for ARPU rate growth for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Year-over-year, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU grew $4.03, the highest increase on record for any major U.S. wireless company. Today we're announcing our sixth consecutive quarter of over 1 million total net customer additions and our eighth consecutive quarter of positive net additions on our Sprint platform postpaid business. Our 56 million total customers establishes a new all-time Sprint record. 
And finally, we made continued progress on the Network Vision deployment. We announced and we're on plan to launch 6 major LTE markets by mid-year.
If you would please turn to Slide 7. I'll organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities, which I just mentioned. Let me begin with cash. We improved our liquidity position by generating $138 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter and by completing a $2 billion debt raise. Joe will provide more details on our liquidity and capital structure, and we ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.6 billion, adequate to address our short-term needs. 
Higher than expected quarterly adjusted OIBDA performance was aided by strong top line growth, fueled largely by strength in our postpaid ARPU rate. This quarter represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total operating revenues and our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Total operating revenues are up 5% year-over-year. Sprint platform service revenues reached their highest-ever levels at $6.5 billion, an increase of approximately 16% over the year-ago period and approximately 5% sequentially, driven by the growth in the postpaid ARPU rate, as well as growth in subscribers across all areas of the business: Postpaid, prepaid and wholesale. 
As I said earlier, the Sprint brand postpaid quarterly ARPU rate grew year-over-year by $4.03 or approximately 7% year-over-year and $1.33 sequentially or approximately 2% as we continue to see the benefits of smartphone adoption and the $10 premium data charge implemented in 2011. 
As I transition to a discussion of our customer experience and brand results, I'd like to begin with an overview of the iPhone, which benefits both areas. Turning to Slide 8. An important near-term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that are new customers to Sprint because they represent new sources of revenue. In the first quarter, 44% of our iPhone activations were new customers, up from 40% in the fourth quarter, above our internal expectations and well in excess of our competitors' results.
Additionally, 40% of new Sprint iPhone users reported breaking a contract with their prior carrier to switch to Sprint, evidence that our Sprint brand hallmarks of value and simplicity are resonating with consumers. Our study also found that over 60% of our iPhone customers who left another carrier to come to Sprint wouldn't have considered switching to us if we did not carry the iPhone.
Longer-term, the most important indicator of success with the iPhone is the anticipated lower churn rate of iPhone customers. All of our early-life iPhone customer experience metrics are positive, potential early indicators of longer-term churn benefits. To date, we are experiencing low early-life calls to care and less than half of the returns and exchanges for iPhone users compared to other smartphone users. The evidence so far supports our decision to carry the iPhone.
Turning to Slide 9. In the customer experience, I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter we achieved a new best-ever level for customer calls to care across our customer base. Calls for postpaid subscriber are down over 10% from last year. We're also making notable improvements with our prepaid base with calls per subscriber down 19% from last year. Third-party overall customer satisfaction measures remain at best-ever levels. And we're not buying satisfaction. Customer care credits in the first quarter were the lowest or best for any quarter on record. 
Third-party accolades continue to validate success across our brand and product portfolios. In the quarter, 2 of our prepaid brands, Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile, were named 2012 Customer Service Champions by J.D. Power and Associates among 800 brands considered. And our brands were recognized 3 times by J.D. Power: Sprint, for highest satisfaction with the purchase experience among full-service wireless providers; Virgin Mobile, for highest-ranked customer service performance among noncontract wireless providers; and Boost Mobile, for highest satisfaction with the purchase experience among noncontract wireless providers. Sprint was recently recognized by ATLANTIC-ACM for excellence in our wholesale business, for network, provisioning, customer service and sales force. And finally, Frost & Sullivan identified Sprint as an excellent example of an end-to-end mobile solution provider for the small business sector.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, Sprint platform postpaid churn remained elevated in the first quarter at 2%, largely due to the involuntary churn impact of some acquisition activities in the second and third quarters of 2011. We continue to expect a step-down in Sprint platform postpaid involuntary churn beginning in the second quarter and improvements in voluntary churn longer term driven by the ongoing improvements in our customer experience, the iPhone and the fact that our percentage of postpaid base on contract is the highest it has been in 4 years. 
As we discussed last quarter, Nextel platform churn is ramping up as we inform customers of our plans to decommission the Nextel platform. In the first quarter, we recaptured 46% of the postpaid customers who left the Nextel platform for our Sprint postpaid platform, better than our expectations. Unique Sprint Direct Connect devices and other Sprint devices give customers strong choices as they make their decision to leave the Nextel platform. 
We're also pleased to report that prepaid churn for the quarter is down both year-over-year and sequentially and at 3.61%, represents our best prepaid churn performance in 6.5 years.
Turning to Slide 10. As I've mentioned before, perhaps the most important brand metric is the Net Promoter Score. In a well-known independent survey, Net Promoter Scores again indicate Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major wireless carriers to show improvement year-over-year. One of the most tangible proof points of our brand improvement is our net porting position for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Being net port positive means more of our competitors' customers switch to Sprint than switch from Sprint to a competitor. Before the third quarter of 2010, the Sprint platform had never been net port positive, and now we've done it for 7 quarters in a row. We were also net port positive for our entire postpaid business for Sprint and Nextel, and we've now achieved being net port positive for all of our postpaid business for 4 of the last 6 quarters, the only 4 quarters of postpaid net port positive performance in company history.
Please turn to Slide 11. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience in the brand, Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 263,000 represent our eighth consecutive quarter of positive net adds. Sprint platform postpaid gross add performance is also particularly noteworthy. The first quarter represents a 10% year-over-year growth and our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Even though the iPad contributed materially to Verizon's and AT&T's postpaid performance, barring an unanticipated number from T-Mobile U.S.A., our first quarter Sprint platform postpaid share of gross adds or SoGA is the company's best quarter ever. We're also pleased with the continued growth of our prepaid business with Q1 being our ninth consecutive quarter of over 2 million gross adds. 
Finally, we had another quarter of strong growth in our wholesale business with our fourth consecutive quarter of at least 500,000 net adds. Our total company net adds of 1.1 million in the quarter brings us to over 56 million customers served, another all-time company record.
Turning to Slide 12. Another pillar of the Sprint brand is innovation. We recently announced the upcoming availability of some impressive new devices, including the LG Viper 4G LTE, a feature-packed ULE platinum, eco-friendly smartphone that will operate on our new LTE network; ZTE Fury, a kid-friendly Android phone at a compelling price point of $19.99; and of course, the HTC EVO 4G LTE, with the first-ever HD voice capability. 
We also continue to innovate in business solutions, evidenced by the recent launch of Sprint Complete Collaboration, a cloud-hosted unified communications offering for our enterprise customers. This quarter we also created New Ventures, an organization focused on bringing new solutions with successful open ecosystem platforms to the wholesale and global marketplace. We recently announced an agreement with Chrysler to act as a strategic wireless partner for the Chrysler Group LLC's Uconnect Program. 
A Q1 report from the patent board recognizes Sprint as 1 of the top 10 innovators in the global telecom and communications industry with over 450 U.S. patents granted in the last year. We were 1 of only 2 wireless carriers to be named to the top 10.
Turning to Slide 13. I'm pleased to announce that 4G WiMAX is coming to both Virgin Mobile USA and Boost Mobile later this quarter, and we will announce more details at a later date. 
Please turn to my final slide, #14. On last quarter's call I discussed the end of Phase 1 of the Sprint turnaround in 2011, and the first quarter of 2012 began Phase 2. It has been a tough road these past 4 years and there is still much hard work left to do. Everyone at Sprint realizes we have a long way to go to deliver the level of financial performance we aspire to, but I am pleased with our progress and in particular, with our OIBDA performance and our Network Vision progress, which Steve Elfman will now report on. Thank you."

I'm pleased to be here to discuss our progress to date. The Network Vision project is progressing well, and I'm confident about hitting the targets we've communicated to you.

The Network Vision project is progressing well, and I'm confident about hitting the targets we've communicated to you. 
The next slide is a Network Vision scorecard we developed, which I'll be sharing with you every quarter throughout the implementation, and is similar to my daily internal flash report. We have made good progress during the first quarter, and the project is hitting its stride. We have ramped the resources and currently have over 6,000 people working on the project both internal and through our vendor partners. We expect no issues with resources in any market. 
A critical part of this project is building a good pipeline of sites for construction. To date, we have completed zoning on approximately 9,700 sites and leasing on close to 7,700 sites. As we have discussed with you, the zoning and leasing process had the potential for the greatest unknowns, so we are pleased with the pipeline. Over 3,200 sites are now in notice-to-proceed status, meaning we have completed all steps required prior to starting actual construction of the site. And we have started work on approximately 3,000 sites in 17 markets.
We continue to expect to launch LTE coverage in 6 metro areas by mid-year and have 12,000 new Network Vision sites on air by the end of the year. We now have over 600 new Network Vision sites on air, and the early results of site performance are meeting our expectations. On Network Vision sites, we are seeing a doubling of coverage range compared to the legacy network. And when we light up the Network Vision tower, in about 80% of the cases we are repurposing about 2.5 to 3 megahertz of our 800 megahertz spectrum to voice on the Sprint platform. So our customers in those markets are beginning to see improvements in their service. 
In the early stages, we are seeing a reduction to in-footprint roaming, which is meeting our expectations of performance. As we build out the network and retune the individual sites to their clusters, we'd expect this performance to further improve.
We are completely done with the field testing and the technology works. For sites on air, we're seeing improved performance of radios, antenna and backhaul, all of which are meeting our performance objectives. Based on the testing of our 5-by-5 megahertz network and the size of our customer base, we expect our network speeds to be competitive.
If we turn to the next slide. The other and equally important project within Network Vision is the thinning of the Nextel network prior to the complete shutdown in 2013. We began the process with a trial in one market in the first quarter and now are underway nationally. The network thinning process is essentially a process of shutting down sites and recalibrating the network to support lower traffic volumes. The Nextel platform was built to support approximately 20 million customers, and as of the end of the first quarter supports approximately 5.4 million customers. 
Through the network thinning process, we go into market and turn off certain sites overnight and then retune the network with the expectation that we continue to provide equivalent on-street coverage quality in the majority of cases. To date, we have nearly 1,300 Nextel sites off air. The process is going well, and we now expect that we will have the 9,600 sites planned for this year off air by the end of Q3. The process is not in itself expected to have any meaningful churn or migration impact but should provide immediate savings on utilities and maintenance and on rent going forward, all of which are in the Network Vision forecast. 
I'm very pleased with the progress we have made and am confident that over the coming quarters, we will be able to continue to report strong progress and performance on the build while remaining on schedule and on budget. 
I'll now turn it over to Joe to go through the financial results."
417206,183739602,289124,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2012",2012-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Across all areas of the business, the first quarter showed steady execution. I am pleased to say we are progressing well against our plan for the year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2012 is a year of",2286,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Across all areas of the business, the first quarter showed steady execution. I am pleased to say we are progressing well against our plan for the year. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, 2012 is a year of execution and continued focus on profitability. And our first quarter results reflect this commitment and discipline. We are pleased with our results in the first quarter, which show progress against the 3 most important financial measures of our business: Growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong conversion of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. 
Our core business is showing growth in both subscribers and service revenues. Sprint platform postpaid gross adds of 1.8 million grew 10% year-over-year, showing a growing market share in a soft quarter for acquisition throughout the industry. This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to smart growth, producing steadily improving results in our ongoing core business in a disciplined manner. Not only did we increase gross adds year-over-year, we did so while taking actions to support a significant shift in gross add volume to our most cost-effective channels, which helps to improve our variable selling expense. Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 263,000 grew 4% year-over-year. 
As we expected, the net adds number during the quarter continued to be affected by the carryover of the churn bubble we discussed on last quarter's call. We believe the impact of the higher churn we have seen in recent quarters is largely behind us. And we have seen involuntary churn begin to improve in Q2. Now that we are largely past this issue, we expect to approach normal seasonality for involuntary churn, which based on our historical trends, is typically worth approximately 10 basis points in the second quarter. And we would expect our sequential improvement in Q2 to be better than this.
I want to make sure everyone understands the expected dynamics of customer growth in 2012. Our momentum in the core business is expected to continue, and we expect to show positive postpaid net adds on the Sprint platform in every quarter in 2012. We will remain disciplined in our pursuit of subscriber growth, and we will not chase unprofitable or marginally profitable gross adds. And we will continue to look for opportunities to improve the cost of customer acquisition as we grow our core business. 
Regarding the Nextel platform, we expect the trend of negative postpaid net adds to increase every quarter throughout the year as we continue our migration efforts. The exact timing of the churn for migration of larger accounts is somewhat unpredictable as we go through the process with our business customers. However, consistent with our Network Vision plan, we expect the negative trend on the Nextel platform to increase throughout the year as we prepare to fully decommission the network in 2013.
When looking at the Nextel platform, the most important metric to measure, the health and strength of our ongoing business, is the recapture rate. I am pleased to say we did better than our business plan in the first quarter, recapturing approximately 46% of postpaid customers leaving the Nextel platform compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The majority of the retail and smaller business customers that we are currently recapturing to the Sprint postpaid platform are purchasing smartphones and so are incurring the $10 premium data add-on charge as they move. This means that ARPU for the customers should increase. However, their data usage is also expected to increase. So these customers are expected to achieve a similar gross margin to our Sprint postpaid platform base over time. 
While we are pleased with the current successes we are seeing in bringing the Nextel platform postpaid customers over to the Sprint platform, I do want to caution that the recapture rate could show large fluctuations over the next several quarters, and therefore, it is a challenge to predict. The reason for this is that of the 3.8 million postpaid customers remaining on the Nextel platform at the end of the first quarter, approximately 3 million of those customers are corporate customers, and the timing of the migration or deactivation of larger accounts may cause large swings in the recapture rate. However, we expect that in total our Nextel recapture rate of our postpaid customers should be slightly better than our approximately 30% that was in our original business case.
As Dan discussed, the most significant growth we are seeing in the business is in postpaid ARPU. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU grew by over $4 or 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. 86% of Sprint platform postpaid handset sales were smartphones in the quarter, and approximately 69% of the Sprint postpaid handset base now have smartphones. We expect Sprint postpaid ARPU to show sequential growth each quarter throughout the year.
Turning to Slide 20. We are seeing growth not just in Sprint banded postpaid, but across the entire Sprint platform. Prepaid net adds on the Sprint platform were 870,000 with churn of just 2.92%, our lowest since the launch of prepaid on that platform in 2007. Prepaid has been a significant growth engine for our business, and in the first quarter those trends continued. Because of pricing actions taken last year, particularly in the Boost business with the $5 smartphone data charge implemented in October of 2011, Sprint platform prepaid ARPU grew by almost 2% sequentially in the first quarter, despite the offsetting impacts of the Boost bill shrinkage program and assurance mix. The combination of growing ARPU and improving churn in the Boost and Virgin Mobile brands translated into very strong revenue growth of 9% sequentially and 43% year-over-year in prepaid on the Sprint platform. 
Now on to our wholesale and affiliate businesses, which is 100% on the Sprint platform. We are also seeing growth. Wholesale and affiliate net adds were 785,000 in the first quarter, up 102% for the first quarter a year ago. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues grew 39% sequentially in the first quarter and 49% year-over-year, reflecting both volume and ARPU rate improvements. 
The core business has good momentum. Our total customers on the Sprint platform increased by more than 1.9 million during the quarter or by 4% from the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. The growth across all our businesses on the Sprint platform contributed to nearly 5% sequential growth in total Sprint platform service revenues and 16% growth year-over-year. This positive performance continues to exceed our expectations and is contributing to our strong adjusted OIBDA results.
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on Slide 21. Total wireless cost of service in the first quarter was $2.3 billion or 32% of service revenues, which was flat on an absolute dollar basis and a 1 percentage point gross margin improvement sequentially. This was primarily due to an improvement in Sprint platform variable network expenses of 9% sequentially from $881 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential improvement in Sprint platform variable network expenses is due to a $40 million reduction in 4G roaming expenses as we shift to the flat rate unlimited use model with Clearwire, as well as a $15 million sequential decline in 3G roaming expenses. Sprint platform variable network expenses increased by just 10% year-over-year while Sprint platform service revenues increased by 16%. It is these trends along with the expected future removal of significant fixed cost associated with the Nextel platform that gives us the confidence in our long-term margin expansion goals.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the first quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, a sequential improvement of $158 million or 9%. This sequential change was due to seasonally lower postpaid gross adds and upgrades. Our subsidy expense was also helped on a year-over-year basis by changes to our upgrade eligibility program made throughout last year, which helped reduce our total postpaid upgrade rate from almost 9% in the year-ago period to 7% in the first quarter. While growing handset subsidies continue to be an industry-wide issue, we are continually taking steps to improve our cost structure and the profitability of our customers. And in the first quarter, we saw improvements in our variable selling expenses, resulting from efforts to drive customers to our Sprint banded channels, which provides a better customer experience and could reduce our cost per acquisition by as much as $200. This is an example of our commitment to smart growth. On a year-over-year basis, we were able to increase Sprint platform postpaid gross adds by 10%, even as we reduced our total gross add volumes in third-party national retailers by 19%. 
Wireless selling, general and administrative cost improved by $19 million sequentially, and increased by $40 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. This year-over-year increase was primarily related to a $59 million incremental expense, which we discussed on the fourth quarter call. There is a full description in the 10-Q, but simply put, when the third-party channels buy handsets direct from an OEM, the expense gets reported as a selling expense rather than in subsidy. This activity is incremental in the first quarter 2012 year-over-year comparative. Excluding this new expense, wireless selling expenses would have improved by 4% year-over-year despite a 10% increase in postpaid gross adds for the Sprint platform compared to the first quarter of 2011. 
Network Vision operating expenses were $104 million during the quarter compared to $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect that our Network Vision-related cost will show substantial sequential increases through the remainder of 2012.
Turning to Slide 22. Wireless adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, a 57% sequential improvement. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was $1.2 billion, which was a 44% sequential improvement. Both results include $104 million of Network Vision expenses, which was a sequential increase in expense of $50 million. This performance was due to ARPU and subscriber growth, as well as lower overall volumes, particularly in upgrades, and improvements to certain variable expenses. While we continue to expect to grow revenues and improve our cost structure, our expectation is that second quarter consolidated adjusted OIBDA will be lower than the first quarter due to an approximate doubling of Network Vision expenses in the second quarter.
Now switching to wireline. Adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter was $161 million, a 10% sequential decline and a 29% decline from a year ago. As you know, at the beginning of each year, we adjust the intercompany transfer rate between wireless and wireline to adhere to current market prices. And this resulted in a $53 million year-over-year decline in wireline revenues. 
Now let's move to cash and liquidity on Slide 23. We ended the first quarter with a total liquidity position of $8.8 billion, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.6 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility. During the quarter, we raised approximately $2 billion through private placements. The combined offering was oversubscribed, and the price of the guaranteed notes was roughly 200 basis points, better than comparable notes issued in the fourth quarter. This vote of confidence from debt holders enhanced our liquidity position and strengthens our belief in our ability to raise capital to support our investment in Network Vision and other high-return projects.
We also continue to pursue vendor financing in the range of $1 billion to $3 billion, and our discussions are going well. Our accrued capital expenditures were $800 million in the first quarter, which excluded $115 million in capitalized interest and included $315 million of Network Vision capital compared to $900 million in the fourth quarter and $555 million in the first quarter of 2011. 
Rebanding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was $58 million in the first quarter of 2012. We estimate that we have approximately $550 million to $650 million in rebanding spend left, which will be split between 2012 and 2013 and will be focused on the U.S. borders. 
Free cash flow was $138 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $257 million in the fourth quarter and $178 million in the first quarter of 2011. Going forward, we expect that free cash flow will be negative as investments in Network Vision accelerate and inventory increases as a result of new LTE handset launches. 
Moving to Slide 24. I'll close with our updated outlook for the year. The positive revenue and subscriber trends in our core business, as well as continued steps towards margin improvement, give us confidence in our outlook for the year, and we expect that adjusted OIBDA will be at the high end of the $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion range that we discussed with you on the fourth quarter call. Second quarter adjusted OIBDA is expected to be lower than the first quarter due to increasing Network Vision spend. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $6 billion. We believe we have made positive progress against our business plan in the first quarter, executing well on Network Vision and making the kind of steady, ongoing progress toward our goals as we invest in the future of our business. 
Our balanced approach to top line growth and profitability was demonstrated by our subscriber and revenue growth on the Sprint platform. We continue to make progress on improving our cost structure in Network Vision. We are very optimistic about the future and, we want to thank the Sprint workforce, both in-house and contracted labor, for their hard work and dedication to meeting our goals.

Well, what we said is -- Jonathan, how are you? This is Dan. That we haven't given specific guidance with respect to churn in the second quarter but just said that you could expect more than, let's say, a 10 basis point improvement in Q2 from Q1. Because number one, if you will, the -- most of the pig is through the python on this involuntary churn issue that we have. There are clearly seasonal benefits in the second quarter. We'll have more benefits also from the iPhone, a higher percentage of our customers being on contract than we've had traditionally, continuing improving overall CSAT and what have you. One of the challenges on churn has been the fact that as you know, in 2011, part of what's driving our profitability performance and our ARPU growth is we've been increasing prices, increasing fees. We did away with loyalty programs, which, of course, drove more upgrades, so you're seeing more favorability on the upgrade side, which has an impact on the bottom line. But of course, you'll see some pressure on the churn side. So what we're trying to do, Jonathan, is find kind of that optimal point, knowing it will give us some pressure on churn to do some things that are, if you will, more accretive to the bottom line and give us more revenue and profitability. But generally, you should see postpaid churn on the Sprint platform begin to improve going forward. Now on the Nextel postpaid platform, it'll go in the other direction. As we accelerate the decommissioning of the iDEN network, you'll see that, if you will, as a -- from a churn point of view as a headwind but continued improvement on the Sprint platform."

We're right on plan as far as we're concerned on Network Vision, so we're not adjusting any of our guidance yet, even though things are going well. With respect to the -- I think it's kind of the -- the question has to do with potential ARPU uptick or what have you given smartphone penetration. Roughly 69% of our customer base currently has a smartphone. So there's an opportunity, obviously, to take that north of 69%. And some of those customers actually have smartphones but don't yet pay the $10 additional data charge because they bought those smartphones before we implemented the increase. And of course, the increase only went to new customers and customers that upgraded. So there is potential there, but also keep in mind that in the year-over-year comps, it'll get harder later in the year in terms of looking at things like revenue growth or ARPU growth because you'll be -- because the increases went into effect in the first quarter of 2011. So we began to see the ARPU increases all through '11. So anyway, as you get later in the year, the comps get more difficult. But net-net, we have about 30% of our subscriber base on phones that still don't have smartphones, and there's obviously a potential to have them upgrade to smart devices, as well as, obviously, the lion's share of our gross adds, new customers coming in, are on the iPhone and other smartphones."

In terms of -- our zonings are ahead, but one of the things you find, in some jurisdictions you don't need to do specific zoning. Leasing, a couple of things on that. We did do the deals with the major tower companies last year, and that makes up approximately 50% of our tower portfolio. And what we have to do there to get a leasing complete is we have to submit basically drawings that is more paperwork with them. We don't have to negotiate rates and rent, so -- or timing. And so those generally go quite a bit smoother and faster in terms of the leasing. So we see that going well. It's the other 50% that are out and, let's say, on the top of a fast-food restaurant or in a farmer's field, that's where we have to go out and negotiate both rate and then go back with drawings. So those take a little bit longer, and you can have a headwind if there's difficulty in negotiating a lease, right? That's one. The other question you had about some headwinds. On a daily basis, there's things that go very, very well. And on a daily basis, there's things that make you put your head in your hands. But there's not been any significant issue that causes a setback. There are some daily ones. And so just to react to the one that I know is out there that we've -- that towers have been falling down, we had early on some of our towers that we determined we needed to have stronger brackets, and we ended up going back to those and putting in some tighter criteria for certification before we would go and do a mount. And so, yes, that caused a brief delay, but nothing that would affect the overall outcome of the project. So you have these that pop up, generally. This one got an awful lot of press, I think, and it doesn't affect the overall program, but sure enough, we did have to put tighter certification in."

Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available in the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Moving to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move on to earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the second quarter were $0.46 compared to $0.29 in the first quarter and $0.28 in the year-ago period. There are a few noteworthy items impacting EPS this quarter that I'd like to cover. The first 2 of which are related to our progress towards the eventual shutdown of the Nextel platform. First, the loss per share in the current period included incremental depreciation expense of $782 million or negative $0.26 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform. We have updated our estimate of the expected useful life of the Nextel assets, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense this quarter. Excluding incremental CapEx spend, our assets and servicing, we expect depreciation expense to be around $2.6 billion for the second half of 2012 and around $3.6 billion for 2013, which is expected to be disproportionately weighted towards the first half of 2013 due to Nextel assets being fully depreciated by the middle of 2013.
The current period also included $184 million or approximately negative $0.06 per share for lease exit costs, which are the net present value of remaining lease obligations associated with certain Nextel platform cell sites, which were taken off air during the quarter. In the second quarter, we shut down approximately 8,300 Nextel platform sites. However, locations from which we may continue to gain future economic benefit, including co-located sites, were not included in this charge and represented approximately 30% -- 36% of total Nextel sites shutdown in the second quarter. During the third quarter to date, we have shut down approximately 1,300 Nextel platform sites, a portion of which will also incur charge in our third quarter results, expected to be approximately $20 million. We expect no additional fitting of the Nextel platform into 2012 at this time. We estimate that approximately $8 million and $77 million of operating expense would have been incurred in the second quarter and the second half of 2012  respectively for the full year 2012 impact of $85 million if Sprint did not take these actions.
Lastly, we also recorded an impairment of $204 million or negative $0.07 per share related to our Clearwire investment. Net tax expense was $26 million in the second quarter. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $220 million. I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse."

And thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in Sprint. If you turn to Slide 6, please. Let me recap the quarter's highlight before reviewing performance across our 3 key priorities, generating cash, improving the customer experience and building the brand. Adjusted OIBDA of $1.45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter exceeded both our internal projections and Street consensus. Adjusted OIBDA margin of 17.9% represents a sequential improvement of 277 basis points from the first quarter. Notably, adjusted OIBDA margin. is also up 69 basis points from the second quarter of 2011, even with the dilutive impact of both the iPhone and our Network Vision investment in 2012. As I've mentioned before, the 2 most important wireless operating metrics that drive financial performance are churn and ARPU. For our Sprint platform postpaid business, both churn and ARPU were best-ever  results for any quarter. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.38 is up $4.31 from the second quarter of last year. And for the third conservative quarter, we posted the highest year-over-year postpaid ARPU increase on record for any major U.S. wireless company. We set the all-time delivers in the same quarter we delivered our best-ever Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.69%. This represents an improvement of 31 basis points sequentially and 3 basis points over our previous record quarter one year ago. We also achieved our ninth consecutive quarter of positive net adds for the Sprint platform postpaid business. We made progress on our Network Vision deployment. We've launched LTE service in 5 major metro areas, and today we are announcing early completion of 2012's iDEN fitting forecast, with all 9,600 iDEN cell sites already off air.
We are now activating new Network Vision sites on air at a rate which if we maintain our current implementation pace in existing cities and bring a new city this plan during the year, we'll achieve our 2012 plan. The current week-by-week plans from our vendors show us achieving our goal of approximately 12,000 sites on air by the end of the year. 
Finally, based on the ongoing strength of our core Sprint platform business, we are increasing our forecast for full year 2012 adjusted OIBDA performance to a range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. 
If you please turn to Slide 7, I'll organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities. Let me begin with cash. In spite of a significant increase in capital investment associated with our Network Vision deployment, this quarter we again improved our liquidity position by generating $209 million of free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.8 billion. During the quarter, we completed our first vendor financing arrangement and retired $1 billion of outstanding debt ahead of scheduled maturity. Our strong quarterly adjusted OIBDA performance in the quarter benefited from continued top line growth. We had solid revenue performance in all 3 areas of our Sprint platform wireless business. The Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate continues to increase with the ongoing impact of a $10 premium data charge as a result of the continued customer adoption smartphones. At $63.38, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU reached a new all-time best level and is up as I mentioned $4.31 year-over-year. 
Total Sprint platform wireless service revenue is up over 16% compared to the year-ago period, with postpaid revenue up almost 13%, prepaid revenue up over 30% and wholesale and other revenue up over 125% year-over-year.
On a consolidated basis, this quarter represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total operating revenues and our fourth conservative quarter of sequential growth. Total operating revenues are up almost 6.5% year-over-year.
As I said earlier, we reported an improvement both sequentially and year-over-year in our adjusted OIBDA margin performance. While far from where we wanted to be, we delivered a meaningful a 69-basis point improvement in margin from the second quarter of 2011. Although postpaid gross add volume was within 10% of a year ago, we grew adjusted OIBDA margin while absorbing the diluted impacts this year of our 2 key investment areas, Network Vision deployment and the iPhone.
As I transition to a discussion of our customer experience and brand results, I'd like to begin with a brief overview of the iPhone, which benefits both areas. 
Turning to Slide 8. In spite of seasonal softness in industry gross adds from Q1 to Q2, we activated nearly 1.5 million iPhones in the second quarter similar to last year -- or similar to last quarter. As I've said before, the most important near-term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that our new customers to Sprint, because they represent new sources of revenue. In the second quarter, 40% of our iPhone activations were new customers, well in excess of our competitors' historical results and our third consecutive quarter at or above 40%. Longer term, the most important metric of success with the iPhone will be the anticipated lower churn rate of iPhone customers. All of our early life iPhone customer experience metrics to be encouraging. We are beginning to see benefits from the iPhone, including lower support costs in service and repair To date, although still young in its product life cycle, we are observing materially lower early like churn rates for iPhone customers compared to other smartphone customers. The operational performance so far continues to support our decision to carry the iPhone. Considering postpaid devices only, we are ahead of the pace required to meet our contracted commitments to Apple.
Turning to Slide 9 and the customer experience. I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter in a well-known and important third-party independent measure of customer satisfaction, we matched our all-time best rating for overall satisfaction for the Sprint brand. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, which made its findings public in May, Sprint is #1 among all national carriers in overall customer satisfaction and the most improved U.S. company across all 47 industries studied over the last 4 years. We also achieved new best-ever levels for customer calls to care across both our postpaid and prepaid customer basis. We're not buying satisfaction. Customer care credits in the second quarter were the lowest or best for any quarter on record. Both postpaid and prepaid customer credits each hit best-ever levels, savings that drop straight to the bottom line.
Our multi-year intense focus on improving our customers' experience with Sprint is continuing to manifest itself in improved churn performance. Sprint platform postpaid churn reached a new all-time best, 1.69%, and prepaid churn at 2.53% matches our best-ever reported churn level and is at the lowest level in almost 7 years. Sprint platform prepaid churn has shown year-over-year improvement for 11 consecutive quarters. While the introduction of the Assurance brand, which has a lower churn rate in typical prepaid brands, has helped these results, we have also made progress in improving the churn performance of our Boost and Virgin Mobile customer basis.
Moving to Slide 10. Verizon, AT&T and the Sprint platform each reported record low postpaid churn results this quarter. This is good for the industry as no signal metric drives profitability more than churn. But as a result, there are fewer postpaid decisions or new customers to go after, especially if you would just out ancillary devices like the iPad. The 2G iDEN network has been a source of customers for other platforms, most of all for Verizon for the past few years. We have data going back 4.5 years, but in a typical year prior to this one, based on reporting data, we estimate Verizon got almost half of all iDEN Dx. Sprint recaptured about 25%, AT&T acquired 20% and T-Mobile about 5%. Verizon benefited from sheer size and by having a push-to-talk CDMA product. From 2008 to 2011, the Nextel platform provided about twice as much benefit to Verizon subscriber numbers and almost as much benefit to AT&T subscriber base as it did to the Sprint platform.
Prior to late 2011, our most effective financial strategy was to do all we could to maintain customers on the Nextel platform, to reduce churn until we had Sprint Direct Connect network technology and devices and until we needed to begin active customer migration so that we could shut down the iDEN network in 2013. So before this year, the best financial strategy was to retain customers on the fixed cost iDEN platform as long as possible. From 2008 to 2011, we decreased the number of Nextel postpaid Dx per year by 66% and improved churn by more than 50 basis points.
Once we declared the end of life for the iDEN platform, a new strategy was warranted. It costs us about $200 less to acquire an iDEN customer as they go out and getting new customer from a competitor. We have described on previous calls how we will give priority to OIBDA over customer growth in 2012. We spent less in advertising than we spent last year.
Given the low number of new postpaid phone decisions anticipated in 2012 and the fact that we are now stimulating high churn on the iDEN network so that we can shut it down in 2013, we decided to focus our limited marketing resources on acquiring Nextel platform customers because of the advantage that the new Sprint Direct Connect provides us as well as because of lower acquisition costs. So in 2012, for the first time, the Sprint platform is out acquiring Verizon as we are more than doubling Sprint's historical share of Nextel postpaid Dx. We likely will not be able to sustain last quarter's 60% recapture rate, but we feel we are focusing our limited marketing spend in the best way possible.
Turning to Slide 11, as I mentioned before, perhaps the most important brand metric is the Net Promoter Score, which is a brand's supporters minus its distractors. In a well-known independent survey, the Net Promoter Score for Sprint is at an all-time high, and Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major carriers to show improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. In another independent third-party survey, the Sprint, Boost and Virgin brands each achieved all-time bests scores for Purchase Consideration. One of the most tangible proof points of our brand improvement is the net porting position for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Being net port positive means more of our competitors' customers switch to Sprint than switch from Sprint to a competitor. Before the third quarter of 2010, the Sprint platform had never in its long history been net port positive. I'm pleased to report that we just achieve our eighth consecutive net port positive quarter.
Please turn to Slide 12. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 442,000 represent our ninth consecutive quarter of positive net adds when measured by net adds over an 8-quarter period as a percentage of the customer base, the Sprint platform is the fastest-growing postpaid brand among the national carriers in spite of not having the iPad, a major contributor to the net add performance of our competitors or until recently, even the iPhone. And as I mentioned earlier, with relatively little advantage compared to our large competitors for Nextel platform Dx until recently.
Our total customer base also continues to grow. This quarter, we reached a record 56.4 million wireless customers. 
Last quarter, we launched innovative new handsets and products. We are pleased -- I think you should be on Slide 13 with the early results of our new LTE handsets, including the latest addition to the EVO product family, the HTC EVO 4G LTE. In spite of an initial launch delay, it quickly became one of our top-selling devices. We're seeing good early results for the Samsung Galaxy S III launched early in the third quarter. We've also seen good market reaction to our new 4G WiMAX prepaid offerings launch late in the quarter. We are seeing prepaid WiMax devices in the high single-digit percentages of our total prepaid sales. And finally, at the end of the quarter, we broke new ground with our Virgin Mobile brand as the first national prepaid carrier to offer the iPhone. It's too early to share results, and we have not yet begun advertising Virgin's iPhone. 
Finally, I'm pleased to announce today that Sprint will be launching the Motorola PHOTON Q 4G LTE device in the very near future, our sixth 4G LTE device in 2012 and the first LTE world phone.
The Motorola PHOTON Q is a ULE platform certified premium with robust business and consumer features. We also continue to innovate in business solutions, evidenced by our announcement of wholesale and retail cloud services and a refresh of capabilities in our Sprint 362 portfolio, which provides mobility solutions for small business customers. 
In the quarter we also introduced Sprint Guardian, an industry first suite of mobile safety and security applications. 
As I conclude my remarks, please turn to Slide 14. We are early in the second phase of the turnaround investing for future growth. We're making progress in our core business operations, which funds these investments. We know we have much work ahead of us to achieve the margins we and our investors want. We've achieved all-time bests for the 2 factors that are the most significant determinants of the profitability of our postpaid wireless business, churn and ARPU. As we work to streamline our network infrastructure and wind down the Nextel platform, we have a vibrant and growing portfolio of Sprint platform businesses that will be the foundation for expected margin expansion in Phase III of the turnaround. 
Thank you for your ongoing interest and support of Sprint. And I will now hand over the call to Steve Elfman, who will give you an update on Network Vision."

We remain confident in our ability and the ability of our vendors to achieve our goals. Please turn to Slide 16. 
We are announcing today that we have completed our network thinning effort of the Nextel platform for this year. We've executed these thinning plans rapidly and nearly 3 months ahead of our guidance last quarter. Two weeks ago, we completed our thinning in our last market, which means we have now reached our goal of 9,600 sites for the year and have reduced the number of towers servicing the Nextel platform by 1/3. As a reminder, the network thinning process is not expected to cause any meaningful disruption to On Street coverage nor is it complete decommissioning. It is a process of taking certain cell sites off the air and recalibrating the network to support lower traffic volumes. The network of the Nextel platform was originally built to support approximately 20 million subs. And as of the end of the second quarter, we were approximately 4.4 million subs subscribers remaining. The thinning process allows us to reduce our costs, while maintaining service for those customers who remain on the platform. The completion of network thinning is an important step for Sprint towards achieving our expected margin improvement goals. This quarter, we announced that we expect to complete the shutdown of the remaining Nextel platform cell sites as of June 30 -- as early as June 30, 2013. We have a lot of questions and costs and the timing of expected cost savings. Joe will give an update on Network Vision financial outlook shortly, but I want to provide you with some direction on our expectations of the timing of savings as we implement Nextel platform thinning and move to full decommissioning.
Within the first 6 months after we take a cell site off the air, we eliminate utility, backhaul and maintenance costs. On average, these represent approximately 40% of the annual tower cosies and rent represents approximately 60%. By early 2014, we expect that from an adjusted OIBDA perspective, we will achieve the majority and projected savings related to the shutdown of the platform.
Please turn to Slide 17. As Dan discussed, we've been very successful in our recapture efforts on the Nextel platform, with 60% of postpaid customers staying with Sprint in the second quarter. One of the factors in our success is the strength of our Sprint Direct Connect product, which continues to show industry-leading push-to-talk call setup times. We continue to expand and improve our SDC portfolio and we are confident we have the best push-to-talk product available in the market. 
During the quarter, we launched the DuraXT, our fifth rugged SDC handset. At the same time, we enabled Sprint Direct Connect to work on both our voice network and roam outside of our footprint, which means our customers now have greater coverage than they did on the Nextel platform.
Please turn to Slide 18. The next slide is the Network Vision's score card, which I showed you last quarter, with an update on the solid progress we have made. As I discussed last quarter, a critical part of this project is building a good pipeline of sites for construction. To date, we have completed leasing on over 12,700 sites and zoning on over 13,900 sites. We are either ready for construction or underway on over 6,300 or 52% of the sites we are planning to bring on air this year.
On July 15, we launched 4G LTE in 5 major markets in 15 cities, including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Atlanta and Kansas City. We also announced the accelerated LTE launch in Waco, Texas and expect to launch 4 additional cities, including Baltimore by the end of August. The network is performing well and the average speeds are highly competitive. We now have over 2,000 Network Vision sites on air. As Dan has said, we are now activating Network Vision sites on air at a rate which  if we maintain our current pace in the existing cities and bringing new cities as planned during the year, we will achieve our 2012 plan. The current week by week plans from our vendors continue to show us achieving approximately 12,000 sites by the end of the year.
You should remember that Network Vision is not just about LTE, it's about modernization of our entire network, which includes voice and 3G. The coverage improvements that we are seeing on these towers are substantial. As we bring the sites up, early results show a 10% to 20% jump in voice minutes per site overnight, a very important indicator of expected future roaming savings. We expect these results to continue to improve as we light up 800 megahertz CDMA voice and handsets with this capability continue to penetrate the base.
Another important milestone in the quarter was the approval by the SEC for the deployment of LTE in the 800 megahertz band. I want to reiterate our confidence in both the Network Vision build and the Nextel platform decommissioning. The technology is working well and our 3 vendors continue to pick up the pace to hit our goals. With that, I'll now turn it over to Joe to go through the financials."

Last quarter I discussed the key financial measures of our business, growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and",2640,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Last quarter I discussed the key financial measures of our business, growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. These priorities remain unchanged in the second quarter. We executed well against each of them. 
I'm particularly pleased with our adjusted OIBDA results. Adjusted OIBDA of $1.45 billion in Q2 was up 20% sequentially, with flat sequential iPhone sales volumes and an increase of Network Vision impacts from approximately $100 million in the first quarter to approximately $175 million in Q2.
Even more gratifying, adjusted OIBDA grew 10% year-over-year while fully absorbing the incremental impact of our iPhone and Network Vision operating expenses and with only a slight decline in gross adds. This growth in adjusted OIBDA is a direct result of our revenue growth. Lower upgrades due to policy changes implemented last year and cost containment due to our ongoing commitment to disciplined growth.
Moving to Slide 21. Our core Sprint platform business continues to show strong growth in both subscribers and revenues. Total customers on the Sprint platform increased by nearly 1.3 million in the quarter and contributed 3% sequentially and 16% year-over-year growth in Sprint platform service revenues. Our Sprint platform postpaid business performed especially well this quarter. While Sprint platform postpaid gross adds of 1.5 million were down slightly year-over-year, the comparative quarter in 2011 was one in which we acquired some lower quality customers, which resulted in elevated churn for the past few quarters. I'm pleased to say that this elevated churn is now behind us, and our customer acquisition in the second quarter displays our ongoing commitment to disciplined growth. Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 442,000 grew by 96% year-over-year and 68% sequentially, aided by our best-ever Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.69%.
As we indicated for the past 3 quarters, we expected involuntary churn to improve significantly this quarter as we move past the temporary churn bubble. This improvement in involuntary churn, as well as sequential improvement in voluntary churn, allowed us to post our best-ever postpaid churn on the Sprint platform. Going forward, we expect Sprint platform postpaid churn to return to normal seasonal patterns: Typically a sequential increase in Q3 followed by a sequential decline in Q4. The strength of our Sprint platform net adds was greatly supported by our focus on the recapture of Nextel customers to our ongoing Sprint platform business. Q2 was our most successful quarter yet in this effort, recapturing 60% or approximately 431,000 of Nextel platform postpaid customers. This result is well above our original business case expectation and better than both the 46% recapture rate in the first quarter of this year and the 39% rate in the fourth quarter of 2011.
As these customers move to the Sprint platform, we are typically seeing an increase in company postpaid ARPU as they transition to a higher mix of smartphones and take the premium data add-on charge. So our focus on the recapture effort is both cost-effective and is revenue accretive to the company as a whole, although slightly dilutive to Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. The success of the program to date gives us the confidence that we should achieve a recapture rate above 40% for the next 2 quarters. However, as we enter 2013 and approach the complete shutdown of the network, we expect the recapture rate to decline. Our current progress with the recapture effort has exceeded our expectations and our overall progress in reacquiring the Nextel customer base gives us confidence that we will meet or exceed our original guidance of a 30% recapture rate as we move toward the goal of complete shutdown of the Nextel platform by midyear 2013. To the extent that customers begin to leave the Nextel platform faster than expected, this may move some Nextel postpaid net losses that were anticipated in 2013 into the current year. As Dan mentioned, the Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.38 reached its highest level ever this quarter, growing by 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The sequential increase to ARPU was due to continued penetration of our premium data add-on charge to the base, as well as changes to certain group discount policies which tightened eligibility requirements and reduced customer credits in the second quarter. We do not anticipate these changes to group discount policies will provide sequential benefit going forward. 81% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset sales in the second quarter were smartphones, and approximately 72% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset base now has smartphones.
We continue to enjoy strong sequential ARPU benefits on the Sprint platform from penetration of the premium data add-on charge, which we expect to continue through the second half of the year. While accretive to the company as a whole, the success of our Nextel recapture rate does manifest itself in some ARPU dilution on the Sprint platform through both migration credits and the assimilation of lower ARPU subscribers into a higher ARPU base. Because of the strong recapture rate in Q2, along with the impact of the group discount policy changes I just mentioned could cause a temporary dilutive effect on the sequential change in Sprint platform ARPU from Q2 to Q3, while providing a continued sequential ongoing benefit to the company as a whole. We expect Sprint platform postpaid ARPU would revert back to its sequential quarterly growth in Q4.
Moving to Slide 22. Our Sprint platform prepaid business also continues to grow as we added 451,000 customers in the quarter. While the prepaid business continues to enjoy good growth, the second quarter showed lower subscriber growth due to typical seasonal slowness for Boost and Virgin Mobile, as well as impacts to net ads associated with the changes in the regulatory environment of the lifeline industry. Aggressive competitive behavior in the lifeline segment ahead of regulatory deadlines, as well as the complexity associated with implementing these new requirements, has had an impact on subscriber numbers across the industry in Q2. The regulatory changes that occurred in the second quarter are still being implemented, and the ultimate impacts are difficult to predict. However, given these changes, we believe there will be a significant reassessment of overall volumes and thus competitive behavior in the lifeline industry. Because of this, we expect our Assurance Wireless and lifeline industry wholesale net add volumes to be adversely affected for the rest of the year. We are engaged in ongoing assessment of the new environment and plan to continue to offer high-value service options to current potential new lifeline customers. Despite this impact, the fundamentals of our prepaid business are strong. Prepaid service revenue on the Sprint platform grew almost 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Our Boost brand on the Sprint platform continues to produce very strong customer growth, and the total Boost brand is growing despite Nextel platform declines. Within a very competitive environment, the substantial improvement in churn we have made in the Boost and Virgin brands of approximately 100 basis points year-over-year has contributed to our strong revenue growth.
Our wholesale and affiliate business also continues to show very good growth. While net adds of 388,000 were also negatively impacted by seasonality and the lifeline regulatory changes, wholesale affiliate and other revenues grew a robust 20% sequentially and more than 100% year-over-year. We continue to expect strong year-over-year revenue growth in wholesale and affiliate business throughout the remainder of the year.
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on Slide 23. Total wireless cost of service in the second quarter was $2.3 billion or 31% of service revenues. This is a 2-percentage point gross margin improvement year-over-year and a 1-percentage point sequentially, even with incremental Network Vision spend in a seasonal uptick in 3G roaming of $30 million sequentially. 
Service and repair costs were down year-over-year and sequentially, driven by lower transaction volumes and higher refurbished replacement rates. The positive impacts of the iPhone and the success of the Sprint buyback program, which was recently named the best in the industry by Compass Intelligent Research are contributing to the improvements in our cost structure.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the second quarter was approximately $1.5 billion, a sequential decline of $93 million and an increase of $322 million year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in subsidy expense is largely driven by our iPhone investment, while high end per unit subsidy is already beginning to show operational expense benefits in other areas of the business, including lower returns, service and repair, and calls to care. We believe our results this quarter reflect the soundness of this investment. 
As we look at the second half of the year, our quarterly adjusted OIBDA results could be impacted by the timing of a possible launch of a new iPhone. While we do not know if or when a new iPhone may be launched this year, our adjusted OIBDA estimates for the second half of the year assume incremental iPhone sales associated with the new iPhone launch. We are also expecting an increase in upgrade activity in the back half of the year. As a larger percentage of our base becomes upgrade eligible and we experience normal seasonal upgrade patterns. To the extent these iPhone sales are higher or lower, this will affect our adjusted OIBDA projections.
Total wireless selling, general and administrative costs of $2.3 billion were flat year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. This means our wireless SG&A expense as a percentage of wireless service revenue improved by 3 percentage points year-over-year, even inclusive of an incremental $70 million of selling expense associated with direct sourced iPhones. Excluding this expense, selling expense would have been reduced by nearly 4% year-over-year. This strong improvement in our expenses is due to our ongoing companywide focus on cost management, which is evident across our business in the second quarter. 
As Dan mentioned, we have recently rolled out our new lineup of LTE devices and launched LTE service in 15 cities. As we look at the second half of 2012, we expect that we will begin to make select additional marketing investments to support the continued growth of our business.
Please turn to Slide 24. The strong core business performance I have outlined has resulted in wireless adjusted OIBDA growth of 23% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The total Network Vision impact to adjusted OIBDA was approximately $175 million during the quarter compared to approximately $100 million in the first quarter of 2012 and minimal amount in the second quarter of 2011.
We expect that our Network Vision-related dilution will continue to show sequential increases through the remainder of 2012. The strong underlying growth of our core Sprint platform business gives us confidence in our ability to continue to invest in our long-term margin expansion goals. 
Now switching to Wireline. Adjusted OIBDA for the second quarter was $149 million, a sequential decline of 7% and a year-over-year decline of 29%. While declines in this business continue, favorability in switched access, as well as operational improvements in billing accuracy and collections, are improving our outlook for the year. Because of these favorable trends, we are now expecting 2012 Wireline adjusted OIBDA to be approximately $600 million.
Moving to Slide 25. I now want to update our 2012 Network Vision outlook. We estimate approximately $300 million of improvement in our 2012 Network Vision adjusted OIBDA impact versus our original business plan. We are now estimating 2012  dilution from Network Vision of approximately $800 million compared to our previous estimate of $1.1 billion. Just over 50% of the $800 million dilution in 2012 will impact cost of service and just over 35% will impact the net subsidy expense. Of the $300 million change from our previous estimate, an estimated $220 million of the benefit from the original guidance is subscriber-related due to lower-than-expected customer losses on the Nextel platform. An estimated $115 million of the benefit is due to lower-than-expected duplicative site cost as we deploy Network Vision, better-than-expected Ethernet rates versus our original business case and lower backhaul and other expenses related to the accelerated thinning of the Nextel platform. 
The third and smallest area of our estimated adjusted OIBDA savings is due to the treatment of tower lease expense for thinned Nextel platform sites, which Brad detailed at the beginning of the call, and which is cash neutral. The current estimated benefits we are seeing to our original business case reflect the success of the project to date. At this point, our previous estimate of approximately $100 million dilution to adjusted OIBDA in 2013 and the broader economics of Network Vision remain largely unchanged and at year end, we will refine these numbers as needed. In addition, we will be posting supplemental slides on our website that provide additional detail on the 2012 Network Vision update after the call.
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 26. We continue to make improvements to our liquidity and capital structure this quarter. During the quarter, we entered into a new $1 billion secured equipment credit facility with a syndicate of international banks to finance equipment purchases from Ericsson for Network Vision. We ended the second quarter with a total liquidity position of $8 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.8 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility. We also have an additional $1 billion of liquidity from the secured credit facility, of which $500 million is available currently through May 2013 and another $500 million is available beginning April 2013 through May 2014. We continue to work with our Network Vision vendors to pursue additional export credit financing. We also retired $1 billion of 2013 debt maturities and now have less than $800 million of maturities due in 2013.
We are confident about our ability to finance the investments we are making in the core business. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.2 billion, which excluded $102 million of capitalized interest and included $704 million of Network Vision capital. Re-banding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was approximately $50 million for the second quarter. Our CapEx outlook for 2012 remains unchanged at approximately $6 billion, excluding capitalized interest and re-banding. 
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $209 million compared to $138 million in the first quarter and $267 million a year ago.
Moving on to our expectations on Slide 27. Because of the strong trends we are seeing, we are very pleased to announce today an increase in our adjusted OIBDA outlook for 2012 to a range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our core Sprint platform business and by the early favorable trends in Network Vision expenses. At the same time, we remain ever vigilant in our focus on execution and on maintaining balanced growth in a highly competitive environment. The first half of 2012 has shown good underlying fundamentals in our business. And as we look to the second half of the year, we expect these strong underlying trends to continue and to support the ramp-up in our Network Vision investments and a potential iPhone refresh. At the same time, we will maintain the flexibility to perform competitively in the market. As always, we will continue our commitment to cost discipline and our focus on executing against our key financial priorities: Growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. We are pleased with our performance to date. We are thankful for the great execution by our employees and vendors, and we are excited about the quarters to come. I'll turn the call back over to Brad."

On today's call, Dan Hesse will discuss operational performance in the quarter; Steve Elfman will provide an update on Network Vision; and Joe Euteneuer will cover our financial results. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available in the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Moving to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move on to earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the second quarter were $0.46 compared to $0.29 in the first quarter and $0.28 in the year-ago period. There were a few noteworthy items impacting EPS this quarter that I'd like to cover, the first 2 of which are related to our progress towards the eventual shutdown of the Nextel platform. First, the loss per share in the current period included incremental depreciation expense of $782 million or negative $0.26 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform. We have updated our estimate of the expected useful life of the Nextel assets, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense this quarter. Excluding incremental CapEx spend, our assets and servicing, we expect depreciation expense to be around $2.6 billion for the second half of 2012 and around $3.6 billion for 2013, which is expected to be disproportionately weighted towards the first half of 2013 due to Nextel assets being fully depreciated by the middle of 2013.
The current period also included $184 million or approximately negative $0.06 per share for lease exit costs, which are the net present value of remaining lease obligations associated with certain Nextel platform cell sites, which were taken off air during the quarter. In the second quarter, we shut down approximately 8,300 Nextel platform sites. However, locations from which we may continue to gain future economic benefit, including co-located sites, were not included in this charge and represented approximately 30% -- 36% of total Nextel sites shutdown in the second quarter. During the third quarter to date, we have shut down approximately 1,300 Nextel platform sites, a portion of which will also incur a charge in our third quarter results, expected to be approximately $20 million. We expect no additional fitting of the Nextel platform in 2012 at this time. We estimate that approximately $8 million and $77 million of operating expense would have been incurred in the second quarter and the second half of 2012  respectively for the full year 2012 impact of $85 million if Sprint did not take these actions.
Lastly, we also recorded an impairment of $204 million or negative $0.07 per share related to our Clearwire investment. Net tax expense was $26 million in the second quarter. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $220 million. I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."

Thanks, Brad, and thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in Sprint. If you turn to Slide 6, please.

Thanks, Brad, and thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in Sprint. If you turn to Slide 6, please. Let me recap the quarter's highlights before reviewing performance across our 3 key priorities: generating cash, improving the customer experience and building the brand. Adjusted OIBDA of $1.45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter exceeded both our internal projections and Street consensus. Adjusted OIBDA margin of 17.9% represents a sequential improvement of 277 basis points from the first quarter. Notably, adjusted OIBDA margin is also up 69 basis points from the second quarter of 2011 even with the dilutive impact of both the iPhone and our Network Vision investment in 2012. As I've mentioned before, the 2 most important wireless operating metrics that drive financial performance are churn and ARPU. For our Sprint platform postpaid business, both churn and ARPU were best-ever results for any quarter.
Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.38 is up $4.31 from the second quarter of last year. And for the third conservative quarter, we posted the highest year-over-year postpaid ARPU increase on record for any major U.S. wireless company. We set the all-time record for Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. In the same quarter, we delivered our best-ever Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.69%. This represents an improvement of 31 basis points sequentially and 3 basis points over our previous record quarter one year ago. We also achieved our ninth consecutive quarter of positive net adds for the Sprint platform postpaid business. We made progress on our Network Vision deployment. We've launched LTE service in 5 major metro areas and today, we're announcing early completion of 2012's iDEN network fitting forecast with all 9,600 iDEN cell sites already off air. We are now activating new Network Vision sites on air at a rate which if we maintain our current implementation pace in existing cities and bring in new cities as planned during the year, we'll achieve our 2012 plan. The current week-by-week plans from our vendors show us achieving our goal of approximately 12,000 sites on air by the end of the year. 
Finally, based on the ongoing strength of our core Sprint platform business, we are increasing our forecast for full year 2012 adjusted OIBDA performance to a range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. 
If you please turn to Slide 7, I'll organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities. Let me begin with cash. In spite of a significant increase in capital investment associated with our Network Vision deployment, this quarter, we again improved our liquidity position by generating $209 million of free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.8 billion. During the quarter, we completed our first vendor financing arrangement and retired $1 billion of outstanding debt ahead of scheduled maturity. Our strong quarterly adjusted OIBDA performance in the quarter benefited from continued top line growth. We had solid revenue performance in all 3 areas of our Sprint platform wireless business. The Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate continues to increase with the ongoing impact of a $10 premium data charge as a result of the continued customer adoption of smartphones. At $63.38, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU reached a new all-time best level and is up, as I mentioned, $4.31 year-over-year. Total Sprint platform wireless service revenue is up over 16% compared to the year-ago period, with postpaid revenue up almost 13%, prepaid revenue up over 30% and wholesale and other revenue up over 125% year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, this quarter represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total operating revenues and our fourth conservative quarter of sequential growth. Total operating revenues are up almost 6.5% year-over-year.
As I said earlier, we reported an improvement both sequentially and year-over-year in our adjusted OIBDA margin performance. While far from where we wanted to be, we delivered a meaningful a 69-basis point improvement in margin from the second quarter of 2011. Although postpaid gross add volume was within 10% of a year ago, we grew adjusted OIBDA margin while absorbing the diluted impacts this year of our 2 key investment areas, Network Vision deployment and the iPhone. As I transition to a discussion of our customer experience and brand results, I'd like to begin with a brief overview of the iPhone, which benefits both areas. 
Turning to Slide 8. In spite of seasonal softness in industry gross adds from Q1 to Q2, we activated nearly 1.5 million iPhones in the second quarter similar to last year -- or similar to last quarter. As I've said before, the most important near-term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that our new customers to Sprint because they represent new sources of revenue. In the second quarter, 40% of our iPhone activations were new customers, well in excess of our competitors' historical results and our third consecutive quarter at or above 40%. Longer term, the most important metric of success with the iPhone will be the anticipated lower churn rate of iPhone customers. All of our early life iPhone customer experience metrics continue to be encouraging. We are beginning to see benefits from the iPhone, including lower support costs in service and repair. To date, although still young in its product life cycle, we are observing materially lower early like churn rates for iPhone customers compared to other smartphone customers. The operational performance so far continues to support our decision to carry the iPhone. Considering postpaid devices only, we are ahead of the pace required to meet our contracted commitments to Apple.
Turning to Slide 9 and the customer experience. I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter in a well-known and important third-party independent measure of customer satisfaction, we matched our all-time best rating for overall satisfaction for the Sprint brand. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, which made its findings public in May, Sprint is #1 among all national carriers in overall customer satisfaction and the most improved U.S. company across all 47 industries studied over the last 4 years. We also achieved new best-ever levels for customer calls to care across both our postpaid and prepaid customer basis. We're not buying satisfaction. Customer care credits in the second quarter were the lowest or best for any quarter on record. Both postpaid and prepaid customer credits each hit best-ever levels, savings that drop straight to the bottom line.
Our multi-year intense focus on improving our customers' experience with Sprint is continuing to manifest itself in improved churn performance. Sprint platform postpaid churn reached a new all-time best, 1.69% and prepaid churn at 2.53% matches our best-ever reported churn level and is at the lowest level in almost 7 years. Sprint platform prepaid churn has shown year-over-year improvement for 11 consecutive quarters. While the introduction of the Assurance brand, which has a lower churn rate than typical prepaid brands, has helped these results, we have also made progress in improving the churn performance of our Boost and Virgin Mobile customer basis.
Moving to Slide 10. Verizon, AT&T and the Sprint platform each reported record low postpaid churn results this quarter. This is good for the industry as no single metric drives profitability more than churn. But as a result, there are fewer postpaid decisions or new customers to go after, especially if you adjust out ancillary devices like the iPad. The 2G iDEN network has been a source of customers for other platforms, most of all for Verizon for the past few years. We have data going back 4.5 years. But in a typical year prior to this one, based on porting data, we estimate Verizon got almost half of all iDEN DX. Sprint recaptured about 25%. AT&T acquired 20% and T-Mobile about 5%. Verizon benefited from sheer size and by having a push-to-talk CDMA product. From 2008 to 2011, the Nextel platform provided about twice as much benefit to Verizon subscriber numbers and almost as much benefit to AT&T subscriber base as it did to the Sprint platform.
Prior to late 2011, our most effective financial strategy was to do all we could to maintain customers on the Nextel platform, to reduce churn until we had Sprint Direct Connect network technology and devices and until we needed to begin active customer migration, so that we could shut down the iDEN network in 2013. So before this year, the best financial strategy was to retain customers on the fixed cost iDEN platform as long as possible. From 2008 to 2011, we decreased the number of Nextel postpaid DX per year by 66% and improved churn by more than 50 basis points.
Once we declared the end of life for the iDEN platform, a new strategy was warranted. It cost us about $200 less to acquire an iDEN customer than to go out and getting new customer from a competitor. We have described on previous calls how we will give priority to OIBDA over customer growth in 2012. We spent less in advertising than we spent last year.
Given the low number of new postpaid phone decisions anticipated in 2012 and the fact that we are now stimulating high churn on the iDEN network so that we can shut it down in 2013, we decided to focus our limited marketing resources on acquiring Nextel platform customers because of the advantage that the new Sprint Direct Connect provides us as well as because of lower acquisition costs. So in 2012, for the first time, the Sprint platform is out acquiring Verizon, as we're more than doubling Sprint's historical share of Nextel postpaid DX. We likely will not be able to sustain last quarter's 60% recapture rate, but we feel we are focusing our limited marketing spend in the best way possible.
Turning to Slide 11. As I mentioned before, perhaps, the most important brand metric is the Net Promoter Score, which is a brand's supporters minus its detractors. In a well-known independent survey, the Net Promoter Score for Sprint is at an all-time high, and Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major carriers to show improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. In another independent third-party survey, the Sprint, Boost and Virgin brands each achieved all-time best scores for Purchase Consideration. One of the most tangible proof points of our brand improvement is the net porting position for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Being net port positive means more of our competitors' customers switch to Sprint than switch from Sprint to a competitor. Before the third quarter of 2010, the Sprint platform had never in its long history been net port positive. I'm pleased to report that we just achieved our eighth consecutive net port positive quarter.
Please turn to Slide 12. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 442,000 represent our ninth consecutive quarter of positive net adds. When measured by net adds over an 8-quarter period as a percentage of the customer base, the Sprint platform is the fastest-growing postpaid brand among the national carriers in spite of not having the iPad, a major contributor to the net add performance of our competitors or until recently even the iPhone. And as I mentioned earlier, with relatively little advantage compared to our large competitors from Nextel platform DX until recently. Our total customer base also continues to grow. This quarter, we reached a record 56.4 million wireless customers. 
Last quarter, we launched innovative new handsets and products. We are pleased -- I think you should be on Slide 13. With the early results of our new LTE handsets, including the latest addition to the EVO product family, the HTC EVO 4G LTE. In spite of an initial launch delay, it quickly became one of our top-selling devices. We're seeing good early results for the Samsung Galaxy S III launched early in the third quarter. We've also seen good market reaction to our new 4G WiMAX prepaid offerings launched late in the quarter. We are seeing prepaid WiMax devices in the high single-digit percentages of our total prepaid sales. And finally, at the end of the quarter, we broke new ground with our Virgin Mobile brand as the first national prepaid carrier to offer the iPhone. It's too early to share results, and we have not yet begun advertising Virgin's iPhone. 
Finally, I'm pleased to announce today that Sprint will be launching the Motorola PHOTON Q 4G LTE device in the very near future, our sixth 4G LTE device in 2012 and the first LTE world phone.
The Motorola PHOTON Q is a ULE Platinum Certified premium QWERTY slider with robust business and consumer features. We also continue to innovate in business solutions, evidenced by our announcement of wholesale and retail cloud services and a refresh of capabilities in our Sprint Biz 36o portfolio, which provides mobility solutions for small business customers. In the quarter, we also introduced Sprint Guardian, an industry first suite of mobile safety and security applications. 
As I conclude my remarks, please turn to Slide 14. We are early in the second phase of the turnaround investing for future growth. We're making progress in our core business operations, which funds these investments. We know we have much work ahead of us to achieve the margins we and our investors want. We've achieved all-time bests for the 2 factors that are the most significant determinants of the profitability of our postpaid wireless business, churn and ARPU. As we work to streamline our network infrastructure and wind down the Nextel platform, we have a vibrant and growing portfolio of Sprint platform businesses that will be the foundation for expected margin expansion in Phase III of the turnaround. 
Thank you for your ongoing interest and support of Sprint, and I will now hand over the call to Steve Elfman, who will give you an update on Network Vision."

We remain confident in our ability and the ability of our vendors to achieve our goals. Please turn to Slide 16. 
We are announcing today that we have completed our network thinning effort on the Nextel platform for this year. We've executed these thinning plans rapidly and nearly 3 months ahead of our guidance last quarter. Two weeks ago, we completed our thinning in our last market, which means we have now reached our goal of 9,600 sites for the year and have reduced the number of towers servicing the Nextel platform by 1/3. As a reminder, the network thinning process is not expected to cause any meaningful disruption to on street coverage nor is it complete decommissioning. It is a process of taking certain cell sites off the air and recalibrating your network to support lower traffic volumes. The network of the Nextel platform was originally built to support approximately 20 million subs. And as of the end of the second quarter, we were approximately 4.4 million subs subscribers remaining. The thinning process allows us to reduce our costs, while maintaining service for those customers who remain on the platform. The completion of network thinning is an important step for Sprint towards achieving our expected margin improvement goals. This quarter, we announced that we expect to complete the shutdown of the remaining Nextel platform cell sites as of June 30 -- as early as June 30, 2013. We have a lot of questions in costs and the timing of the expected cost savings. Joe will give an update on Network Vision financial outlook shortly, but I want to provide you with some direction on our expectations of the timing of savings as we implement Nextel platform thinning and move to full decommissioning.
Within the first 6 months after we take a cell site off the air, we eliminate utility, backhaul and maintenance costs. On average, these represent approximately 40% of the annual tower costs and rent represents approximately 60%. By early 2014, we expect that from an adjusted OIBDA perspective, we will achieve the majority and projected savings related to the shutdown of the platform.
Please turn to Slide 17. As Dan discussed, we've been very successful in our recapture efforts on the Nextel platform, with 60% of postpaid customers staying with Sprint in the second quarter. One of the factors in our success is the strength of our Sprint Direct Connect product, which continues to show industry-leading push-to-talk call setup times. We continue to expand and improve our SDC portfolio and we are confident we have the best push-to-talk product available in the market. 
During the quarter, we launched the Kyocera DuraXT, our fifth rugged SDC handset. At the same time, we enabled Sprint Direct Connect to work on both our voice network and roam outside of our footprint, which means our customers now have greater coverage than they did on the Nextel platform.
Please turn to Slide 18. The next slide of -- is the Network Vision's score card, which I showed you last quarter, with an update on the solid progress we have made. As I discussed last quarter, a critical part of this project is building a good pipeline of sites for construction. To date, we have completed leasing on over 12,700 sites and zoning on over 13,900 sites. We are either ready for construction or underway on over 6,300 or 52% of the sites we're planning to bring on air this year.
On July 15, we launched 4G LTE in 5 major markets in 15 cities, including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Atlanta and Kansas City. We also announced the accelerated LTE launch in Waco, Texas and expect to launch 4 additional cities, including Baltimore by the end of August. The network is performing well and the average speeds are highly competitive. We now have over 2,000 Network Vision sites on air. As Dan has said, we are now activating Network Vision sites on air at a rate which if we maintain our current pace in the existing cities and bring-in new cities as planned during the year, we will achieve our 2012 plan. The current week-by-week plans from our vendors continue to show us achieving approximately 12,000 sites by the end of the year.
You should remember that Network Vision is not just about LTE. It's about modernization of our entire network, which includes voice and 3G. The coverage improvements that we are seeing on these towers are substantial. As we bring the sites up, early results show a 10% to 20% jump in voice minutes per site overnight, a very important indicator of expected future roaming savings. We expect these results to continue to improve as we light up 800 megahertz CDMA voice and handsets with this capability continue to penetrate the base.
Another important milestone in the quarter was the approval by the SEC for the deployment of LTE in the 800 megahertz band. I want to reiterate our confidence in both the Network Vision build and the Nextel platform decommissioning. The technology is working well and our 3 vendors continue to pick up the pace to hit our goals. With that, I will now turn it over to Joe to go through the financials."

Last quarter, I discussed the key financial measures of our business, growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform an",2640,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I discussed the key financial measures of our business, growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. These priorities remain unchanged in the second quarter. We executed well against each of them.  I'm particularly pleased with our adjusted OIBDA results. Adjusted OIBDA of $1.45 billion in Q2 was up 20% sequentially, with flat sequential iPhone sales volumes and an increase of Network Vision impacts from approximately $100 million in the first quarter to approximately $175 million in Q2.
Even more gratifying, adjusted OIBDA grew 10% year-over-year while fully absorbing the incremental impact of our iPhone and Network Vision operating expenses and with only a slight decline in gross adds. This growth in adjusted OIBDA is a direct result of our revenue growth, lower upgrades due to policy changes implemented last year and cost containment due to our ongoing commitment to disciplined growth.
Moving to Slide 21. Our core Sprint platform business continues to show strong growth in both subscribers and revenues. Total customers on the Sprint platform increased by nearly 1.3 million in the quarter and contributed 3% sequentially and 16% year-over-year growth in Sprint platform service revenues. Our Sprint platform postpaid business performed especially well this quarter. While Sprint platform postpaid gross adds of 1.5 million were down slightly year-over-year, the comparative quarter in 2011 was one in which we acquired some lower quality customers, which resulted in elevated churn for the past few quarters. I'm pleased to say that this elevated churn is now behind us, and our customer acquisition in the second quarter displays our ongoing commitment to disciplined growth. Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 442,000 grew by 96% year-over-year and 68% sequentially, aided by our best-ever Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.69%.
As we indicated for the past 3 quarters, we expected involuntary churn to improve significantly this quarter as we move past the temporary churn bubble. This improvement in involuntary churn, as well as sequential improvement in voluntary churn, allowed us to post our best-ever postpaid churn on the Sprint platform. Going forward, we expect Sprint platform postpaid churn to return to normal seasonal patterns, typically, a sequential increase in Q3 followed by a sequential decline in Q4. The strength of our Sprint platform net adds was greatly supported by our focus on the recapture of Nextel customers to our ongoing Sprint platform business. Q2 was our most successful quarter yet in this effort, recapturing 60% or approximately 431,000 of Nextel platform postpaid customers. This result is well above our original business case expectation and better than both the 46% recapture rate in the first quarter of this year and the 39% rate in the fourth quarter of 2011.
As these customers move to the Sprint platform, we are typically seeing an increase in company postpaid ARPU as they transition to a higher mix of smartphones and take the premium data add-on charge. So our focus on the recapture effort is both cost-effective and is revenue accretive to the company as a whole, although slightly dilutive to Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. The success of the program to date gives us the confidence that we should achieve a recapture rate above 40% for the next 2 quarters. However, as we enter 2013 and approach the complete shutdown of the network, we expect the recapture rate to decline. Our current progress with the recapture effort has exceeded our expectations and our overall progress in reacquiring the Nextel customer base gives us confidence that we will meet or exceed our original guidance of a 30% recapture rate as we move toward the goal of complete shutdown of the Nextel platform by midyear 2013. To the extent that customers begin to leave the Nextel platform faster than expected, this may move some Nextel postpaid net losses that were anticipated in 2013 into the current year. As Dan mentioned, the Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.38 reached its highest level ever this quarter, growing by 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The sequential increase to ARPU was due to continued penetration of our premium data add-on charge to the base, as well as changes to certain group discount policies, which tightened eligibility requirements and reduced customer credits in the second quarter. We do not anticipate these changes to group discount policies will provide sequential benefit going forward. 81% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset sales in the second quarter were smartphones, and approximately 72% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset base now has smartphones.
We continue to enjoy strong sequential ARPU benefits on the Sprint platform from penetration of the premium data add-on charge, which we expect to continue through the second half of the year. While accretive to the company as a whole, the success of our Nextel recapture rate does manifest itself in some ARPU dilution on the Sprint platform through both migration credits and the assimilation of lower ARPU subscribers into a higher ARPU base. Because of the strong recapture rate in Q2, along with the impact of the group discount policy changes I just mentioned, could cause a temporary dilutive effect on the sequential change in Sprint platform ARPU from Q2 to Q3, while providing a continued sequential ongoing benefit to the company as a whole. We expect Sprint platform postpaid ARPU would revert back to its sequential quarterly growth in Q4.
Moving to Slide 22. Our Sprint platform prepaid business also continues to grow as we added 451,000 customers in the quarter. While the prepaid business continues to enjoy good growth, the second quarter showed lower subscriber growth due to typical seasonal slowness for Boost and Virgin Mobile, as well as impacts to net ads associated with the changes in the regulatory environment of the lifeline industry. Aggressive competitive behavior in the lifeline segment ahead of regulatory deadlines as well as the complexity associated with implementing these new requirements has had an impact on subscriber numbers across the industry in Q2. The regulatory changes that occurred in the second quarter are still being implemented and the ultimate impacts are difficult to predict. However, given these changes, we believe there will be a significant reassessment of overall volumes and thus, competitive behavior in the lifeline industry. Because of this, we expect our Assurance Wireless and lifeline industry wholesale net add volumes to be adversely affected for the rest of the year. We are engaged in ongoing assessment of the new environment and plan to continue to offer high-value service options to current potential new lifeline customers. Despite this impact, the fundamentals of our prepaid business are strong. Prepaid service revenue on the Sprint platform grew almost 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Our Boost brand on the Sprint platform continues to produce very strong customer growth and the total Boost brand is growing despite Nextel platform declines. Within a very competitive environment, the substantial improvement in churn we have made in the Boost and Virgin brands of approximately 100 basis points year-over-year has contributed to our strong revenue growth.
Our wholesale and affiliate business also continues to show very good growth. While net adds of 388,000 were also negatively impacted by seasonality and the lifeline regulatory changes, wholesale affiliate and other revenues grew a robust 20% sequentially and more than 100% year-over-year. We continue to expect strong year-over-year revenue growth in wholesale and affiliate business throughout the remainder of the year.
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on Slide 23. Total wireless cost of service in the second quarter was $2.3 billion or 31% of service revenues. This is a 2-percentage point gross margin improvement year-over-year and a 1-percentage point sequentially even with incremental Network Vision spend in a seasonal uptick in 3G roaming of $30 million sequentially.  Service and repair cost were down year-over-year and sequentially, driven by lower transaction volumes and higher refurbished replacement rates. The positive impacts of the iPhone and the success of the Sprint buyback program, which was recently named the best in the industry by Compass Intelligent Research, are contributing to the improvements in our cost structure.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the second quarter was approximately $1.5 billion, a sequential decline of $93 million and an increase of $322 million year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in subsidy expense is largely driven by our iPhone investment, while high end per unit subsidy is already beginning to show operational expense benefits in other areas of the business, including lower returns, service and repair, and calls to care. We believe our results this quarter reflect the soundness of this investment. 
As we look at the second half of the year, our quarterly adjusted OIBDA results could be impacted by the timing of a possible launch of a new iPhone. While we do not know if or when a new iPhone may be launched this year, our adjusted OIBDA estimates for the second half of the year assume incremental iPhone sales associated with the new iPhone launch. We are also expecting an increase in upgrade activity in the back half of the year, as a larger percentage of our base becomes upgrade eligible and we experience normal seasonal upgrade patterns. To the extent these iPhone sales are higher or lower, this will affect our adjusted OIBDA projections.
Total wireless selling, general and administrative cost of $2.3 billion were flat year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. This means our wireless SG&A expense, as a percentage of wireless service revenue, improved by 3 percentage points year-over-year, even inclusive of an incremental $70 million of selling expense associated with direct sourced iPhones. Excluding this expense, selling expense would have been reduced by nearly 4% year-over-year. The strong improvement in our expenses is due to our ongoing company-wide focus on cost management, which is evident across our business in the second quarter. 
As Dan mentioned, we have recently rolled out our new lineup of LTE devices and launched LTE service in 15 cities. As we look at the second half of 2012, we expect that we will begin to make select additional marketing investments to support the continued growth of our business.
Please turn to Slide 24. The strong core business performance I have outlined has resulted in wireless adjusted OIBDA growth of 23% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The total Network Vision impact to adjusted OIBDA was approximately $175 million during the quarter compared to approximately $100 million in the first quarter of 2012 and minimal amount in the second quarter of 2011. We expect that our Network Vision-related dilution will continue to show sequential increases through the remainder of 2012. The strong underlying growth of our core Sprint platform business gives us confidence in our ability to continue to invest in our long-term margin expansion goals. 
Now switching to Wireline. Adjusted OIBDA for the second quarter was $149 million, a sequential decline of 7% and a year-over-year decline of 29%. While declines in this business continue, favorability in switched access as well as operational improvements in billing accuracy and collections are improving our outlook for the year. Because of these favorable trends, we are now expecting 2012 wireline adjusted OIBDA to be approximately $600 million.
Moving to Slide 25. I now want to update our 2012 Network Vision outlook. We estimate approximately $300 million of improvement in our 2012 Network Vision adjusted OIBDA impact versus our original business plan. We are now estimating 2012  dilution from Network Vision of approximately $800 million compared to our previous estimate of $1.1 billion. Just over 50% of the $800 million dilution in 2012 will impact cost of service and just over 35% will impact the net subsidy expense. Of the $300 million change from our previous estimate, an estimated $220 million of the benefit from the original guidance is subscriber-related due to lower-than-expected customer losses on the Nextel platform. An estimated $115 million of the benefit is due to lower-than-expected duplicative site cost as we deploy Network Vision, better-than-expected Ethernet rates versus our original business case and lower backhaul and other expenses related to the accelerated thinning of the Nextel platform. 
The third and smallest area of our estimated adjusted OIBDA savings is due to the treatment of tower lease expense for thinned Nextel platform sites, which Brad detailed at the beginning of the call, and which is cash neutral. The current estimated benefits we are seeing to our original business case reflect the success of the project to date. At this point, our previous estimate of approximately $100 million dilution to adjusted OIBDA in 2013 and the broader economics of Network Vision remain largely unchanged and at year end, we will refine these numbers as needed. In addition, we will be posting supplemental slides on our website that provide additional detail on the 2012 Network Vision update after the call.
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 26. We continue to make improvements to our liquidity and capital structure this quarter. During the quarter, we entered into a new $1 billion secured equipment credit facility with a syndicate of international banks to finance equipment purchases from Ericsson for Network Vision. We ended the second quarter with a total liquidity position of $8 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.8 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility. We also have an additional $1 billion of liquidity from the secured credit facility of which $500 million is available currently through May 2013 and another $500 million is available beginning April 2013 through May 2014. We continue to work with our Network Vision vendors to pursue additional export credit financing. We also retired $1 billion of 2013 debt maturities and now have less than $800 million of maturities due in 2013.
We are confident about our ability to finance the investments we are making in the core business. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.2 billion which excluded $102 million of capitalized interest and included $704 million of Network Vision capital. Re-banding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was approximately $50 million for the second quarter. Our CapEx outlook for 2012 remains unchanged at approximately $6 billion, excluding capitalized interest and re-banding.  Free cash flow for the second quarter was $209 million compared to $138 million in the first quarter and $267 million a year ago.
Moving on to our expectations on Slide 27. Because of the strong trends we are seeing, we are very pleased to announce today an increase in our adjusted OIBDA outlook for 2012 to a range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our core Sprint platform business and by the early favorable trends in Network Vision expenses. At the same time, we remain ever vigilant in our focus on execution and on maintaining balanced growth in a highly competitive environment. The first half of 2012 has shown good underlying fundamentals in our business. And as we look to the second half of the year, we expect these strong underlying trends to continue and to support the ramp-up in our Network Vision investments and a potential iPhone refresh. At the same time, we will maintain the flexibility to perform competitively in the market. As always, we will continue our commitment to cost discipline and our focus on executing against our key financial priorities: growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. We are pleased with our performance to date. We are thankful for the great execution by our employees and vendors, and we are excited about the quarters to come. I'll turn the call back over to Brad."

On today's call, Dan Hesse will discuss operational performance in the quarter; Steve Elfman will provide an update on Network Vision; and Joe Euteneuer will cover our financial results. Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Moving to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move on to earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the second quarter were $0.46 compared to $0.29 in the first quarter and $0.28 in the year-ago period. There were a few noteworthy items impacting EPS this quarter that I'd like to cover, the first 2 of which are related to our progress towards the eventual shutdown of the Nextel platform. First, the loss per share in the current period included incremental depreciation expense of $782 million or negative $0.26 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform. We have updated our estimate of the expected useful life of the Nextel assets, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense this quarter. Excluding incremental CapEx spend, our assets and servicing, we expect depreciation expense to be around $2.6 billion for the second half of 2012 and around $3.6 billion for 2013, which is expected to be disproportionately weighted towards the first half of 2013 due to Nextel assets being fully depreciated by the middle of 2013.
The current period also included $184 million or approximately negative $0.06 per share for lease exit costs, which are the net present value of remaining lease obligations associated with certain Nextel platform cell sites, which were taken off air during the quarter. In the second quarter, we shut down approximately 8,300 Nextel platform sites. However, locations from which we may continue to gain future economic benefit, including co-located sites, were not included in this charge and represented approximately 30% -- 36% of total Nextel sites shutdown in the second quarter. During the third quarter to date, we have shut down approximately 1,300 Nextel platform sites, a portion of which will also incur a charge in our third quarter results, expected to be approximately $20 million. We expect no additional fitting of the Nextel platform in 2012 at this time. We estimate that approximately $8 million and $77 million of operating expense would have been incurred in the second quarter and the second half of 2012  respectively, for the full year 2012 impact of $85 million if Sprint did not take these actions.
Lastly, we also recorded an impairment of $204 million or negative $0.07 per share related to our Clearwire investment. Net tax expense was $26 million in the second quarter. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."

Thanks, Brad, and thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in Sprint. If you turn to Slide 6, please. Let me recap the quarter's highlights before reviewing performance across our 3 key priorities: generating cash, improving the customer experience and building the brand. Adjusted OIBDA of $1.45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter exceeded both our internal projections and Street consensus. Adjusted OIBDA margin of 17.9% represents a sequential improvement of 277 basis points from the first quarter. Notably, adjusted OIBDA margin is also up 69 basis points from the second quarter of 2011, even with the dilutive impact of both the iPhone and our Network Vision investment in 2012. As I've mentioned before, the 2 most important wireless operating metrics that drive financial performance are churn and ARPU. For our Sprint platform postpaid business, both churn and ARPU were best-ever results for any quarter.
Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.38 is up $4.31 from the second quarter of last year. And for the third consecutive quarter, we posted the highest year-over-year postpaid ARPU increase on record for any major U.S. wireless company. We set the all-time record for Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. In the same quarter, we delivered our best-ever Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.69%. This represents an improvement of 31 basis points sequentially and 3 basis points over our previous record quarter one year ago. We also achieved our ninth consecutive quarter of positive net adds for the Sprint platform postpaid business. We made progress on our Network Vision deployment. We've launched LTE service in 5 major metro areas and today, we're announcing early completion of 2012's iDEN network fitting forecast with all 9,600 iDEN cell sites already off air. We are now activating new Network Vision sites on air at a rate which, if we maintain our current implementation pace in existing cities and bring in new cities as planned during the year, we'll achieve our 2012 plan. The current week-by-week plans from our vendors show us achieving our goal of approximately 12,000 sites on air by the end of the year. 
Finally, based on the ongoing strength of our core Sprint platform business, we are increasing our forecast for full year 2012 adjusted OIBDA performance to a range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. 
If you please turn to Slide 7, I'll organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities. Let me begin with cash. In spite of a significant increase in capital investment associated with our Network Vision deployment, this quarter, we again improved our liquidity position by generating $209 million of free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.8 billion. During the quarter, we completed our first vendor financing arrangement and retired $1 billion of outstanding debt ahead of it's scheduled maturity. Our strong quarterly adjusted OIBDA performance in the quarter benefited from continued top line growth. We had solid revenue performance in all 3 areas of our Sprint platform wireless business. The Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate continues to increase with the ongoing impact of a $10 premium data charge as a result of the continued customer adoption of smartphones. At $63.38, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU reached a new all-time best level and is up, as I mentioned, $4.31 year-over-year. Total Sprint platform wireless service revenue is up over 16% compared to the year-ago period, with postpaid revenue up almost 13%, prepaid revenue up over 30% and wholesale and other revenue up over 125% year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, this quarter represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total operating revenues and our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Total operating revenues are up almost 6.5% year-over-year.
As I said earlier, we reported an improvement both sequentially and year-over-year in our adjusted OIBDA margin performance. While far from where we wanted to be, we delivered a meaningful a 69-basis point improvement in margin from the second quarter of 2011. Although postpaid gross add volume was within 10% of a year ago, we grew adjusted OIBDA margin while absorbing the dilutive impacts this year of our 2 key investment areas, Network Vision deployment and the iPhone. As I transition to a discussion of our customer experience and brand results, I'd like to begin with a brief overview of the iPhone, which benefits both areas. 
Turning to Slide 8. In spite of seasonal softness in industry gross adds from Q1 to Q2, we activated nearly 1.5 million iPhones in the second quarter, similar to last year -- or similar to last quarter. As I've said before, the most important near-term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that are new customers to Sprint because they represent new sources of revenue. In the second quarter, 40% of our iPhone activations were new customers, well in excess of our competitors' historical results and our third consecutive quarter at or above 40%. Longer term, the most important metric of success with the iPhone will be the anticipated lower churn rate of iPhone customers. All of our early life iPhone customer experience metrics continue to be encouraging. We are beginning to see benefits from the iPhone, including lower support costs in service and repair. To date, although still young in its product life cycle, we are observing materially lower early like churn rates for iPhone customers compared to other smartphone customers. The operational performance so far continues to support our decision to carry the iPhone. Considering postpaid devices only, we are ahead of the pace required to meet our contracted commitments to Apple.
Turning to Slide 9 and the customer experience. I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter in a well-known and important third-party independent measure of customer satisfaction, we matched our all-time best rating for overall satisfaction for the Sprint brand. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, which made its findings public in May, Sprint is #1 among all national carriers in overall customer satisfaction and the most improved U.S. company across all 47 industries studied over the last 4 years. We also achieved new best-ever levels for customer calls to care across both our postpaid and prepaid customer bases. We're not buying satisfaction. Customer care credits in the second quarter were the lowest or best for any quarter on record. Both postpaid and prepaid customer credits each hit best-ever levels, savings that drop straight to the bottom line.
Our multi-year intense focus on improving our customers' experience with Sprint is continuing to manifest itself in improved churn performance. Sprint platform postpaid churn reached a new all-time best, 1.69% and prepaid churn at 2.53% matches our best-ever reported churn level and is at the lowest level in almost 7 years. Sprint platform prepaid churn has shown year-over-year improvement for 11 consecutive quarters. While the introduction of the Assurance brand, which has a lower churn rate than typical prepaid brands, has helped these results, we have also made progress in improving the churn performance of our Boost and Virgin Mobile customer bases.
Moving to Slide 10. Verizon, AT&T and the Sprint platform each reported record low postpaid churn results this quarter. This is good for the industry as no single metric drives profitability more than churn. But as a result, there are fewer postpaid decisions or new customers to go after, especially if you adjust out ancillary devices like the iPad. The 2G iDEN network has been a source of customers for other platforms, most of all for Verizon for the past few years. We have data going back 4.5 years. But in a typical year prior to this one, based on porting data, we estimate Verizon got almost half of all iDEN DX. Sprint recaptured about 25%. AT&T acquired 20% and T-Mobile about 5%. Verizon benefited from sheer size and by having a push-to-talk CDMA product. From 2008 to 2011, the Nextel platform provided about twice as much benefit to Verizon subscriber numbers and almost as much benefit to AT&T subscriber base as it did to the Sprint platform.
Prior to late 2011, our most effective financial strategy was to do all we could to maintain customers on the Nextel platform, to reduce churn until we had Sprint Direct Connect network technology and devices and until we needed to begin active customer migration, so that we could shut down the iDEN network in 2013. So before this year, the best financial strategy was to retain customers on the fixed cost iDEN platform as long as possible. From 2008 to 2011, we decreased the number of Nextel postpaid DX per year by 66% and improved churn by more than 50 basis points.
Once we declared the end of life for the iDEN platform, a new strategy was warranted. It costs us about $200 less to acquire an iDEN customer than to go out and get a new customer from a competitor. We have described on previous calls how we will give priority to OIBDA over customer growth in 2012. We've spent less in advertising than we spent last year.
Given the low number of new postpaid phone decisions anticipated in 2012 and the fact that we are now stimulating high churn on the iDEN network so that we can shut it down in 2013, we decided to focus our limited marketing resources on acquiring Nextel platform customers, because of the advantage that the new Sprint Direct Connect provides us as well as because of lower acquisition costs. So in 2012, for the first time, the Sprint platform is out-acquiring Verizon, as we're more than doubling Sprint's historical share of Nextel postpaid DX. We likely will not be able to sustain last quarter's 60% recapture rate, but we feel we are focusing our limited marketing spend in the best way possible.
Turning to Slide 11. As I mentioned before, perhaps, the most important brand metric is the Net Promoter Score, which is a brand's supporters minus its detractors. In a well-known independent survey, the Net Promoter Score for Sprint is at an all-time high, and Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major carriers to show improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. In another independent third-party survey, the Sprint, Boost and Virgin brands each achieved all-time best scores for Purchase Consideration. One of the most tangible proof points of our brand improvement is the net porting position for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Being net port positive means more of our competitors' customers switched to Sprint than switch from Sprint to a competitor. Before the third quarter of 2010, the Sprint platform had never in its long history been net port positive. I'm pleased to report that we just achieved our eighth consecutive net port positive quarter.
Please turn to Slide 12. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 442,000 represent our ninth consecutive quarter of positive net adds. When measured by net adds over an 8-quarter period as a percentage of the customer base, the Sprint platform is the fastest-growing postpaid brand among the national carriers in spite of not having the iPad, a major contributor to the net add performance of our competitors or until recently even the iPhone. And as I mentioned earlier, with relatively little advantage compared to our large competitors from Nextel platform DX until recently. Our total customer base also continues to grow. This quarter, we reached a record 56.4 million wireless customers. 
Last quarter, we launched innovative new handsets and products. We are pleased -- I think you should be on Slide 13 -- with the early results of our new LTE handsets, including the latest addition to the EVO product family, the HTC EVO 4G LTE. In spite of an initial launch delay, it quickly became one of our top-selling devices. We're seeing good early results for the Samsung Galaxy S III launched early in the third quarter. We've also seen good market reaction to our new 4G WiMAX prepaid offerings launched late in the quarter. We are seeing prepaid WiMax devices in the high single-digit percentages of our total prepaid sales. And finally, at the end of the quarter, we broke new ground with our Virgin Mobile brand as the first national prepaid carrier to offer the iPhone. It's too early to share results, and we have not yet begun advertising Virgin's iPhone. 
Finally, I'm pleased to announce today that Sprint will be launching the Motorola PHOTON Q 4G LTE device in the very near future, our sixth 4G LTE device of 2012 and the first LTE world phone.
The Motorola PHOTON Q is a ULE Platinum Certified premium QWERTY slider with robust business and consumer features. We also continue to innovate in business solutions, evidenced by our announcement of wholesale and retail cloud services and a refresh of capabilities in our Sprint Biz 360 portfolio, which provides mobility solutions for small business customers. In the quarter, we also introduced Sprint Guardian, an industry first suite of mobile safety and security applications. 
As I conclude my remarks, please turn to Slide 14. We are early in the second phase of the turnaround, investing for future growth. We're making progress in our core business operations, which funds these investments. We know we have much work ahead of us to achieve the margins we and our investors want. We've achieved all-time bests for the 2 factors that are the most significant determinants of the profitability of our postpaid wireless business, churn and ARPU. As we work to streamline our network infrastructure and wind down the Nextel platform, we have a vibrant and growing portfolio of Sprint platform businesses that will be the foundation for our expected margin expansion in Phase III of the turnaround. 
Thank you for your ongoing interest and support of Sprint, and I will now hand over the call to Steve Elfman, who will give you an update on Network Vision."

We remain confident in our ability and the ability of our vendors to achieve our goals. Please turn to Slide 16. 
We are announcing today that we have completed our network thinning effort on the Nextel platform for this year. We've executed our thinning plans rapidly and nearly 3 months ahead of our guidance last quarter. Two weeks ago, we completed our thinning in our last market, which means we have now reached our goal of 9,600 sites for the year and have reduced the number of towers servicing the Nextel platform by 1/3. As a reminder, the network thinning process is not expected to cause any meaningful disruption to on-street coverage nor is it complete decommissioning. It is a process of taking certain cell sites off the air and recalibrating the network to support lower traffic volumes. The network of the Nextel platform was originally built to support approximately 20 million subs. And as of the end of the second quarter, we were approximately 4.4 million subs subscribers remaining. The thinning process allows us to reduce our costs, while maintaining service for those customers who remain on the platform. The completion of network thinning is an important step for Sprint towards achieving our expected margin improvement goals. This quarter, we announced that we expect to complete the shutdown of the remaining Nextel platform cell sites as of June 30 -- as early as June 30, 2013. We have had a lot of questions in costs and the timing of the expected cost savings. Joe will give an update on Network Vision financial outlook shortly, but I want to provide you with some direction on our expectations of the timing of savings, as we implement Nextel platform thinning and move to full decommissioning.
Within the first 6 months after we take a cell site off the air, we eliminate utility, backhaul and maintenance costs. On average, these represent approximately 40% of the annual tower costs and rent represents approximately 60%. By early 2014, we expect that from an adjusted OIBDA perspective, we will achieve the majority and projected savings related to the shutdown of the platform.
Please turn to Slide 17. As Dan discussed, we've been very successful in our recapture efforts on the Nextel platform, with 60% of postpaid customers staying with Sprint in the second quarter. One of the factors in our success is the strength of our Sprint Direct Connect product, which continues to show industry-leading push-to-talk call setup times. We continue to expand and improve our SDC portfolio and we are confident we have the best push-to-talk product available in the market. 
During the quarter, we launched the Kyocera DuraXT, our fifth rugged SDC handset. At the same time, we enabled Sprint Direct Connect to work on both our voice network and roam outside of our footprint, which means our customers now have greater coverage than they did on the Nextel platform.
Please turn to Slide 18. The next slide of -- is the Network Vision's score card, which I showed you last quarter, with an update on the solid progress we have made. As I discussed last quarter, a critical part of this project is building a good pipeline of sites for construction. To date, we have completed leasing on over 12,700 sites and zoning on over 13,900 sites. We are either ready for construction or underway on over 6,300 or 52% of the sites we're planning to bring on air this year.
On July 15, we launched 4G LTE in 5 major markets in 15 cities, including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Atlanta and Kansas City. We also announced the accelerated LTE launch in Waco, Texas and expect to launch 4 additional cities, including Baltimore, by the end of August. The network is performing well and the average speeds are highly competitive. We now have over 2,000 Network Vision sites on air. As Dan has said, we are now activating Network Vision sites on air at a rate which, if we maintain our current pace in the existing cities and bring in new cities as planned during the year, we will achieve our 2012 plan. The current week-by-week plans from our vendors continue to show us achieving approximately 12,000 sites by the end of the year.
You should remember that Network Vision is not just about LTE. It's about modernization of our entire network, which includes voice and 3G. The coverage improvements that we are seeing on these towers are substantial. As we bring the sites up, early results show a 10% to 20% jump in voice minutes per site overnight, a very important indicator of expected future roaming savings. We expect these results to continue to improve as we light up 800 megahertz CDMA voice and handsets with this capability continue to penetrate the base.
Another important milestone in the quarter was the approval by the SEC for the deployment of LTE in the 800 megahertz band. I want to reiterate our confidence in both the Network Vision build and the Nextel platform decommissioning. The technology is working well and our 3 vendors continue to pick up the pace to hit our goals. With that, I will now turn it over to Joe to go through the financials."

Last quarter, I discussed the key financial measures of our business, growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform an",2640,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I discussed the key financial measures of our business, growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. These priorities remain unchanged in the second quarter. We executed well against each of them.  I'm particularly pleased with our adjusted OIBDA results. Adjusted OIBDA of $1.45 billion in Q2 was up 20% sequentially, with flat sequential iPhone sales volumes and an increase of Network Vision impacts from approximately $100 million in the first quarter to approximately $175 million in Q2.
Even more gratifying, adjusted OIBDA grew 10% year-over-year, while fully absorbing the incremental impact of our iPhone and Network Vision operating expenses and with only a slight decline in gross adds. This growth in adjusted OIBDA is a direct result of our revenue growth, lower upgrades due to policy changes implemented last year and cost containment due to our ongoing commitment to disciplined growth.
Moving to Slide 21. Our core Sprint platform business continues to show strong growth in both subscribers and revenues. Total customers on the Sprint platform increased by nearly 1.3 million in the quarter and contributed 3% sequentially and 16% year-over-year growth in Sprint platform service revenues. Our Sprint platform postpaid business performed especially well this quarter. While Sprint platform postpaid gross adds of 1.5 million were down slightly year-over-year, the comparative quarter in 2011 was one in which we acquired some lower quality customers, which resulted in elevated churn for the past few quarters. I'm pleased to say that this elevated churn is now behind us, and our customer acquisition in the second quarter displays our ongoing commitment to disciplined growth. Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 442,000 grew by 96% year-over-year and 68% sequentially, aided by our best-ever Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.69%.
As we indicated for the past 3 quarters, we expected involuntary churn to improve significantly this quarter as we move past the temporary churn bubble. This improvement in involuntary churn, as well as sequential improvement in voluntary churn, allowed us to post our best-ever postpaid churn on the Sprint platform. Going forward, we expect Sprint platform postpaid churn to return to normal seasonal patterns, typically, a sequential increase in Q3 followed by a sequential decline in Q4. The strength of our Sprint platform net adds was greatly supported by our focus on the recapture of Nextel customers to our ongoing Sprint platform business. Q2 was our most successful quarter yet in this effort, recapturing 60% or approximately 431,000 of Nextel platform postpaid customers. This result is well above our original business case expectation and better than both the 46% recapture rate in the first quarter of this year and the 39% rate in the fourth quarter of 2011.
As these customers move to the Sprint platform, we are typically seeing an increase in company postpaid ARPU as they transition to a higher mix of smartphones and take the premium data add-on charge. So our focus on the recapture effort is both cost-effective and is revenue accretive to the company as a whole, although slightly dilutive to Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. The success of the program to date gives us the confidence that we should achieve a recapture rate above 40% for the next 2 quarters. However, as we enter 2013 and approach the complete shutdown of the network, we expect the recapture rate to decline. Our current progress with the recapture effort has exceeded our expectations and our overall progress in reacquiring the Nextel customer base gives us confidence that we will meet or exceed our original guidance of a 30% recapture rate as we move toward the goal of complete shutdown of the Nextel platform by midyear 2013. To the extent that customers begin to leave the Nextel platform faster than expected, this may move some Nextel postpaid net losses that were anticipated in 2013 into the current year. As Dan mentioned, the Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.38 reached its highest level ever this quarter, growing by 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The sequential increase to ARPU was due to continued penetration of our premium data add-on charge to the base, as well as changes to certain group discount policies, which tightened eligibility requirements and reduced customer credits in the second quarter. We do not anticipate these changes to group discount policies will provide sequential benefit going forward. 81% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset sales in the second quarter were smartphones, and approximately 72% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset base now has smartphones.
We continue to enjoy strong sequential ARPU benefits on the Sprint platform from penetration of the premium data add-on charge, which we expect to continue through the second half of the year. While accretive to the company as a whole, the success of our Nextel recapture rate does manifest itself in some ARPU dilution on the Sprint platform, through both migration credits and the assimilation of lower ARPU subscribers into a higher ARPU base. Because of the strong recapture rate in Q2, along with the impact of the group discount policy changes I just mentioned, could cause a temporary dilutive effect on the sequential change in Sprint platform ARPU from Q2 to Q3, while providing a continued sequential ongoing benefit to the company as a whole. We expect Sprint platform postpaid ARPU would revert back to its sequential quarterly growth in Q4.
Moving to Slide 22. Our Sprint platform prepaid business also continues to grow as we added 451,000 customers in the quarter. While the prepaid business continues to enjoy good growth, the second quarter showed lower subscriber growth due to typical seasonal slowness for Boost and Virgin Mobile, as well as impacts to net ads associated with the changes in the regulatory environment of the lifeline industry. Aggressive competitive behavior in the lifeline segment ahead of regulatory deadlines, as well as the complexity associated with implementing these new requirements, has had an impact on subscriber numbers across the industry in Q2. The regulatory changes that occurred in the second quarter are still being implemented and the ultimate impacts are difficult to predict. However, given these changes, we believe there will be a significant reassessment of overall volumes and thus, competitive behavior in the lifeline industry. Because of this, we expect our Assurance Wireless and lifeline industry wholesale net add volumes to be adversely affected for the rest of the year. We are engaged in ongoing assessment of the new environment and plan to continue to offer high-value service options to current potential new lifeline customers. Despite this impact, the fundamentals of our prepaid business are strong. Prepaid service revenue on the Sprint platform grew almost 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Our Boost brand on the Sprint platform continues to produce very strong customer growth and the total Boost brand is growing despite Nextel platform declines. Within a very competitive environment, the substantial improvement in churn we have made in the Boost and Virgin brands of approximately 100 basis points year-over-year has contributed to our strong revenue growth.
Our wholesale and affiliate business also continues to show very good growth. While net adds of 388,000 were also negatively impacted by seasonality and the lifeline regulatory changes, wholesale affiliate and other revenues grew a robust 20% sequentially and more than 100% year-over-year. We continue to expect strong year-over-year revenue growth in wholesale and affiliate business throughout the remainder of the year.
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on Slide 23. Total wireless cost of service in the second quarter was $2.3 billion or 31% of service revenues. This is a 2-percentage point gross margin improvement year-over-year and a 1-percentage point sequentially, even with incremental Network Vision spend in a seasonal uptick in 3G roaming of $30 million sequentially.  Service and repair cost were down year-over-year and sequentially, driven by lower transaction volumes and higher refurbished replacement rates. The positive impacts of the iPhone and the success of the Sprint buyback program, which was recently named the best in the industry by Compass Intelligent Research, are contributing to the improvements in our cost structure.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the second quarter was approximately $1.5 billion, a sequential decline of $93 million and an increase of $322 million year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in subsidy expense is largely driven by our iPhone investment, while high end per unit subsidy is already beginning to show operational expense benefits in other areas of the business, including lower returns, service and repair, and calls to care. We believe our results this quarter reflect the soundness of this investment. 
As we look at the second half of the year, our quarterly adjusted OIBDA results could be impacted by the timing of a possible launch of a new iPhone. While we do not know if or when a new iPhone may be launched this year, our adjusted OIBDA estimates for the second half of the year assume incremental iPhone sales associated with the new iPhone launch. We are also expecting an increase in upgrade activity in the back half of the year, as a larger percentage of our base becomes upgrade eligible and we experience normal seasonal upgrade patterns. To the extent these iPhone sales are higher or lower, this will affect our adjusted OIBDA projections.
Total wireless selling, general and administrative costs of $2.3 billion were flat year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. This means our wireless SG&A expense, as a percentage of wireless service revenue, improved by 3 percentage points year-over-year, even inclusive of an incremental $70 million of selling expense associated with direct sourced iPhones. Excluding this expense, selling expense would have been reduced by nearly 4% year-over-year. This strong improvement in our expenses is due to our ongoing, company-wide focus on cost management, which is evident across our business in the second quarter. 
As Dan mentioned, we have recently rolled out our new lineup of LTE devices and launched LTE service in 15 cities. As we look at the second half of 2012, we expect that we will begin to make select additional marketing investments to support the continued growth of our business.
Please turn to Slide 24. The strong core business performance I have outlined has resulted in wireless adjusted OIBDA growth of 23% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The total Network Vision impact to adjusted OIBDA was approximately $175 million during the quarter compared to approximately $100 million in the first quarter of 2012 and minimal amounts in the second quarter of 2011. We expect that our Network Vision-related dilution will continue to show sequential increases through the remainder of 2012. The strong underlying growth of our core Sprint platform business gives us confidence in our ability to continue to invest in our long-term margin expansion goals. 
Now switching to wireline. Adjusted OIBDA for the second quarter was $149 million, a sequential decline of 7% and a year-over-year decline of 29%. While declines in this business continue, favorability in switched access, as well as operational improvements in billing accuracy and collections, are improving our outlook for the year. Because of these favorable trends, we are now expecting 2012 wireline adjusted OIBDA to be approximately $600 million.
Moving to Slide 25. I now want to update our 2012 Network Vision outlook. We estimate approximately $300 million of improvement in our 2012 Network Vision adjusted OIBDA impact versus our original business plan. We are now estimating 2012  dilution from Network Vision of approximately $800 million compared to our previous estimate of $1.1 billion. Just over 50% of the $800 million dilution in 2012 will impact cost of service and just over 35% will impact the net subsidy expense. Of the $300 million change from our previous estimate, an estimated $220 million of the benefit from the original guidance is subscriber-related, due to lower-than-expected customer losses on the Nextel platform. An estimated $115 million of the benefit is due to lower-than-expected duplicative site cost as we deploy Network Vision, better-than-expected Ethernet rates versus our original business case and lower backhaul and other expenses related to the accelerated thinning of the Nextel platform. 
The third and smallest area of our estimated adjusted OIBDA savings is due to the treatment of tower lease expense for thinned Nextel platform sites, which Brad detailed at the beginning of the call, and which is cash neutral. The current estimated benefits we are seeing to our original business case reflect the success of the project to date. At this point, our previous estimate of approximately $100 million dilution to adjusted OIBDA in 2013 and the broader economics of Network Vision remain largely unchanged and at year end, we will refine these numbers as needed. In addition, we will be posting supplemental slides on our website that provide additional detail on the 2012 Network Vision update after the call.
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 26. We continued to make improvements to our liquidity and capital structure this quarter. During the quarter, we entered into a new $1 billion secured equipment credit facility with a syndicate of international banks to finance equipment purchases from Ericsson for Network Vision. We ended the second quarter with a total liquidity position of $8 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.8 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility. We also have an additional $1 billion of liquidity from the secured credit facility, of which $500 million is available currently through May 2013 and another $500 million is available beginning April 2013 through May 2014. We continue to work with our Network Vision vendors to pursue additional export credit financing. We also retired $1 billion of 2013 debt maturities and now have less than $800 million of maturities due in 2013.
We are confident about our ability to finance the investments we are making in the core business. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.2 billion which excluded $102 million of capitalized interest and included $704 million of Network Vision capital. Re-banding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was approximately $50 million for the second quarter. Our CapEx outlook for 2012 remains unchanged at approximately $6 billion, excluding capitalized interest and re-banding.  Free cash flow for the second quarter was $209 million compared to $138 million in the first quarter and $267 million a year ago.
Moving on to our expectations on Slide 27. Because of the strong trends we are seeing, we are very pleased to announce today an increase in our adjusted OIBDA outlook for 2012 to a range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our core Sprint platform business and by the early favorable trends in Network Vision expenses. At the same time, we remain ever vigilant in our focus on execution and on maintaining balanced growth in a highly competitive environment. The first half of 2012 has shown good underlying fundamentals in our business. And as we look to the second half of the year, we expect these strong underlying trends to continue and to support the ramp-up in our Network Vision investments and a potential iPhone refresh. At the same time, we will maintain the flexibility to perform competitively in the market. As always, we will continue our commitment to cost discipline and our focus on executing against our key financial priorities: growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. We are pleased with our performance to date. We are thankful for the great execution by our employees and vendors, and we are excited about the quarters to come. I'll turn the call back over to Brad."

Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Moving to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the second quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move on to earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the second quarter were $0.46 compared to $0.29 in the first quarter and $0.28 in the year-ago period. There were a few noteworthy items impacting EPS this quarter that I'd like to cover, the first 2 of which are related to our progress towards the eventual shutdown of the Nextel platform. First, the loss per share in the current period included incremental depreciation expense of $782 million or negative $0.26 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform. We have updated our estimate of the expected useful life of the Nextel assets, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense this quarter. Excluding incremental CapEx spend, our assets and servicing, we expect depreciation expense to be around $2.6 billion for the second half of 2012 and around $3.6 billion for 2013, which is expected to be disproportionately weighted towards the first half of 2013 due to Nextel assets being fully depreciated by the middle of 2013.
The current period also included $184 million or approximately negative $0.06 per share for lease exit costs, which are the net present value of remaining lease obligations associated with certain Nextel platform cell sites, which were taken off air during the quarter. In the second quarter, we shut down approximately 8,300 Nextel platform sites. However, locations from which we may continue to gain future economic benefit, including co-located sites, were not included in this charge and represented approximately 30% -- 36% of total Nextel sites shutdown in the second quarter. During the third quarter to date, we have shut down approximately 1,300 Nextel platform sites, a portion of which will also incur a charge in our third quarter results, expected to be approximately $20 million. We expect no additional fitting of the Nextel platform in 2012 at this time. We estimate that approximately $8 million and $77 million of operating expense would have been incurred in the second quarter and the second half of 2012  respectively, for the full year 2012 impact of $85 million if Sprint did not take these actions.
Lastly, we also recorded an impairment of $204 million or negative $0.07 per share related to our Clearwire investment. Net tax expense was $26 million in the second quarter. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."

Thanks, Brad, and thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in Sprint. If you turn to Slide 6, please. Let me recap the quarter's highlights before reviewing performance across our 3 key priorities: generating cash, improving the customer experience and building the brand. Adjusted OIBDA of $1.45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter exceeded both our internal projections and Street consensus. Adjusted OIBDA margin of 17.9% represents a sequential improvement of 277 basis points from the first quarter. Notably, adjusted OIBDA margin is also up 69 basis points from the second quarter of 2011, even with the dilutive impact of both the iPhone and our Network Vision investment in 2012. As I've mentioned before, the 2 most important wireless operating metrics that drive financial performance are churn and ARPU. For our Sprint platform postpaid business, both churn and ARPU were best-ever results for any quarter.
Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.38 is up $4.31 from the second quarter of last year. And for the third consecutive quarter, we posted the highest year-over-year postpaid ARPU increase on record for any major U.S. wireless company. We set the all-time record for Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. In the same quarter, we delivered our best-ever Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.69%. This represents an improvement of 31 basis points sequentially and 3 basis points over our previous record quarter one year ago. We also achieved our ninth consecutive quarter of positive net adds for the Sprint platform postpaid business. We made progress on our Network Vision deployment. We've launched LTE service in 5 major metro areas and today, we're announcing early completion of 2012's iDEN network fitting forecast with all 9,600 iDEN cell sites already off air. We are now activating new Network Vision sites on air at a rate which, if we maintain our current implementation pace in existing cities and bring in new cities as planned during the year, we'll achieve our 2012 plan. The current week-by-week plans from our vendors show us achieving our goal of approximately 12,000 sites on air by the end of the year. 
Finally, based on the ongoing strength of our core Sprint platform business, we are increasing our forecast for full year 2012 adjusted OIBDA performance to a range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. 
If you please turn to Slide 7, I'll organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities. Let me begin with cash. In spite of a significant increase in capital investment associated with our Network Vision deployment, this quarter, we again improved our liquidity position by generating $209 million of free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.8 billion. During the quarter, we completed our first vendor financing arrangement and retired $1 billion of outstanding debt ahead of its scheduled maturity. Our strong quarterly adjusted OIBDA performance in the quarter benefited from continued top line growth. We had solid revenue performance in all 3 areas of our Sprint platform wireless business. The Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate continues to increase with the ongoing impact of a $10 premium data charge as a result of the continued customer adoption of smartphones. At $63.38, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU reached a new all-time best level and is up, as I mentioned, $4.31 year-over-year. Total Sprint platform wireless service revenue is up over 16% compared to the year-ago period, with postpaid revenue up almost 13%, prepaid revenue up over 30% and wholesale and other revenue up over 125% year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, this quarter represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total operating revenues and our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Total operating revenues are up almost 6.5% year-over-year.
As I said earlier, we reported an improvement both sequentially and year-over-year in our adjusted OIBDA margin performance. While far from where we wanted to be, we delivered a meaningful a 69-basis point improvement in margin from the second quarter of 2011. Although postpaid gross add volume was within 10% of a year ago, we grew adjusted OIBDA margin while absorbing the dilutive impacts this year of our 2 key investment areas, Network Vision deployment and the iPhone. As I transition to a discussion of our customer experience and brand results, I'd like to begin with a brief overview of the iPhone, which benefits both areas. 
Turning to Slide 8. In spite of seasonal softness in industry gross adds from Q1 to Q2, we activated nearly 1.5 million iPhones in the second quarter, similar to last year -- or similar to last quarter. As I've said before, the most important near-term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that are new customers to Sprint because they represent new sources of revenue. In the second quarter, 40% of our iPhone activations were new customers, well in excess of our competitors' historical results and our third consecutive quarter at or above 40%. Longer term, the most important metric of success with the iPhone will be the anticipated lower churn rate of iPhone customers. All of our early life iPhone customer experience metrics continue to be encouraging. We are beginning to see benefits from the iPhone, including lower support costs in service and repair. To date, although still young in its product life cycle, we are observing materially lower early like churn rates for iPhone customers compared to other smartphone customers. The operational performance so far continues to support our decision to carry the iPhone. Considering postpaid devices only, we are ahead of the pace required to meet our contracted commitments to Apple.
Turning to Slide 9 and the customer experience. I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter in a well-known and important third-party independent measure of customer satisfaction, we matched our all-time best rating for overall satisfaction for the Sprint brand. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, which made its findings public in May, Sprint is #1 among all national carriers in overall customer satisfaction and the most improved U.S. company across all 47 industries studied over the last 4 years. We also achieved new best-ever levels for customer calls to care across both our postpaid and prepaid customer bases. We're not buying satisfaction. Customer care credits in the second quarter were the lowest or best for any quarter on record. Both postpaid and prepaid customer credits each hit best-ever levels, savings that drop straight to the bottom line.
Our multi-year intense focus on improving our customers' experience with Sprint is continuing to manifest itself in improved churn performance. Sprint platform postpaid churn reached a new all-time best, 1.69% and prepaid churn at 2.53% matches our best-ever reported churn level and is at the lowest level in almost 7 years. Sprint platform prepaid churn has shown year-over-year improvement for 11 consecutive quarters. While the introduction of the Assurance brand, which has a lower churn rate than typical prepaid brands, has helped these results, we have also made progress in improving the churn performance of our Boost and Virgin Mobile customer bases.
Moving to Slide 10. Verizon, AT&T and the Sprint platform each reported record low postpaid churn results this quarter. This is good for the industry as no single metric drives profitability more than churn. But as a result, there are fewer postpaid decisions or new customers to go after, especially if you adjust out ancillary devices like the iPad. The 2G iDEN network has been a source of customers for other platforms, most of all for Verizon for the past few years. We have data going back 4.5 years. But in a typical year prior to this one, based on porting data, we estimate Verizon got almost half of all iDEN DX. Sprint recaptured about 25%. AT&T acquired 20% and T-Mobile about 5%. Verizon benefited from sheer size and by having a push-to-talk CDMA product. From 2008 to 2011, the Nextel platform provided about twice as much benefit to Verizon subscriber numbers and almost as much benefit to AT&T subscriber base as it did to the Sprint platform.
Prior to late 2011, our most effective financial strategy was to do all we could to maintain customers on the Nextel platform, to reduce churn until we had Sprint Direct Connect network technology and devices and until we needed to begin active customer migration, so that we could shut down the iDEN network in 2013. So before this year, the best financial strategy was to retain customers on the fixed cost iDEN platform as long as possible. From 2008 to 2011, we decreased the number of Nextel postpaid DX per year by 66% and improved churn by more than 50 basis points.
Once we declared the end of life for the iDEN platform, a new strategy was warranted. It costs us about $200 less to acquire an iDEN customer than to go out and get a new customer from a competitor. We have described on previous calls how we will give priority to OIBDA over customer growth in 2012. We've spent less in advertising than we spent last year.
Given the low number of new postpaid phone decisions anticipated in 2012 and the fact that we are now stimulating high churn on the iDEN network so that we can shut it down in 2013, we decided to focus our limited marketing resources on acquiring Nextel platform customers, because of the advantage that the new Sprint Direct Connect provides us as well as because of lower acquisition costs. So in 2012, for the first time, the Sprint platform is out-acquiring Verizon, as we're more than doubling Sprint's historical share of Nextel postpaid DX. We likely will not be able to sustain last quarter's 60% recapture rate, but we feel we are focusing our limited marketing spend in the best way possible.
Turning to Slide 11. As I mentioned before, perhaps, the most important brand metric is the Net Promoter Score, which is a brand's supporters minus its detractors. In a well-known independent survey, the Net Promoter Score for Sprint is at an all-time high, and Sprint is the only 1 of the 4 major carriers to show improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. In another independent third-party survey, the Sprint, Boost and Virgin brands each achieved all-time best scores for Purchase Consideration. One of the most tangible proof points of our brand improvement is the net porting position for the Sprint platform postpaid business. Being net port positive means more of our competitors' customers switched to Sprint than switch from Sprint to a competitor. Before the third quarter of 2010, the Sprint platform had never in its long history been net port positive. I'm pleased to report that we just achieved our eighth consecutive net port positive quarter.
Please turn to Slide 12. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 442,000 represent our ninth consecutive quarter of positive net adds. When measured by net adds over an 8-quarter period as a percentage of the customer base, the Sprint platform is the fastest-growing postpaid brand among the national carriers in spite of not having the iPad, a major contributor to the net add performance of our competitors or until recently even the iPhone. And as I mentioned earlier, with relatively little advantage compared to our large competitors from Nextel platform DX until recently. Our total customer base also continues to grow. This quarter, we reached a record 56.4 million wireless customers. 
Last quarter, we launched innovative new handsets and products. We are pleased -- I think you should be on Slide 13 -- with the early results of our new LTE handsets, including the latest addition to the EVO product family, the HTC EVO 4G LTE. In spite of an initial launch delay, it quickly became one of our top-selling devices. We're seeing good early results for the Samsung Galaxy S III launched early in the third quarter. We've also seen good market reaction to our new 4G WiMAX prepaid offerings launched late in the quarter. We are seeing prepaid WiMax devices in the high single-digit percentages of our total prepaid sales. And finally, at the end of the quarter, we broke new ground with our Virgin Mobile brand as the first national prepaid carrier to offer the iPhone. It's too early to share results, and we have not yet begun advertising Virgin's iPhone. 
Finally, I'm pleased to announce today that Sprint will be launching the Motorola PHOTON Q 4G LTE device in the very near future, our sixth 4G LTE device of 2012 and the first LTE world phone.
The Motorola PHOTON Q is a ULE Platinum Certified premium QWERTY slider with robust business and consumer features. We also continue to innovate in business solutions, evidenced by our announcement of wholesale and retail cloud services and a refresh of capabilities in our Sprint Biz 360 portfolio, which provides mobility solutions for small business customers. In the quarter, we also introduced Sprint Guardian, an industry first suite of mobile safety and security applications. 
As I conclude my remarks, please turn to Slide 14. We are early in the second phase of the turnaround, investing for future growth. We're making progress in our core business operations, which funds these investments. We know we have much work ahead of us to achieve the margins we and our investors want. We've achieved all-time bests for the 2 factors that are the most significant determinants of the profitability of our postpaid wireless business, churn and ARPU. As we work to streamline our network infrastructure and wind down the Nextel platform, we have a vibrant and growing portfolio of Sprint platform businesses that will be the foundation for our expected margin expansion in Phase III of the turnaround. 
Thank you for your ongoing interest and support of Sprint, and I will now hand over the call to Steve Elfman, who will give you an update on Network Vision."

We remain confident in our ability and the ability of our vendors to achieve our goals. Please turn to Slide 16. 
We are announcing today that we have completed our network thinning effort on the Nextel platform for this year. We've executed our thinning plans rapidly and nearly 3 months ahead of our guidance last quarter. Two weeks ago, we completed our thinning in our last market, which means we have now reached our goal of 9,600 sites for the year and have reduced the number of towers servicing the Nextel platform by 1/3. As a reminder, the network thinning process is not expected to cause any meaningful disruption to on-street coverage nor is it complete decommissioning. It is a process of taking certain cell sites off the air and recalibrating the network to support lower traffic volumes. The network of the Nextel platform was originally built to support approximately 20 million subs. And as of the end of the second quarter, we were approximately 4.4 million subs subscribers remaining. The thinning process allows us to reduce our costs, while maintaining service for those customers who remain on the platform. The completion of network thinning is an important step for Sprint towards achieving our expected margin improvement goals. This quarter, we announced that we expect to complete the shutdown of the remaining Nextel platform cell sites as of June 30 -- as early as June 30, 2013. We have had a lot of questions in costs and the timing of the expected cost savings. Joe will give an update on Network Vision financial outlook shortly, but I want to provide you with some direction on our expectations of the timing of savings, as we implement Nextel platform thinning and move to full decommissioning.
Within the first 6 months after we take a cell site off the air, we eliminate utility, backhaul and maintenance costs. On average, these represent approximately 40% of the annual tower costs and rent represents approximately 60%. By early 2014, we expect that from an adjusted OIBDA perspective, we will achieve the majority and projected savings related to the shutdown of the platform.
Please turn to Slide 17. As Dan discussed, we've been very successful in our recapture efforts on the Nextel platform, with 60% of postpaid customers staying with Sprint in the second quarter. One of the factors in our success is the strength of our Sprint Direct Connect product, which continues to show industry-leading push-to-talk call setup times. We continue to expand and improve our SDC portfolio and we are confident we have the best push-to-talk product available in the market. 
During the quarter, we launched the Kyocera DuraXT, our fifth rugged SDC handset. At the same time, we enabled Sprint Direct Connect to work on both our voice network and roam outside of our footprint, which means our customers now have greater coverage than they did on the Nextel platform.
Please turn to Slide 18. The next slide of -- is the Network Vision's score card, which I showed you last quarter, with an update on the solid progress we have made. As I discussed last quarter, a critical part of this project is building a good pipeline of sites for construction. To date, we have completed leasing on over 12,700 sites and zoning on over 13,900 sites. We are either ready for construction or underway on over 6,300 or 52% of the sites we're planning to bring on air this year.
On July 15, we launched 4G LTE in 5 major markets in 15 cities, including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Atlanta and Kansas City. We also announced the accelerated LTE launch in Waco, Texas and expect to launch 4 additional cities, including Baltimore, by the end of August. The network is performing well and the average speeds are highly competitive. We now have over 2,000 Network Vision sites on air. As Dan has said, we are now activating Network Vision sites on air at a rate which, if we maintain our current pace in the existing cities and bring in new cities as planned during the year, we will achieve our 2012 plan. The current week-by-week plans from our vendors continue to show us achieving approximately 12,000 sites by the end of the year.
You should remember that Network Vision is not just about LTE. It's about modernization of our entire network, which includes voice and 3G. The coverage improvements that we are seeing on these towers are substantial. As we bring the sites up, early results show a 10% to 20% jump in voice minutes per site overnight, a very important indicator of expected future roaming savings. We expect these results to continue to improve as we light up 800 megahertz CDMA voice and handsets with this capability continue to penetrate the base.
Another important milestone in the quarter was the approval by the SEC for the deployment of LTE in the 800 megahertz band. I want to reiterate our confidence in both the Network Vision build and the Nextel platform decommissioning. The technology is working well and our 3 vendors continue to pick up the pace to hit our goals. With that, I will now turn it over to Joe to go through the financials."
417206,212439000,332544,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2012",2012-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I discussed the key financial measures of our business, growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform an",2640,"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Last quarter, I discussed the key financial measures of our business, growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. These priorities remain unchanged in the second quarter. We executed well against each of them.  I'm particularly pleased with our adjusted OIBDA results. Adjusted OIBDA of $1.45 billion in Q2 was up 20% sequentially, with flat sequential iPhone sales volumes and an increase of Network Vision impacts from approximately $100 million in the first quarter to approximately $175 million in Q2.
Even more gratifying, adjusted OIBDA grew 10% year-over-year, while fully absorbing the incremental impact of our iPhone and Network Vision operating expenses and with only a slight decline in gross adds. This growth in adjusted OIBDA is a direct result of our revenue growth, lower upgrades due to policy changes implemented last year and cost containment due to our ongoing commitment to disciplined growth.
Moving to Slide 21. Our core Sprint platform business continues to show strong growth in both subscribers and revenues. Total customers on the Sprint platform increased by nearly 1.3 million in the quarter and contributed 3% sequentially and 16% year-over-year growth in Sprint platform service revenues. Our Sprint platform postpaid business performed especially well this quarter. While Sprint platform postpaid gross adds of 1.5 million were down slightly year-over-year, the comparative quarter in 2011 was one in which we acquired some lower quality customers, which resulted in elevated churn for the past few quarters. I'm pleased to say that this elevated churn is now behind us, and our customer acquisition in the second quarter displays our ongoing commitment to disciplined growth. Sprint platform postpaid net adds of 442,000 grew by 96% year-over-year and 68% sequentially, aided by our best-ever Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.69%.
As we indicated for the past 3 quarters, we expected involuntary churn to improve significantly this quarter as we move past the temporary churn bubble. This improvement in involuntary churn, as well as sequential improvement in voluntary churn, allowed us to post our best-ever postpaid churn on the Sprint platform. Going forward, we expect Sprint platform postpaid churn to return to normal seasonal patterns, typically, a sequential increase in Q3 followed by a sequential decline in Q4. The strength of our Sprint platform net adds was greatly supported by our focus on the recapture of Nextel customers to our ongoing Sprint platform business. Q2 was our most successful quarter yet in this effort, recapturing 60% or approximately 431,000 of Nextel platform postpaid customers. This result is well above our original business case expectation and better than both the 46% recapture rate in the first quarter of this year and the 39% rate in the fourth quarter of 2011.
As these customers move to the Sprint platform, we are typically seeing an increase in company postpaid ARPU as they transition to a higher mix of smartphones and take the premium data add-on charge. So our focus on the recapture effort is both cost-effective and is revenue accretive to the company as a whole, although slightly dilutive to Sprint platform postpaid ARPU. The success of the program to date gives us the confidence that we should achieve a recapture rate above 40% for the next 2 quarters. However, as we enter 2013 and approach the complete shutdown of the network, we expect the recapture rate to decline. Our current progress with the recapture effort has exceeded our expectations and our overall progress in reacquiring the Nextel customer base gives us confidence that we will meet or exceed our original guidance of a 30% recapture rate as we move toward the goal of complete shutdown of the Nextel platform by midyear 2013. To the extent that customers begin to leave the Nextel platform faster than expected, this may move some Nextel postpaid net losses that were anticipated in 2013 into the current year. As Dan mentioned, the Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.38 reached its highest level ever this quarter, growing by 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The sequential increase to ARPU was due to continued penetration of our premium data add-on charge to the base, as well as changes to certain group discount policies, which tightened eligibility requirements and reduced customer credits in the second quarter. We do not anticipate these changes to group discount policies will provide sequential benefit going forward. 81% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset sales in the second quarter were smartphones, and approximately 72% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset base now has smartphones.
We continue to enjoy strong sequential ARPU benefits on the Sprint platform from penetration of the premium data add-on charge, which we expect to continue through the second half of the year. While accretive to the company as a whole, the success of our Nextel recapture rate does manifest itself in some ARPU dilution on the Sprint platform, through both migration credits and the assimilation of lower ARPU subscribers into a higher ARPU base. Because of the strong recapture rate in Q2, along with the impact of the group discount policy changes I just mentioned, could cause a temporary dilutive effect on the sequential change in Sprint platform ARPU from Q2 to Q3, while providing a continued sequential ongoing benefit to the company as a whole. We expect Sprint platform postpaid ARPU would revert back to its sequential quarterly growth in Q4.
Moving to Slide 22. Our Sprint platform prepaid business also continues to grow as we added 451,000 customers in the quarter. While the prepaid business continues to enjoy good growth, the second quarter showed lower subscriber growth due to typical seasonal slowness for Boost and Virgin Mobile, as well as impacts to net ads associated with the changes in the regulatory environment of the lifeline industry. Aggressive competitive behavior in the lifeline segment ahead of regulatory deadlines, as well as the complexity associated with implementing these new requirements, has had an impact on subscriber numbers across the industry in Q2. The regulatory changes that occurred in the second quarter are still being implemented and the ultimate impacts are difficult to predict. However, given these changes, we believe there will be a significant reassessment of overall volumes and thus, competitive behavior in the lifeline industry. Because of this, we expect our Assurance Wireless and lifeline industry wholesale net add volumes to be adversely affected for the rest of the year. We are engaged in ongoing assessment of the new environment and plan to continue to offer high-value service options to current potential new lifeline customers. Despite this impact, the fundamentals of our prepaid business are strong. Prepaid service revenue on the Sprint platform grew almost 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Our Boost brand on the Sprint platform continues to produce very strong customer growth and the total Boost brand is growing despite Nextel platform declines. Within a very competitive environment, the substantial improvement in churn we have made in the Boost and Virgin brands of approximately 100 basis points year-over-year has contributed to our strong revenue growth.
Our wholesale and affiliate business also continues to show very good growth. While net adds of 388,000 were also negatively impacted by seasonality and the lifeline regulatory changes, wholesale affiliate and other revenues grew a robust 20% sequentially and more than 100% year-over-year. We continue to expect strong year-over-year revenue growth in wholesale and affiliate business throughout the remainder of the year.
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on Slide 23. Total wireless cost of service in the second quarter was $2.3 billion or 31% of service revenues. This is a 2-percentage point gross margin improvement year-over-year and a 1-percentage point sequentially, even with incremental Network Vision spend in a seasonal uptick in 3G roaming of $30 million sequentially.  Service and repair cost were down year-over-year and sequentially, driven by lower transaction volumes and higher refurbished replacement rates. The positive impacts of the iPhone and the success of the Sprint buyback program, which was recently named the best in the industry by Compass Intelligent Research, are contributing to the improvements in our cost structure.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the second quarter was approximately $1.5 billion, a sequential decline of $93 million and an increase of $322 million year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in subsidy expense is largely driven by our iPhone investment, while high end per unit subsidy is already beginning to show operational expense benefits in other areas of the business, including lower returns, service and repair, and calls to care. We believe our results this quarter reflect the soundness of this investment. 
As we look at the second half of the year, our quarterly adjusted OIBDA results could be impacted by the timing of a possible launch of a new iPhone. While we do not know if or when a new iPhone may be launched this year, our adjusted OIBDA estimates for the second half of the year assume incremental iPhone sales associated with the new iPhone launch. We are also expecting an increase in upgrade activity in the back half of the year, as a larger percentage of our base becomes upgrade eligible and we experience normal seasonal upgrade patterns. To the extent these iPhone sales are higher or lower, this will affect our adjusted OIBDA projections.
Total wireless selling, general and administrative costs of $2.3 billion were flat year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. This means our wireless SG&A expense, as a percentage of wireless service revenue, improved by 3 percentage points year-over-year, even inclusive of an incremental $70 million of selling expense associated with direct sourced iPhones. Excluding this expense, selling expense would have been reduced by nearly 4% year-over-year. This strong improvement in our expenses is due to our ongoing, company-wide focus on cost management, which is evident across our business in the second quarter. 
As Dan mentioned, we have recently rolled out our new lineup of LTE devices and launched LTE service in 15 cities. As we look at the second half of 2012, we expect that we will begin to make select additional marketing investments to support the continued growth of our business.
Please turn to Slide 24. The strong core business performance I have outlined has resulted in wireless adjusted OIBDA growth of 23% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The total Network Vision impact to adjusted OIBDA was approximately $175 million during the quarter compared to approximately $100 million in the first quarter of 2012 and minimal amounts in the second quarter of 2011. We expect that our Network Vision-related dilution will continue to show sequential increases through the remainder of 2012. The strong underlying growth of our core Sprint platform business gives us confidence in our ability to continue to invest in our long-term margin expansion goals. 
Now switching to wireline. Adjusted OIBDA for the second quarter was $149 million, a sequential decline of 7% and a year-over-year decline of 29%. While declines in this business continue, favorability in switched access, as well as operational improvements in billing accuracy and collections, are improving our outlook for the year. Because of these favorable trends, we are now expecting 2012 wireline adjusted OIBDA to be approximately $600 million.
Moving to Slide 25. I now want to update our 2012 Network Vision outlook. We estimate approximately $300 million of improvement in our 2012 Network Vision adjusted OIBDA impact versus our original business plan. We are now estimating 2012  dilution from Network Vision of approximately $800 million compared to our previous estimate of $1.1 billion. Just over 50% of the $800 million dilution in 2012 will impact cost of service and just over 35% will impact the net subsidy expense. Of the $300 million change from our previous estimate, an estimated $220 million of the benefit from the original guidance is subscriber-related, due to lower-than-expected customer losses on the Nextel platform. An estimated $115 million of the benefit is due to lower-than-expected duplicative site cost as we deploy Network Vision, better-than-expected Ethernet rates versus our original business case and lower backhaul and other expenses related to the accelerated thinning of the Nextel platform. 
The third and smallest area of our estimated adjusted OIBDA savings is due to the treatment of tower lease expense for thinned Nextel platform sites, which Brad detailed at the beginning of the call, and which is cash neutral. The current estimated benefits we are seeing to our original business case reflect the success of the project to date. At this point, our previous estimate of approximately $100 million dilution to adjusted OIBDA in 2013 and the broader economics of Network Vision remain largely unchanged and at year end, we will refine these numbers as needed. In addition, we will be posting supplemental slides on our website that provide additional detail on the 2012 Network Vision update after the call.
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 26. We continued to make improvements to our liquidity and capital structure this quarter. During the quarter, we entered into a new $1 billion secured equipment credit facility with a syndicate of international banks to finance equipment purchases from Ericsson for Network Vision. We ended the second quarter with a total liquidity position of $8 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.8 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility. We also have an additional $1 billion of liquidity from the secured credit facility, of which $500 million is available currently through May 2013 and another $500 million is available beginning April 2013 through May 2014. We continue to work with our Network Vision vendors to pursue additional export credit financing. We also retired $1 billion of 2013 debt maturities and now have less than $800 million of maturities due in 2013.
We are confident about our ability to finance the investments we are making in the core business. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.2 billion which excluded $102 million of capitalized interest and included $704 million of Network Vision capital. Re-banding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was approximately $50 million for the second quarter. Our CapEx outlook for 2012 remains unchanged at approximately $6 billion, excluding capitalized interest and re-banding.  Free cash flow for the second quarter was $209 million compared to $138 million in the first quarter and $267 million a year ago.
Moving on to our expectations on Slide 27. Because of the strong trends we are seeing, we are very pleased to announce today an increase in our adjusted OIBDA outlook for 2012 to a range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our core Sprint platform business and by the early favorable trends in Network Vision expenses. At the same time, we remain ever vigilant in our focus on execution and on maintaining balanced growth in a highly competitive environment. The first half of 2012 has shown good underlying fundamentals in our business. And as we look to the second half of the year, we expect these strong underlying trends to continue and to support the ramp-up in our Network Vision investments and a potential iPhone refresh. At the same time, we will maintain the flexibility to perform competitively in the market. As always, we will continue our commitment to cost discipline and our focus on executing against our key financial priorities: growth of subscribers and revenues in our core ongoing Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. We are pleased with our performance to date. We are thankful for the great execution by our employees and vendors, and we are excited about the quarters to come. I'll turn the call back over to Brad."

And most importantly, each one of the vendors has really refined their logistics processes, basically getting the product out of country to warehouse to the site and up the pole, so -- and have ramped up their crews appropriately. So that's what gives us a lot of confidence. And at the same time, the key as we've said before is getting the pipeline and getting the leasing, getting the zoning.

After that we will open up the call to your questions. 
However, due to securities law issues relating to the pending transaction, we will only address questions related to the ongoing business and not with respect to the pending soft baked transaction or M&A related questions. Under the merger agreement, a preliminary proxy statement with respect to the transaction is expected to be filed by the end of November, and it will contain a complete description of the merger and related matters. We appreciate your understanding of and cooperation regarding this issue.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I do want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we'll be discussing forward looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our annual report on Form 10-K and when filed, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2012.
Turning to Slide 3, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move on to earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the third quarter were $0.26 compared to $0.46 in the second quarter and $0.10 in the year-ago period. There were a couple of noteworthy items impacting EPS this quarter that I'd like to cover. First, the loss per share in the current period included incremental depreciation expense of $397 million or negative $0.13 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform. Our expectation for accelerated depreciation in Q4 is similar to that of this quarter, and we expect total depreciation for the fourth quarter of approximately $1.5 billion. Accelerated depreciation for 2013 is expected to be disproportionately weighted toward the first half of 2013 due to Nextel assets being fully depreciated by the middle of 2013.
The current period also includes $22 million or approximately negative $0.01 per share for lease exit costs, which are the net present value of remaining lease obligations associated with certain Nextel platform cell sites which were taken off air during the quarter. In the third quarter, we shut down approximately 1,300 Nextel platform sites, bringing the total number of sites shutdown to approximately 9,600 in 2012. However, locations from which we may continue to gain future economic benefit, including co-located sites, were not included in this charge and represented approximately 39% of total Nextel sites shutdown during 2012. We estimate that absent the actions taken to terminate leases in the second and third quarters of 2012, rent expense would've been higher by approximately $38 million for the third quarter and approximately $85 million for the full year 2012.
Net tax expense was $47 million in the third quarter primarily related to state taxes. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. I will now turn the call over to Sprint CEO, Dan Hesse"

As Brad mentioned, today's call is about our performance in the third quarter. Our 3 priorities continue to be the customer experience, our brand and cash. But as I've mentioned in previous quarters this year because of our heavy investments in our investment phase, our #1 priority in 2012 is cash. 
Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted OIBDA of approximately $1.28 billion exceeded both our internal projections and Street consensus for the fifth consecutive quarter. Although our adjusted OIBDA margin at 16% is not yet where we wanted to be over time, we are pleased with this quarter's results given the dilutive impacts of our 2 major investment areas, Network Vision and the iPhone, including the launch of the iPhone 5. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Sprint platform business. Postpaid ARPU for the Sprint platform is up 5% year-over-year, and we achieved our best ever third quarter results for Sprint platform postpaid churn at 1.88%. Total prepaid churn of 3.37% is our best performance for any quarter ever and represents our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. 
In the first half of 2012, we recaptured 55% of the postpaid customers leaving the Nextel platform, double our historic performance level and a level we did not believe we could sustain in the second half. I'm pleased to report we recaptured 59% of the parting Nextel postpaid customers in the third quarter.
We had a successful launch of the iPhone 5 and again achieved an industry-leading 40% gross add mix across all of our iPhone activations in the quarter. We also made solid progress on Network Vision deployment. We now have over 20,000 cell sites with zoning and leasing complete and over 13,500 now under construction or ready for construction. 
Finally, based on the performance of our business, we are again increasing our adjusted OIBDA forecast for the year and we now expect to slightly exceed the top end of the range of our 2012 adjusted OIBDA forecast, which we raised significantly a quarter ago.
If you please turn to Slide 7, I'll organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities. Let me begin with cash. As you recall, we are in the second phase of our turnaround, where we are investing in Network Vision and the iPhone, investments we expect will provide us with margin growth in Phase III. We have now entered the cash burn quarters of the investment phase with CapEx ramping up to $1.49 billion this quarter. We ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.3 billion. As you have read, earlier this week, Sprint received $3.1 billion of additional cash as a result of a convertible bond offering to Softbank.
Please turn to Slide 8. Delivering solid operational profitability as measured by adjusted OIBDA is our #1 priority as we work through these heavy investment quarters. We delivered better-than-expected adjusted OIBDA as we benefited from continued year-over-year ARPU strength in both our postpaid and prepaid Sprint platform wireless businesses. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU is up $3 or 5%, and prepaid ARPU is up $0.84 or over 3% year-over-year. Total postpaid ARPU is at its highest level in over 6 years. On a consolidated basis, total net operating revenue is up over 5% compared to the year ago period. This quarter represents our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in net operating revenues.
Please turn to Slide 9. We continued our disciplined approach to subscriber acquisition in the quarter. As I described last quarter, we are continuing to prioritize the recapture of our Nextel subscribers over traditional customer acquisition spend because of the efficiency of a lower-cost to recapture of over $200 per customer versus the cost for acquiring a new customer in the marketplace. As I mentioned, our 59% recapture rate topped expectations and our strong performance for the first half for the year. As we work toward a complete shutdown of the Nextel platform anticipated for the middle of next year, we are making good progress in moving customers off the platform. As of the end of the third quarter, we are down the 3.1 million subscribers on the platform, down from 7 million a year ago. Even though we added nearly 900,000 customers to the Sprint platform this quarter, we reduced the iDEN base by over 1.3 million customers this quarter, so total company subscribers declined by 423,000 in the quarter. This 30% stimulated decline in the size of the Nextel subscriber base in one quarter is by far the largest ever. The previous 2 quarters declines were 18% and 13%, respectively, and before that, the decline had rarely been above 10%. In absolute terms, the loss is the largest since the first quarter of 2008.
Loss of iDEN platform customers pressures our top line results. But clearing the Nextel platform so we could shut down the network and harvest the spectrum are key elements of our plan to reduce expenses and grow margin in future periods. 
The iPhone benefits both the customer experience and the brand. In spite of a slowdown in iPhone sales early in the quarter as customers anticipated the launch of the iPhone 5, as you can see on Slide 10, we activated approximately 1.5 million iPhones in the third quarter. As I said, the most important ear term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that our new customers to Sprint, because they represent a new source of revenue. In the third quarter, 40% of our iPhone activations were new customers, in excess of our competitor's historical results and our fourth consecutive quarter at or above 40%.
Early life iPhone customer experience metrics are encouraging. To date, we are continuing to observe materially lower early life voluntary for iPhone customers compared to other smartphone customers and lower support costs as measured by calls to care and device service and repair costs. The operational performance of continues to validate our decision to invest in the iPhone, and we are also ahead of the pace required to meet our contractual commitments to Apple.
Turning to Slide 11 and the customer experience. I'm pleased to report that Sprint customers continue to enjoy an industry-leading experience as reflected by our #1 ranking in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. This quarter, we received 2 J.D. Power awards that attest to the improvements we've made in the customer experience over the last 4 years. The Sprint brand is now ranked highest in satisfaction with the purchase experience among full-service wireless providers for the third consecutive time and the Virgin brand is ranked highest in satisfaction for customer care with 9 contract service for the second consecutive time.
Improved customer experience in Sprint continues to manifest itself in our churn performance. Sprint platform postpaid churn was our best ever for third quarter, and Sprint platform prepaid has delivered year-over-year improvement in churn for each of the last 12 quarters. While the assurance brand churn benefited from some regulatory changes to the subscriber base eligibility validation process in the third quarter, both the Virgin and Boost Sprint platform churn rates are down materially year-over-year. Our total prepaid churn set an all-time best record this quarter.
Turning to Slide 12, one aspect of our brand I'm particularly proud of is the progress we're making in sustainability. Corporate social responsibility is a hallmark of the Sprint brand. Newsweek's ranking of the greenest companies in America was released this week and again, Sprint was named the third greenest company in the United States. Again, we're the only telecom carrier to make the top 25. This quarter, we were also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America as the Mobile Telecommunications Sector Leader for the second year in a row.
Please turn to Slide 13. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, the Sprint platform continues to grow. In the quarter, we reached 52.9 million customers served on the Sprint platform, our all time highest level. This is our 11th consecutive quarter of posting net subscriber additions on the Sprint platform. When measured by net adds or any quarter period as a percentage of the customer base, Sprint platform is the fastest-growing postpaid brand among the national carriers in spite of not having the iPad, a major contributor to the net add performance of our competitors. Tuesday, we announced the Sprint will carry the iPad Mini and the fourth-generation iPad, which we believe will aid our subscriber performance going forward. 
Finally on Slide 14, in addition to the highly successful iPhone 5, we continue to grow our portfolio of LTE devices, including 3 additional new LTE smartphones in the quarter. Additionally, we are continuing to innovate in service offerings, including the u connect vehicle connection offering with Chrysler, our new Bring Your Own Device offering for business and the cloud-enabled Microsoft 365 offering for small and midsize businesses. 
So in conclusion, the third quarter represented a quarter of solid execution with particular focus on 3 areas. Number one, cash, as we increased our adjusted OIBDA forecast yet again; number two, recapturing as many Nextel customers as possible with the recapture rate that exceeded the year's first half; and number three, implementing Network Vision with Steve Elfman will now give you an update on."

The third quarter, we continued  to make strong progress with the Network Vision pipeline. The pace of Network Vision has accelerated, and we continue to be confident in the technology and the benefits. We now have zoning complete on over 21,500 sites and leasing complete on over 20,000 sites, more than 55% increase over Q2 for each. Over 13,500 sites are ready or have already begun construction, an increase of more than 115% over the second quarter. Our weekly construction starts are now up more than 250% from Q2, and sites completed per week is now up over 200% from last quarter. We'd expanded a number of cities in the construction to over 200 and we have now launched LTE in 32 cities with more than 115 expected to launch in the months to come. We now have nearly 4,300 sites on air, more than double where we were 3 months ago.
Throughout this process, we've talked to you about the fact that we've been working with our vendors and pushing them very hard to achieve the goal they committed to at the beginning of the year. While we're encouraged by the momentum of the project, we have been seeing some delays from our vendors largely related to logistics execution and material shortages, as well as some delays related to the hurricanes in the third quarter. And now we believe we are approximately one quarter behind in hitting the 12,000 target.
The delay during the front end of the project has not meaningfully changed our expectations of timing or cost of the project. We have all hands on deck and are laser focused on deploying as quickly as possible in order to bring the benefits of LTE and enhanced 3G to our customers. As we discussed with you in the past quarters, we are strategically launching LTE markets early, so we can let consumers know that Sprint's LTE is available in their neighborhood or coming soon as they make decisions and can provide them an enhanced and continuing improving performance as we build new sites.
Turning to Slide 17. During the quarter, I was very pleased with our strong execution and progress on the elimination of the Nextel platform. We are well on pace to have the platform shut down in the mid-2013 and expect margin benefits in the second half of the year. Following our completion of the thinning of 9,600 sites in July, we have completed AXIS disconnects and powering down of all equipment for virtually all of those sites during the third quarter. We are already starting to see the financial benefits from these actions, which Joe will review in a few minutes.
As Dan said, we recaptured 59% of the Nextel platform postpaid customers during the quarter, which continues to beat our expectations. At the end of Q3, we had nearly 1.2 million Sprint Direct Connect customers, and we are pleased with performance of the product. We're encouraged with the progress we are seeing in our negotiations with our large business customers, and I'm pleased to say that we have already confirmed migration agreements with several large accounts. A continued success in the Nextel platform conversion reinforces our expectations of margin benefits in the latter part of next year. 
The third quarter has been a quarter of steady execution of Network Vision. We continue to exceed expectations on the Nextel platform and the progress we are making there yielding benefits. Our pacing on Network Vision build continues to gain momentum, and we're bringing LTE to new customers daily. I will continue to push our vendors and my team everyday to improve execution and accelerate our pace.
I look forward to updating you next quarter. I'll turn it over to Joe to update you on the financial results."
417206,217777044,369735,"Sprint Nextel Corp., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2012",2012-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Sprint Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and thanks everyone for being here today. As I laid out for you at the beginning of the year, my ongoing priorities for the business are in 3 areas: The growth of subscribers and revenues in our score Sprint platform business, strong rec",2357,"Thank you, Steve, and thanks everyone for being here today. As I laid out for you at the beginning of the year, my ongoing priorities for the business are in 3 areas: The growth of subscribers and revenues in our score Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. These are the most important areas of execution for future financial strength, and am pleased to report we continue to yield solid results in each area.
First, our focus on the growth of subscribers and revenues in each our core Sprint platform business has resulted in an increase in the total customers on the Sprint platform of nearly 900,000 in the quarter and 14% year-over-year growth in wireless service revenues. Second, our 59% recapture rate of postpaid Nextel customers to the Sprint platform in the third quarter continues to exceed our expectations. And finally, we continue to achieve adjusted OIBDA results above expectations because of our focus on discipline growth and profitability.
Moving to Slide 19. Our Sprint platform postpaid business continues to show strong growth in both subscribers and revenues. Sprint platform postpaid net adds grew by 55% year-over-year as a result of our strong recapture rate of Nextel subscribers. While Sprint platform postpaid gross adds were down year-over-year in an environment of lower industry decisions, they were up nearly 6% sequentially. This is despite our ongoing focus on Nextel recapture rate rather than external, more costly acquisition. As we entered the third quarter, we realized that industry decisions would be delayed in advance of the iPhone launch at the end of the quarter, so we chose to conserve our marketing dollars and continue to focus on recapture. With our current powerful device line up, including our upcoming launch of the iPad in November, you'll see a seasonal increase some of our external marketing efforts in the fourth quarter.
At it is the focus on the Nextel platform that allowed us to recapture nearly 60% of postpaid Nextel customers to our ongoing Sprint platform business in both of the last 2 quarters. This success gives us the confidence juries our expected recapture rate for Q4 to over 45%. However, as we have previously stated, we fully expect the recapture rate to decline in 2013.
As we have discussed with you in the past few quarters, the majority of the recaptures we've achieved have come from consumer and small business accounts, which are less complex. We continue to work with our larger business accounts and as Steve said, conversations are progressing well. At the end of the third quarter, approximately 1.8 million of the 2.3 million remaining postpaid customers on the Nextel platform were business accounts. While our work with our business customers is going well, we continue to expect that the recapture rate will be choppy as our customers make decisions and we approach the complete shutdown of the Nextel network.
One of the most important things we can do to create long-term margin improvement is to clear customers off the Nextel platform. We're also starting to see expense benefits of the thinning project in our results. Power-related expenses for the Nextel network declined by over $40 million sequentially, largely due to reduced rent, which benefits OIBDA only, and utility expenses, which benefit both OIBDA and cash. These benefits will increase once we are able to shut down the remainder of the network mid next year, so we are very focused on achieving that goal.
We also achieved our best ever third quarter Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.88%, which shows steady progress on this key metric despite some impacts we have seen related to our network, which should be expected with any major network build. While we do expect some hiccups with churn along the way as we work to execute rapidly on the Network Vision project, churn will be an ongoing focus for our business and we expect to see churn benefits from enhanced network quality when the build is complete.
As I indicated on last quarter's call, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of 63 21 was down slightly on a sequential basis but remained historic highs and grew 5% year-over-year due to the continued penetration of our premium data add-on charge. 81% of Sprint platform postpaid handset sales in the third quarter were smartphones, and approximately 73% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset base now have smartphones. As I discussed with you last quarter, the success of our Nextel recapture efforts manifested itself in some ARPU dilution on the Sprint platform through the assimilation of lower ARPU subscribers into a higher ARPU base. While our higher rate of recapture causes some dilution to the Sprint platform ARPU in the near-term, as I said, many of these customers are increasing their ARPU as they purchase smartphones so that recaptured customers are actually accretive to the total postpaid ARPU, which at $61.18, was the highest postpaid ARPU we have had in over 6 years. We expect that ARPU on the Sprint platform will resume sequential growth in Q4, as we believe some of the smartphone purchasing decisions in Q3 were pushed to Q4 due to the late launch of the iPhone in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 20. Our Sprint platform prepaid business also continues to grow. We added 459,000 customers in the quarter and posted our best ever third quarter Sprint platform prepaid churn up 2.93%, as we saw year-over-year improvements across all of our prepaid brands. These strong results supported the growth of Sprint platform prepaid revenue, which grew 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. 
Regulatory changes continue to affect the lifeline industry, which have impacted our assurance net adds year-over-year as they are implemented. We also expect the onetime impact to our assurance subscribers next year as we implement a recertification process of our assurance base as of June 1, 2012. Customers who do not recertify by the end of this year are expected to churn off in the second quarter of 2013 in accordance with our normal prepaid churn rules. This process is expected to have a significant impact on customer accounts throughout the lifeline industry. We continue to believe our assurance brand is best in class.
Our wholesale and affiliate business continues to post solid results. We have now had positive net adds for 11 consecutive quarters and nearly doubled revenues from the year-ago period. However, wholesale and affiliate net adds declined substantially from last quarter due to our prepaid resellers eliminating inactive accounts in the base largely associated with lifeline regulatory changes. We plan to continue working with our wholesale partners to eliminate inactive prepaid accounts in the fourth quarter. 
Let's move onto our wireless operating expenses on Slide 21. Total wireless cost of service in the third quarter was $2.3 billion or nearly 31% of service revenues, which is a 3 percentage point gross margin improvement year-over-year even with incremental Network Vision dilution. We continue to see benefits in service and repair expenses, which are down year-over-year due to lower transaction volumes and higher refurbished replacement rates, mostly attributable to our industry-leading retail buyback program. As I mentioned earlier, we are also starting to see lower rent and utilities expenses on the Nextel network from the accelerated thinning project this year.
Our 3G roaming expenses in the third quarter also declined by 4% year-over-year. While it is still early in the build and we still have a lot of work to do, this is the first year-over-year decline we have seen in 3G roaming cost since the fourth quarter of 2009. Total wireless cost of service was slightly down sequentially as lower Nextel network expenses more than offset a seasonally high service and repair and 3G roaming cost.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the third quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of $171 million sequentially and $481 million year-over-year. Higher subsidy rates on smartphones such as the iPhone, which was not in our device lineup in the year-ago period, continue to be a challenge for the industry and ourselves. However, we continue to see the benefits from our decision to carry the iPhone show up in other areas of the business such as lower returns and exchanges, lower calls to care and lower early life churn. The sequential increase to net subsidy expense was primarily related to over 375,000 additional Sprint platform upgrades as we introduced 2 iconic Android devices at the end of the second quarter, as well as launching the iPhone 5 at the end of the third quarter.
Total wireless selling, general and administrative costs of $2.3 billion were flat sequentially and up slightly year-over-year. However, this increase was almost entirely related to an incremental $72 million of selling expense associated with direct sourced iPhones that was not included in the prior-year period. Prior to carrying the iPhone, Sprint sourced all phones to our channels, and this expense was recognized as the subsidy. Excluding this expense, selling expenses had declined by 5% year-over-year, largely related to our continued efforts to increase volumes in our most cost-effective channels, which resulted in a 15% year-over-year increase in postpaid company own store gross adds and a 54% year-over-year increase in gross adds on our website. 
Our disciplined growth strategy is also benefiting us with reducing bad debt expense as we maintain tight credit standards and are smart about our channel mix. Bad debt expense as a percentage of total wireless service revenue were down from 2.4% to 1.8%, a 55-basis point reduction from the year-ago period.
Please turn to slide 22. As I stated earlier, I am particularly pleased that our disciplined approach to growth is leading the strong adjusted OIBDA results. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA of approximately $1.28 billion was almost $200 million above consensus estimates. Wireless adjusted OIBDA of $1.1 billion was down approximately $100 million from the year-ago period. However, the total estimated Network Vision impact to adjusted OIBDA was approximately $185 million during the quarter compared to approximately $30 million in the third quarter of 2011. This means that excluding the increased dilution from Network Vision, we have kept wireless adjusted OIBDA margins essentially flat despite the dilution of the iPhone. This result shows our continued focus on cost discipline. As Dan mentioned, the strength of our adjusted OIBDA results means that we now expect to slightly exceed the top end of our previously range guidance of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion for the year.
Now switching to wireline. Adjusted OIBDA for the third quarter was $158 million, a sequential increase of 6% and a year-over-year decline of 14%. The sequential growth was mostly related to smaller penalties in the third quarter for lower companywide T1 volumes largely related to Network Vision. We remain confident in our wireline adjusted OIBDA guidance of approximately $600 million for the year.
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 23. We continue to make improvements to our liquidity and capital structure this quarter. We raised $1.5 billion in the debt markets and use the proceeds to retire $473 million of 2013 debt maturities and $1 billion of 2015 maturities. This leaves us with only $317 million of debt maturities due in 2013, less than $1.4 billion due in 2014 and approximately $1.6 billion due in 2015. We ended the third quarter with a total liquidity position of $7.5 billion, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.3 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility which expires in October of 2013. We also have approximately $923 million of expected future liquidity from the secured equipment credit facility that we signed last quarter as we borrowed $77 million during the third quarter.
We continue to expect to fully utilize the secured equipment credit facility as we progress through the Network Vision project. In addition, this week we received $3.1 billion from Softbank related to issuance of a 7-year 1% convertible bond announced on October 15. We have substantially improved our capital position, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to execute on Network Vision and operational plans. 
Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion excluding $52 million of capitalized interest and including approximately $1.1 billion of Network Vision capital. Network Vision capital was up 54% sequentially as the build continues to gain momentum. With the shift in timing of some of the towers on air into early 2013, we expect that we will also see a shift of some capital expenses and Network Vision adjusted OIBDA dilution from 2012 to 2013. We now expect capital expenditures for 2012 to be less than $6 billion excluding capitalized interest and re-banding. Re-banding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was approximately $43 million for the third quarter, and we now expect approximately $200 million for the full year. 
Free cash flow for the third quarter was negative $487 million compared to $209 million in the second quarter and negative $273 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the third quarter was partially impacted by the increase in capital expenditures associated with Network Vision. We have now entered the cash burn period of our investment phase that we have anticipated for some time, and we expect to be free cash flow negative for the next several quarters. 
In closing, I am very pleased with the strong steady results that we continue to produce as we execute on Network Vision and we move through our investment phase. With many exciting developments for Sprint in the coming months, I want to emphasize that our discipline and focus on profitability will not change. Throughout the year, as we have embarked on the investment phase of our turnaround, we have kept our razor-sharp focus on disciplined, profitable growth, and that focus continues to show results. These benefits are allowing us to once again raise our adjusted OIBDA guidance to slightly exceed our previously raised guidance. I am proud of the team and we will continue our focus in discipline as we move forward and execute on our plan. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brad for Q&A."

And then just second, obviously for not that much money, you guys have kind of affected some substantive governance changes at Clearwire. I was wondering if you could kind of update us on your thinking with respect to Clearwire's ability right now as an independent company still to fund itself, to pursue objectives that are in Sprint's best interest in terms of LTE network build, et cetera?"

How much of that from an infrastructure perspective is being front-end loaded in the build, perhaps that be a question for Steve. And then just lastly on roaming expense trends encouraged to see the trends turning down. We see more of a kind of a 4G versus 3G focus in the latest buildout plans.

But again we're not talking specifically about the Softbank investment in Sprint today. But clearly, we will have a much more flexibility to make sure that our spectrum assets are what we need them to be. So we will look at what spectrum is available, either sold on the market or obviously it's also a part of whenever you do think of a combinations or mergers going down in the future, you look at what it does for the total spectrum position of the company. But you also pointed out that Sprint is in a pretty good position today with respect to spectrum in that as we aggressively and on purpose move Nextel customers off the Nextel platform, that very high value 800 megahertz spectrum is available for reuse, for 3G and for 4G LTE TD, for the Sprint platform customers, that's important, we of course have the 1.9 PCS and through our partnership with Clearwire, that high-capacity, high-frequency 2.5 gigahertz spectrum. But it's always good if you want to be the highest-quality network provider out there to have a good position in low, medium and high-frequency, and we will continue to be opportunistic when opportunities arise for access to additional spectrum, including opportunities like spectrum hosting on our Network Vision platform. So I'll turn it over to Steve."

Question 2 was in terms of roaming benefits with 3G as well as our 4G launches. We're seeing really good benefit in our roaming, as I think Joe pointed out in the results, even in this quarter. And for us, we are not just ramping the 4G, but also the 3G. Generally making one visit to the site, in some cases with 3G with one of our vendors. We have to make a second visit, but also with also one of our vendors, because we're replacing a current incumbent in some markets, we can more easily turn 4G on and not affect our customers the way when we have a partial build in a city. We choose not to put the 3G -- turn the 3G on, if you will, until we have enough sites and clusters up to minimize that effect of what's called sort of border crossings in those cities. So you'll see the benefits from roaming. They're there now, and you'll see more and more as we put up 3G, this is getting the critical mass of sites in the city to get that."

Verizon did have a good quarter, but we do a lot of research with all of our channels with care and what have you, and it is not due to their share data plans, we are seeing absolutely no evidence of it. They do have a substantial, but we think temporary, advantage in terms of LTE footprint. And also, as Steve kind of alluded to on the answer to his Paschal, we do have some what we call pardon our dust issues as we implement Network Vision market by market. So there are some temporary advantages that Verizon has due to its network. But we do not see making any changes to our rate plans in spite of low advertising spend and really a focus on iDEN recapture. We're pretty pleased with what the effectiveness of our marketing plans. I think when you look at subscribers overall, I think you alluded to this as well in your question, it is just much more economically beneficial for us to focus our resources on recapturing the iDEN customers, a substantially lower cost per gross add. Also to reduce cost, we have been shifting much more of the acquisition to our own channels. So we're seeing, if you will, a double-digit increase percentage in our retail stores year-over-year. We're seeing web growth, dramatic increase in our lowest cost acquisition channel, which is the web. So we're really focusing on profitability. And also, if you take a look at it overall, Jonathan, we added 900,000 customers to the Sprint platform. And as we're implementing Network Vision, the question is, how many customers do you want to add to the Sprint platform in a particular quarter to minimize the investment in just pure capacity, what we might call legacy, but at least a capital that will have shorter life than let's say Network Vision, so Network Vision capital would have. So all of these are -- we look at together, which is on the one hand we are accelerating the decline on purpose. I mentioned a 30% decline in the side of the iDEN base this quarter. We are focusing our guns knowing so many of those customers are going to be coming out on recapturing as many of them as possible. That's our focus, that's the most profitable way of using our dollars, knowing we're adding a lot of customers because of that to the Sprint platform and looking at our capacity and other resources that way. But back to your question about Verizon, we're seeing absolutely nothing in any of our channels that indicates that the new rate plans of Verizon has is either helping or hurting, to their credit, I don't think it's hurting them, because of their LTE footprint advantage right now, there being if you will blasting right through what we believe are complex rate plans.

First, the loss per share in the current period included incremental depreciation expense of $397 million or negative $0.13 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform. Our expectation for accelerated depreciation in Q4 is similar to that of this quarter, and we expect total depreciation for the fourth quarter of approximately $1.5 billion. Accelerated depreciation for 2013 is expected to be disproportionately weighted toward the first half of 2013 due to Nextel assets being fully depreciated by the middle of 2013.
The current period also includes $22 million or approximately negative $0.01 per share for lease exit costs, which are the net present value of remaining lease obligations associated with certain Nextel platform cell sites, which were taken off air during the quarter. 
In the third quarter, we shut down approximately 1,300 Nextel platform sites, bringing the total number of sites shut down to approximately 9,600 in 2012. However, locations from which we may continue to gain future economic benefit, including collocated sites, were not included in this charge and represented approximately 39% of total Nextel sites shut down during 2012. We estimate that absent the actions taken to terminate leases in the second and third quarters of 2012, rent expense would have been higher by approximately $38 million for the third quarter and approximately $85 million for the full year 2012.
Net tax expense was $47 million in the third quarter, primarily related to state taxes. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. 
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."

As Brad mentioned, today's call is about our performance in the third quarter. Our 3 priorities continue to be the customer experience, our brand and cash. But as I have mentioned in previous quarters of this year, because of our heavy investments in our investment phase, our #1 priority in 2012 is cash. 
Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted OIBDA of approximately $1.28 billion exceeded both our internal projections and street consensus for the fifth consecutive quarter. Although our adjusted OIBDA margin at 16% is not yet where we want it to be over time, we are pleased with this quarter's results given the dilutive impacts of our 2 major investment areas, Network Vision and the iPhone, including the launch of the iPhone 5. 
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Sprint platform business. Postpaid ARPU for the Sprint platform is up 5% year-over-year, and we achieved our best ever third quarter results for Sprint platform postpaid churn at 1.88%. Total prepaid churn of 3.37% is our best performance for any quarter ever and represents our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. 
In the first half of 2012, we recaptured 55% of the postpaid customers leaving the Nextel platform, double our historic performance level and a level we did not believe we could sustain in the second half. I'm pleased to report we recaptured 59% of departing Nextel postpaid customers in the third quarter.
We had a successful launch of the iPhone 5 and again achieved an industry-leading 40% gross add mix across all of our iPhone activations in the quarter. 
We also made solid progress on Network Vision deployment. We now have over 20,000 cell sites with zoning and leasing complete and over 13,500 now under construction or ready for construction. 
Finally, based on the performance of our business, we are again increasing our adjusted OIBDA forecast for the year, and we now expect to slightly exceed the top end of the range of our 2012 adjusted OIBDA forecast, which we raised significantly a quarter ago.
If you'd please turn to Slide 7, I'll organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities. Let me begin with cash. As you recall, we are in the second phase of our turnaround where we are investing in Network Vision and the iPhone, investments we expect will provide us with margin growth in Phase 3. We have now entered the cash burn quarters of the investment phase with CapEx ramping up to $1.49 billion this quarter. We ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.3 billion. As you have read, earlier this week, Sprint received $3.1 billion of additional cash as a result of a convertible bond offering to SOFTBANK.
Please turn to Slide 8. Delivering solid operational profitability, as measured by adjusted OIBDA, is our #1 priority as we work through these heavy investment quarters. We delivered better-than-expected adjusted OIBDA as we benefited from continued year-over-year ARPU strength in both our postpaid and prepaid Sprint platform wireless businesses. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU is up $3 or 5%, and prepaid ARPU is up $0.84 or over 3% year-over-year. Total postpaid ARPU is at its highest level in over 6 years. On a consolidated basis, total net operating revenue is up over 5% compared to the year ago period. This quarter represents our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in net operating revenues.
Please turn to Slide 9. We continued our disciplined approach to subscriber acquisition in the quarter. As I described last quarter, we are continuing to prioritize the recapture of our Nextel subscribers over traditional customer acquisition spend because of the efficiency of a lower cost per recapture of over $200 per customer versus the cost for acquiring a new customer in the marketplace. As I mentioned, our 59% recapture rate topped expectations and our strong performance for the first half for the year. As we work toward a complete shutdown of the Nextel platform anticipated for the middle of next year, we are making good progress in moving customers off the platform. As of the end of the third quarter, we are down to 3.1 million subscribers on the platform, down from 7 million a year ago. Even though we added nearly 900,000 customers to the Sprint platform this quarter, we reduced the iDEN base by over 1.3 million customers this quarter, so total company subscribers declined by 423,000 in the quarter. This 30% stimulated decline in the size of the Nextel subscriber base in 1 quarter is, by far, the largest ever. The previous 2 quarters' declines were 18% and 13%, respectively, and before that, the decline had rarely been above 10%. In absolute terms, the loss is the largest since the first quarter of 2008.
Loss of iDEN platform customers pressures our top line results. But clearing the Nextel platform so we could shut down the network and harvest the spectrum are key elements of our plan to reduce expenses and grow margin in future periods. 
The iPhone benefits both the customer experience and the brand. In spite of a slowdown in iPhone sales early in the quarter as customers anticipated the launch of the iPhone 5, as you can see on Slide 10, we activated approximately 1.5 million iPhones in the third quarter. As I said, the most important near-term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that are new customers to Sprint because they represent a new source of revenue. In the third quarter, 40% of our iPhone activations were new customers, in excess of our competitor's historical results, and our fourth consecutive quarter at or above 40%.
Early-life iPhone customer experience metrics are encouraging. To date, we are continuing to observe materially lower early-life voluntary churn rates for iPhone customers compared to other smartphone customers and lower support costs as measured by calls to care and device service and repair costs. The operational performance, so far, continues to validate our decision to invest in the iPhone. And we are also ahead of the pace required to meet our contractual commitments to Apple.
Turning to Slide 11 and the customer experience. I'm pleased to report that Sprint customers continue to enjoy an industry-leading experience as reflected by our #1 ranking in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. This quarter, we received 2 J.D. Power awards that attest to the improvements we've made in the customer experience over the last 4 years. The Sprint brand is now ranked highest in satisfaction with the purchase experience among full-service wireless providers for the third consecutive time and the Virgin brand is ranked highest in satisfaction for customer care with noncontract wireless service for the second consecutive time.
The improved customer experience at Sprint continues to manifest itself in our churn performance. Sprint platform postpaid churn was our best ever for a third quarter, and Sprint platform prepaid has delivered year-over-year improvement in churn for each of the last 12 quarters. While the Assurance brand churn benefited from some regulatory changes to the subscriber base eligibility validation process in the third quarter, both the Virgin and Boost, Sprint platform churn rates are down materially year-over-year. Our total prepaid churn set an all-time best record this quarter.
Turning to Slide 12. One aspect of our brand I am particularly proud of is the progress we're making in sustainability. Corporate social responsibility is a hallmark of the Sprint brand. Newsweek's ranking of the greenest companies in America was released this week, and again, Sprint was named the third greenest company in the United States. Again, we're the only telecom carrier to make the top 25. This quarter, we were also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America as the Mobile Telecommunications Sector Leader for the second year in a row.
Please turn to Slide 13. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, the Sprint platform continues to grow. In the quarter, we reached 52.9 million customers served on the Sprint platform, our all-time highest level. This is our 11th consecutive quarter of posting net subscriber additions on the Sprint platform. When measured by net adds over an 8-quarter period as a percentage of the customer base, the Sprint platform is the fastest-growing postpaid brand among the national carriers in spite of not having the iPad, a major contributor to the net add performance of our competitors. On Tuesday, we announced that Sprint will carry the iPad Mini and the fourth generation iPad, which, we believe, will aid our subscriber performance going forward. 
Finally, on Slide 14. In addition to the highly successful iPhone 5, we continue to grow our portfolio of LTE devices, including 3 additional new LTE smartphones in the quarter. Additionally, we are continuing to innovate in service offerings, including the Uconnect vehicle connection offering with Chrysler, our new bring-your-own-device offering for business and the cloud-enabled Microsoft 365 offering for small and midsized businesses. 
So in conclusion, the third quarter represented a quarter of solid execution with particular focus on 3 areas: number one, cash as we increased our adjusted OIBDA forecast yet again; number two, recapturing as many Nextel customers as possible with the recapture rate that exceeded the year's first half; and number three, implementing Network Vision, which Steve Elfman will now give you an update on."

I'm pleased to discuss our continued progress on Network Vision during the quarter. Please turn to Slide 16. In the third quarter, we continued  to make strong progress with the Network Vision pipeline. The pace of Network Vision has accelerated and we continue to be confident in the technology and the benefits. We now have zoning complete on over 21,500 sites and leasing complete on over 20,000 sites, more than 55% increase over Q2 for each. Over 13,500 sites are ready or have already begun construction, an increase of more than 115% over the second quarter. Our weekly construction starts are now up more than 250% from Q2, and sites completed per week is now up over 200% from last quarter. We've expanded the number of cities under construction to over 200, and we have now launched LTE in 32 cities with more than 115 expected to launch in the months to come. We now have nearly 4,300 sites on air, more than double where we were 3 months ago.
Throughout this process, we've talked to you about the fact that we've been working with our vendors and pushing them very hard to achieve the goal they committed to at the beginning of the year. While we're encouraged by the momentum of the project, we have been seeing some delays from our vendors, largely related to logistics execution and material shortages as well as some delays related to the hurricanes in the third quarter. And now, we believe, we're approximately 1 quarter behind in hitting the 12,000 target.
The delay during the front end of the project has not meaningfully changed our expectations of timing or cost of the project. We have all hands on deck and are laser-focused on deploying as quickly as possible in order to bring the benefits of LTE and enhanced 3G to our customers. 
As we discussed with you in the past quarters, we are strategically launching LTE markets early, so we can let consumers know that Sprint's LTE is available in their neighborhood or coming soon as they make decisions and can provide them an enhanced and continuing improving performance as we build new sites.
Turning to Slide 17. During the quarter, I was very pleased with our strong execution and progress on the elimination of the Nextel platform. We are well on pace to have the platform shut down in mid-2013 and expect margin benefits in the second half of the year. Following our completion of the thinning of 9,600 sites in July, we have completed access disconnects and powering down of all equipment for virtually all of those sites during the third quarter. We are already starting to seize the financial benefits from these actions, which Joe will review in a few minutes.
As Dan said, we recaptured 59% of the Nextel platform postpaid customers during the quarter, which continues to beat our expectations. At the end of Q3, we had nearly 1.2 million Sprint Direct Connect customers, and we are pleased with performance of the product. We are encouraged with the progress we are seeing in our negotiations with our large business customers and I'm pleased to say that we have already confirmed migration agreements with several large accounts. A continued success in the Nextel platform conversion reinforces our expectations of margin benefits in the latter part of next year. 
The third quarter has been a quarter of steady execution of Network Vision. We continue to exceed expectations on the Nextel platform and the progress we are making there yielding benefits. Our pacing on Network Vision build continues to gain momentum, and we're bringing LTE to new customers daily. I will continue to push our vendors and my team everyday to improve execution and accelerate our pace.
I look forward to updating you next quarter. I'll turn over to Joe to update you on the financial results."

As I laid out for you at the beginning of the year, my ongoing priorities for the business are in 3 areas: the growth of subscribers and revenues in our core Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. These are the most important areas of execution for future financial strength, and I am pleased to report we continue to yield solid results in each area.
First, our focus on the growth of subscribers and revenues in each -- our core Sprint platform business has resulted in an increase in the total customers on the Sprint platform of nearly 900,000 in the quarter and 14% year-over-year growth in wireless service revenues. 
Second, our 59% recapture rate of postpaid Nextel customers to the Sprint platform in the third quarter continues to exceed our expectations. 
And finally, we continue to achieve adjusted OIBDA results above expectations because of our focus on disciplined growth and profitability.
Moving to Slide 19. Our Sprint platform postpaid business continues to show strong growth in both subscribers and revenues. Sprint platform postpaid net adds grew by 55% year-over-year as a result of our strong recapture rate of Nextel subscribers. While Sprint platform postpaid gross adds were down year-over-year in an environment of lower industry decisions, they were up nearly 6% sequentially. This is despite our ongoing focus on Nextel recapture rate rather than external, more costly acquisition. As we entered the third quarter, we realized that industry decisions would be delayed in advance of the iPhone launch at the end of the quarter, so we chose to conserve our marketing dollars and continue to focus on recapture. With our current powerful device lineup, including our upcoming launch of the iPad in November, you'll see us seasonally increase some of our external marketing efforts in the fourth quarter.
It is the focus on the Nextel platform that allowed us to recapture nearly 60% of postpaid Nextel customers to our ongoing Sprint platform business in both of the last 2 quarters. This success gives us the confidence to raise our expected recapture rate for Q4 to over 45%. However, as we have previously stated, we fully expect the recapture rate to decline in 2013.
As we have discussed with you in the past few quarters, the majority of the recaptures we've achieved have come from consumer and small business accounts, which are less complex. We continue to work with our larger business accounts, and as Steve said, conversations are progressing well. At the end of the third quarter, approximately 1.8 million of the 2.3 million remaining postpaid customers on the Nextel platform were business accounts. While our work with our business customers is going well, we continue to expect that the recapture rate will be choppy as our customers make decisions and we approach the complete shutdown of the Nextel network.
One of the most important things we can do to create long-term margin improvement is to clear customers off the Nextel platform. We're also starting to see expense benefits of the thinning project in our results. Power-related expenses for the Nextel network declined by over $40 million sequentially, largely due to reduced rent, which benefits OIBDA only, and utility expenses, which benefit both OIBDA and cash. These benefits will increase once we are able to shut down the remainder of the network mid-next year, so we are very focused on achieving that goal.
We also achieved our best-ever third quarter Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.88%, which shows steady progress on this key metric despite some impacts we have seen related to our network, which should be expected with any major network build. While we do expect some hiccups with churn along the way as we work to execute rapidly on the Network Vision project, churn will be an ongoing focus for our business and we expect to see churn benefits from enhanced network quality when the build is complete.
As I indicated on last quarter's call, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.21 was down slightly on a sequential basis, but remained historic highs and grew 5% year-over-year due to the continued penetration of our premium data add-on charge. 81% of Sprint platform postpaid handset sales in the third quarter were smartphones, and approximately 73% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset base now have smartphones. As I discussed with you last quarter, the success of our Nextel recapture efforts manifests itself in some ARPU dilution on the Sprint platform through the assimilation of lower ARPU subscribers into a higher ARPU base. While our high rate of recapture causes some dilution to the Sprint platform ARPU in the near term, as I said, many of these customers are increasing their ARPU as they purchase smartphones so that recaptured customers are actually accretive to the total postpaid ARPU, which, at $61.18, was the highest postpaid ARPU we have had in over 6 years. We expect that ARPU on the Sprint platform will resume sequential growth in Q4 as we believe some of the smartphone purchasing decisions in Q3 were pushed to Q4 due to the late launch of the iPhone in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 20. Our Sprint platform prepaid business also continues to grow. We added 459,000 customers in the quarter and posted our best ever third quarter Sprint platform prepaid churn, up 2.93%, as we saw year-over-year improvements across all of our prepaid brands. These strong results supported the growth of Sprint platform prepaid revenue, which grew 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. 
Regulatory changes continue to affect the Lifeline industry, which have impacted our Assurance net adds year-over-year as they are implemented. We also expect a onetime impact to our Assurance subscribers next year as we implement a recertification process of our Assurance base as of June 1, 2012. Customers who do not recertify by the end of this year are expected to churn off in the second quarter of 2013 in accordance with our normal prepaid churn rules. This process is expected to have a significant impact on customer accounts throughout the Lifeline industry. We continue to believe our Assurance brand is best in class.
Our wholesale and affiliate business continues to post solid results. We have now had positive net adds for 11 consecutive quarters and nearly doubled revenues from the year ago period. However, wholesale and affiliate net adds declined substantially from last quarter due to our prepaid resellers eliminating inactive accounts in the base, largely associated with Lifeline regulatory changes. We plan to continue working with our wholesale partners to eliminate inactive prepaid accounts in the fourth quarter. 
Let's move onto our wireless operating expenses on Slide 21. Total wireless cost of service in the third quarter was $2.3 billion or nearly 31% of service revenues, which is a 3 percentage point gross margin improvement year-over-year even with incremental Network Vision dilution. We continue to see benefits in service and repair expenses, which are down year-over-year due to lower transaction volumes and higher refurbished replacement rates, mostly attributable to our industry-leading retail buyback program. As I mentioned earlier, we are also starting to see lower rent and utilities expenses on the Nextel network from the accelerated thinning project this year.
Our 3G roaming expenses in the third quarter also declined by 4% year-over-year. While it is still early in the build and we still have a lot of work to do, this is the first year-over-year decline we have seen in 3G roaming costs since the fourth quarter of 2009. Total wireless cost of service was slightly down sequentially as lower Nextel network expenses more than offset a seasonally high service and repair and 3G roaming costs.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the third quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of $171 million sequentially and $481 million year-over-year. Higher subsidy rates on smartphones such as the iPhone, which was not in our device lineup in the year ago period, continue to be a challenge for the industry and ourselves. However, we continue to see the benefits from our decision to carry the iPhone show up in other areas of the business such as lower returns and exchanges, lower calls to care and lower early life churn. The sequential increase to net subsidy expense was primarily related to over 375,000 additional Sprint platform upgrades as we introduced 2 iconic Android devices at the end of the second quarter, as well as launching the iPhone 5 at the end of the third quarter.
Total wireless selling, general and administrative costs of $2.3 billion were flat sequentially and up slightly year-over-year. However, this increase was almost entirely related to an incremental $72 million of selling expense associated with direct-sourced iPhones that was not included in the prior year period. Prior to carrying the iPhone, Sprint sourced all phones to our channels and this expense was recognized as a subsidy. Excluding this expense, selling expenses had declined by 5% year-over-year, largely related to our continued efforts to increase volumes in our most cost-effective channels, which resulted in a 15% year-over-year increase in postpaid company-owned store gross adds and a 54% year-over-year increase in gross adds on our website. 
Our disciplined growth strategy is also benefiting us with reducing bad debt expense as we maintain tight credit standards and are smart about our channel mix. 
Bad debt expense as a percentage of total wireless service revenue were down from 2.4% to 1.8%, a 55 basis point reduction from the year ago period.
Please turn to slide 22. As I stated earlier, I am particularly pleased that our disciplined approach to growth is leading to strong adjusted OIBDA results. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA of approximately $1.28 billion was almost $200 million above consensus estimates. Wireless adjusted OIBDA of $1.1 billion was down approximately $100 million from the year ago period. However, the total estimated Network Vision impact to adjusted OIBDA was approximately $185 million during the quarter compared to approximately $30 million in the third quarter of 2011. This means that excluding the increased dilution from Network Vision, we have kept wireless adjusted OIBDA margins essentially flat despite the dilution of the iPhone. This result shows our continued focus on cost discipline. As Dan mentioned, the strength of our adjusted OIBDA results means that we now expect to slightly exceed the top end of our previously raised guidance of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion for the year.
Now switching to wireline. Adjusted OIBDA for the third quarter was $158 million, a sequential increase of 6% and a year-over-year decline of 14%. The sequential growth was mostly related to smaller penalties in the third quarter for lower company-wide T1 volumes largely related to Network Vision. We remain confident in our wireline adjusted OIBDA guidance of approximately $600 million for the year.
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 23. We continue to make improvements to our liquidity and capital structure this quarter. We raised $1.5 billion in the debt markets and used the proceeds to retire $473 million of 2013 debt maturities and $1 billion of 2015 maturities. This leaves us with only $317 million of debt maturities due in 2013, less than $1.4 billion due in 2014 and approximately $1.6 billion due in 2015. 
We ended the third quarter with a total liquidity position of $7.5 billion, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.3 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility, which expires in October of 2013. We also have approximately $923 million of expected future liquidity from the secured equipment credit facility that we signed last quarter as we borrowed $77 million during the third quarter. We continue to expect to fully utilize the secured equipment credit facility as we progress through the Network Vision project. 
In addition, this week, we received $3.1 billion from SOFTBANK related to issuance of a 7-year 1% convertible bond announced on October 15. We have substantially improved our capital position, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to execute on Network Vision and operational plans. 
Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion excluding $52 million of capitalized interest and including approximately $1.1 billion of Network Vision capital. Network Vision capital was up 54% sequentially as the build continues to gain momentum. With the shift in timing of some of the towers on air into early 2013, we expect that we will also see a shift of some capital expenses and Network Vision adjusted OIBDA dilution from 2012 to 2013. We now expect capital expenditures for 2012 to be less than $6 billion excluding capitalized interest and rebanding. Rebanding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was approximately $43 million for the third quarter and we now expect approximately $200 million for the full year. 
Free cash flow for the third quarter was negative $487 million, compared to $209 million in the second quarter and negative $273 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the third quarter was partially impacted by the increase in capital expenditures associated with Network Vision. We have now entered the cash burn period of our investment phase that we have anticipated for some time, and we expect to be free cash flow-negative for the next several quarters. 
In closing, I am very pleased with the strong steady results that we continue to produce as we execute on Network Vision and we move through our investment phase. With many exciting developments for Sprint in the coming months, I want to emphasize that our discipline and focus on profitability will not change. Throughout the year, as we have embarked on the investment phase of our turnaround, we have kept a razor-sharp focus on disciplined, profitable growth and that focus continues to show results. These benefits are allowing us to, once again, raise our adjusted OIBDA guidance to slightly exceed our previously raised guidance. I am proud of the team, and we will continue our focus and discipline as we move forward and execute on our plan. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brad for Q&A."

How much of that, from an infrastructure perspective, is being front-end loaded in the build? Perhaps that'd be a question for Steve. And then just lastly, on roaming expense trends, encouraged to see the trends turning down. We see more of a kind of a 4G versus 3G focus in the latest build-out plans.

But again, we're not talking specifically about the SOFTBANK investment in Sprint today. But clearly, we will have a much more flexibility to make sure that our spectrum assets are what we need them to be. So we will look at what spectrum is available, either sold on the market or it's obviously it's also a part of whenever you do think of a combinations or mergers going down in the future, you look at what it does for the total spectrum position of the company. But you also pointed out that Sprint is in a pretty good position today with respect to spectrum in that as we aggressively and on purpose move Nextel customers off the Nextel platform, that very high-value 800 megahertz spectrum is available for reuse for 3G and for 4G LTE-TD. For the Sprint platform customers, that's important. We, of course, have the 1.9 PCS. And through our partnership with Clearwire, that high-capacity, high-frequency 2.5 gigahertz spectrum. But it's always good if you want to be the highest-quality network provider out there to have a good position in low, medium and high frequency and we'll continue to be opportunistic when opportunities arise for access to additional spectrum, including opportunities like spectrum hosting on our Network Vision platform.

So all of our devices, once we've got Band 41 in the chip, we'll be launching. So that's question number one. Question two was in terms of roaming benefits with 3G as well as our 4G launches. We're seeing really good benefit in our roaming, as I think Joe pointed out in the results, even in this quarter. And for us, we're not just ramping the 4G, but also the 3G. They're generally making one visit to the site, in some cases, with 3G with one of our vendors. We have to make a second visit, but also with also one of our vendors because we're replacing a current incumbent in some markets, we can more easily turn 4G on and not affect our customers the way when we have a partial build in a city. We choose not to put the 3G -- turn the 3G on, if you will, until we have enough sites and clusters up to minimize that effect of what's called sort of border crossings in those cities. So you'll see the benefits from roaming. They're there now and you'll see more and more as we put up 3G. This is getting the critical mass of sites in a city to get that."

Verizon did have a good quarter, but we do a lot of research with all of our channels, with care and what have you, and it is not due to their share data plans. We are seeing absolutely no evidence of it. They do have a substantial, but we say -- we think temporary advantage in terms of LTE footprint. And also, as Steve kind of alluded to on the answer to his past call, we do have some, what we call, pardon-our-dust issues as we implement Network Vision market-by-market. So that -- so there are some temporary advantages that Verizon has due to its network, but we do not see making any changes to our rate plans in spite of low advertising spend and really a focus on iDEN recapture. We're pretty pleased with what -- the effectiveness of our marketing plans. I think when you look at subscribers overall, I think you alluded to this as well in your question, it is just much more economically beneficial for us to focus our resources on recapturing the iDEN customers at substantially lower cost per gross add. Also to reduce cost, we have been shifting much more of the acquisition to our own channels. So we're seeing, if you will, a double-digit increase percentage in our retail stores year-over-year. We're seeing web growth, dramatic increase in our lowest-cost acquisition channel, which is the web. So we're really focusing on profitability. And also, if you take a look at it overall, Jonathan, we added 900,000 customers to the Sprint platform. And as we're implementing Network Vision, the question is how many customers do you want to add to the Sprint platform in a particular quarter to minimize the investment in just pure capacity, what we might call legacy, but at least capital that would have shorter life than, let's say, Network Vision, so -- Network Vision capital would have. So all of these are -- we look at together, which is we, on the one hand, we are accelerating the decline on purpose. I mentioned a 30% decline in the side of the iDEN base this quarter. We're focusing our guns knowing so many of those customers are going to be coming out. We're recapturing as many of them as possible. That's our focus. That's the most profitable way of using our dollars, knowing we're adding a lot of customers because of that to the Sprint platform and looking at our capacity and our other resources that way. But back to your question about Verizon, we're seeing absolutely nothing in any of our channels that indicates that the new rate plans that Verizon has is either helping or hurting -- to their credit, I don't think it's hurting them. Because of their LTE footprint advantage right now, they're being able -- they're, if you will, blasting right through, what we believe, are complex rate plans.

Good morning, and welcome to Sprint's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. On today's call, Dan Hesse will discuss operational performance in the quarter; Steve Elfman will provide an update on Network Vision; and Joe Euteneuer will cover financial results. After that, we will open up the call to your questions. 
However, due to securities law issues relating to the pending transaction, we will only address questions related to the ongoing business and not with respect to the pending SOFTBANK transaction or M&A-related questions. Under the merger agreement, a preliminary proxy statement with respect to the transaction is expected to be filed by the end of November and it will contain a complete description of the merger and related matters. We appreciate your understanding of and cooperation regarding this issue.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide 2 is our cautionary statement. I do want to point out that in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review, including our annual report on Form 10-K, and when filed, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2012.
Turning to Slide 3. Throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the third quarter can be found in the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at sprint.com/investors.
Let's move on to earnings per share on Slide 4. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the third quarter were $0.26 compared to $0.46 in the second quarter and $0.10 in the year ago period. There were a couple of noteworthy items impacting EPS this quarter that I'd like to cover. First, the loss per share in the current period included incremental depreciation expense of $397 million or negative $0.13 per share, primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense related to the expected shutdown of the Nextel platform. Our expectation for accelerated depreciation in Q4 is similar to that of this quarter, and we expect total depreciation for the fourth quarter of approximately $1.5 billion. Accelerated depreciation for 2013 is expected to be disproportionately weighted toward the first half of 2013 due to Nextel assets being fully depreciated by the middle of 2013.
The current period also includes $22 million or approximately negative $0.01 per share for lease exit costs, which are the net present value of remaining lease obligations associated with certain Nextel platform cell sites, which were taken off air during the quarter. 
In the third quarter, we shut down approximately 1,300 Nextel platform sites, bringing the total number of sites shut down to approximately 9,600 in 2012. However, locations from which we may continue to gain future economic benefit, including co-located sites, were not included in this charge and represented approximately 39% of total Nextel sites shut down during 2012. We estimate that absent the actions taken to terminate leases in the second and third quarters of 2012, rent expense would have been higher by approximately $38 million for the third quarter and approximately $85 million for the full year 2012.
Net tax expense was $47 million in the third quarter, primarily related to state taxes. For the full year 2012, we continue to expect our net tax expense to be approximately $150 million to $200 million. 
I will now turn the call over to Sprint's CEO, Dan Hesse."

As Brad mentioned, today's call is about our performance in the third quarter. Our 3 priorities continue to be the customer experience, our brand and cash. But as I have mentioned in previous quarters this year, because of our heavy investments in our investment phase, our #1 priority in 2012 is cash. 
Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted OIBDA of approximately $1.28 billion exceeded both our internal projections and Street consensus for the fifth consecutive quarter. Although our adjusted OIBDA margin at 16% is not yet where we want it to be over time, we are pleased with this quarter's results given the dilutive impacts of our 2 major investment areas, Network Vision and the iPhone, including the launch of the iPhone 5. 
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Sprint platform business. Postpaid ARPU for the Sprint platform is up 5% year-over-year, and we achieved our best ever third quarter results for Sprint platform postpaid churn at 1.88%. Total prepaid churn of 3.37% is our best performance for any quarter ever and represents our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. 
In the first half of 2012, we recaptured 55% of the postpaid customers leaving the Nextel platform, double our historic performance level and a level we did not believe we could sustain in the second half. I'm pleased to report we recaptured 59% of departing Nextel postpaid customers in the third quarter.
We had a successful launch of the iPhone 5 and again achieved an industry-leading 40% gross add mix across all of our iPhone activations in the quarter. 
We also made solid progress on Network Vision deployment. We now have over 20,000 cell sites with zoning and leasing complete and over 13,500 now under construction or ready for construction. 
Finally, based on the performance of our business, we are again increasing our adjusted OIBDA forecast for the year, and we now expect to slightly exceed the top end of the range of our 2012 adjusted OIBDA forecast, which we raised significantly a quarter ago.
If you'd please turn to Slide 7, I'll organize the balance of my comments around our 3 overarching priorities. Let me begin with cash. As you recall, we are in the second phase of our turnaround where we are investing in Network Vision and the iPhone, investments we expect will provide us with margin growth in Phase 3. We have now entered the cash burn quarters of the investment phase with CapEx ramping up to $1.49 billion this quarter. We ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.3 billion. As you have read, earlier this week, Sprint received $3.1 billion of additional cash as a result of a convertible bond offering to SOFTBANK.
Please turn to Slide 8. Delivering solid operational profitability, as measured by adjusted OIBDA, is our #1 priority as we work through these heavy investment quarters. We delivered better-than-expected adjusted OIBDA as we benefited from continued year-over-year ARPU strength in both our postpaid and prepaid Sprint platform wireless businesses. Sprint platform postpaid ARPU is up $3 or 5%, and prepaid ARPU is up $0.84 or over 3% year-over-year. Total postpaid ARPU is at its highest level in over 6 years. On a consolidated basis, total net operating revenue is up over 5% compared to the year ago period. This quarter represents our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in net operating revenues.
Please turn to Slide 9. We continued our disciplined approach to subscriber acquisition in the quarter. As I described last quarter, we are continuing to prioritize the recapture of our Nextel subscribers over traditional customer acquisition spend because of the efficiency of a lower cost for recapture of over $200 per customer versus the cost for acquiring a new customer in the marketplace. As I mentioned, our 59% recapture rate topped expectations in our strong performance for the first half of the year. As we work toward a complete shutdown of the Nextel platform anticipated for the middle of next year, we are making good progress in moving customers off the platform. As of the end of the third quarter, we are down to 3.1 million subscribers on the platform, down from 7 million a year ago. Even though we added nearly 900,000 customers to the Sprint platform this quarter, we reduced the iDEN base by over 1.3 million customers this quarter, so total company subscribers declined by 423,000 in the quarter. This 30% stimulated decline in the size of the Nextel subscriber base in 1 quarter is, by far, the largest ever. The previous 2 quarters' declines were 18% and 13%, respectively, and before that, the decline had rarely been above 10%. In absolute terms, the loss is the largest since the first quarter of 2008.
Loss of iDEN platform customers pressures our top line results. But clearing the Nextel platform so we can shut down the network and harvest the spectrum are key elements of our plan to reduce expenses and grow margin in future periods. 
The iPhone benefits both the customer experience and the brand. In spite of a slowdown in iPhone sales early in the quarter as customers anticipated the launch of the iPhone 5, as you can see on Slide 10, we activated approximately 1.5 million iPhones in the third quarter. As I've said, the most important near-term financial indicator of success with the iPhone is the percentage of activations that are new customers to Sprint because they represent a new source of revenue. In the third quarter, 40% of our iPhone activations were new customers, in excess of our competitor's historical results, and our fourth consecutive quarter at or above 40%.
Early-life iPhone customer experience metrics are encouraging. To date, we are continuing to observe materially lower early-life voluntary churn rates for iPhone customers compared to other smartphone customers and lower support costs as measured by calls to care and device service and repair costs. The operational performance, so far, continues to validate our decision to invest in the iPhone. And we are also ahead of the pace required to meet our contractual commitments to Apple.
Turning to Slide 11 and the customer experience. I am pleased to report that Sprint customers continue to enjoy an industry-leading experience as reflected by our #1 ranking in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. This quarter, we received 2 J.D. Power awards that attest to the improvements we've made in the customer experience over the last 4 years. The Sprint brand is now ranked highest in satisfaction with the purchase experience among full-service wireless providers for the third consecutive time and the Virgin brand is ranked highest in satisfaction for customer care with noncontract wireless service for the second consecutive time.
The improved customer experience at Sprint continues to manifest itself in our churn performance. Sprint platform postpaid churn was our best ever for a third quarter, and Sprint platform prepaid has delivered year-over-year improvement in churn for each of the last 12 quarters. While the Assurance brand churn benefited from some regulatory changes to the subscriber base eligibility validation process in the third quarter, both the Virgin and Boost, Sprint platform churn rates are down materially year-over-year. Our total prepaid churn set an all-time best record this quarter.
Turning to Slide 12. One aspect of our brand I am particularly proud of is the progress we're making in sustainability. Corporate social responsibility is a hallmark of the Sprint brand. Newsweek's ranking of the greenest companies in America was released this week, and again, Sprint was named the third greenest company in the United States. Again, we're the only telecom carrier to make the top 25. This quarter, we were also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America as the Mobile Telecommunications Sector Leader for the second year in a row.
Please turn to Slide 13. Driven by the improvements in the customer experience and the brand, the Sprint platform continues to grow. In the quarter, we reached 52.9 million customers served on the Sprint platform, our all-time highest level. This is our 11th consecutive quarter of posting net subscriber additions on the Sprint platform. When measured by net adds over an 8-quarter period as a percentage of the customer base, the Sprint platform is the fastest-growing postpaid brand among the national carriers in spite of not having the iPad, a major contributor to the net add performance of our competitors. On Tuesday, we announced that Sprint will carry the iPad Mini and the fourth generation iPad, which, we believe, will aid our subscriber performance going forward. 
Finally, on Slide 14. In addition to the highly successful iPhone 5, we continue to grow our portfolio of LTE devices, including 3 additional new LTE smartphones in the quarter. Additionally, we are continuing to innovate in service offerings, including the Uconnect vehicle connection offering with Chrysler, our new bring-your-own-device offering for business and the cloud-enabled Microsoft 365 offering for small and midsized businesses. 
So in conclusion, the third quarter represented a quarter of solid execution with particular focus on 3 areas: number one, cash as we increased our adjusted OIBDA forecast yet again; number two, recapturing as many Nextel customers as possible with a recapture rate that exceeded the year's first half; and number three, implementing Network Vision, which Steve Elfman will now give you an update on."

I'm pleased to discuss our continued progress on Network Vision during the quarter. Please turn to Slide 16. In the third quarter, we continued to make strong progress with the Network Vision pipeline. The pace of Network Vision has accelerated and we continue to be confident in the technology and the benefits. We now have zoning complete on over 21,500 sites and leasing complete on over 20,000 sites, more than 55% increase over Q2 for each. Over 13,500 sites are ready or have already begun construction, an increase of more than 115% over the second quarter. Our weekly construction starts are now up more than 250% from Q2, and sites completed per week is now up over 200% from last quarter. We've expanded the number of cities under construction to over 200, and we have now launched LTE in 32 cities with more than 115 expected to launch in the months to come. We now have nearly 4,300 sites on air, more than double where we were 3 months ago.
Throughout this process, we've talked to you about the fact that we've been working with our vendors and pushing them very hard to achieve the goal they committed to at the beginning of the year. While we're encouraged by the momentum of the project, we have been seeing some delays from our vendors, largely related to logistics execution and material shortages as well as some delays related to the hurricanes in the third quarter. And now, we believe, we're approximately 1 quarter behind in hitting the 12,000 target.
The delay during the front end of the project has not meaningfully changed our expectations of timing or cost of the project. We have all hands on deck and are laser-focused on deploying as quickly as possible in order to bring the benefits of LTE and enhanced 3G to our customers. 
As we discussed with you in the past quarters, we are strategically launching LTE markets early, so we can let consumers know that Sprint's LTE is available in their neighborhood or coming soon as they make decisions and can provide them an enhanced and continually improving performance as we build new sites.
Turning to Slide 17. During the quarter, I was very pleased with our strong execution and progress on the elimination of the Nextel platform. We are well on pace to have the platform shut down in mid-2013 and expect margin benefits in the second half of the year. Following our completion of the thinning of 9,600 sites in July, we have completed access disconnects and powering down of all equipment for virtually all of those sites during the third quarter. We are already starting to see the financial benefits from these actions, which Joe will review in a few minutes.
As Dan said, we recaptured 59% of the Nextel platform postpaid customers during the quarter, which continues to beat our expectations. At the end of Q3, we had nearly 1.2 million Sprint Direct Connect customers, and we are pleased with the performance of the product. We are encouraged with the progress we are seeing in our negotiations with our large business customers and I'm pleased to say that we have already confirmed migration agreements with several large accounts. Our continued success in the Nextel platform conversion reinforces our expectations of margin benefits in the latter part of next year. 
The third quarter has been a quarter of steady execution of Network Vision. We continue to exceed expectations on the Nextel platform and the progress we are making there is yielding benefits. Our pacing on Network Vision build continues to gain momentum, and we are bringing LTE to new customers daily. I will continue to push our vendors and my team everyday to improve execution and accelerate our pace.
I look forward to updating you next quarter. I'll turn over to Joe to update you on the financial results."

As I laid out for you at the beginning of the year, my ongoing priorities for the business are in 3 areas: the growth of subscribers and revenues in our core Sprint platform business, strong re",2360,"Thank you, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for being here today. As I laid out for you at the beginning of the year, my ongoing priorities for the business are in 3 areas: the growth of subscribers and revenues in our core Sprint platform business, strong recapture of Nextel customers to the Sprint platform and overall profitability in our execution. These are the most important areas of execution for future financial strength, and I am pleased to report we continue to yield solid results in each area.
First, our focus on the growth of subscribers and revenues in each -- our core Sprint platform business has resulted in an increase in the total customers on the Sprint platform of nearly 900,000 in the quarter and 14% year-over-year growth in wireless service revenues. 
Second, our 59% recapture rate of postpaid Nextel customers to the Sprint platform in the third quarter continues to exceed our expectations. 
And finally, we continue to achieve adjusted OIBDA results above expectations because of our focus on disciplined growth and profitability.
Moving to Slide 19. Our Sprint platform postpaid business continues to show strong growth in both subscribers and revenues. Sprint platform postpaid net adds grew by 55% year-over-year as a result of our strong recapture rate of Nextel subscribers. While Sprint platform postpaid gross adds were down year-over-year in an environment of lower industry decisions, they were up nearly 6% sequentially. This is despite our ongoing focus on Nextel recapture rate rather than external, more costly acquisition. As we entered the third quarter, we realized that industry decisions would be delayed in advance of the iPhone launch at the end of the quarter, so we chose to conserve our marketing dollars and continue to focus on recapture. With our current powerful device lineup, including our upcoming launch of the iPad in November, you'll see us seasonally increase some of our external marketing efforts in the fourth quarter.
It is the focus on the Nextel platform that allowed us to recapture nearly 60% of postpaid Nextel customers to our ongoing Sprint platform business in both of the last 2 quarters. This success gives us the confidence to raise our expected recapture rate for Q4 to over 45%. However, as we have previously stated, we fully expect the recapture rate to decline in 2013.
As we have discussed with you in the past few quarters, the majority of the recaptures we've achieved have come from consumer and small business accounts, which are less complex. We continue to work with our larger business accounts, and as Steve said, conversations are progressing well. At the end of the third quarter, approximately 1.8 million of the 2.3 million remaining postpaid customers on the Nextel platform were business accounts. While our work with our business customers is going well, we continue to expect that the recapture rate will be choppy as our customers make decisions and we approach the complete shutdown of the Nextel network.
One of the most important things we can do to create long-term margin improvement is to clear customers off the Nextel platform. We're also starting to see expense benefits of the thinning project in our results. Power-related expenses for the Nextel network declined by over $40 million sequentially, largely due to reduced rent, which benefits OIBDA only, and utility expenses, which benefit both OIBDA and cash. These benefits will increase once we are able to shut down the remainder of the network mid-next year, so we are very focused on achieving that goal.
We also achieved our best-ever third quarter Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.88%, which shows steady progress on this key metric despite some impacts we have seen related to our network, which should be expected with any major network build. While we do expect some hiccups with churn along the way as we work to execute rapidly on the Network Vision project, churn will be an ongoing focus for our business and we expect to see churn benefits from enhanced network quality when the build is complete.
As I indicated on last quarter's call, Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.21 was down slightly on a sequential basis, but remained historic highs and grew 5% year-over-year due to the continued penetration of our premium data add-on charge. 81% of Sprint platform postpaid handset sales in the third quarter were smartphones, and approximately 73% of the Sprint platform postpaid handset base now have smartphones. As I discussed with you last quarter, the success of our Nextel recapture efforts manifests itself in some ARPU dilution on the Sprint platform through the assimilation of lower ARPU subscribers into a higher ARPU base. While our high rate of recapture causes some dilution to the Sprint platform ARPU in the near term, as I said, many of these customers are increasing their ARPU as they purchase smartphones so the recaptured customers are actually accretive to the total postpaid ARPU, which, at $61.18, was the highest postpaid ARPU we have had in over 6 years. We expect that ARPU on the Sprint platform will resume sequential growth in Q4 as we believe some of the smartphone purchasing decisions in Q3 were pushed to Q4 due to the late launch of the iPhone in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 20. Our Sprint platform prepaid business also continues to grow. We added 459,000 customers in the quarter and posted our best ever third quarter Sprint platform prepaid churn, up 2.93%, as we saw year-over-year improvements across all of our prepaid brands. These strong results supported the growth of Sprint platform prepaid revenue, which grew 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. 
Regulatory changes continue to affect the Lifeline industry, which have impacted our Assurance net adds year-over-year as they are implemented. We also expect a onetime impact to our Assurance subscribers next year as we implement a recertification process of our Assurance base as of June 1, 2012. Customers who do not recertify by the end of this year are expected to churn off in the second quarter of 2013 in accordance with our normal prepaid churn rules. This process is expected to have a significant impact on customer accounts throughout the Lifeline industry. We continue to believe our Assurance brand is best in class.
Our wholesale and affiliate business continues to post solid results. We have now had positive net adds for 11 consecutive quarters and nearly doubled revenues from the year ago period. However, wholesale and affiliate net adds declined substantially from last quarter due to our prepaid resellers eliminating inactive accounts in the base, largely associated with Lifeline regulatory changes. We plan to continue working with our wholesale partners to eliminate inactive prepaid accounts in the fourth quarter. 
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on Slide 21. Total wireless cost of service in the third quarter was $2.3 billion or nearly 31% of service revenues, which is a 3 percentage point gross margin improvement year-over-year even with incremental Network Vision dilution. We continue to see benefits in service and repair expenses, which are down year-over-year due to lower transaction volumes and higher refurbished replacement rates, mostly attributable to our industry-leading retail buyback program. As I mentioned earlier, we are also starting to see lower rent and utilities expenses on the Nextel network from the accelerated thinning project this year.
Our 3G roaming expenses in the third quarter also declined by 4% year-over-year. While it is still early in the build and we still have a lot of work to do, this is the first year-over-year decline we have seen in 3G roaming costs since the fourth quarter of 2009. Total wireless cost of service was slightly down sequentially as lower Nextel network expenses more than offset a seasonally high service and repair and 3G roaming costs.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the third quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of $171 million sequentially and $481 million year-over-year. Higher subsidy rates on smartphones such as the iPhone, which was not in our device lineup in the year ago period, continue to be a challenge for the industry and ourselves. However, we continue to see the benefits from our decision to carry the iPhone show up in other areas of the business such as lower returns and exchanges, lower calls to care and lower early life churn. The sequential increase to net subsidy expense was primarily related to over 375,000 additional Sprint platform upgrades as we introduced 2 iconic Android devices at the end of the second quarter, as well as launching the iPhone 5 at the end of the third quarter.
Total wireless selling, general and administrative costs of $2.3 billion were flat sequentially and up slightly year-over-year. However, this increase was almost entirely related to an incremental $72 million of selling expense associated with direct-sourced iPhones that was not included in the prior year period. Prior to carrying the iPhone, Sprint sourced all phones to our channels and this expense was recognized as a subsidy. Excluding this expense, selling expenses had declined by 5% year-over-year, largely related to our continued efforts to increase volumes in our most cost-effective channels, which resulted in a 15% year-over-year increase in postpaid company-owned store gross adds and a 54% year-over-year increase in gross adds on our website. 
Our disciplined growth strategy is also benefiting us with reducing bad debt expense as we maintain tight credit standards and are smart about our channel mix. 
Bad debt expense as a percentage of total wireless service revenue were down from 2.4% to 1.8%, a 55-basis point reduction from the year ago period.
Please turn to slide 22. As I stated earlier, I am particularly pleased that our disciplined approach to growth is leading to strong adjusted OIBDA results. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA of approximately $1.28 billion was almost $200 million above consensus estimates. Wireless adjusted OIBDA of $1.1 billion was down approximately $100 million from the year ago period. However, the total estimated Network Vision impact to adjusted OIBDA was approximately $185 million during the quarter compared to approximately $30 million in the third quarter of 2011. This means that excluding the increased dilution from Network Vision, we have kept wireless adjusted OIBDA margins essentially flat despite the dilution of the iPhone. This result shows our continued focus on cost discipline. As Dan mentioned, the strength of our adjusted OIBDA results means that we now expect to slightly exceed the top end of our previously raised guidance of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion for the year.
Now switching to wireline. Adjusted OIBDA for the third quarter was $158 million, a sequential increase of 6% and a year-over-year decline of 14%. The sequential growth was mostly related to smaller penalties in the third quarter for lower company-wide T1 volumes largely related to Network Vision. We remain confident in our wireline adjusted OIBDA guidance of approximately $600 million for the year.
Moving to cash and liquidity on Slide 23. We continue to make improvements to our liquidity and capital structure this quarter. We raised $1.5 billion in the debt markets and used the proceeds to retire $473 million of 2013 debt maturities and $1 billion of 2015 maturities. This leaves us with only $317 million of debt maturities due in 2013, less than $1.4 billion due in 2014 and approximately $1.6 billion due in 2015. 
We ended the third quarter with a total liquidity position of $7.5 billion, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.3 billion and $1.2 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility, which expires in October of 2013. We also have approximately $923 million of expected future liquidity from the secured equipment credit facility that we signed last quarter as we borrowed $77 million during the third quarter. We continue to expect to fully utilize the secured equipment credit facility as we progress through the Network Vision project. 
In addition, this week, we received $3.1 billion from SOFTBANK related to issuance of a 7-year 1% convertible bond announced on October 15. We have substantially improved our capital position, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on Network Vision and operational plans. 
Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion excluding $52 million of capitalized interest and including approximately $1.1 billion of Network Vision capital. Network Vision capital was up 54% sequentially as the build continues to gain momentum. With the shift in timing of some of the towers on air into early 2013, we expect that we will also see a shift of some capital expenses and Network Vision adjusted OIBDA dilution from 2012 to 2013. We now expect capital expenditures for 2012 to be less than $6 billion excluding capitalized interest and rebanding. Rebanding expense, which is not included in capital expenditures, was approximately $43 million for the third quarter and we now expect approximately $200 million for the full year. 
Free cash flow for the third quarter was negative $487 million, compared to $209 million in the second quarter and negative $273 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the third quarter was partially impacted by the increase in capital expenditures associated with Network Vision. We have now entered the cash burn period of our investment phase that we have anticipated for some time, and we expect to be free cash flow-negative for the next several quarters. 
In closing, I am very pleased with the strong steady results that we continue to produce as we execute on Network Vision and we move through our investment phase. With many exciting developments for Sprint in the coming months, I want to emphasize that our discipline and focus on profitability will not change. Throughout the year, as we have embarked on the investment phase of our turnaround, we have kept a razor-sharp focus on disciplined, profitable growth and that focus continues to show results. These benefits are allowing us to, once again, raise our adjusted OIBDA guidance to slightly exceed our previously raised guidance.

So we will look at what spectrum is available, either sold on the market or it's obviously it's also a part of whenever you do think of a combinations or mergers going down in the future, you look at what it does for the total spectrum position of the company. But you also pointed out that Sprint is in a pretty good position today with respect to spectrum in that as we aggressively and on purpose move Nextel customers off the Nextel platform, that very high-value 800 megahertz spectrum is available for reuse for 3G and for 4G LTE-TD. For the Sprint platform customers, that's important. We, of course, have the 1.9 PCS. And through our partnership with Clearwire, that high-capacity, high-frequency 2.5 gigahertz spectrum. But it's always good if you want to be the highest-quality network provider out there to have a good position in low, medium and high frequency and we'll continue to be opportunistic when opportunities arise for access to additional spectrum, including opportunities like spectrum hosting on our Network Vision platform.

We're seeing really good benefit in our roaming, as I think Joe pointed out in the results, even in this quarter. And for us, we're not just ramping the 4G, but also the 3G. They're generally making one visit to the site, in some cases, with 3G with one of our vendors. We have to make a second visit, but also with also one of our vendors because we're replacing a current incumbent in some markets, we can more easily turn 4G on and not affect our customers the way when we have a partial build in a city, we choose not to put the 3G -- turn the 3G on, if you will, until we have enough sites and clusters up to minimize the effect of what's called sort of border crossings in those cities.

Verizon did have a good quarter, but we do a lot of research with all of our channels, with care and what have you, and it is not due to their shared data plans. We are seeing absolutely no evidence of it. They do have a substantial, but we say -- we think temporary advantage in terms of LTE footprint. And also, as Steve kind of alluded to on the answer to his past call, we do have some, what we call, pardon-our-dust issues as we implement Network Vision market-by-market. So that -- so there are some temporary advantages that Verizon has due to its network, but we do not see making any changes to our rate plans in spite of low advertising spend and really a focus on iDEN recapture. We're pretty pleased with what -- the effectiveness of our marketing plans. I think when you look at subscribers overall, I think you alluded to this as well in your question, it is just much more economically beneficial for us to focus our resources on recapturing the iDEN customers at substantially lower cost per gross add. Also to reduce cost, we have been shifting much more of the acquisition to our own channels. So we're seeing, if you will, a double-digit increase percentage in our retail stores year-over-year. We're seeing Web growth, dramatic increase in our lowest-cost acquisition channel, which is the Web. So we're really focusing on profitability. And also, if you take a look at it overall, Jonathan, we added 900,000 customers to the Sprint platform. And as we're implementing Network Vision, the question is how many customers do you want to add to the Sprint platform in a particular quarter to minimize the investment in just pure capacity, what we might call legacy, but at least capital that would have shorter life than, let's say, Network Vision, so -- Network Vision capital would have. So all of these are -- we look at together, which is we, on the one hand, we are accelerating the decline on purpose. I mentioned a 30% decline in the size of the iDEN base this quarter. We're focusing our guns, knowing so many of those customers are going to be coming out, on recapturing as many of them as possible. That's our focus. That's the most profitable way of using our dollars, knowing we're adding a lot of customers because of that to the Sprint platform and looking at our capacity and our other resources that way. But back to your question about Verizon, we're seeing absolutely nothing in any of our channels that indicates that the new rate plans that Verizon has is either helping or hurting -- to their credit, I don't think it's hurting them. Because of their LTE footprint advantage right now, they're being able -- they're, if you will, blasting right through, what we believe, are complex rate plans.

Number one is what we're seeing right now is not really a change in the industry pricing phenomenon or structure in terms of up or down. It's really more we're seeing changes in structure. And I had a question earlier, shared data versus unlimited or what have you, just seeing what'll be most effective in the market. So I am not seeing any trends right now in the industry either, if you will, increase or decrease price, but really change what I call the business model with respect to pricing given the evolving device trends, not only the evolving move toward smartphones and more data use, but devices like tablets and what have you. We would -- I'm not going to -- I wouldn't say any definitive yes or no with respect to what we might do in terms of raising prices going forward. But we certainly would be in a much better position to raise prices if we felt we had a very strong competitive network and we would be hesitant to do that while we're still building out Network Vision and while our -- while we have what I've alluded to earlier on the call as a temporary disadvantage in terms of 4G coverage, which, again, we intend to close that gap, but we have a disadvantage now. So it would be risky to increase prices when you still have a 4G network disadvantage. Thanks."
