Now let's proceed. One year ago, we reported broad-based strong financial results for fiscal 2010 with sales up 14% and net earnings from continuing operation up 39%. We are now pleased to also report strong performance for fiscal 2011 with net sales up 18%, net earnings up 19% to $3.40 per diluted share and net earnings, excluding nonrecurring items, up 24% to $3.60 per diluted share. At the same time, we are disappointed that the year finished on a softer note than we initially expected with fourth quarter sales up 8%, net earnings down 2% and net earnings excluding nonrecurring items down 4% but that does not diminish our satisfaction from achieving another successful year. And it's worth noting that the $3.60 per diluted share of earnings in 2011, excluding nonrecurring items, was above the initial guidance we provided to you 1 year ago that called for $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share. Let's first review some key sales highlights by region for the fourth quarter and full year.
Sales in the Americas increased 5% in the fourth quarter, with comp store sales up 3% on top of an 8% comp increase last year. This was a slight improvement from the 4% increase in November, December holiday sales that we had previously reported. The 5% sales increase in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. In fact, while price stratification for the Americas in the fourth quarter indicated continued declines in sales and transactions below $250, it was more than offset by sales growth in most of the higher-priced categories. It was a pretty similar dichotomy for the full year with the greatest strength in sales over $20,000 and $50,000. We believe that the slower sales growth in the Americas in the fourth quarter might have been in varying degrees due to restrained spending by customers employed in the financial sector, which especially affected our sales in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions at the U.S., substantial competitive discounting and particular softness at our entry-level silver jewelry price points that might be tied to some resistance to price increases among other factors. 
Sales in the New York flagship store rose 2% in the quarter, which was a bit better than the 1% decline in the holiday period. The 2% increase was due to higher sales to foreign tourists. The overall Americas region also benefited from higher sales to foreign tourists but also saw increased sales to local customers. Comp store sales and brand stores rose 3% with growth somewhat skewed towards the western half of the region, which includes continued strong growth in Hawaii and Guam, driven by Japanese tourists. Our stores in Canada and Latin America posted solid sales growth in the quarter.
For the full year, sales in the Americas rose 15% due to an overall increase in the average price-per-unit sold. Growth in jewelry units sold at higher price points was offset by declines in the silver jewelry category. The Americas region represented 50% of worldwide sales versus 51% in 2010. Americas comps rose 13% in the full year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 20% in 2011 and remained at 8% of worldwide sales. In 2011, more than 40% of sales made in the New York flagship store were to foreign tourists versus somewhat less than 40% in 2010. Americas brand store comps rose 11% in 2011 on a constant-exchange-rate basis due to strong increases in most parts of the U.S., as well as in Canada and Latin America. 
I mentioned that higher foreign tourists spending generated a good portion of the fourth quarter sales growth in the U.S. That reason also applied to the full year. In fact, full year sales to foreign tourists represented an estimated 23% of U.S. sales in 2011 versus 17% and 15% in 2010 and 2009. European, Japanese and Chinese tourists represented roughly similar amounts of that spending in 2011. The 5 highest volume brand stores in the Americas in 2011 included 3 in the U.S. and 2 in Canada, and they are South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, San Francisco in Chicago, as well as in Vancouver and on Toronto's Bloor Street. We opened 6 new stores in the Americas in 2011, including one in Richmond, Virginia, a fourth store in Las Vegas in the Fashion Show Mall, a fourth store in the Chicago market in Northbrook, a store in Calgary, a second store in Vancouver in the Oakridge Center and a third store in Brazil in Brasilia. Their results range from quite good to very strong, and that follows excellent first-year results from the 5 Americas stores we opened in the previous year. 
We finished 2011 with 102 stores in the Americas, including 87 in the U.S., 5 in Canada, 7 in Mexico and 3 in Brazil. Rounding out the Americas are Internet and catalog sales, which declined 4% in the fourth quarter as an increased amount per order was more than offset by a decline in the number of orders shipped. Internet and catalog sales rose 6% in the full year due to increased sales per order and accounted for about 10% of sales in the Americas for the year. We continue to believe that our Internet presence serves the dual purpose of generating online sales and expanding brand awareness, which drives traffic to our stores. We are currently in the process of revamping our West side with some exciting enhancements that will debut later this year. 
Tiffany's second largest region by sales is Asia-Pacific. Sales rose 19% in the fourth quarter due to increased units sold and a smaller increase in the average price-per-unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales in the quarter rose 18% with growth in most countries and especially in Australia, Hong Kong and Macau contributed to a 13% increase in comp store sales. That was on top of a 16% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter and was basically in line with the previously reported November, December sales results. 
For the full year, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 36% due to similar increases in units and in the average price-per-unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales rose 31%, and comp store sales rose 27% on top of a 14% comp increase in 2010 with strong increases in most countries.
Asia-Pacific represented 21% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010. Sales in Greater China represented 12 points of the 21%. We have a meaningful opportunity to achieve much higher brand awareness in China, and as we proceed, we should undoubtedly see the benefits through sales growth in China, as well as in other markets serving the growing numbers of Chinese tourists. 
During the year, we opened 6 stores in Asia-Pacific, including 3 in Korea in Seoul, Daegu and Incheon, 2 in China in Guangzhou and one in Taiwan in Taichung, and the early results are good. We also did a major renovation and expansion, which doubled the size of our very successful store on Collins Street in Melbourne. We ended 2011 with 58 stores in the Asia-Pacific region. Our 2 largest stores by sales volume in the region are on Canton Road in Hong Kong and in Ngee Ann City in Singapore. 
Now let's turn to Japan. Total sales rose 12% from the fourth quarter due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. This was essentially in line with the 13% sales increase in the holiday period. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales rose 5% in the quarter, and comps rose 4% on top of a 1% increase last year due to relatively similar growth throughout Japan. One year ago this month, we were looking at a sales decline and considerable uncertainty in Japan following the tragic earthquake and tsunami. But our sales growth resumed 1 month later, demonstrating the enduring value and emotional resonance of our brands, combined with extraordinary efforts of our Tiffany colleagues in Japan. 
For the year, on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 3%, and comparable store sales rose 4%. However, due to the yen strengthening by 10% against the U.S. dollar in 2011, total sales increased 13% due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. Our flagship store in the Ginza in Tokyo generate the highest volume of our stores in Japan and accounted for 12% of our total retail sales in Japan last year. During 2011, we opened a new store in Hakata and closed 2 locations in Kokura and Wakayama and finished the year with 55 locations in Japan. For the full year, Japan represented 17% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010.
Now let's review performance in Europe. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 3% due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. This was slightly better than the previously reported holiday sales results. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales rose 3%, and comp store sales declined 2% on top of the 16% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter. The 2% comp decline reflected mixed results that range from solid growth in Continental Europe with the highest growth in Germany and Austria to a sales decline in the U.K. 
For the full year, sales in Europe increased 17% due to increases in units sold, as well as in the average price-per-unit sold and continue to represent 12% of worldwide sales.
On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total European sales rose 12%, and comp store sales rose 6% on top of an 18% comp increase in 2010. Strong sales growth across Continental Europe surpassed the more modest increase in U.K. sales in the year. We think that softness in London is probably reflected restrained spending by customers in the financial industry, similar to what we've experienced in New York along with overall challenging economic conditions. The vast majority of our European sales were generated by local customers. However, Tiffany stores in Europe also derived a growing benefit from sales from non-European tourists, which we estimate now represent about 1/4 of European sales with the highest percentage of those sales in Paris. 
In addition, Tiffany's Internet sales in Europe through websites in 9 countries are also growing very nicely and represented almost 10% of total European sales in 2011.
During the year, we opened 3 stores in Europe, including a second store in Milan in the Excelsior, which is posting excellent initial results, as well as second stores in both Frankfurt and Zürich in their airports. And I should add that we've had excellent results from the 2 stores we opened in 2010 in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona. The U.K., with 10 stores, accounted for slightly less than half of our European sales in 2011. Our 2 highest sales volume stores in Europe in 2011 were on Old Bond Street in London and in Milan. We operated 32 stores in Europe at the end of 2011. 
Putting it all together, our solid sales growth contributed to improved sales productivity in 2011 coming from comp store sales growth and the successful results from new stores. Looking at that sales productivity by region, the 247 stores we operated in 21 countries at year end generated total worldwide sales per gross square foot of $3,000 in 2011 versus $2,600 in 2010. By region, the Americas generated $2,300 in 2011 versus $2,100 in 2010. Europe generated $3,400 versus $3,000 in 2010. Japan was at $4,100 versus $3,500 in 2010, and the highest productivity continued to be in Asia-Pacific with $4,700 per gross square foot versus $4,000 in 2010. 
Let's briefly look at other sales, which declined 22% in the fourth quarter. That segment consists primarily of wholesale sales of diamonds and sales to independent third-party distributors of our products, primarily in the Middle East and Russia. And the sales decline reflected lower sales in both components as we had expected.
For the full year, other sales declined 5% as sales growth to independent distributors was more than offset by a decline in wholesale sales of diamonds. We recently announced that we have signed a memorandum of understanding with Damas Jewellers to establish a joint venture in the UAE. The JV will give us overall responsibility for 5 existing stores in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and we will soon commence new merchandising and marketing initiatives there to drive sales growth. 
Let's now review some merchandising highlights. While total sales growth decelerated to 8% in the fourth quarter after increasing 24% in the first 9 months of the year, there were some different patterns by category and price point in some regions. High-end statement jewelry sales softened after experiencing strong growth in the first 3 quarters of 2011. On the other hand,, the most resilient category was engagement jewelry with a very solid increase in the quarter, continuing its strong growth from earlier in the year. High-end fashion jewelry sales were up modestly in the quarter after strong growth in the first 3 quarters of the year. We are extremely pleased with the continued success of our extraordinary yellow diamond jewelry collection and with its long-term potential. We've also seen customers all year attracted to platinum- and diamond-focused products such as studs and pendants and to important collection such as Victoria, Metro and Celebration Rings. There's also been a growing desire for gold jewelry, and collections like Return to Tiffany, 1837 and the new Locks collection, which followed the unprecedented success of the Keys Collection. 
Conversely, silver jewelry sales have been growing more modestly. We were pleased with growth in designer jewelry sales in the quarter that continued our success from earlier in the year. Elsa Peretti's designs had a healthy sales increase, led by the always alluring Diamonds by the Yard collection. Paloma Picasso sales growth was stimulated by her stunning new Venezia Collection, and we are also continuing to be pleased with the sales growth of Tiffany's Leather Collection. 
Product development has always been an important strategy and sales driver at Tiffany's, and you can expect to see a very exciting and eclectic array of new jewelry designs over the coming year. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat McGuiness."
35576,172054043,277955,"Tiffany & Co., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, Mar 20, 2012",2012-03-20,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I will now focus my remarks on the rest of the earnings statement. Let's start with gross margin, which at 60.4% in the fourth quarter was a half-point lower than the prior year. The downward pressure in the quarter came from higher product",1714,"Thanks, Mark. I will now focus my remarks on the rest of the earnings statement. Let's start with gross margin, which at 60.4% in the fourth quarter was a half-point lower than the prior year. The downward pressure in the quarter came from higher product costs, a continued shift in sales mix towards higher-priced products that are in a lower gross margin and a lack of sales leverage on fixed costs. 
For the full year, gross margin of 59% was 1/10 of a point lower than the prior year. Higher product acquisition costs and shift in product sales mix were mostly offset by sales leverage on fixed costs. Throughout the year, we have spoken about gross margin pressure from significantly higher costs of precious metals and diamonds, which, in turn, have led to increased retail prices at Tiffany and in the overall jewelry industry. 
When product input cost stabilize, we would expect less pressure on gross margin in the latter part of 2012 and future pricing actions, if any, would be more modest. For the full year though, we expect gross margin to be lower than the prior year based on our assumptions for product costs, inventory turnover, sales volume and sales mix. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to growth in store occupancy, labor and marketing costs. In last year's fourth quarter, we recorded $6 million of nonrecurring expenses related to the relocation of our New York headquarter's staff in June 2011. Excluding that expense, SG&A is expected to increase 11% in this fourth quarter, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales would have been 36.3% versus 35.1% last year. For the full year, SG&A expenses rose 18%. This is also primarily due to higher cost per store occupancy, labor and marketing. 
SG&A expenses also included $43 million of nonrecurring expenses in the first half of 2011 related to the headquarters staff relocation. In 2010, we recorded $17 million of those nonrecurring expenses. So excluding nonrecurring expenses in both years, SG&A expenses increased 16% for the year, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved to 38.4% from 39.2% in the prior year. I will remind you that the vast majority of our SG&A expenses are relatively fixed, in fact, about 80%. So there is further opportunity to leverage those costs and improve the ratio to sales. For 2012, we believe we have put together a well controlled and prudent expense plan. Our plan calls for high single-digit expense growth, which includes increased spending for new stores, labor, occupancy and marketing. Our plan will enable us to improve the expense ratio to sales for the full year. 
Excluding nonrecurring charges, the improvement will be comparable or better than the 80 basis point reduction achieved in 2011. The SG&A expense growth in 2012 also factors in higher pension and postretirement costs due to asset performance and the reduction in the discount rate. For the full year, the slight decline in gross margin and the improved SG&A expense ratio gave us an operating margin of 19.4% versus 19.3% last year. However, excluding nonrecurring items, the operating margin was 20.6% versus 19.8% last year. For 2012, the expected decline in gross margin and improvement in the SG&A expense ratio will likely result in the operating margin being unchanged from 2011 to 20.6% excluding the nonrecurring items. 
Other expenses rose to $13 million in the fourth quarter from $11 million last year while other expenses in the full year declined to $43 million from $47 million due to lower interest expense. We expect other expenses in 2012 to be roughly unchanged from 2011. The effective income tax rate of 34.5% in the fourth quarter was a bit higher than we anticipated, which caused us a few cents per share in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 came in at 34%. That was higher than the 32.7% rate in fiscal 2010, which included benefits from nonrecurring items primarily related to a change in tax status in certain subsidiaries. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% for 2012. 
Adding it all up, net income declined 2% in the fourth quarter to $178 million or $1.39 per diluted share. For the full year, net earnings rose 19% to $439 million or $3.40 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings declined 4% in the fourth quarter but rose 24% in the full year to $3.60 per diluted share. Due to the higher-than-expected effective tax rate, this was at the lower end of the range we had projected when we reported holiday sales results on January 10. The full year net margin rose to 12.1% in 2011 from 11.9% in 2010. Excluding the nonrecurring items, net margin was 12.8% in 2011 versus 12.2% in 2010. 
Whichever way you measure it, Tiffany had a very strong year, and earnings surpassed the healthy objective that we set at the start of 2011. Our return on average equity and return on average assets improved in 2011. ROE was 19% for the full year versus 18% in 2010, while ROA was 11% for the full year versus 10% in 2010. While the improved ROA reflects the strong earnings in 2011 it also reflects a large increase in inventory levels, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
We finished the year with a solid balance sheet that we believe serves as a competitive advantage. Accounts receivable of $184 million at year end was 1% below the prior year end, and receivable turnover remained very high at 20x. Net inventories of $2.1 billion at January 31 were 28% higher than the prior year end, but it's important to look at the components of that increase. 
Finished goods inventories rose 16% in fiscal 2011, reflecting higher product acquisition cost, new stores, product launches and expanded product assortments, including our statement jewelry category. And the lower-than-expected sales growth in the fourth quarter temporarily inflated year-end inventory levels. It's worth noting that the larger driver of inventory growth was in raw material and work-in-process inventories. Combined, they increased 46% in the year, reflecting higher product acquisition cost, increased internal manufacturing and substantially higher rough and polished diamond purchases. 
For 2012, we are planning for a 15% increase in net inventories partly due to new stores, expanded product assortment and further vertical integration of our diamond supply chain. The inventory growth also includes a meaningful increase of extraordinary statement jewelry pieces to support the celebration of Tiffany's 175th anniversary over the 2012, 2013 time frame. 
Capital expenditures were $239 million in 2011 or 7% of sales. This was substantially higher than the $127 million we spent in 2010. The largest single piece of the CapEx increase resulted from the relocation of our New York headquarters staff. We also increased our CapEx by renovating more of our store base, and CapEx also went toward opening 14 stores. Our CapEx budget of $240 million for 2012 reflects both a higher rate of new store openings and an increased number of store renovations. The budgeted amount represents about 6% of sales and is consistent with the long-term plan to spend about 6% to 7% of sales per year. 
As a result of the factors I cited, Tiffany's 2011 free cash flow, which we define as cash flows from operating activities minus capital expenditures, was an outflow of $29 million. At year end, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $442 million, total short-term and long-term debt was $712 million, and stockholders' equity was $2.3 billion at year end. As a result, the ratio of total debt to equity was 30% at year end compared with 32% at the end of fiscal 2010 and 40% at the end of fiscal 2009. 
In 2011, we paid off $61 million of maturing long-term debt in Japan. We also entered into a JPY 4 billion or about $15 million 1-year credit facility in Japan, which was fully utilized at year end. During the year, we continued returning cash to stockholders. We remained active in our share repurchase program in 2011 spending $174 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $66.23 per share. And once again, we increased the quarterly dividend rate on common stock, announcing a 16% increase in May 2011. That represented the tenth dividend increase in 9 years, which has also led to a meaningful increase in the dividend payout ratio over that period. 
The annual dividend of $1.16 per share represents a payout ratio 34% on 2011's earnings per share of $3.40. Looking to our financial guidance for 2012, we stated in today's news release that we are projecting an approximate 10% increase in worldwide sales in 2012, primarily driven by sales growth in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Our expected 10% worldwide sales increase in dollars equates to a 12% increase on constant-exchange-rate basis with comp store sales growth of 8%. 
I've already mentioned our full year assumptions for gross margin, SG&A expense growth, other expenses and the effective income tax rate. Bringing it all together, we are projecting net earnings for 2012 in a range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2011 EPS of $3.60 per diluted share, which excluded the nonrecurring items. 
As we noted in today's news release, we expect a large portion of the earnings growth to be weighted toward the fourth quarter. The unusual spread is largely due to our expectation for some continued gross margin pressure in the next few quarters. We also noted in today's release that we are now halfway through the first quarter, and worldwide sales growth is tracking in line with our internal expectation. We know there are economic challenges and uncertainty in a number of markets around the world as evidenced by the fourth quarter results, and we believe we have factored a reasonable degree of caution into our forecast. However, we also continue to take a long-term approach to managing our business and are striving to increase Tiffany's presence and customer base. 
Our 2012 plan includes making those investments to reap both immediate and longer-term benefits. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski."

I'm pleased to say that we achieved, if not exceeded, the objectives we set for 2011. We generated strong sales and earnings growth for the year despite the softness in the fourth quarter, and we continue to build an even stronger platform for future growth. The new stores we opened and the new products introduced performed well, and we have exciting plans for 2012. 
Specifically, one of our key initiatives will be the continued expansion of our company operated worldwide store base. Our plan for 2012 is to open a net of 24 stores, representing a 10% increase in the number of locations. In the Americas, we are planning to open 9 stores comprised of 4 stores in the United States, including a store we are opening this week in Salt Lake City and a store in Manhattan's SoHo in September. We are planning for 2 new stores in Canada, including one we opened last month in the Montréal, and we are planning to open 3 stores in Latin America with 2 in Mexico and 1 in Rio de Janeiro. In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open a net of 7 stores this year, including one store in Junction in Australia, our sixth in Australia. Our second store in Singapore's airport, which will be our fifth store in Singapore and a net of 5 stores in China, bringing us to 21 stores in China by year end. 
Our plans continue to call for expanding our store base to 30 stores in China in the next several years. In Japan, the store total will be unchanged. Our plans for Europe call for adding 3 stores this year in Prague, in Nice and in the Berlin airport, which will bring us to 35 European stores by year end and closer to our goal of 50 stores in Europe in the next 5 or so years. 
Our worldwide store expansion plans in 2012 also include adding 5 company-operated stores in the Middle East. Two months ago, we announced our signing of a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint venture in the UAE with Damas Jewellers. Under the JV, Tiffany will soon take on responsibility for merchandising, assortment and pricing, advertising and promotional activities, staffing, store design and visual display and financial services in 5 existing Tiffany company stores including 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi. We are very excited about inverting the stores into company operated locations and believe there is substantial potential for us to reach a large base of customers who undoubtedly appreciates Tiffany's extraordinary product offerings. 
Beyond the Middle East, we are also exploring opportunities to expand Tiffany's modest existing presence in Russia and Brazil and to eventually enter India. Tiffany's website has been widely recognized for its innovative excellence in the jewelry category. We believe we can enhance the customer experience even further and are working on a comprehensive revamp of the website to launch later in the year, which we expect will generate additional marketing and sales benefits. 
We also have developed an exciting and impactful array of new products to be introduced in 2012. I'm sure you are all aware that Tiffany's 1837 jewelry collection has been an enormous success. To commemorate the year of Tiffany's founding, we are excited about the current launch of the next generation of 1837 with new designs in gold and silver and a significant portion of the collection executed in Tiffany's mill. is a luminous blend of copper silver and gold, which are metallurgist took several years to develop. It has a radiant, innovative glow, and initial customer reception has been very strong. We plan to further expand our assortment of statement jewelry with important pieces, and we'll continue to offer our extraordinary engagement jewelry and the compelling and competitively dominant assortment of styles. 
Beyond engagement and statement jewelry, we have developed a new collection for later this year with designs inspired by the natural world and platinum gold and. There will also be new designs featuring pink diamonds, a continued focus and expansion of our very successful Yellow Diamond Collection, additions to our Somerset jewelry collection and new pearl jewelry offerings. And we will debut a new collection of designs inspired by the Art Deco period to coincide with the fourth quarter debut of the movie The Great Gatsby, for which Tiffany has designed the jewelry. We are also currently launching Paloma Picasso's new Paloma Collection in gold and silver inspired by the Paloma's favorite gardens around the world. 
Finally, we will continue to build on the strength of our core collection with additions to our very successful Return to Tiffany, Keys, Locks and Charms collections and new additions to our Leather Collection. And, of course, you can be certain that we will employ an active marketing program through advertising and print and digital media, public relations and store events to focus on these new designs, as well as the wide range of Tiffany Classics. 
Supporting our ongoing business and store and product expansion is our strong infrastructure. Tiffany's 2 distribution centers are very effectively handling worldwide store replenishment and direct-to-customer shipments. Very importantly, we have developed excellent product manufacturing and sourcing capabilities. In 2011, we internally manufactured about 60% of Tiffany's merchandise sold. The new jewelry manufacturing facility we opened in Lexington, Kentucky in 2011 gives us additional capacity to complement our facilities in New York and Rhode Island and can support our future growth. 
Tiffany has built an extraordinarily powerful diamond supply chain through relationships with many of the world's diamond producers. Less than 1% of the world's diamonds meet Tiffany quality standards as we continue to seek global wealth creation in the future, we and others in our industry expect that the worldwide supply of diamonds especially at our quality levels keep pace with growing customer demand and therefore, diamond cost will likely move higher. While we cannot mitigate higher costs, we can feel assured that the diamond supply chain we have developed will enable us to serve our growing customer base with a comprehensive supply of the finest quality diamonds that they expect from Tiffany. The 2012, 2013 period mark the 175th anniversary of Tiffany's founding. Our brand is now globally recognized and inspired. 
54% of our worldwide sales of 2011 were transacted outside the United States, and the percentage of sales made to non-U.S. customers is even greater if you include spending by foreign tourists shopping in our U.S. stores. Tiffany will continue to grow as the place that customers from around the world come to celebrate life's most important occasions. The Tiffany & Co. brand is flourishing because it represents the finest product quality and craftmanship, enduring value a rewarding shopping experience and a bond of trust with consumers. We know that these will make the keys to our future growth and to our success. 
We believe we have put together a reasonable and achievable financial plan for 2012 with approximately 10% worldwide sales growth and net earnings growth of 10% to 13%, excluding last year's nonrecurring items. What we accomplish in 2012 should yield benefits for years to come, and we remain committed to our longer-term financial objectives to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. 
Thank you for joining us today for our review of Tiffany's results and outlook. I look forward to seeing many of you during the year and updating you on Tiffany's progress. In fact, please note that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on Thursday, May 24. I appreciate your ongoing and growing interest. Here's Mark again."

Now let's proceed. One year ago, we reported broad-based strong financial results for fiscal 2010 with sales up 14% and net earnings from continuing operations up 39%. We are now pleased to also report strong performance for fiscal 2011 with net sales up 18%, net earnings up 19% to $3.40 per diluted share and net earnings excluding nonrecurring items, up 24% to $3.60 per diluted share. At the same time, we are disappointed that the year finished on a softer note than we initially expected with fourth quarter sales up 8%, net earnings down 2% and net earnings, excluding nonrecurring items, down 4%, but that does not diminish our satisfaction from achieving another successful year. And it's worth noting that the $3.60 per diluted share of earnings in 2011, excluding nonrecurring items, was above the initial guidance we provided to you one year ago that called for $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share. 
Let's first review some key sales highlights by region for the fourth quarter and full year. Sales in the Americas increased 5% in the fourth quarter with comp store sales up 3% on top of an 8% comp increase last year. This was a slight improvement from the 4% increase in November, December holiday sales that we had previously reported. The 5% sales increase in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the average price-per-unit sold. In fact, while price stratification for the Americas in the fourth quarter indicated continued declines in sales and transactions below $250, it was more than offset by sales growth in most of the higher-priced categories. It was a pretty similar dichotomy for the full year with the greatest strength in sales over $20,000 and $50,000. 
We believe that the slower sales growth in the Americas in the fourth quarter might have been in varying degrees due to restrained spending by customers employed in the financial sector, which especially affected our sales in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., substantial competitive discounting and particular softness at our entry-level silver jewelry price points that might be tied to some resistance to price increases among other factors. 
Sales in the New York flagship store rose 2% in the quarter, which was a bit better than the 1% decline in the holiday period. The 2% increase was due to higher sales to foreign tourists. The overall Americas region also benefited from higher sales to foreign tourists but also saw increased sales to local customers. Comp store sales in brand stores rose 3%, with growth somewhat skewed toward the western half of the region, which includes continued strong growth in Hawaii and Guam driven by Japanese tourists. Our stores in Canada and Latin America posted solid sales growth in the quarter.
For the full year, sales in the Americas rose 15% due to an overall increase in the average price-per-unit sold. Growth in jewelry units sold at higher price points was offset by declines in the silver jewelry category. The Americas region represented 50% of worldwide sales versus 51% in 2010. Americas comps rose 13% in the full year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 20% in 2011 and remained at 8% of worldwide sales. 
In 2011, more than 40% of sales made in the New York flagship store were to foreign tourists versus somewhat less than 40% in 2010. Americas brand store comps rose 11% in 2011 on a constant exchange rate basis due to strong increases in most parts of the U.S. as well as in Canada and Latin America. 
I mentioned that higher foreign tourist spending generated a good portion of the fourth quarter sales growth in the U.S. That reason also applied to the full year. In fact, full year sales to foreign tourists represented an estimated 23% of U.S. sales in 2011 versus 17% and 15% in 2010 and 2009. European, Japanese and Chinese tourists represented roughly similar amounts of that spending in 2011. 
The 5 highest volume brand stores in the Americas in 2011 included 3 in the U.S. and 2 in Canada, and they are South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, San Francisco and Chicago, as well as in Vancouver and on Toronto's Bloor Street. We opened 6 new stores in the Americas in 2011, including one in Richmond, Virginia, a fourth store in Las Vegas in the Fashion Show Mall, a fourth store in the Chicago market in Northbrook, a store in Calgary, a second store in Vancouver in the Oakridge Centre and a third store in Brazil in Brasilia. Their results range from quite good to very strong, and that follows excellent first-year results from the 5 Americas stores we opened in the previous year. 
We finished 2011 with 102 stores in the Americas, including 87 in the U.S., 5 in Canada, 7 in Mexico and 3 in Brazil. Rounding out the Americas are Internet and catalog sales, which declined 4% in the fourth quarter as an increased amount per order was more than offset by a decline in the number of orders shipped. Internet and catalog sales rose 6% in the full year due to increased sales per order and accounted for about 10% of sales in the Americas for the year. We continue to believe that our Internet presence serves the dual purpose of generating online sales and expanding brand awareness, which drives traffic to our stores. We are currently in the process of revamping our website with some exciting enhancements that will debut later this year. 
Tiffany's second largest region by sales is Asia-Pacific. Sales rose 19% in the fourth quarter due to increased units sold and a smaller increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales in the quarter rose 18% with growth in most countries and especially in Australia, Hong Kong and Macau contributed to a 13% increase in comp store sales. That was on top of a 16% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter and was basically in line with the previously reported November, December sales results. 
For the full year, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 36% due to similar increases in units and in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 31%, and comp store sales rose 27% on top of a 14% comp increase in 2010 with strong increases in most countries.
Asia-Pacific represented 21% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010. Sales in Greater China represented 12 points of the 21%. We have a meaningful opportunity to achieve much higher brand awareness in China, and as we proceed, we should undoubtedly see the benefits through sales growth in China as well as in other markets serving the growing numbers of Chinese tourists. 
During the year, we opened 6 stores in Asia-Pacific, including 3 in Korea, in Seoul, Daegu and Incheon; 2 in China, in Guangzhou and Dong Cheng; and one in Taiwan, in Taichung. And their early results are good. We also did a major renovation and expansion, which doubled the size of our very successful store on Collins Street in Melbourne. We ended 2011 with 58 stores in the Asia-Pacific region. Our 2 largest stores by sales volume in the region are on Canton Road in Hong Kong and in Ngee Ann City in Singapore. 
Now let's turn to Japan. Total sales rose 12% in the fourth quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This was essentially in line with the 13% sales increase in the holiday period. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 5% in the quarter, and comps rose 4% on top of a 1% increase last year due to relatively similar growth throughout Japan. 
One year ago this month, we were looking at a sales decline and considerable uncertainty in Japan following the tragic earthquake and tsunami. But our sales growth resumed one month later, demonstrating the enduring value and emotional resonance of our brand combined with the extraordinary efforts of our Tiffany colleagues in Japan. For the year, on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 3%, and comparable store sales rose 4%. However, due to the yen strengthening by 10% against the U.S. dollar in 2011, total sales increased 13% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. 
Our flagship store in the Ginza in Tokyo generates the highest volume of our stores in Japan and accounted for 12% of our total retail sales in Japan last year. During 2011, we opened a new store in Hakata and closed 2 locations in Kokura and Wakayama and finished the year with 55 locations in Japan. For the full year, Japan represented 17% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010.
Now let's review performance in Europe. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 3% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This was slightly better than the previously reported holiday sales result. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 3%, and comp store sales declined 2% on top of the 16% comp increase on last year's fourth quarter. The 2% comp decline reflected mixed results that range from solid growth in Continental Europe with the highest growth in Germany and Austria to a sales decline in the U.K.  
For the full year, sales in Europe increased 17% due to increases in units sold as well as in the average price per unit sold and continue to represent 12% of worldwide sales. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales rose 12%, and comp store sales rose 6% on top of an 18% comp increase in 2010. Strong sales growth across Continental Europe surpassed a more modest increase in U.K. sales in the year. We think that softness in London has probably reflected restrained spending by customers in the financial industry similar to what we've experienced in New York along with overall challenging economic conditions. 
The vast majority of our European sales are generated by local customers. However, Tiffany stores in Europe also derive a growing benefit from sales to non-European tourists, which we estimate now represent about 1/4 of European sales with the highest percentage of those sales in Paris. In addition, Tiffany's Internet sales in Europe through websites in 9 countries are also growing very nicely and represented almost 10% of total European sales in 2011.
During the year, we opened 3 stores in Europe, including a second store in Milan, in the Excelsior, which is posting excellent initial results, as well as second stores in both Frankfurt and Zürich, in their airports. And I should add that we've had excellent results from the 2 stores we opened in 2010 in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona. 
The U.K., with 10 stores, accounted for slightly less than half of our European sales in 2011. Our 2 highest sales volume stores in Europe in 2011 were on Old Bond Street in London and on via della Spiga in Milan. We operated 32 stores in Europe at the end of 2011. 
Putting it all together, our solid sales growth contributed to improved sales productivity in 2011 coming from comp store sales growth and the successful results from new stores. Looking at that sales productivity by region, the 247 stores we operated in 21 countries at year end generated total worldwide sales per gross square foot of $3,000 in 2011 versus $2,600 in 2010. 
By region, the Americas generated $2,300 in 2011 versus $2,100 in 2010. Europe generated $3,400 versus $3,000 in 2010. Japan was at $4,100 versus $3,500 in 2010. And the highest productivity continued to be in Asia-Pacific, with $4,700 per gross square foot versus $4,000 in 2010. 
Let's briefly look at other sales, which declined 22% in the fourth quarter. That segment consists primarily of wholesale sales of diamonds and sales to independent third-party distributors of our products, primarily in the Middle East and Russia, and the sales decline reflected lower sales in both components, as we had expected. For the full year, other sales declined 5% as sales growth to independent distributors was more than offset by a decline in wholesale sales of diamonds. 
We recently announced that we have signed a memorandum of understanding with Damas Jewelers to establish a joint venture in the UAE. The JV will give us overall responsibility for 5 existing stores in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and we will soon commence new merchandising and marketing initiatives there to drive sales growth. 
Let's now review some merchandising highlights. While total sales growth decelerated to 8% in the fourth quarter after increasing 24% in the first 9 months of the year, there were some different patterns by category and price point in some regions. High-end statement jewelry sales softened after experiencing strong growth in the first 3 quarters of 2011. On the other hand, the most resilient category was engagement jewelry, with a very solid increase in the quarter, continuing its strong growth from earlier in the year. Fine and fashion jewelry sales were up modestly in the quarter after strong growth in the first 3 quarters of the year. We are extremely pleased with the continued success of our extraordinary yellow diamond jewelry collection and with its long-term potential. 
We've also seen customers all year attracted to platinum- and diamond-focused products, such as studs and pendants and to important collections, such as Victoria, Metro and Celebration Rings. There's also been a growing desire for gold jewelry and collections like Return to Tiffany, 1837 and the new Locks collection, which followed the unprecedented success of the Keys collection. Conversely, silver jewelry sales have been growing more modestly. 
We were pleased with growth in designer jewelry sales in the quarter that continued our success from earlier in the year. Elsa Peretti's designs had a healthy sales increase led by the always alluring Diamonds by the Yard collection. Paloma Picasso sales growth was stimulated by her stunning new Venezia Collection, and we are also continuing to be pleased with the sales growth of Tiffany's Leather Collection. 
Product development has always been an important strategy and sales driver at Tiffany's, and you can expect to see a very exciting and eclectic array of new jewelry designs over the coming year. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat McGuiness."

Let's start with gross margin, which at 60.4% in the fourth quarter was 0.5 point lower than the prior year. The downward pressure in the quarter came from higher product cost, a continued shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products that earn a lower gross margin and a lack of sales leverage on fixed cost. 
For the full year, gross margin of 59% was 0.1 point lower than the prior year. Higher product acquisition costs and shifts in product sales mix were mostly offset by sales leverage on fixed costs. Throughout the year, we have spoken about gross margin pressure from significantly higher cost of precious metals and diamonds which, in turn, have led to increased retail prices at Tiffany and in the overall jewelry industry. If product input costs stabilize, we would expect less pressure on gross margin in the latter part of 2012, and future pricing actions, if any, would be more modest. For the full year though, we expect gross margin to be lower than the prior year based on our assumptions for product cost, inventory turnover, sales volume and sales mix. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in the fourth quarter primarily due to growth in store occupancy, labor and marketing costs. In last year's fourth quarter, we recorded $6 million of nonrecurring expenses related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff in June 2011. Excluding that expense, SG&A is expected to increase 11% in this fourth quarter, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales would have been 36.3% versus 35.1% last year. For the full year, SG&A expenses rose 18%. This is also primarily due to higher cost for store occupancy, labor and marketing. 
SG&A expenses also included $43 million of nonrecurring expenses in the first half of 2011 related to the headquarters staff relocation. In 2010, we recorded $17 million of those nonrecurring expenses. So excluding nonrecurring expenses in both years, SG&A expenses increased 16% for the year, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved to 38.4% from 39.2% in the prior year. 
We will remind you that the vast majority of our SG&A expenses are relatively fixed, in fact, about 80%. So there's further opportunity to leverage those costs and improve the ratio to sales. For 2012, we believe we have put together a well controlled and prudent expense plan. Our plan calls for high single-digit expense growth, which includes increased spending for new stores, labor, occupancy and marketing. Our plan will enable us to improve the expense ratio to sales for the full year. Excluding nonrecurring charges, the improvement will be comparable or better than the 80-basis-point reduction achieved in 2011. The SG&A expense growth in 2012 also factors in higher pension and post-retirement costs due to asset performance and a reduction in the discount rate. 
For the full year, the slight decline in gross margin and the improved SG&A expense ratio gave us an operating margin of 19.4% versus 19.3% last year. However, excluding nonrecurring items, the operating margin was 20.6% versus 19.8% last year. For 2012, the expected decline in gross margin and improvement in the SG&A expense ratio will likely result in the operating margin being unchanged from 2011 to 20.6% excluding the nonrecurring items. 
Other expenses rose to $13 million in the fourth quarter from $11 million last year, while other expenses in the full year declined to $43 million from $47 million due to lower interest expense. We expect other expenses in 2012 to be roughly unchanged from 2011. The effective income tax rate of 34.5% in the fourth quarter was a bit higher than we anticipated, which caused us a few cents per share in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 came in at 34%. That was higher than the 32.7% rate in fiscal 2010, which included benefits from nonrecurring items primarily related to a change in tax status of certain subsidiaries. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% for 2012. 
Adding it all up, net income declined 2% in the fourth quarter to $178 million or $1.39 per diluted share. For the full year, net earnings rose 19% to $439 million or $3.40 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings declined 4% in the fourth quarter but rose 24% in the full year to $3.60 per diluted share. Due to the higher-than-expected effective tax rate, this was at the lower end of the range we had projected when we reported holiday sales results on January 10. The full year net margin rose to 12.1% in 2011 from 11.9% in 2010. Excluding the nonrecurring items, net margin was 12.8% in 2011 versus 12.2% in 2010. 
Whichever way you measure it, Tiffany had a very strong year, and earnings surpassed the healthy objective that we set at the start of 2011. Our return on average equity and return on average assets improved in 2011. ROE was 19% for the full year versus 18% in 2010, while ROA was 11% for the full year versus 10% in 2010. While the improved ROA reflects the strong earnings in 2011, it also reflects a large increase in inventory levels, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
We finished the year with a solid balance sheet that we believe serves as a competitive advantage. Accounts receivable of $184 million at year end was 1% below the prior year end, and receivable turnover remained very high at 20x. Net inventories of $2.1 billion at January 31 were 28% higher than the prior year end, but it's important to look at the components of that increase. 
Finished goods inventories rose 16% in fiscal 2011, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, new stores, product launches and expanded product assortments, including our statement jewelry category, and the lower-than-expected sales growth in the fourth quarter temporarily inflated year-end inventory levels. It's worth noting that the larger driver of inventory growth was in raw material and work-in-process inventories. Combined, they increased 46% in the year, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, increased internal manufacturing and substantially higher rough and polished diamond purchases. 
For 2012, we are planning for a 15% increase in net inventories partly due to new stores, expanded product assortments and further vertical integration of our diamond supply chain. The inventory growth also includes a meaningful increase of extraordinary statement jewelry pieces to support the celebration of Tiffany's 175th anniversary over the 2012, 2013 timeframe. 
Capital expenditures were $239 million in 2011 or 7% of sales. This was substantially higher than the $127 million we spent in 2010. The largest single piece of the CapEx increase resulted from the relocation of our New York headquarters staff. We also increased our CapEx by renovating more of our store base, and CapEx also went toward opening 14 stores. Our CapEx budget of $240 million for 2012 reflects both a higher rate of new store openings and an increased number of store renovations. The budgeted amount represents about 6% of sales and is consistent with the long-term plan to spend about 6% to 7% of sales per year. 
As a result of the factors I've cited, Tiffany's 2011 free cash flow, which we define as cash flows from operating activities minus capital expenditures, was an outflow of $29 million. At year end, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $442 million. Total short-term and long-term debt was $712 million, and stockholders' equity was $2.3 billion at year end. As a result, the ratio of total debt to equity was 30% at year end compared with 32% at the end of fiscal 2010 and 40% at the end of fiscal 2009. In 2011, we paid off $61 million of maturing long-term debt in Japan. We also entered into a JPY 4 billion or about $50 million one-year credit facility in Japan, which was fully utilized at year end. 
During the year, we continued returning cash to stockholders. We remained active in our share repurchase program in 2011, spending $174 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $66.23 per share. And once again, we increased the quarterly dividend rate on common stock, announcing a 16% increase in May 2011. That represented the 10th dividend increase in 9 years, which has also led to a meaningful increase in the dividend payout ratio over that period. The annual dividend of $1.16 per share represents a payout ratio of 34% on 2011's earnings per share of $3.40. 
Looking to our financial guidance for 2012. We stated in today's news release that we are projecting an approximate 10% increase in worldwide sales in 2012 primarily driven by sales growth in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Our expected 10% worldwide sales increase in dollars equates to a 12% increase on constant exchange rate basis with comp store sales growth of 8%. 
I've already mentioned our full year assumptions for gross margin, SG&A expense growth, other expenses and the effective income tax rate. Bringing it all together, we are projecting net earnings for 2012 in a range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2011 EPS of $3.60 per diluted share, which excluded the nonrecurring items. 
As we noted in today's news release, we expect a large portion of the earnings growth to be weighted toward the fourth quarter. The unusual spread is largely due to our expectation for some continued gross margin pressure in the next few quarters. We also noted in today's release that we are now halfway through the first quarter, and worldwide sales growth is tracking in line with our internal expectation. 
We know there are economic challenges and uncertainty in a number of markets around the world as evidenced by the fourth quarter results, and we believe we have factored a reasonable degree of caution into our forecast. However, we also continue to take a long-term approach to managing our business and are striving to increase Tiffany's presence and customer base. Our 2012 plan includes making those investments to reap both immediate and longer-term benefits. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski."

I'm glad to be on this call and pleased to say that we achieved, if not exceeded, the objectives we set for 2011. We generated strong sales and earnings growth for the year despite the softness in the fourth quarter, and we continue to build an even stronger platform for future growth. The new stores we opened and the new products we introduced performed well, and we have exciting plans for 2012. Specifically, one of our key initiatives will be the continued expansion of our company-operated worldwide store base. Our plan for 2012 is to open a net of 24 stores, representing a 10% increase in the number of locations. 
In the Americas, we are planning to open 9 stores comprised of 4 stores in the United States, including a store we are opening this week in Salt Lake City and a store in Manhattan SoHo in September. We are planning for 2 new stores in Canada, including one we opened last month in at Montréal, and we are planning to open 3 stores in Latin America, with 2 in Mexico and 1 in Rio de Janeiro. 
In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open a net of 7 stores this year, including one store in Bondi Junction in Australia, our sixth in Australia; our second store in Singapore's airport, which will be our fifth store in Singapore; and a net of 5 stores in China, bringing us to 21 stores in China by year end. Our plans continue to call for expanding our store base to 30 stores in China in the next several years. In Japan, the store total will be unchanged. 
Our plans for Europe call for adding 3 stores this year in Prague, in Nice and in the Berlin airport, which will bring us to 35 European stores by year end and closer to our goal of 50 stores in Europe in the next 5-or-so years. 
Our worldwide store expansion plans in 2012 also include adding 5 company-operated stores in the Middle East. Two months ago, we announced our signing of a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint venture in the UAE with Damas Jewelers. Under the JV, Tiffany will soon take on responsibility for merchandising, assortment and pricing, advertising and promotional activities, staffing, store design and visual display and financial services in 5 existing Tiffany company stores, including 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi. We are very excited about converting these stores into company-operated locations and believe there is substantial potential for us to reach a large base of customers who undoubtedly appreciates Tiffany's extraordinary product offerings. Beyond the Middle East, we are also exploring opportunities to expand Tiffany's modest existing presence in Russia and Brazil and to eventually enter India. 
Tiffany's website has been widely recognized for its innovative excellence in the jewelry category. We believe we can enhance the customer experience even further and are working on a comprehensive revamp of the website to launch later in the year, which we expect will generate additional marketing and sales benefits. 
We also have developed an exciting and impactful array of new products to be introduced in 2012. I'm sure you are all aware that Tiffany's 1837 jewelry collection has been an enormous success. To commemorate the year of Tiffany's founding, we are excited about the current launch of the next generation of 1837 with new designs in gold and silver and a significant portion of the collection executed in Tiffany's new RUBEDO metal. RUBEDO is a luminescent blend of copper, silver and gold, which our metallurgists took several years to develop. It has a radiant, innovative glow, and initial customer reception has been very strong. We plan to further expand our assortment of statement jewelry with important pieces, and we'll continue to offer our extraordinary engagement jewelry in a compelling and competitively dominant assortment of styles. 
Beyond engagement and statement jewelry, we have developed a new Enchant collection for later this year with designs inspired by the natural world in platinum, gold and tanzanite. There will also be new designs featuring pink diamonds, a continued focus and expansion of our very successful Yellow Diamond Collection, additions to our Somerset jewelry collection and new pearl jewelry offerings. And we will debut a new collection of designs inspired by the Art Deco period to coincide with the fourth quarter debut of the movie The Great Gatsby, for which Tiffany has designed the jewelry. We are also currently launching Paloma Picasso's new Villa Paloma collection in gold and silver, inspired by the beauty found in Paloma's favorite gardens around the world. 
Finally, we will continue to build on the strength of our core collections with additions to our very successful Return to Tiffany, Keys, Locks and Charms collections and new additions to our Leather Collection. And of course, you can be certain that we will employ an active marketing program through advertising and print and digital media, public relations and store events to focus on these new designs as well as the wide range of Tiffany classics. 
Supporting our ongoing business and store and product expansion is our strong infrastructure. Tiffany's 2 distribution centers are very effectively handling worldwide store replenishment and direct-to-customer shipments. Very importantly, we have developed excellent product manufacturing and sourcing capabilities. In 2011, we internally manufactured about 60% of Tiffany's merchandise sold. The new jewelry manufacturing facility we opened in Lexington, Kentucky in 2011 gives us additional capacity to complement our facilities in New York and Rhode Island and can support our future growth. 
Tiffany has built an extraordinarily powerful diamond supply chain through relationships with many of the world's diamond producers. Less than 1% of the world's diamonds meet Tiffany quality standards. As we continue to seek global wealth creation in the future, we and others in our industry expect that the worldwide supply of diamonds, especially at our quality levels, keep pace with growing customer demand, and therefore, diamond cost will likely move higher. While we cannot mitigate higher cost, we can feel assured that the diamond supply chain we have developed will enable us to serve our growing customer base with a comprehensive supply of the finest-quality diamonds that they expect from Tiffany. 
The 2012, 2013 period marks the 175th anniversary of Tiffany's founding. Our brand is now globally recognized and admired. 54% of our worldwide sales in 2011 were transacted outside the United States, and the percentage of sales made to non-U.S. customers is even greater if you include the spending by foreign tourists shopping in our U.S. stores. 
Tiffany will continue to grow as the place that customers from around the world come to celebrate life's most important occasions. The Tiffany & Co. brand is flourishing because it represents the finest product quality and craftmanship, enduring value, a rewarding shopping experience and a bond of trust with consumers. We know that these traits will remain the keys to our future growth and our success. 
We believe we have put together a reasonable and achievable financial plan for 2012 with approximately 10% worldwide sales growth and net earnings growth of 10% to 13%, excluding last year's nonrecurring items. What we accomplish in 2012 should yield benefits for years to come, and we remain committed to our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. 
Thank you for joining us today for our review of Tiffany's results and outlook. I look forward to seeing many of you during the year and updating you on Tiffany's progress. In fact, please note that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on Thursday, May 24. I appreciate your ongoing and growing interest. Here's Mark again."

Now let's proceed. One year ago, we reported broad-based strong financial results for fiscal 2010 with sales up 14% and net earnings from continuing operations up 39%. We are now pleased to also report strong performance for fiscal 2011, with net sales up 18%, net earnings up 19% to $3.40 per diluted share and net earnings excluding nonrecurring items up 24% to $3.60 per diluted share. 
At the same time, we are disappointed that the year finished on a softer note than we initially expected, with fourth quarter sales up 8%, net earnings down 2% and net earnings excluding nonrecurring items down 4%, but that does not diminish our satisfaction from achieving another successful year. And it's worth noting that the $3.60 per diluted share of earnings in 2011 excluding nonrecurring items was above the initial guidance we provided to you one year ago that called for $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share. 
Let's first review some key sales highlights by region for the fourth quarter and full year. Sales in the Americas increased 5% in the fourth quarter, with comp store sales up 3% on top of an 8% comp increase last year. This was a slight improvement from the 4% increase in November, December holiday sales that we had previously reported. The 5% sales increase in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. In fact, while price stratification for the Americas in the fourth quarter indicated continued declines in sales and transactions below $250, it was more than offset by sales growth in most of the higher-priced categories. It was a pretty similar dichotomy for the full year, with the greatest strength in sales over $20,000 and $50,000. 
We believe that the slower sales growth in the Americas in the fourth quarter might have been in varying degrees due to restrained spending by customers employed in the financial sector, which especially affected our sales in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., substantial competitive discounting and particular softness at our entry-level silver jewelry price points that might be tied to some resistance to price increases among other factors. 
Sales in the New York flagship store rose 2% in the quarter, which was a bit better than the 1% decline in the holiday period. The 2% increase was due to higher sales to foreign tourists. The overall Americas region also benefited from higher sales to foreign tourists but also saw increased sales to local customers. Comp store sales in branch stores rose 3%, with growth somewhat skewed toward the western half of the region, which includes continued strong growth in Hawaii and Guam, driven by Japanese tourists. Our stores in Canada and Latin America posted solid sales growth in the quarter.
For the full year, sales in the Americas rose 15% due to an overall increase in the average price per unit sold. Growth in jewelry units sold at higher price points was offset by declines in the silver jewelry category. The Americas region represented 50% of worldwide sales versus 51% in 2010. Americas comps rose 13% in the full year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 20% in 2011 and remained at 8% of worldwide sales. 
In 2011, more than 40% of sales made in the New York flagship store were to foreign tourists versus somewhat less than 40% in 2010. Americas branch store comps rose 11% in 2011 on a constant exchange rate basis due to strong increases in most parts of the U.S. as well as in Canada and Latin America. 
I mentioned that higher foreign tourist spending generated a good portion of the fourth quarter sales growth in the U.S. That reason also applied to the full year. In fact, full year sales to foreign tourists represented an estimated 23% of U.S. sales in 2011 versus 17% and 15% in 2010 and 2009. European, Japanese and Chinese tourists represented roughly similar amounts of that spending in 2011. 
The 5 highest-volume branch stores in the Americas in 2011 included 3 in the U.S. and 2 in Canada, and they are South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, San Francisco and Chicago as well as in Vancouver and on Toronto's Bloor Street. We opened 6 new stores in the Americas in 2011, including one in Richmond, Virginia, a fourth store in Las Vegas in the Fashion Show Mall, a fourth store in the Chicago market in Northbrook, a store in Calgary, a second store in Vancouver in the Oakridge Centre and a third store in Brazil in Brasilia. Their results range from quite good to very strong, and that follows excellent first-year results from the 5 Americas stores we opened in the previous year. 
We finished 2011 with 102 stores in the Americas, including 87 in the U.S., 5 in Canada, 7 in Mexico and 3 in Brazil. Rounding out the Americas are Internet and catalog sales, which declined 4% in the fourth quarter as an increased amount per order was more than offset by a decline in the number of orders shipped. Internet and catalog sales rose 6% in the full year due to increased sales per order and accounted for about 10% of sales in the Americas for the year. We continue to believe that our Internet presence serves the dual purpose of generating online sales and expanding brand awareness, which drives traffic to our stores. We are currently in the process of revamping our website with some exciting enhancements that will debut later this year. 
Tiffany's second-largest region by sales is Asia-Pacific. Sales rose 19% in the fourth quarter due to increased units sold and a smaller increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales for the quarter rose 18% with growth in most countries and especially in Australia, Hong Kong and Macau contributed to a 13% increase in comp store sales. That was on top of a 16% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter and was basically in line with the previously reported November, December sales results. 
For the full year, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 36% due to similar increases in units and in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 31%, and comp store sales rose 27% on top of a 14% comp increase in 2010, with strong increases in most countries.
Asia-Pacific represented 21% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010. Sales in Greater China represented 12 points of the 21%. We have a meaningful opportunity to achieve much higher brand awareness in China, and as we proceed, we should undoubtedly see the benefits through sales growth in China as well as in other markets serving the growing numbers of Chinese tourists. 
During the year, we opened 6 stores in Asia-Pacific, including 3 in Korea, in Seoul, Daegu and Incheon; 2 in China, in Guangzhou and Dong Cheng; and one in Taiwan, in Taichung. And their early results are good. We also did a major renovation and expansion, which doubled the size of our very successful store on Collins Street in Melbourne. We ended 2011 with 58 stores in the Asia-Pacific region. Our 2 largest stores by sales volume in the region are on Canton Road in Hong Kong and in Ngee Ann City in Singapore. 
Now let's turn to Japan. Total sales rose 12% in the fourth quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This was essentially in line with the 13% sales increase in the holiday period. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 5% in the quarter and comps rose 4% on top of a 1% increase last year due to relatively similar growth throughout Japan. 
One year ago this month, we were looking at a sales decline and considerable uncertainty in Japan following the tragic earthquake and tsunami. But our sales growth resumed one month later, demonstrating the enduring value and emotional resonance of our brand combined with the extraordinary efforts of our Tiffany colleagues in Japan. For the year, on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 3% and comparable store sales rose 4%. However, due to the yen strengthening by 10% against the U.S. dollar in 2011, total sales increased 13% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. 
Our flagship store on the Ginza in Tokyo generates the highest volume of our stores in Japan and accounted for 12% of our total retail sales in Japan last year. During 2011, we opened a new store in Hakata and closed 2 locations in Kokura and Wakayama and finished the year with 55 locations in Japan. For the full year, Japan represented 17% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010.
Now let's review performance in Europe. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 3% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This was slightly better than the previously reported holiday sales result. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 3% and comp store sales declined 2% on top of the 16% comp increase on last year's fourth quarter. The 2% comp decline reflected mixed results that range from solid growth in Continental Europe, with the highest growth in Germany and Austria, to a sales decline in the U.K.  
For the full year, sales in Europe increased 17% due to increases in units sold as well as in the average price per unit sold and continue to represent 12% of worldwide sales. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales rose 12% and comp store sales rose 6% on top of an 18% comp increase in 2010. Strong sales growth across Continental Europe surpassed a more modest increase in U.K. sales in the year. We think the softness in London has probably reflected restrained spending by customers in the financial industry, similar to what we've experienced in New York, along with overall challenging economic conditions. 
The vast majority of our European sales are generated by local customers. However, Tiffany stores in Europe also derive a growing benefit from sales to non-European tourists, which we estimate now represent about 1/4 of European sales, with the highest percentage of those sales in Paris. In addition, Tiffany's Internet sales in Europe through websites in 9 countries are also growing very nicely and represented almost 10% of total European sales in 2011.
During the year, we opened 3 stores in Europe, including a second store in Milan, in the Excelsior, which is posting excellent initial results, as well as second stores in both Frankfurt and Zürich, in their airports. And I should add that we've had excellent results from the 2 stores we opened in 2010 in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona. 
The U.K., with 10 stores, accounted for slightly less than half of our European sales in 2011. Our 2 highest-sales-volume stores in Europe in 2011 were on Old Bond Street in London and on via della Spiga in Milan. We operated 32 stores in Europe at the end of 2011. 
Putting it all together, our solid sales growth contributed to improved sales productivity in 2011 coming from comp store sales growth and the successful results from new stores. Looking at that sales productivity by region, the 247 stores we operated in 21 countries at year end generated total worldwide sales per gross square foot of $3,000 in 2011 versus $2,600 in 2010. 
By region, the Americas generated $2,300 in 2011 versus $2,100 in 2010. Europe generated $3,400 versus $3,000 in 2010. Japan was at $4,100 versus $3,500 in 2010. And the highest productivity continued to be in Asia-Pacific, with $4,700 per gross square foot versus $4,000 in 2010. 
Let's briefly look at other sales, which declined 22% in the fourth quarter. That segment consists primarily of wholesale sales of diamonds and sales to independent third-party distributors of our products, primarily in the Middle East and Russia, and the sales decline reflected lower sales in both components, as we had expected. For the full year, other sales declined 5% as sales growth to independent distributors was more than offset by a decline in wholesale sales of diamonds. 
We recently announced that we have signed a memorandum of understanding with Damas Jewelers to establish a joint venture in the UAE. The JV will give us overall responsibility for 5 existing stores in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and we will soon commence new merchandising and marketing initiatives there to drive sales growth. 
Let's now review some merchandising highlights. While total sales growth decelerated to 8% in the fourth quarter after increasing 24% in the first 9 months of the year, there were some differing patterns by category and price point in some regions. High-end statement jewelry sales softened after experiencing strong growth in the first 3 quarters of 2011. On the other hand, the most resilient category was engagement jewelry, with a very solid increase in the quarter, continuing its strong growth from earlier in the year. Fine and fashion jewelry sales were up modestly in the quarter after strong growth in the first 3 quarters of the year. We are extremely pleased with the continued success of our extraordinary yellow diamond jewelry collection and with its long-term potential. 
We've also seen customers all year attracted to platinum- and diamond-focused products, such as studs and pendants, and to important collections, such as Victoria, Metro and Celebration Rings. There's also been a growing desire for gold jewelry in collections like Return to Tiffany, 1837 and the new Locks Collection, which followed the unprecedented success of the Keys Collection. Conversely, silver jewelry sales have been growing more modestly. 
We were pleased with growth in designer jewelry sales in the quarter that continued our success from earlier in the year. Elsa Peretti's designs had a healthy sales increase, led by the always alluring Diamonds by the Yard collection. Paloma Picasso sales growth was stimulated by her stunning new Venezia Collection, and we are also continuing to be pleased with the sales growth of Tiffany's Leather Collection. 
Product development has always been an important strategy and sales driver at Tiffany's, and you can expect to see a very exciting and eclectic array of new jewelry designs over the coming year. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat McGuiness."

Let's start with gross margin, which at 60.4% in the fourth quarter was 0.5 point lower than the prior year. The downward pressure in the quarter came from higher product cost, a continued shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products that earn a lower gross margin, and a lack of sales leverage on fixed cost. 
For the full year, gross margin of 59% was 0.1 point lower than the prior year. Higher product acquisition costs and shifts in product sales mix were mostly offset by sales leverage on fixed costs. Throughout the year, we have spoken about gross margin pressure from significantly higher cost of precious metals and diamonds, which, in turn, have led to increased retail prices at Tiffany and in the overall jewelry industry. If product input costs stabilize, we would expect less pressure on gross margin in the latter part of 2012, and future pricing actions, if any, would be more modest. For the full year, though, we expect gross margin to be lower than the prior year based on our assumptions for product cost, inventory turnover, sales volume and sales mix. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in the fourth quarter primarily due to growth in store occupancy, labor and marketing costs. In last year's fourth quarter, we recorded $6 million of nonrecurring expenses related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff in June 2011. Excluding that expense, SG&A expenses increased 11% in this fourth quarter, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales would have been 36.3% versus 35.1% last year. For the full year, SG&A expenses rose 18%. This was also primarily due to higher cost for store occupancy, labor and marketing. 
SG&A expenses also included $43 million of nonrecurring expenses in the first half of 2011 related to the headquarters staff relocation. In 2010, we recorded $17 million of those nonrecurring expenses. So excluding nonrecurring expenses in both years, SG&A expenses increased 16% for the year, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved to 38.4% from 39.2% in the prior year. 
We will remind you that the vast majority of our SG&A expenses are relatively fixed, in fact, about 80%. So there's further opportunity to leverage those costs and improve the ratio to sales. For 2012, we believe we have put together a well-controlled and prudent expense plan. Our plan calls for high-single-digit expense growth, which includes increased spending for new stores, labor, occupancy and marketing. Our plan will enable us to improve the expense ratio to sales for the full year. Excluding nonrecurring charges, the improvement will be comparable or better than the 80-basis-point reduction achieved in 2011. The SG&A expense growth in 2012 also factors in higher pension and post-retirement costs due to asset performance and a reduction in the discount rate. 
For the full year, the slight decline in gross margin and the improved SG&A expense ratio gave us an operating margin of 19.4% versus 19.3% last year. However, excluding nonrecurring items, the operating margin was 20.6% versus 19.8% last year. For 2012, the expected decline in gross margin and improvement in the SG&A expense ratio will likely result in the operating margin being unchanged from 2011 to 20.6% excluding the nonrecurring items. 
Other expenses rose to $13 million in the fourth quarter from $11 million last year, while other expenses in the full year declined to $43 million from $47 million due to lower interest expense. We expect other expenses in 2012 to be roughly unchanged from 2011. The effective income tax rate of 34.5% in the fourth quarter was a bit higher than we anticipated, which cost us a few cents per share in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 came in at 34%. That was higher than the 32.7% rate in fiscal 2010, which included benefits from nonrecurring items primarily related to a change in tax status of certain subsidiaries. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% for 2012. 
Adding it all up, net income declined 2% in the fourth quarter to $178 million or $1.39 per diluted share. For the full year, net earnings rose 19% to $439 million or $3.40 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings declined 4% in the fourth quarter but rose 24% in the full year to $3.60 per diluted share. Due to the higher-than-expected effective tax rate, this was at the lower end of the range we had projected when we reported holiday sales results on January 10. The full year net margin rose to 12.1% in 2011 from 11.9% in 2010. Excluding the nonrecurring items, net margin was 12.8% in 2011 versus 12.2% in 2010. 
Whichever way you measure it, Tiffany had a very strong year, and earnings surpassed the healthy objective that we set at the start of 2011. Our return on average equity and return on average assets improved in 2011. ROE was 19% for the full year versus 18% in 2010, while ROA was 11% for the full year versus 10% in 2010. While the improved ROA reflects the strong earnings in 2011, it also reflects a large increase in inventory levels, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
We finished the year with a solid balance sheet that we believe serves as a competitive advantage. Accounts receivable of $184 million at year end was 1% below the prior year end, and receivable turnover remained very high at 20x. Net inventories of $2.1 billion at January 31 were 28% higher than the prior year end, but it's important to look at the components of that increase. 
Finished goods inventories rose 16% in fiscal 2011, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, new stores, product launches and expanded product assortments, including our statement jewelry category.  And the lower-than-expected sales growth in the fourth quarter temporarily inflated year-end inventory levels. It's worth noting that the larger driver of inventory growth was in raw material and work-in-process inventories. Combined, they increased 46% in the year, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, increased internal manufacturing and substantially higher rough and polished diamond purchases. 
For 2012, we are planning for a 15% increase in net inventories, partly due to new stores, expanded product assortments and further vertical integration of our diamond supply chain. The inventory growth also includes a meaningful increase of extraordinary statement jewelry pieces to support the celebration of Tiffany's 175th anniversary over the 2012, 2013 timeframe. 
Capital expenditures were $239 million in 2011 or 7% of sales. This was substantially higher than the $127 million we spent in 2010. The largest single piece of the CapEx increase resulted from the relocation of our New York headquarters staff. We also increased our CapEx by renovating more of our store base, and CapEx also went toward opening 14 stores. Our CapEx budget of $240 million for 2012 reflects both a higher rate of new store openings and an increased number of store renovations. The budgeted amount represents about 6% of sales and is consistent with the long-term plan to spend about 6% to 7% of sales per year. 
As a result of the factors I've cited, Tiffany's 2011 free cash flow, which we define as cash flows from operating activities minus capital expenditures, was an outflow of $29 million. At year end, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $442 million, total short-term and long-term debt was $712 million, and stockholders' equity was $2.3 billion at year end. As a result, the ratio of total debt to equity was 30% at year end compared with 32% at the end of fiscal 2010 and 40% at the end of fiscal 2009. In 2011, we paid off $61 million of maturing long-term debt in Japan. We also entered into a JPY 4 billion or about $50 million one-year credit facility in Japan, which was fully utilized at year end. 
During the year, we continued returning cash to stockholders. We remained active in our share repurchase program in 2011, spending $174 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $66.23 per share. And once again, we increased the quarterly dividend rate on common stock, announcing a 16% increase in May 2011. That represented the 10th dividend increase in 9 years, which has also led to a meaningful increase in the dividend payout ratio over that period. The annual dividend of $1.16 per share represents a payout ratio of 34% on 2011's earnings per share of $3.40. 
Looking to our financial guidance for 2012. We stated in today's news release that we are projecting an approximate 10% increase in worldwide sales in 2012 primarily driven by sales growth in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Our expected 10% worldwide sales increase in dollars equates to a 12% increase on constant exchange rate basis with comp store sales growth of 8%. 
I've already mentioned our full year assumptions for gross margin, SG&A expense growth, other expenses and the effective income tax rate. Bringing it all together, we are projecting net earnings for 2012 in a range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2011 EPS of $3.60 per diluted share, which excluded the nonrecurring items. 
As we noted in today's news release, we expect a large portion of the earnings growth to be weighted toward the fourth quarter. The unusual spread is largely due to our expectation for some continued gross margin pressure in the next few quarters. We also noted in today's release that we are now halfway through the first quarter, and worldwide sales growth is tracking in line with our internal expectation. 
We know there are economic challenges and uncertainty in a number of markets around the world, as evidenced by the fourth quarter results, and we believe we have factored a reasonable degree of caution into our forecast. However, we also continue to take a long-term approach to managing our business and are striving to increase Tiffany's presence and customer base. Our 2012 plan includes making those investments to reap both immediate and longer-term benefits. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski."

I'm glad to be on this call and pleased to say that we achieved, if not exceeded, the objectives we set for 2011. We generated strong sales and earnings growth for the year despite the softness in the fourth quarter, and we continue to build an even stronger platform for future growth. The new stores we opened and the new products we introduced performed well, and we have exciting plans for 2012. Specifically, one of our key initiatives will be the continued expansion of our company-operated worldwide store base. Our plan for 2012 is to open a net of 24 stores, representing a 10% increase in the number of locations. 
In the Americas, we are planning to open 9 stores, comprised of 4 stores in the United States, including a store we are opening this week in Salt Lake City and a store in Manhattan SoHo in September.  We are planning for 2 new stores in Canada, including one we opened last month in at Montréal, and we are planning to open 3 stores in Latin America, with 2 in Mexico and 1 in Rio de Janeiro. 
In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open a net of 7 stores this year, including one store in Bondi Junction, Australia, our sixth in Australia; our second store in Singapore at the airport, which will be our fifth store in Singapore; and a net of 5 stores in China, bringing us to 21 stores in China by year end. Our plans continue to call for expanding our store base to 30 stores in China in the next several years. In Japan, the store total will be unchanged. 
Our plans for Europe call for adding 3 stores this year in Prague, in Nice and in the Berlin airport, which will bring us to 35 European stores by year end and closer to our goal of 50 stores in Europe in the next 5 or so years. 
Our worldwide store expansion plans in 2012 also include adding 5 company-operated stores in the Middle East. Two months ago, we announced our signing of a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint venture in the UAE with Damas Jewelers. Under the JV, Tiffany will soon take on responsibility for merchandising, assortment and pricing, advertising and promotional activities, staffing, store design and visual display and financial services in 5 existing Tiffany company stores, including 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi. We are very excited about converting these stores into company-operated locations and believe there is substantial potential for us to reach a large base of customers who undoubtedly appreciate Tiffany's extraordinary product offerings. Beyond the Middle East, we are also exploring opportunities to expand Tiffany's modest existing presence in Russia and Brazil and to eventually enter India. 
Tiffany's website has been widely recognized for its innovative excellence in the jewelry category. We believe we can enhance the customer experience even further and are working on a comprehensive revamp of the website to launch later in the year, which we expect will generate additional marketing and sales benefits. 
We also have developed an exciting and impactful array of new products to be introduced in 2012. I'm sure you are all aware that Tiffany's 1837 jewelry collection has been an enormous success. To commemorate the year of Tiffany's founding, we are excited about the current launch of the next generation of 1837, with new designs in gold and silver and a significant portion of the collection executed in Tiffany's new RUBEDO metal. RUBEDO is a luminescent blend of copper, silver and gold, which our metallurgists took several years to develop. It has a radiant, innovative glow, and initial customer reception has been very strong. We plan to further expand our assortment of statement jewelry with important pieces, and we'll continue to offer our extraordinary engagement jewelry in a compelling and competitively dominant assortment of styles. 
Beyond engagement and statement jewelry, we have developed a new Enchant Collection for later this year with designs inspired by the natural world in platinum, gold and tanzanite. There will also be new designs featuring pink diamonds, a continued focus and expansion of our very successful Yellow Diamond Collection, additions to our Somerset jewelry collection and new pearl jewelry offerings. And we will debut a new collection of designs inspired by the Art Deco period to coincide with the fourth quarter debut of the movie The Great Gatsby, for which Tiffany has designed the jewelry. We are also currently launching Paloma Picasso's new Villa Paloma collection in gold and silver, inspired by the beauty found in Paloma's favorite gardens around the world. 
Finally, we will continue to build on the strength of our core collections with additions to our very successful Return to Tiffany, Keys, Locks and Charms collections and new additions to our Leather Collection. And of course, you can be certain that we will employ an active marketing program through advertising and print and digital media, public relations and store events to focus on these new designs as well as the wide range of Tiffany classics. 
Supporting our ongoing business and store and product expansion is our strong infrastructure. Tiffany's 2 distribution centers are very effectively handling worldwide store replenishment and direct-to-customer shipments. Very importantly, we have developed excellent product manufacturing and sourcing capabilities. In 2011, we internally manufactured about 60% of Tiffany's merchandise sold. The new jewelry manufacturing facility we opened in Lexington, Kentucky in 2011 gives us additional capacity to complement our facilities in New York and Rhode Island and can support our future growth. 
Tiffany has built an extraordinarily powerful diamond supply chain through relationships with many of the world's diamond producers. Less than 1% of the world's diamonds meet Tiffany quality standards. As we continue to seek global wealth creation in the future, we and others in our industry expect that the worldwide supply of diamonds, especially at our quality levels, keep pace with growing customer demand, and therefore, diamond cost will likely move higher. While we cannot mitigate higher cost, we can feel assured that the diamond supply chain we have developed will enable us to serve our growing customer base with a comprehensive supply of the finest-quality diamonds that they expect from Tiffany. 
The 2012, 2013 period marks the 175th anniversary of Tiffany's founding. Our brand is now globally recognized and admired. 54% of our worldwide sales in 2011 were transacted outside the United States, and the percentage of sales made to non-U.S. customers is even greater if you include the spending by foreign tourists shopping in our U.S. stores. 
Tiffany will continue to grow as the place that customers from around the world come to celebrate life's most important occasions. The Tiffany & Co. brand is flourishing because it represents the finest product quality and craftsmanship, enduring value, a rewarding shopping experience and a bond of trust with consumers. We know that these traits will remain the keys to our future growth and our success. 
We believe we have put together a reasonable and achievable financial plan for 2012 with approximately 10% worldwide sales growth and net earnings growth of 10% to 13%, excluding last year's nonrecurring items. What we accomplish in 2012 should yield benefits for years to come, and we remain committed to our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. 
Thank you for joining us today for our review of Tiffany's results and outlook. I look forward to seeing many of you during the year and updating you on Tiffany's progress. In fact, please note that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on Thursday, May 24. I appreciate your ongoing and growing interest. Here's Mark again."

Now let's proceed. One year ago, we reported broad-based strong financial results for fiscal 2010 with sales up 14% and net earnings from continuing operations up 39%. We are now pleased to also report strong performance for fiscal 2011, with net sales up 18%, net earnings up 19% to $3.40 per diluted share and net earnings excluding nonrecurring items up 24% to $3.60 per diluted share. 
At the same time, we are disappointed that the year finished on a softer note than we initially expected, with fourth quarter sales up 8%, net earnings down 2% and net earnings excluding nonrecurring items down 4%, but that does not diminish our satisfaction from achieving another successful year. And it's worth noting that the $3.60 per diluted share of earnings in 2011 excluding nonrecurring items was above the initial guidance we provided to you one year ago that called for $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share. 
Let's first review some key sales highlights by region for the fourth quarter and full year. Sales in the Americas increased 5% in the fourth quarter, with comp store sales up 3% on top of an 8% comp increase last year. This was a slight improvement from the 4% increase in November, December holiday sales that we had previously reported. The 5% sales increase in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. In fact, while price stratification for the Americas in the fourth quarter indicated continued declines in sales and transactions below $250, it was more than offset by sales growth in most of the higher-priced categories. It was a pretty similar dichotomy for the full year, with the greatest strength in sales over $20,000 and $50,000. 
We believe that the slower sales growth in the Americas in the fourth quarter might have been in varying degrees due to restrained spending by customers employed in the financial sector, which especially affected our sales in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., substantial competitive discounting and particular softness at our entry-level silver jewelry price points that might be tied to some resistance to price increases among other factors. 
Sales in the New York flagship store rose 2% in the quarter, which was a bit better than the 1% decline in the holiday period. The 2% increase was due to higher sales to foreign tourists. The overall Americas region also benefited from higher sales to foreign tourists but also saw increased sales to local customers. Comp store sales in branch stores rose 3%, with growth somewhat skewed toward the western half of the region, which includes continued strong growth in Hawaii and Guam, driven by Japanese tourists. Our stores in Canada and Latin America posted solid sales growth in the quarter.
For the full year, sales in the Americas rose 15% due to an overall increase in the average price per unit sold. Growth in jewelry units sold at higher price points was offset by declines in the silver jewelry category. The Americas region represented 50% of worldwide sales versus 51% in 2010. Americas comps rose 13% in the full year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 20% in 2011 and remained at 8% of worldwide sales. 
In 2011, more than 40% of sales made in the New York flagship store were to foreign tourists versus somewhat less than 40% in 2010. Americas branch store comps rose 11% in 2011 on a constant exchange rate basis due to strong increases in most parts of the U.S. as well as in Canada and Latin America. 
I mentioned that higher foreign tourist spending generated a good portion of the fourth quarter sales growth in the U.S. That reason also applied to the full year. In fact, full year sales to foreign tourists represented an estimated 23% of U.S. sales in 2011 versus 17% and 15% in 2010 and 2009. European, Japanese and Chinese tourists represented roughly similar amounts of that spending in 2011. 
The 5 highest-volume branch stores in the Americas in 2011 included 3 in the U.S. and 2 in Canada, and they are South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, San Francisco and Chicago as well as in Vancouver and on Toronto's Bloor Street. We opened 6 new stores in the Americas in 2011, including one in Richmond, Virginia, a fourth store in Las Vegas in the Fashion Show Mall, a fourth store in the Chicago market in Northbrook, a store in Calgary, a second store in Vancouver in the Oakridge Centre and a third store in Brazil in Brasilia. Their results range from quite good to very strong, and that follows excellent first-year results from the 5 Americas stores we opened in the previous year. 
We finished 2011 with 102 stores in the Americas, including 87 in the U.S., 5 in Canada, 7 in Mexico and 3 in Brazil. Rounding out the Americas are Internet and catalog sales, which declined 4% in the fourth quarter as an increased amount per order was more than offset by a decline in the number of orders shipped. Internet and catalog sales rose 6% in the full year due to increased sales per order and accounted for about 10% of sales in the Americas for the year. We continue to believe that our Internet presence serves the dual purpose of generating online sales and expanding brand awareness, which drives traffic to our stores. We are currently in the process of revamping our website with some exciting enhancements that will debut later this year. 
Tiffany's second-largest region by sales is Asia-Pacific. Sales rose 19% in the fourth quarter due to increased units sold and a smaller increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales for the quarter rose 18% with growth in most countries and especially in Australia, Hong Kong and Macau contributed to a 13% increase in comp store sales. That was on top of a 16% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter and was basically in line with the previously reported November, December sales results. 
For the full year, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 36% due to similar increases in units and in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 31%, and comp store sales rose 27% on top of a 14% comp increase in 2010, with strong increases in most countries.
Asia-Pacific represented 21% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010. Sales in Greater China represented 12 points of the 21%. We have a meaningful opportunity to achieve much higher brand awareness in China, and as we proceed, we should undoubtedly see the benefits through sales growth in China as well as in other markets serving the growing numbers of Chinese tourists. 
During the year, we opened 6 stores in Asia-Pacific, including 3 in Korea, in Seoul, Daegu and Incheon; 2 in China, in Guangzhou and Dong Cheng; and one in Taiwan, in Taichung. And their early results are good. We also did a major renovation and expansion, which doubled the size of our very successful store on Collins Street in Melbourne. We ended 2011 with 58 stores in the Asia-Pacific region. Our 2 largest stores by sales volume in the region are on Canton Road in Hong Kong and in Ngee Ann City in Singapore. 
Now let's turn to Japan. Total sales rose 12% in the fourth quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This was essentially in line with the 13% sales increase in the holiday period. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 5% in the quarter and comps rose 4% on top of a 1% increase last year due to relatively similar growth throughout Japan. 
One year ago this month, we were looking at a sales decline and considerable uncertainty in Japan following the tragic earthquake and tsunami. But our sales growth resumed one month later, demonstrating the enduring value and emotional resonance of our brand combined with the extraordinary efforts of our Tiffany colleagues in Japan. For the year, on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 3% and comparable store sales rose 4%. However, due to the yen strengthening by 10% against the U.S. dollar in 2011, total sales increased 13% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. 
Our flagship store on the Ginza in Tokyo generates the highest volume of our stores in Japan and accounted for 12% of our total retail sales in Japan last year. During 2011, we opened a new store in Hakata and closed 2 locations in Kokura and Wakayama and finished the year with 55 locations in Japan. For the full year, Japan represented 17% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010.
Now let's review performance in Europe. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 3% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This was slightly better than the previously reported holiday sales result. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 3% and comp store sales declined 2% on top of the 16% comp increase on last year's fourth quarter. The 2% comp decline reflected mixed results that range from solid growth in Continental Europe, with the highest growth in Germany and Austria, to a sales decline in the U.K.  
For the full year, sales in Europe increased 17% due to increases in units sold as well as in the average price per unit sold and continue to represent 12% of worldwide sales. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales rose 12% and comp store sales rose 6% on top of an 18% comp increase in 2010. Strong sales growth across Continental Europe surpassed a more modest increase in U.K. sales in the year. We think that softness in London has probably reflected restrained spending by customers in the financial industry, similar to what we've experienced in New York, along with overall challenging economic conditions. 
The vast majority of our European sales are generated by local customers. However, Tiffany stores in Europe also derive a growing benefit from sales to non-European tourists, which we estimate now represent about 1/4 of European sales, with the highest percentage of those sales in Paris. In addition, Tiffany's Internet sales in Europe through websites in 9 countries are also growing very nicely and represented almost 10% of total European sales in 2011.
During the year, we opened 3 stores in Europe, including a second store in Milan, in the Excelsior, which is posting excellent initial results, as well as second stores in both Frankfurt and Zürich, in their airports. And I should add that we've had excellent results from the 2 stores we opened in 2010 in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona. 
The U.K., with 10 stores, accounted for slightly less than half of our European sales in 2011. Our 2 highest-sales-volume stores in Europe in 2011 were on Old Bond Street in London and on via della Spiga in Milan. We operated 32 stores in Europe at the end of 2011. 
Putting it all together, our solid sales growth contributed to improved sales productivity in 2011 coming from comp store sales growth and the successful results from new stores. Looking at that sales productivity by region, the 247 stores we operated in 21 countries at year end generated total worldwide sales per gross square foot of $3,000 in 2011 versus $2,600 in 2010. 
By region, the Americas generated $2,300 in 2011 versus $2,100 in 2010. Europe generated $3,400 versus $3,000 in 2010. Japan was at $4,100 versus $3,500 in 2010. And the highest productivity continued to be in Asia-Pacific, with $4,700 per gross square foot versus $4,000 in 2010. 
Let's briefly look at other sales, which declined 22% in the fourth quarter. That segment consists primarily of wholesale sales of diamonds and sales to independent third-party distributors of our products, primarily in the Middle East and Russia, and the sales decline reflected lower sales in both components, as we had expected. For the full year, other sales declined 5% as sales growth to independent distributors was more than offset by a decline in wholesale sales of diamonds. 
We recently announced that we have signed a memorandum of understanding with Damas Jewelers to establish a joint venture in the UAE. The JV will give us overall responsibility for 5 existing stores in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and we will soon commence new merchandising and marketing initiatives there to drive sales growth. 
Let's now review some merchandising highlights. While total sales growth decelerated to 8% in the fourth quarter after increasing 24% in the first 9 months of the year, there were some differing patterns by category and price point in some regions. High-end statement jewelry sales softened after experiencing strong growth in the first 3 quarters of 2011. On the other hand, the most resilient category was engagement jewelry, with a very solid increase in the quarter, continuing its strong growth from earlier in the year. Fine and fashion jewelry sales were up modestly in the quarter after strong growth in the first 3 quarters of the year. We are extremely pleased with the continued success of our extraordinary yellow diamond jewelry collection and with its long-term potential. 
We've also seen customers all year attracted to platinum- and diamond-focused products, such as studs and pendants, and to important collections, such as Victoria, Metro and Celebration Rings. There's also been a growing desire for gold jewelry in collections like Return to Tiffany, 1837 and the new Locks Collection, which followed the unprecedented success of the Keys Collection. Conversely, silver jewelry sales have been growing more modestly. 
We were pleased with growth in designer jewelry sales in the quarter that continued our success from earlier in the year. Elsa Peretti's designs had a healthy sales increase, led by the always alluring Diamonds by the Yard collection. Paloma Picasso sales growth was stimulated by her stunning new Venezia Collection, and we are also continuing to be pleased with the sales growth of Tiffany's Leather Collection. 
Product development has always been an important strategy and sales driver at Tiffany's, and you can expect to see a very exciting and eclectic array of new jewelry designs over the coming year. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat McGuiness."

The downward pressure in the quarter came from higher product cos",1706,"Thanks, Mark. I will now focus my remarks on the rest of the earnings statement. Let's start with gross margin, which at 60.4% in the fourth quarter was 0.5 point lower than the prior year. The downward pressure in the quarter came from higher product cost, a continued shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products that earn a lower gross margin, and a lack of sales leverage on fixed cost. 
For the full year, gross margin of 59% was 0.1 point lower than the prior year. Higher product acquisition costs and shifts in product sales mix were mostly offset by sales leverage on fixed costs. Throughout the year, we have spoken about gross margin pressure from significantly higher cost of precious metals and diamonds, which, in turn, have led to increased retail prices at Tiffany and in the overall jewelry industry. If product input costs stabilize, we would expect less pressure on gross margin in the latter part of 2012, and future pricing actions, if any, would be more modest. For the full year, though, we expect gross margin to be lower than the prior year based on our assumptions for product cost, inventory turnover, sales volume and sales mix. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in the fourth quarter primarily due to growth in store occupancy, labor and marketing costs. In last year's fourth quarter, we recorded $6 million of nonrecurring expenses related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff in June 2011. Excluding that expense, SG&A expenses increased 11% in this fourth quarter, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales would have been 36.3% versus 35.1% last year. For the full year, SG&A expenses rose 18%. This is also primarily due to higher cost for store occupancy, labor and marketing. 
SG&A expenses also included $43 million of nonrecurring expenses in the first half of 2011 related to the headquarters staff relocation. In 2010, we recorded $17 million of those nonrecurring expenses. So excluding nonrecurring expenses in both years, SG&A expenses increased 16% for the year, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved to 38.4% from 39.2% in the prior year. 
We will remind you that the vast majority of our SG&A expenses are relatively fixed, in fact, about 80%. So there's further opportunity to leverage those costs and improve the ratio to sales. For 2012, we believe we have put together a well-controlled and prudent expense plan. Our plan calls for high-single-digit expense growth, which includes increased spending for new stores, labor, occupancy and marketing. Our plan will enable us to improve the expense ratio to sales for the full year. Excluding nonrecurring charges, the improvement will be comparable or better than the 80-basis-point reduction achieved in 2011. The SG&A expense growth in 2012 also factors in higher pension and post-retirement costs due to asset performance and a reduction in the discount rate. 
For the full year, the slight decline in gross margin and the improved SG&A expense ratio gave us an operating margin of 19.4% versus 19.3% last year. However, excluding nonrecurring items, the operating margin was 20.6% versus 19.8% last year. For 2012, the expected decline in gross margin and improvement in the SG&A expense ratio will likely result in the operating margin being unchanged from 2011 to 20.6% excluding the nonrecurring items. 
Other expenses rose to $13 million in the fourth quarter from $11 million last year, while other expenses in the full year declined to $43 million from $47 million due to lower interest expense. We expect other expenses in 2012 to be roughly unchanged from 2011. The effective income tax rate of 34.5% in the fourth quarter was a bit higher than we anticipated, which cost us a few cents per share in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 came in at 34%. That was higher than the 32.7% rate in fiscal 2010, which included benefits from nonrecurring items primarily related to a change in tax status of certain subsidiaries. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% for 2012. 
Adding it all up, net income declined 2% in the fourth quarter to $178 million or $1.39 per diluted share. For the full year, net earnings rose 19% to $439 million or $3.40 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings declined 4% in the fourth quarter but rose 24% in the full year to $3.60 per diluted share. Due to the higher-than-expected effective tax rate, this was at the lower end of the range we had projected when we reported holiday sales results on January 10. The full year net margin rose to 12.1% in 2011 from 11.9% in 2010. Excluding the nonrecurring items, net margin was 12.8% in 2011 versus 12.2% in 2010. 
Whichever way you measure it, Tiffany had a very strong year, and earnings surpassed the healthy objective that we set at the start of 2011. Our return on average equity and return on average assets improved in 2011. ROE was 19% for the full year versus 18% in 2010, while ROA was 11% for the full year versus 10% in 2010. While the improved ROA reflects the strong earnings in 2011, it also reflects a large increase in inventory levels, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
We finished the year with a solid balance sheet that we believe serves as a competitive advantage. Accounts receivable of $184 million at year end was 1% below the prior year end, and receivable turnover remained very high at 20x. Net inventories of $2.1 billion at January 31 were 28% higher than the prior year end, but it's important to look at the components of that increase. 
Finished goods inventories rose 16% in fiscal 2011, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, new stores, product launches and expanded product assortments, including our statement jewelry category.  And the lower-than-expected sales growth in the fourth quarter temporarily inflated year-end inventory levels. It's worth noting that the larger driver of inventory growth was in raw material and work-in-process inventories. Combined, they increased 46% in the year, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, increased internal manufacturing and substantially higher rough and polished diamond purchases. 
For 2012, we are planning for a 15% increase in net inventories, partly due to new stores, expanded product assortments and further vertical integration of our diamond supply chain. The inventory growth also includes a meaningful increase of extraordinary statement jewelry pieces to support the celebration of Tiffany's 175th anniversary over the 2012, 2013 timeframe. 
Capital expenditures were $239 million in 2011 or 7% of sales. This was substantially higher than the $127 million we spent in 2010. The largest single piece of the CapEx increase resulted from the relocation of our New York headquarters staff. We also increased our CapEx by renovating more of our store base, and CapEx also went toward opening 14 stores. Our CapEx budget of $240 million for 2012 reflects both a higher rate of new store openings and an increased number of store renovations. The budgeted amount represents about 6% of sales and is consistent with the long-term plan to spend about 6% to 7% of sales per year. 
As a result of the factors I've cited, Tiffany's 2011 free cash flow, which we define as cash flows from operating activities minus capital expenditures, was an outflow of $29 million. At year end, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $442 million, total short-term and long-term debt was $712 million, and stockholders' equity was $2.3 billion at year end. As a result, the ratio of total debt to equity was 30% at year end compared with 32% at the end of fiscal 2010 and 40% at the end of fiscal 2009. In 2011, we paid off $61 million of maturing long-term debt in Japan. We also entered into a JPY 4 billion or about $50 million one-year credit facility in Japan, which was fully utilized at year end. 
During the year, we continued returning cash to stockholders. We remained active in our share repurchase program in 2011, spending $174 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $66.23 per share. And once again, we increased the quarterly dividend rate on common stock, announcing a 16% increase in May 2011. That represented the 10th dividend increase in 9 years, which has also led to a meaningful increase in the dividend payout ratio over that period. The annual dividend of $1.16 per share represents a payout ratio of 34% on 2011's earnings per share of $3.40. 
Looking to our financial guidance for 2012. We stated in today's news release that we are projecting an approximate 10% increase in worldwide sales in 2012 primarily driven by sales growth in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Our expected 10% worldwide sales increase in dollars equates to a 12% increase on constant exchange rate basis with comp store sales growth of 8%. 
I've already mentioned our full year assumptions for gross margin, SG&A expense growth, other expenses and the effective income tax rate. Bringing it all together, we are projecting net earnings for 2012 in a range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2011 EPS of $3.60 per diluted share, which excluded the nonrecurring items. 
As we noted in today's news release, we expect a large portion of the earnings growth to be weighted toward the fourth quarter. The unusual spread is largely due to our expectation for some continued gross margin pressure in the next few quarters. We also noted in today's release that we are now halfway through the first quarter, and worldwide sales growth is tracking in line with our internal expectation. 
We know there are economic challenges and uncertainty in a number of markets around the world, as evidenced by the fourth quarter results, and we believe we have factored a reasonable degree of caution into our forecast. However, we also continue to take a long-term approach to managing our business and are striving to increase Tiffany's presence and customer base. Our 2012 plan includes making those investments to reap both immediate and longer-term benefits. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski."

We generated strong sales and earnings growth for the year despite the softness in the fourth quarter, and we continue",1294,"Thanks, Pat and Mark. I'm glad to be on this call and pleased to say that we achieved, if not exceeded, the objectives we set for 2011. We generated strong sales and earnings growth for the year despite the softness in the fourth quarter, and we continue to build an even stronger platform for future growth. The new stores we opened and the new products we introduced performed well, and we have exciting plans for 2012. Specifically, one of our key initiatives will be the continued expansion of our company-operated worldwide store base. Our plan for 2012 is to open a net of 24 stores, representing a 10% increase in the number of locations. 
In the Americas, we are planning to open 9 stores, comprised of 4 stores in the United States, including a store we are opening this week in Salt Lake City and a store in Manhattan SoHo in September.  We are planning for 2 new stores in Canada, including one we opened last month in at Montréal, and we are planning to open 3 stores in Latin America, with 2 in Mexico and 1 in Rio de Janeiro. 
In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open a net of 7 stores this year, including one store in Bondi Junction, Australia, our sixth in Australia; our second store in Singapore at the airport, which will be our fifth store in Singapore; and a net of 5 stores in China, bringing us to 21 stores in China by year end. Our plans continue to call for expanding our store base to 30 stores in China in the next several years. In Japan, the store total will be unchanged. 
Our plans for Europe call for adding 3 stores this year in Prague, in Nice and in the Berlin airport, which will bring us to 35 European stores by year end and closer to our goal of 50 stores in Europe in the next 5 or so years. 
Our worldwide store expansion plans in 2012 also include adding 5 company-operated stores in the Middle East. Two months ago, we announced our signing of a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint venture in the UAE with Damas Jewelers. Under the JV, Tiffany will soon take on responsibility for merchandising, assortment and pricing, advertising and promotional activities, staffing, store design and visual display and financial services in 5 existing Tiffany company stores, including 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi. We are very excited about converting these stores into company-operated locations and believe there is substantial potential for us to reach a large base of customers who undoubtedly appreciates Tiffany's extraordinary product offerings. Beyond the Middle East, we are also exploring opportunities to expand Tiffany's modest existing presence in Russia and Brazil and to eventually enter India. 
Tiffany's website has been widely recognized for its innovative excellence in the jewelry category. We believe we can enhance the customer experience even further and are working on a comprehensive revamp of the website to launch later in the year, which we expect will generate additional marketing and sales benefits. 
We also have developed an exciting and impactful array of new products to be introduced in 2012. I'm sure you are all aware that Tiffany's 1837 jewelry collection has been an enormous success. To commemorate the year of Tiffany's founding, we are excited about the current launch of the next generation of 1837, with new designs in gold and silver and a significant portion of the collection executed in Tiffany's new RUBEDO metal. RUBEDO is a luminescent blend of copper, silver and gold, which our metallurgists took several years to develop. It has a radiant, innovative glow, and initial customer reception has been very strong. We plan to further expand our assortment of statement jewelry with important pieces, and we'll continue to offer our extraordinary engagement jewelry in a compelling and competitively dominant assortment of styles. 
Beyond engagement and statement jewelry, we have developed a new Enchant Collection for later this year with designs inspired by the natural world in platinum, gold and tanzanite. There will also be new designs featuring pink diamonds, a continued focus and expansion of our very successful Yellow Diamond Collection, additions to our Somerset jewelry collection and new pearl jewelry offerings. And we will debut a new collection of designs inspired by the Art Deco period to coincide with the fourth quarter debut of the movie The Great Gatsby, for which Tiffany has designed the jewelry. We are also currently launching Paloma Picasso's new Villa Paloma collection in gold and silver, inspired by the beauty found in Paloma's favorite gardens around the world. 
Finally, we will continue to build on the strength of our core collections with additions to our very successful Return to Tiffany, Keys, Locks and Charms collections and new additions to our Leather Collection. And of course, you can be certain that we will employ an active marketing program through advertising and print and digital media, public relations and store events to focus on these new designs as well as the wide range of Tiffany classics. 
Supporting our ongoing business and store and product expansion is our strong infrastructure. Tiffany's 2 distribution centers are very effectively handling worldwide store replenishment and direct-to-customer shipments. Very importantly, we have developed excellent product manufacturing and sourcing capabilities. In 2011, we internally manufactured about 60% of Tiffany's merchandise sold. The new jewelry manufacturing facility we opened in Lexington, Kentucky in 2011 gives us additional capacity to complement our facilities in New York and Rhode Island and can support our future growth. 
Tiffany has built an extraordinarily powerful diamond supply chain through relationships with many of the world's diamond producers. Less than 1% of the world's diamonds meet Tiffany quality standards. As we continue to seek global wealth creation in the future, we and others in our industry expect that the worldwide supply of diamonds, especially at our quality levels, keep pace with growing customer demand, and therefore, diamond cost will likely move higher. While we cannot mitigate higher cost, we can feel assured that the diamond supply chain we have developed will enable us to serve our growing customer base with a comprehensive supply of the finest-quality diamonds that they expect from Tiffany. 
The 2012, 2013 period marks the 175th anniversary of Tiffany's founding. Our brand is now globally recognized and admired. 54% of our worldwide sales in 2011 were transacted outside the United States, and the percentage of sales made to non-U.S. customers is even greater if you include the spending by foreign tourists shopping in our U.S. stores. 
Tiffany will continue to grow as the place that customers from around the world come to celebrate life's most important occasions. The Tiffany & Co. brand is flourishing because it represents the finest product quality and craftsmanship, enduring value, a rewarding shopping experience and a bond of trust with consumers. We know that these traits will remain the keys to our future growth and our success. 
We believe we have put together a reasonable and achievable financial plan for 2012 with approximately 10% worldwide sales growth and net earnings growth of 10% to 13%, excluding last year's nonrecurring items. What we accomplish in 2012 should yield benefits for years to come, and we remain committed to our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. 
Thank you for joining us today for our review of Tiffany's results and outlook. I look forward to seeing many of you during the year and updating you on Tiffany's progress. In fact, please note that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on Thursday, May 24. I appreciate your ongoing and growing interest. Here's Mark again."

Now let's proceed. The first quarter results we reported this morning were mixed. Total sales growth of 8% was a few percent below our expectation due to softness in April, but you should note that it was on top of a 20% increase in last year's first quarter. The shortfall to our expectation was entirely in the Americas while quarterly sales in Asia-Pacific, Japan and Europe came in pretty much where we expected. 
Gross margin declines in the quarter, which we had anticipated, and SG&A expenses were in line with our expectations. Put it together, our net earnings rose slightly over last year on a GAAP basis but declined slightly when adjusted to exclude nonrecurring costs last year. You should also note that net earnings in last year's first quarter had increased by a strong 26%. 
We had clearly communicated 2 months ago that we expected only minimal EPS growth when adjusted in the first quarter, and that we anticipated that most of the expected annual increase in 2012 would occur in the fourth quarter. Pat will address our new annual outlook in his remarks. 
Let's begin the sales review by looking at the Americas where total sales rose 3% in the quarter. The increase was due to a higher average price per unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales also rose 3%, and comps were equal to last year due to a 1% increase in brand store comps with no meaningful geographical differences by region except for strength in our Pacific market and a 4% decline in New York flagship store sales. 
In last year's first quarter, Americas comps had increased 17% due to a 15% increase in brand store comps and a 23% increase in New York flagship store sales. In any case, both the brand stores and New York comps trailed our expectations. We believe that our performance in the U.S. while disappointing to us is also reflective of data published by MasterCard spending polls for the high-end segment of the U.S. jewelry industry. 
On our last call, we identified a number of factors that we believed affected sales in the Americas ranging from restrained spending by customers employed in the financial sector to substantial competitive discounting, which we believe has continued to particular softness in entry-level silver jewelry price points tied to resistance to price increases. We think those factors are all still relevant. 
In addition, the first quarter finished on a softer note that we attribute to difficult year-over-year comparison to strong growth in April 2011, which may have been related to at least some degree to the timing of Mother's Day, which occurred on May 8 last year and May 13 this year. In terms of customer mix, it was higher foreign tourist spending that drove the modest Americas sales increase in the quarter versus suspending by domestic customers. In fact, our stores in Hawaii and Guam saw the largest increase. 
Conversely, we noted that foreign tourist spending in the New York flagship store was equally to the prior year as increased sales to Asian visitors were offset by lower sales to European and other tourists. In the Americas region beyond the U.S., sales were up in Canada, and we had strong sales growth in Mexico where we had 8 stores and Brazil with our 3 stores. We added 3 stores in the Americas in the first quarter, including one in the newly opened City Creek Center in Salt Lake City, one in Montréal in the Ritz Carlton hotel and one in Mexico in the Palazio department store. Six more stores in the Americas are planned for later this year. 
Lastly, combined e-commerce and catalog sales in the Americas rose 1% in the quarter due to an increase in the average sales per order. The increase was slightly below our expectation but came on top of a 14% increase last year. 
Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, which posted a solid 17% sales increase in the first quarter that was virtually in line with our expectation and was mostly due to increased unit volume, as well as some increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 16% with double-digit sales increases in most countries. Local currency comp store sales rose 10% despite going up against the substantial 26% increase last year. 
While we acknowledge that sales growth trends in China for Tiffany, as well as others in the luxury industry have decelerated from the extraordinarily strong rates last year due to both difficult comparisons and some softening in economic growth, we certainly remain enthusiastic about Tiffany's long-term sales growth potential with that important consumer segment. 
During the quarter, we opened our 17th store in China in Wuhan and are planning to add 7 additional Asia-Pacific stores later in the year. 
Turning to Japan. Total sales rose 15% in the first quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, as well as a decent increase in unit volume. Excluding the translation effect of the yen, which was 2% stronger than a year ago, total sales in yen rose 13% in the quarter, and comp store sales rose 12%, which exceeded our expectation. 
In last year's first quarter, we were affected by the tragic earthquake and tsunami, which led to a temporary drop in sales in March and a 3% comp decline for the quarter. Sales growth had resumed a month later, and it has continued to increase since then. And the 12% comp growth in the quarter reflected healthy increases across Japan although with somewhat greater strength in the Tokyo region. 
During the quarter, we relocated one of our stores from within one department store to another in Tokyo's Shinjuku District, but the total number of stores we operate in Japan remained at 55. Economic conditions in Europe are obviously less than ideal, but we achieved a somewhat better-than-expected 3% sales increase in the quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total European sales rose 7%, and comps were equal to the prior year, which was on top of a 15% comp increase from last year's first quarter. 
Geographically, the unchanged comp in the quarter was equally reflective of both the U.K. and overall Continental Europe. Actually, the strongest sales growth was in Germany. While in London, the softest store not surprising to us was in the Royal Exchange in the city, which caters to customers employed in the financial industry. The European store count remained at 32 in the quarter. 
Rounding out the sales review is other sales, which declined 14% in the quarter due to lower wholesale sales to independent distributors as we prepare to commence operations of stores in the UAE. We are pleased to have finalized our joint venture agreement with Damas Jewelers, and through that JV, we'll assume operating control of the 5 Tiffany stores in Abu Dhabi and Dubai later in the second quarter. 
That covers the sales review by segment. On a worldwide basis, our price stratification analysis in the first quarter indicated no meaningful differences in rates of sales growth by price point. From a global merchandising perspective, there were a few highlights worth mentioning. We continue to achieve a healthy increase in engagement jewelry sales. Growth in fine and fashion jewelry sales reflected the enormous appeal of our Yellow Diamond Collection, as well as the popularity of gold jewelry, and we're very pleased with initial customer reaction to our recently updated 1837 collection, which showcases the new RUBEDO metal. 
Growth in designer jewelry sales reflected the success of Paloma Picasso's designs, including her new Villa Paloma and her Venezia Collection. And beyond jewelry, we're pleased with the sales momentum of our leather goods collection. There are additional introduction in the pipeline for later in the year. 
That wraps up the sales review. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat."
35576,206255409,313058,"Tiffany & Co., Q1 2013 Earnings Call, May 24, 2012",2012-05-24,"Earnings Calls","Tiffany & Co.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. As you just heard, first quarter sales mostly in the Americas were a bit below what we had initially expected. As a result, we have adjusted our expectation for the next couple of quarters. It probably goes without saying, but those sales",1410,"Thank you, Mark. As you just heard, first quarter sales mostly in the Americas were a bit below what we had initially expected. As a result, we have adjusted our expectation for the next couple of quarters. It probably goes without saying, but those sales results certainly do not affect any of our exciting plans for store expansion, product launches worthy pursuit of market share growth opportunities in 2012. 
Looking at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin declined by 1 point in the quarter to 57.3%. The decline was based on higher product acquisition cost from last year as we had expected and previously communicated. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 9% in the quarter. Excluding roughly $8 million of nonrecurring cost in last year's first quarter related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff, SG&A expenses rose 11% year-over-year due to higher labor, occupancy and marketing spending, all of which resulted in an increase in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales. 
Other expenses net of $10.5 million in the quarter were virtually unchanged from the prior year, and the effective tax rate in the quarter came in as expected at 34.5% versus 35.6% last year. Adding it up, net earnings rose 1% in the quarter. However, excluding last year's nonrecurring costs, net earnings declined 5% versus our expectation for a slight increase due to the sales shortfall in the Americas. 
Looking at our balance sheet. Accounts receivable are in good shape increasing 3% at April 30 from a year ago with receivables turning at 20x per year. The more significant use of working capital has been in net inventories, which in April 30 were 27% higher than a year ago. Part of that overall increase was due to higher product acquisition costs. In addition, the 16% year-over-year increase in finished goods was due to store openings and expanded product assortment, and of course, some effects from the softer-than-expected sales growth. The large increase in inventories was in raw material and work-in-process, up 44% year-over-year due to the continued expansion of our rough diamond supply chain and internal jewelry manufacturing. We now expect net inventory growth of about 10% for the full year versus 15% previously as we make adjustments tied to our lower sales expectations. 
Capital expenditures of $44 million were modestly lower than the $52 million a year ago. We bought back some of our shares during the first quarter, spending $46 million to purchase approximately 700,000 shares at an average cost of $66.42 per share. As a result of that various spending, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $343 million at April 30 and was lower than a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt of $834 million was higher than a year ago and represented 35% of stockholders' equity. 
We continue to achieve solid returns on assets and equity with ROA running at 11% and ROE at 19% through the first quarter. And we were pleased that Tiffany's Board of Directors last week approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate. That represented the 11th dividend increase in the past decade. 
Before turning to our financial outlook for the rest of the year, I want to make sure you are all aware of the disclosure we made in our report on Form 8-K filed yesterday with the SEC regarding the potential acquisition of Elsa Peretti's intellectual property rights. Please see the 8-K filing on our website for more details. 
Now let's review our full year outlook. We indicated in today's news release that the sales in the first few weeks of the second quarter are increasing by a low single-digit percentage. We are experiencing the difficult comparisons to extremely strong growth at this time last year especially in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, as well as decelerating rates of economic growth in a number of countries that are affecting our results. 
Based on results in the first quarter and revisions we have made from our initial outlook for the second and third quarters, we are now expecting full year worldwide sales to increase about 7% to 8% for 2012 versus our previous 10% objective with the strongest growth occurring in the Asia-Pacific region. Our plans call for adding 24 Tiffany stores this year, and as you heard, we opened 4 in the first quarter. 
For the rest of the year, the 20 stores plans include 6 additional stores in the Americas with leases finalized for a store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, a store in Rio de Janeiro and a store on Altavista Street in the south area of Mexico City. We have 7 stores scheduled to open in Asia-Pacific with leases finalized for a store in Bondi Junction, Australia and a second store in Singapore's Changi Airport. We'll have 2 additional stores in Europe with a store in Nice opening tomorrow and a store in Prague opening later this year. A store planned to open in the Berlin airport is now delayed until early 2013 due to airport construction delays. And we will soon begin to operate the 5 stores in the UAE in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. 
We have a strong lineup of product introductions planned for this year in a wide range of material and price points, including an Art Deco jewelry collection tied to the launch of The Great Gatsby movie and Tiffany's new Enchant jewelry collection with the designs inspired by the natural world and platinum, gold and tanzanite. Those and other introductions will receive strong marketing support, both in print and digital media to create awareness among customers. 
We now expect the operating margin for the full year to be modestly lower than last year's 20.6%, which had excluded nonrecurring items. We expect SG&A expense growth after excluding the nonrecurring cost from last year to be somewhat below sales growth leading to an improvement of perhaps a 0.5 point in the ratio of G&A expenses to sales but be more than offset by a decline in gross margin. We are pleased to see precious metal and diamond stabilizing in recent months, which if it continues should bode well for gross margin by the fourth quarter and into next year but not before then. 
We are not currently anticipating taking any meaningful price increases for the rest of the year. Also related to gross margin, I'm pleased to say that our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are operating efficiently to support our product needs in our stores and shipping to customers. We believe we have sufficient room to leverage that infrastructure capacity and receive a margin benefit based on achieving solid sales growth. 
Therefore, we now expect earnings for the year to increase to a range of $3.70 to $3.80, with all of the year-over-year growth coming in the fourth quarter. Our current expectation calls for earnings declines in the second and third quarters. You should also note that of this $0.25 per share decrease in our full year guidance, approximately $0.20 is related to a reduction in our operating expectations while $0.05 is tied to the expected cost of additional debt for working capital, repayment of maturing debt and general corporate purposes. 
Our initial sales plans, primarily for the Americas but also for Asia-Pacific, did not factor in enough of the difficult year-over-year comparisons, as well as more recently the economic conditions in sales trends that have softened in some markets in Asia-Pacific and elsewhere. We believe those conditions may remain soft for the next couple of quarters. 
As a reminder, local currency comp store sales in the second and third quarters of last year had increased 23% and 15%, respectively, in the Americas and 41% and 36%, respectively, in Asia-Pacific. The adjustments we've made in our new sales outlook take into account soft macro conditions and those difficult year-over-year comparisons in the next 2 quarters. 
Despite the challenges we are addressing in 2012, I want to emphasize that we remain committed to our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. We believe that our company now in it's 175th year is better positioned than ever to achieve greater prominence in our industry.

Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Now let's proceed. The first quarter results we reported this morning were mixed. Total sales growth of 8% was a few percent below our expectation due to softness in April, but you should note that it was on top of a 20% increase on last year's first quarter. The shortfall to our expectation was entirely in the Americas while quarterly sales in Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe came in pretty much where we expected. 
Gross margin declined in the quarter, which we had anticipated, and SG&A expenses were in line with our expectation. Put it together and net earnings rose slightly over last year on a GAAP basis but declined slightly when adjusted to exclude nonrecurring costs last year. You should also note that net earnings in last year's first quarter had increased by a strong 26%. 
We had clearly communicated 2 months ago that we expected only minimal EPS growth when adjusted in the first quarter, and that we anticipated that most of the expected annual increase in 2012 would occur in the fourth quarter. Pat will address our new annual outlook in his remarks. 
Let's begin the sales review by looking at the Americas, where total sales rose 3% in the quarter. The increase was due to a higher average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales also rose 3%, and comps were equal to last year due to a 1% increase in brand store comps, with no meaningful geographical differences by region except for strength in our Pacific market and a 4% decline in New York flagship store sales. 
In last year's first quarter, Americas comps had increased 17% due to a 15% increase in brand store comp and a 23% increase in New York flagship store sales. In any case, both the brand stores and New York comps trailed our expectations. We believe that our performance in the U.S., while disappointing to us, is also reflective of data published by MasterCard spending poll for the high-end segment of the U.S. jewelry industry. 
On our last call, we identified a number of factors that we believed affected sales in the Americas, ranging from restrained spending by customers employed in the financial sector to substantial competitive discounting, which we believe has continued, to particular softness in entry-level silver jewelry price points tied to resistance to price increases. We think those factors are all still relevant. 
In addition, the first quarter finished on a softer note that we attribute to difficult year-over-year comparison to strong growth in April 2011, which may have been related to at least some degree to the timing of Mother's Day, which occurred on May 8 last year and May 13 this year. 
In terms of customer mix, it was higher foreign tourist spending that drove the modest Americas sales increase in the quarter versus suspending by domestic customers. In fact, our stores in Hawaii and Guam saw the largest increase. Conversely, we noted that foreign tourist spending in the New York flagship store was equal to the prior year, as increased sales to Asian visitors were offset by lower sales to Europeans and other tourists. 
In the Americas region beyond the U.S., sales were up in Canada and we had strong sales growth in Mexico, where we have 8 stores, and Brazil, with our 3 stores. We added 3 stores in the Americas in the first quarter, including one in the newly opened City Creek Center in Salt Lake City, one in Montréal in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and one in Mexico in the Palacio De Hierro's Interlomas department store. Six more stores in the Americas are planned for later this year. 
Lastly, combined e-commerce and catalog sales in the Americas rose 1% in the quarter due to an increase in the average sales per order. The increase was slightly below our expectation but came on top of a 14% increase last year. 
Let's now turn to the Asia Pacific region, which posted a solid 17% sales increase in the first quarter that was virtually in line with our expectation and was mostly due to increased unit volume, as well as some increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 16% with double-digit sales increases in most countries. Local currency comp store sales rose 10%, despite going up against a substantial 26% increase last year. 
While we acknowledge that sales growth trends in China for Tiffany, as well as others in the luxury industry, have decelerated from the extraordinarily strong rates last year, due to both difficult comparisons and some softening in economic growth, we certainly remain enthusiastic about Tiffany's long-term sales growth potential with that important consumer segment. During the quarter, we opened our 17th store in China in Wuhan and are planning to add 7 additional Asia Pacific stores later in the year. 
Turning to Japan. Total sales rose 15% in the first quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, as well as a decent increase in unit volume. Excluding the translation effect of the yen, which was 2% stronger than a year ago, total sales in yen rose 13% in the quarter and comp store sales rose 12%, which exceeded our expectation. 
In last year's first quarter, we were affected by the tragic earthquake and tsunami, which led to a temporary drop in sales in March and a 3% comp decline for the quarter. Sales growth had resumed a month later, and it has continued to increase since then. And the 12% comp growth in the quarter reflected healthy increases across Japan, although with somewhat greater strength in the Tokyo region. 
During the quarter, we relocated one of our stores from within one department store to another in Tokyo's Shinjuku district, but the total number of stores we operate in Japan remained at 55. 
Economic conditions in Europe are obviously less than ideal, but we achieved a somewhat better-than-expected 3% sales increase in the quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales rose 7% and comps were equal to the prior year, which was on top of a 15% comp increase from last year's first quarter. 
Geographically, the unchanged comp in the quarter was equally reflective of both the U.K. and overall continental Europe. Actually, the strongest sales growth was in Germany while in London, the softest store, not surprising to us, was in the Royal Exchange in the city, which caters to customers employed in the financial industry. The European store count remained at 32 in the quarter. 
Rounding out the sales review is other sales, which declined 14% in the quarter due to lower wholesale sales to independent distributors, as we prepare to commence operations of stores in the UAE. We are pleased to have finalized our joint venture agreement with Damas Jewellery, and through that JV, we'll assume operating control of the 5 Tiffany stores in Abu Dhabi and Dubai later in the second quarter. 
That covers the sales review by segment. On a worldwide basis, our price stratification analysis in the first quarter indicated no meaningful differences in rates of sales growth by price points. 
From a global merchandising perspective, there were a few highlights worth mentioning. We continue to achieve a healthy increase in engagement jewelry sales. Growth in fine and fashion jewelry sales reflected the enormous appeal of our Yellow Diamond Collection, as well as the popularity of gold jewelry. And we're very pleased with initial customer reaction to our recently updated 1837 collection, which showcases the new RUBEDO metal. Growth in designer jewelry sales reflected the success of Paloma Picasso's designs, including her new Villa Paloma and her Venezia Collection. 
And beyond jewelry, we're pleased with the sales momentum of our leather goods collections. There are additional introduction to the pipeline for later in the year. 
That wraps up the sales review. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat."

As a result, we have adjusted our expectation for the next couple of quarters. It probably goes without saying, but those sales results certainly do not affect any of our exciting plans for store expansion, product launches or the pursuit of market share growth opportunities in 2012. 
Looking at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin declined by 1 point in the quarter to 57.3%. The decline was based on higher product acquisition costs from last year, as we had expected and previously communicated. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 9% in the quarter. Excluding roughly $8 million of nonrecurring costs in last year's first quarter related to the relocation of our New York headquarter staff, SG&A expenses rose 11% year-over-year due to higher labor, occupancy and marketing spending, all of which resulted in an increase in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales. 
Other expenses, net of $10.5 million in the quarter, were virtually unchanged from the prior year, and the effective tax rate in the quarter came in as expected at 34.5% versus 35.6% last year. Adding it up, net earnings rose 1% in the quarter. However, excluding last year's nonrecurring costs, net earnings declined 5% versus our expectation for a slight increase, due to the sales shortfall in the Americas. 
Looking at our balance sheet. Accounts receivable are in good shape, increasing 3% at April 30 from a year ago, with receivables turning at 20x per year. 
The more significant use of working capital has been in net inventories, which, in April 30, were 27% higher than a year ago. Part of that overall increase was due to higher product acquisition costs. In addition, the 16% year-over-year increase in finished goods was due to store openings and expanded product assortment, and of course, some effects from the softer-than-expected sales growth. The larger increase in inventories was in raw material and work in process, up 44% year-over-year, due to the continued expansion of our rough diamond supply chain and internal jewelry manufacturing. We now expect net inventory growth of about 10% for the full year versus 15% previously, as we make adjustments tied to our lower sales expectations. 
Capital expenditures of $44 million were modestly lower than the $52 million a year ago. We bought back some of our shares during the first quarter, spending $46 million to purchase approximately 700,000 shares at an average cost of $66.42 per share. 
As a result of that various spending, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $343 million at April 30 and was lower than a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt of $834 million was higher than a year ago and represented 35% of stockholders' equity. 
We continue to achieve solid returns on assets and equity with ROA running at 11% and ROE at 19% through the first quarter, and we were pleased that Tiffany's Board of Directors last week approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate. That represented the 11th dividend increase in the past decade. 
Before turning to our financial outlook for the rest of the year, I want to make sure you are all aware of the disclosure we made in our report on Form 8-K filed yesterday with the SEC regarding the potential acquisition of Elsa Peretti's intellectual property rights. Please see the 8-K filing on our website for more details. 
Now let's review our full year outlook. We indicated in today's news release that the sales in the first few weeks of the second quarter are increasing by a low single-digit percentage. We are experiencing the difficult comparisons to extremely strong growth at this time last year, especially in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, as well as decelerating rates of economic growth in a number of countries that are affecting our results. 
Based on results in the first quarter and revisions we have made from our initial outlook for the second and third quarters, we are now expecting full year worldwide sales to increase about 7% to 8% for 2012 versus our previous 10% objective, with the strongest growth occurring in the Asia Pacific region. 
Our plans call for adding 24 Tiffany stores this year, and as you heard, we opened 4 in the first quarter. For the rest of the year, the 20 stores plan include 6 additional stores in the Americas, with leases finalized for a store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, a store in Rio de Janeiro and a store on Altavista Street in the south area of Mexico City. We have 7 stores scheduled to open in Asia Pacific, with leases finalized for a store in Bondi Junction, Australia and a second store in Singapore's Changi Airport. We'll have 2 additional stores in Europe, with a store in Nice opening tomorrow and a store in Prague opening later this year. A store planned to open in the Berlin airport is now delayed until early 2013 due to airport construction delays. And we will soon begin to operate the 5 stores in the UAE, in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. 
We have a strong lineup of product introductions planned for this year in a wide range of materials and price points, including an Art Deco jewelry collection, tied to the launch of The Great Gatsby movie, and Tiffany's new Enchant jewelry collection, with the designs inspired by the natural world in platinum, gold and tanzanite. Those and other introductions will receive strong marketing support, both in print and digital media, to create awareness among customers. 
We now expect the operating margin for the full year to be modestly lower than last year's 20.6%, which had excluded nonrecurring items. We expect SG&A expense growth, after excluding the nonrecurring costs from last year, to be somewhat below sales growth, leading to an improvement of perhaps a 0.5 point in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales, but being more than offset by a decline in gross margin. 
We are pleased to see precious metal and diamond costs stabilizing in recent months, which, if it continues, should bode well for gross margin by the fourth quarter and into next year, but not before then. We are not currently anticipating taking any meaningful price increases for the rest of the year. 
Also related to gross margins, I'm pleased to say that our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are operating efficiently to support our product needs in our stores and shipping to customers. We believe we have sufficient room to leverage that infrastructure capacity and receive a margin benefit based on achieving solid sales growth. 
Therefore, we now expect earnings for the year to increase to a range of $3.70 to $3.80, with all of the year-over-year growth coming in the fourth quarter. Our current expectation calls for earnings declines in the second and third quarters. You should also note that of this $0.25 per share decrease in our full year guidance, approximately $0.20 is related to a reduction in our operating expectations while $0.05 is tied to the expected cost of additional debt incurred for working capital, repayment of maturing debt and general corporate purposes. 
Our initial sales plan, primarily for the Americas, but also for Asia Pacific, did not factor in enough of the difficult year-over-year comparisons, as well as, more recently, the economic conditions in sales trends that have softened in some markets in Asia Pacific and elsewhere. We believe those conditions may remain soft for the next couple of quarters. 
As a reminder, local currency comp store sales in the second and third quarters of last year had increased 23% and 15%, respectively, in the Americas and 41% and 36%, respectively, in Asia Pacific. The adjustments we've made in our new sales outlook take into account soft macro conditions and those difficult year-over-year comparisons in the next 2 quarters. 
Despite the challenges we are addressing in 2012, I want to emphasize that we remain committed to our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by, at least, 15% per year. We believe that our company, now in its 175th year, is better positioned than ever to achieve greater prominence in our industry.

Capital expenditures of $44 million were modestly lower than the $52 million a year ago. We bought back some of our shares during the first quarter, spending $46 million to purchase approximately 700,000 shares at an average cost of $66.42 per share. As a result of that various spending, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $343 million at April 30 and was lower than a year ago. 
Total short-term and long-term debt of $834 million was higher than a year ago and represented 35% of stockholders' equity. We continue to achieve solid returns on assets and equity with ROA running at 11% and ROE at 19% through the first quarter, and we were pleased that Tiffany's Board of Directors last week approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate. That represented the 11th dividend increase in the past decade. 
Before turning to our financial outlook for the rest of the year, I want to make sure you are all aware of the disclosure we made in our report on Form 8-K filed yesterday with the SEC regarding the potential acquisition of Elsa Peretti's intellectual property rights. Please see the 8-K filing on our website for more details. 
Now let's review our full year outlook. We indicated in today's news release that the sales in the first few weeks of the second quarter are increasing by a low single-digit percentage. We are experiencing the difficult comparisons to extremely strong growth at this time last year, especially in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, as well as decelerating rates of economic growth in a number of countries that are affecting our results. 
Based on results in the first quarter and revisions we have made from our initial outlook for the second and third quarters, we are now expecting full year worldwide sales to increase about 7% to 8% for 2012 versus our previous 10% objective, with the strongest growth occurring in the Asia Pacific region. 
Our plans call for adding 24 Tiffany stores this year, and as you heard, we opened 4 in the first quarter. For the rest of the year, the 20 stores plan includes 6 additional stores in the Americas, with leases finalized for a store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, a store in Rio de Janeiro and a store on Altavista Street in the south area of Mexico City. We have 7 stores scheduled to open in Asia Pacific, with leases finalized for a store in Bondi Junction, Australia and a second store in Singapore's Changi Airport. 
We'll have 2 additional stores in Europe, with a store in Nice opening tomorrow and a store in Prague opening later this year. A store planned to open in the Berlin airport is now delayed until early 2013 due to airport construction delays. And we will soon begin to operate the 5 stores in the UAE, in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. 
We have a strong lineup of product introductions planned for this year in a wide range of materials and price points, including an Art Deco jewelry collection, tied to the launch of The Great Gatsby movie, and Tiffany's new Enchant jewelry collection, with the designs inspired by the natural world in platinum, gold and tanzanite. Those and other introductions will receive strong marketing support, both in print and digital media, to create awareness among customers. 
We now expect the operating margin for the full year to be modestly lower than last year's 20.6%, which had excluded nonrecurring items. We expect SG&A expense growth, after excluding the nonrecurring costs from last year, to be somewhat below sales growth, leading to an improvement of perhaps a 0.5 point in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales, but being more than offset by a decline in gross margin. 
We are pleased to see precious metal and diamond costs stabilizing in recent months, which, if it continues, should bode well for gross margin by the fourth quarter and into next year, but not before then. We are not currently anticipating taking any meaningful price increases for the rest of the year. 
Also related to gross margins, I'm pleased to say that our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are operating efficiently to support our product needs in our stores and shipping to customers. We believe we have sufficient room to leverage that infrastructure capacity and receive a margin benefit based on achieving solid sales growth. 
Therefore, we now expect earnings for the year to increase to a range of $3.70 to $3.80, with all of the year-over-year growth coming in the fourth quarter. Our current expectation calls for earnings declines in the second and third quarters. You should also note that of this $0.25 per share decrease in our full year guidance, approximately $0.20 is related to a reduction in our operating expectations while $0.05 is tied to the expected cost of additional debt incurred for working capital, repayment of maturing debt and general corporate purposes. 
Our initial sales plan, primarily for the Americas, but also for Asia Pacific, did not factor in enough of the difficult year-over-year comparisons, as well as, more recently, the economic conditions in sales trends that have softened in some markets in Asia Pacific and elsewhere. We believe those conditions may remain soft for the next couple of quarters. 
As a reminder, local currency comp store sales in the second and third quarters of last year had increased 23% and 15%, respectively, in the Americas and 41% and 36%, respectively, in Asia Pacific. The adjustments we've made in our new sales outlook take into account soft macro conditions and those difficult year-over-year comparisons in the next 2 quarters. 
Despite the challenges we are addressing in 2012, I want to emphasize that we remain committed to our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. We believe that our company, now in its 175th year, is better positioned than ever to achieve greater prominence in our industry. 
Thank you for listening to today's conference call. Please call Mark with any questions, and also note that we expect to report Tiffany's second quarter results on Monday, August 27. Here's Mark to close the call."

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now let's proceed. 
The first quarter results we reported this morning were mixed. Total sales growth of 8% was a few percent below our expectation due to softness in April, but you should note that it was on top of a 20% increase on last year's first quarter. The shortfall to our expectation was entirely in the Americas while quarterly sales in Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe came in pretty much where we expected. 
Gross margin declined in the quarter, which we had anticipated, and SG&A expenses were in line with our expectation. Put it together and net earnings rose slightly over last year on a GAAP basis but declined slightly when adjusted to exclude nonrecurring costs last year. You should also note that net earnings in last year's first quarter had increased by a strong 26%. 
We had clearly communicated 2 months ago that we expected only minimal EPS growth when adjusted in the first quarter, and that we anticipated that most of the expected annual increase in 2012 would occur in the fourth quarter. Pat will address our new annual outlook in his remarks. 
Let's begin the sales review by looking at the Americas, where total sales rose 3% in the quarter. The increase was due to a higher average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales also rose 3%, and comps were equal to last year due to a 1% increase in brand store comps, with no meaningful geographical differences by region except for strength in our Pacific market and a 4% decline in New York flagship store sales. 
In last year's first quarter, Americas comps had increased 17% due to a 15% increase in brand store comp and a 23% increase in New York flagship store sales. In any case, both the brand stores and New York comps trailed our expectations. 
We believe that our performance in the U.S., while disappointing to us, is also reflective of data published by MasterCard spending polls for the high-end segment of the U.S. jewelry industry. 
On our last call, we identified a number of factors that we believed affected sales in the Americas, ranging from restrained spending by customers employed in the financial sector to substantial competitive discounting, which we believe has continued, to particular softness in entry-level silver jewelry price points tied to resistance to price increases. We think those factors are all still relevant. 
In addition, the first quarter finished on a softer note that we attribute to a difficult year-over-year comparison to strong growth in April 2011, which may have been related to at least some degree to the timing of Mother's Day, which occurred on May 8 last year and May 13 this year.
In terms of customer mix, it was higher foreign tourist spending that drove the modest Americas sales increase in the quarter versus suspending by domestic customers. In fact, our stores in Hawaii and Guam saw the largest increase. Conversely, we noted that foreign tourist spending in the New York flagship store was equal to the prior year, as increased sales to Asian visitors were offset by lower sales to Europeans and other tourists. 
In the Americas region beyond the U.S., sales were up in Canada and we had strong sales growth in Mexico, where we have 8 stores, and Brazil, with our 3 stores. We added 3 stores in the Americas in the first quarter, including one in the newly opened City Creek Center in Salt Lake City, one in Montréal in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and one in Mexico in the Palacio De Hierro's Interlomas department store. Six more stores in the Americas are planned for later this year. 
Lastly, combined e-commerce and catalog sales in the Americas rose 1% in the quarter due to an increase in the average sales per order. The increase was slightly below our expectation but came on top of a 14% increase last year. 
Let's now turn to the Asia Pacific region, which posted a solid 17% sales increase in the first quarter that was virtually in line with our expectation and was mostly due to increased unit volume, as well as some increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 16% with double-digit sales increases in most countries. Local currency comp store sales rose 10%, despite going up against a substantial 26% increase last year. 
While we acknowledge that sales growth trends in China for Tiffany, as well as others in the luxury industry, have decelerated from the extraordinarily strong rates last year, due to both difficult comparisons and some softening in economic growth, we certainly remain enthusiastic about Tiffany's long-term sales growth potential with that important consumer segment. During the quarter, we opened our 17th store in China in Wuhan and are planning to add 7 additional Asia Pacific stores later in the year. 
Turning to Japan. Total sales rose 15% in the first quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold, as well as a decent increase in unit volume. Excluding the translation effect of the yen, which was 2% stronger than a year ago, total sales in yen rose 13% in the quarter and comp store sales rose 12%, which exceeded our expectation. 
In last year's first quarter, we were affected by the tragic earthquake and tsunami, which led to a temporary drop in sales in March and a 3% comp decline for the quarter. Sales growth had resumed a month later, and it has continued to increase since then. And the 12% comp growth in the quarter reflected healthy increases across Japan, although with somewhat greater strength in the Tokyo region. During the quarter, we relocated one of our stores from within one department store to another in Tokyo's Shinjuku district, but the total number of stores we operate in Japan remained at 55. 
Economic conditions in Europe are obviously less than ideal, but we achieved a somewhat better-than-expected 3% sales increase in the quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales rose 7% and comps were equal to the prior year, which was on top of a 15% comp increase in last year's first quarter. 
Geographically, the unchanged comp in the quarter was equally reflective of both the U.K. and overall continental Europe. Actually, the strongest sales growth was in Germany while in London, the softest store, not surprising to us, was in the Royal Exchange in the city, which caters to customers employed in the financial industry. The European store count remained at 32 in the quarter. 
Rounding out the sales review is other sales, which declined 14% in the quarter due to lower wholesale sales to independent distributors, as we prepare to commence operations of stores in the UAE. We are pleased to have finalized our joint venture agreement with Damas Jewellery, and through that JV, we'll assume operating control of the 5 Tiffany stores in Abu Dhabi and Dubai later in the second quarter. 
That covers the sales review by segment. On a worldwide basis, our price stratification analysis in the first quarter indicated no meaningful differences in rates of sales growth by price point. From a global merchandising perspective, there were a few highlights worth mentioning. 
We continue to achieve a healthy increase in engagement jewelry sales. Growth in fine and fashion jewelry sales reflected the enormous appeal of our Yellow Diamond Collection, as well as the popularity of gold jewelry. And we're very pleased with initial customer reaction to our recently updated 1837 collection, which showcases the new RUBEDO metal. 
Growth in designer jewelry sales reflected the success of Paloma Picasso's designs, including her new Villa Paloma and her Venezia Collection. And beyond jewelry, we're pleased with the sales momentum of our leather goods collection. There are additional introductions to the pipeline for later in the year. 
That wraps up the sales review. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat."

As you just heard, first quarter sales, mostly in the Americas, were a bit below what we had initially expected. As a result, we have adjusted our expectation for the next couple of quarters.

As a result, we have adjusted our expectation for the next couple of quarters. It probably goes without saying, but those sales results certainly do not affect any of our exciting plans for store expansion, product launches or the pursuit of market share growth opportunities in 2012.
Looking at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin declined by 1 point in the quarter to 57.3%. The decline was based on higher product acquisition costs from last year, as we had expected and previously communicated. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 9% in the quarter. Excluding roughly $8 million of nonrecurring costs in last year's first quarter related to the relocation of our New York headquarter staff, SG&A expenses rose 11% year-over-year due to higher labor, occupancy and marketing spending, all of which resulted in an increase in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales. 
Other expenses, net of $10.5 million in the quarter, were virtually unchanged from the prior year, and the effective tax rate in the quarter came in as expected at 34.5% versus 35.6% last year. Adding it up, net earnings rose 1% in the quarter. However, excluding last year's nonrecurring costs, net earnings declined 5% versus our expectation for a slight increase, due to the sales shortfall in the Americas. 
Looking at our balance sheet. Accounts receivable are in good shape, increasing 3% at April 30 from a year ago, with receivables turning at 20x per year. The more significant use of working capital has been in net inventories, which at April 30, were 27% higher than a year ago. Part of that overall increase was due to higher product acquisition costs. 
In addition, the 16% year-over-year increase in finished goods was due to store openings and expanded product assortment, and of course, some effects from the softer-than-expected sales growth. The larger increase in inventories was in raw material and work in process, up 44% year-over-year, due to the continued expansion of our rough diamond supply chain and internal jewelry manufacturing. We now expect net inventory growth of about 10% for the full year versus 15% previously, as we make adjustments tied to our lowered sales expectations. 
Capital expenditures of $44 million were modestly lower than the $52 million a year ago. We bought back some of our shares during the first quarter, spending $46 million to purchase approximately 700,000 shares at an average cost of $66.42 per share. As a result of that various spending, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $343 million at April 30 and was lower than a year ago. 
Total short-term and long-term debt of $834 million was higher than a year ago and represented 35% of stockholders' equity. We continue to achieve solid returns on assets and equity with ROA running at 11% and ROE at 19% through the first quarter, and we were pleased that Tiffany's Board of Directors last week approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate. That represented the 11th dividend increase in the past decade. 
Before turning to our financial outlook for the rest of the year, I want to make sure you are all aware of the disclosure we made in our report on Form 8-K filed yesterday with the SEC regarding the potential acquisition of Elsa Peretti's intellectual property rights. Please see the 8-K filing on our website for more details. 
Now let's review our full year outlook. We indicated in today's news release that the sales in the first few weeks of the second quarter are increasing by a low single-digit percentage. We are experiencing the difficult comparisons to extremely strong growth at this time last year, especially in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, as well as decelerating rates of economic growth in a number of countries that are affecting our results. 
Based on results in the first quarter and revisions we have made from our initial outlook for the second and third quarters, we are now expecting full year worldwide sales to increase about 7% to 8% for 2012 versus our previous 10% objective, with the strongest growth occurring in the Asia Pacific region. 
Our plans call for adding 24 Tiffany stores this year, and as you heard, we opened 4 in the first quarter. For the rest of the year, the 20 stores plan includes 6 additional stores in the Americas, with leases finalized for a store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, a store in Rio de Janeiro and a store on Altavista Street in the south area of Mexico City. We have 7 stores scheduled to open in Asia Pacific, with leases finalized for a store in Bondi Junction, Australia and a second store in Singapore's Changi Airport. 
We'll have 2 additional stores in Europe, with a store in Nice opening tomorrow and a store in Prague opening later this year. A store planned to open in the Berlin airport is now delayed until early 2013 due to airport construction delays. And we will soon begin to operate the 5 stores in the UAE, in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. 
We have a strong lineup of product introductions planned for this year in a wide range of materials and price points, including an Art Deco jewelry collection, tied to the launch of The Great Gatsby movie, and Tiffany's new Enchant jewelry collection, with the designs inspired by the natural world in platinum, gold and tanzanite. Those and other introductions will receive strong marketing support, both in print and digital media, to create awareness among customers. 
We now expect the operating margin for the full year to be modestly lower than last year's 20.6%, which had excluded nonrecurring items. We expect SG&A expense growth, after excluding the nonrecurring costs from last year, to be somewhat below sales growth, leading to an improvement of perhaps a 0.5 point in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales, but being more than offset by a decline in gross margin. 
We are pleased to see precious metal and diamond costs stabilizing in recent months, which, if it continues, should bode well for gross margin by the fourth quarter and into next year, but not before then. We are not currently anticipating taking any meaningful price increases for the rest of the year. 
Also related to gross margins, I'm pleased to say that our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are operating efficiently to support our product needs in our stores and shipping to customers. We believe we have sufficient room to leverage that infrastructure capacity and receive a margin benefit based on achieving solid sales growth. 
Therefore, we now expect earnings for the year to increase to a range of $3.70 to $3.80, with all of the year-over-year growth coming in the fourth quarter. Our current expectation calls for earnings declines in the second and third quarters. You should also note that of this $0.25 per share decrease in our full year guidance, approximately $0.20 is related to a reduction in our operating expectations while $0.05 is tied to the expected cost of additional debt incurred for working capital, repayment of maturing debt and general corporate purposes. 
Our initial sales plan, primarily for the Americas, but also for Asia Pacific, did not factor in enough of the difficult year-over-year comparisons, as well as, more recently, the economic conditions in sales trends that have softened in some markets in Asia Pacific and elsewhere. We believe those conditions may remain soft for the next couple of quarters. 
As a reminder, local currency comp store sales in the second and third quarters of last year had increased 23% and 15%, respectively, in the Americas and 41% and 36%, respectively, in Asia Pacific. The adjustments we've made in our new sales outlook take into account soft macro conditions and those difficult year-over-year comparisons in the next 2 quarters. 
Despite the challenges we are addressing in 2012, I want to emphasize that we remain committed to our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. We believe that our company, now in its 175th year, is better positioned than ever to achieve greater prominence in our industry.

Now let's review the results. When we reported first quarter results on May 24, we indicated that worldwide sales in the first few weeks of the second quarter were increasing by a low single-digit percentage and that we expected net earnings in the second quarter to decline from the prior year when excluding last year's nonrecurring costs. The overall results we report today were in line with those internal expectations. Net worldwide sales rose 2%, led by strong growth in Japan, while sales in the Americas, Asia Pacific in Europe are virtually equal to the prior year. And while net earnings on a GAAP basis rose 2%, adjusted net earnings declined 17% from the prior year, which was about what we expected when excluding nonrecurring costs in last year's second quarter related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff. The year-over-year comparisons we faced in the quarter could not have been much more difficult. So it's worth reminding you that in last year's second quarter, worldwide sales had increased 30%; net earnings had increased 33%; and net earnings, excluding nonrecurring costs, had surged 58%. 
Let's now look at second quarter sales by region. In the Americas, total sales declined 1% in the quarter. An increase in the average price per unit sold was offset by a decline in unit volume. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales were equal to the prior year, and comp store sales were down 5% on top of the 23% comp increase last year. Of that 5% comp decline in the quarter, brand store comps were down 4% on top of the 19% increase last year, with most regions performing in a relatively narrow band, except for solid growth in Florida, Texas and our Pacific market of Hawaii and Guam. Sales in the New York flagship store declined 9% on top of a staggering 41% increase last year. Data published by MasterCard SpendingPulse continues to indicate weak customer spending for the entire U.S. jewelry industry and most pronounced among the high tier jewelers. 
From a customer mix perspective, the sales decline in the U.S. in the quarter was entirely due to lower spending by local customers. While overall sales to foreign tourists are roughly unchanged from the prior year, higher sales to Japanese and Chinese visitors were offset by a decline in spending by European tourists in the U.S., which obviously affected the New York flagship stores as well. Also in the Americas region, total sales rose in Canada, although comps declined, while we had strong growth in local currency comps in Latin America. 
Beyond stores, combined e-commerce and catalog sales in the Americas rose 3% in the quarter due to an increase in the average sales per order. That was on top of a 16% increase last year. I'm pleased to add that based on successful results measured both quantitatively and creatively from a test mailing of a new catalog format we did earlier this year, our catalogs will soon have a fresh new look, starting with the upcoming holiday season. 
During the quarter, we added 1 store in the Americas when we opened our ninth store in Mexico in the Alta Vista neighborhood of Mexico City. In the second half of the year, we will be adding 3 stores in the U.S., 1 in Brazil and 5 in Canada, which now includes converting from wholesale distribution for Tiffany boutiques and hold department stores into company-operated locations. 
Turning to the Asia Pacific region, total sales rose 1% in the second quarter, resulting from increased unit volume with an offsetting decline in the average price per unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 3% and comp store sales in local currencies declined 5%, which compared with an extraordinary 41% comp increase in last year's second quarter. Australia posted the strongest growth in the quarter, in contrast to softness in Hong Kong tied to restrained Chinese consumer spending and softness in Korea. We remain enthusiastic about Tiffany's longer-term potential in China and we continue to expand our store base in the second quarter by opening our 18th and 19th stores there, one 1 in Nanjing and the other in Shanghai's Grand Gateway Mall, which represents our fifth store in that city. We have 5 additional stores on track to open in the Asia Pacific region in the second half of the year. 
Among our various regions, the strongest performance in the quarter came from Japan where total sales rose 11% due to a healthy increase in jewelry unit volume and an increase in the average price per unit sold. In local currency, both total sales and comparable store sales rose 10% in the quarter. This came on top of an 8% comp in last year's second quarter. Sales growth was broad-based throughout Japan with no significant variations by region. The number of Tiffany stores in Japan remains unchanged. 
Turning to Europe, total sales declined 1% in the quarter due to a modest decline in units, although mixed by category, and a small increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total European sales increased 8% and comp store sales rose 2%, which was on top of an 11% comp increase in the second quarter of last year. Considering the obvious challenging economic conditions, we are pleased with our European results, although we do acknowledge that sales are getting a boost from non-European tourists who are offsetting spending declines by local customers in some markets. By market, sales growth in Germany, France and some other countries was largely offset by weakness in the U.K. and Italy. We opened 1 European store during the quarter when we entered the south of France with a store in Nice and initial results are very encouraging. We plan to open 1 more European store later in the year. 
Lastly, other sales increased 12% in the second quarter. In addition to increased wholesale sales to independent distributors in certain markets, we assumed control in July of 5 Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi. We are now operating those stores and recording the retail sales and expenses as opposed to previously recording wholesale sales. As we expected, it will take some time for us to get that business fully up to speed, but we are pleased with initial results and very excited about long-term prospects throughout the Middle East. 
That wraps up the regional sales review. From a global merchandising perspective, most product categories posted sales that were relatively close to last year's levels. In addition, our worldwide price stratification analysis in the second quarter indicated fluctuating demand at various price point levels from which we can't draw any conclusions. Not to belabor the point, but the year-over-year comparisons were tough in pretty much all product categories and therefore difficult to analyze. There are quite a few exciting product introductions coming in the next few months that Pat will address shortly. 
Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 56.3% in the second quarter was 2.7 points below last year and virtually on our expectations, mostly tied to higher product acquisition costs from last year as well as the lack of sales leverage on fixed costs. SG&A expenses in the quarter on a GAAP basis declined 8% from last year. However, excluding roughly $34 million of nonrecurring costs in the second quarter of last year related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff, SG&A expenses rose but only by 1%, which was modestly below our expectation and not indicative of future increases, as higher store occupancy costs were mostly offset by the timing of the marketing spending. Other expenses, net of $14.3 million in the second quarter, were $4.6 million above the prior year. This primarily resulted from increased interest expense. 
Tiffany's effective tax rate in the quarter came in at the expected 34.6%. The prior year rate of 31.2% had reflected a reversal of the tax valuation allowance. In total, second quarter net earnings increased 2% on a GAAP basis, but excluding last year's nonrecurring costs, declined 17%, which was in line with our last forecast. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat."

While Tiffany's sales growth in the second quarter was restrained due to both macroeconomic reasons and difficult year-over-year comparisons, we were pleased that operating results met our expectations. From a balance sheet perspective, duri",1148,"Thanks, Mark. While Tiffany's sales growth in the second quarter was restrained due to both macroeconomic reasons and difficult year-over-year comparisons, we were pleased that operating results met our expectations. From a balance sheet perspective, during the quarter, we took advantage of attractive interest rates to secure $250 million of long-term debt with principal payments due over a 10- to 30-year period at a coupon of 4.4%. Of the $250 million of proceeds, $60 million went toward repaying in full our 6.56% senior notes that came due. The remaining $190 million of proceeds is for general corporate purposes, including reducing short-term debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 
At July 31, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $367 million versus $565 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $940 million versus $694 million a year ago, and total debt represented 39% of stockholders' equity versus 29% a year ago. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were in a very good shape, declining 6% from the prior year, and receivables turnover remained at a very high 18x per year. 
The largest use of cash over the past year has been in net inventories, which were up 21% from July 31 last year. By stages of inventory, there were similar rates of growth for both finished goods and combined raw material and work in process, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, new store openings, expanded product assortments and expansion of our rough diamond supply chain and internal jewelry manufacturing. We continue to expect net inventories to increase approximately 10% for the full year. And we continue to exceed our objective for returns on assets and equity, ROA was 11% and ROE was 19% through the second quarter. 
I now want to review the full year outlook. Starting at the top, we are now projecting net worldwide sales growth of 6% to 7% for the year versus our previous expectation of 7% to 8% growth. moderated our sales growth expectation for the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific and the Americas to reflect lingering economic uncertainties. At the moment, we continue to compare against unusually strong growth in most regions at this time last year, as well as a challenging economic conditions in a number of countries. We believe we have appropriately considered those factors in our current forecast. 
Our full year plan now calls for adding 28 Tiffany-operated stores versus 24 previously, which are inclusive of the 13 stores we added in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, we have exciting plans in the Americas to open a store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood; a second store in San Francisco in the San Francisco center; a store in La Jolla, California; a store in Rio de Janeiro; and a third store in Toronto in share gardens. On top of that, we recently completed an agreement to directly operate 4 existing Tiffany boutiques within Holt Renfrew department stores that were previously operated on a wholesale basis. Earlier this month, we began operation of the stores in Ottawa, Montréal and Calgary, and we'll begin to operate a shop in their Vancouver store later in the year. 
In Asia Pacific, we plan to open a store in Bondi Junction, Australia; a second store in Singapore's Changi Airport; and new stores in China in Hardin, Shenyang and Tianjin. And in Europe, we will soon enter the Czech Republic where we open a store in Prague next month. We have an attractive line up of product introductions plan for the second half of the year, including Tiffany's new Enchant jewelry collection with designs inspired by the natural world and crafted in platinum and diamonds with gold and tanzanite. At the same time, we will be expanding our assortment of yellow diamond jewelry and we're introducing pink diamond accents to number of our collections. Building on this success of RUBEDO, which were introduced in the newly designed 1837 collection launched earlier this year, we will also be incorporating RUBEDO into our iconic Return to Tiffany collection. This fall, we will be introducing a spectacular collection of new statement jewelry, and we're pleased with the recent launch of Tiffany harmony engagement rings and wedding bands, which are currently offered exclusively in Japan. 
We've postponed the launch of jewelry designs that we've created in relation to the premiere of the movie The Great Gatsby. The movie premiere, originally scheduled for December, was recently moved to the middle of 2013 and it makes sense for our product launch to coincide with the marketing surrounding the movie's premiere. The lack of expected sales revenues for those collections should not have any meaningful effect on our fourth quarter results. 
Moving down the earnings statement, we continue to expect that the full year operating margin will be below last year's 20.6%, which had excluded nonrecurring items. That is based on assumptions for gross margin decline and that SG&A expense growth after excluding the nonrecurring costs from last year, will be roughly in line with sales growth. Product cost pressure is moderating and we expect to soon benefit from reductions over the past year in precious metal and diamond costs. And expected year-over-year gross margin decline in the third quarter should be smaller than we experienced in the second quarter, and we expect gross margin to increase in the fourth quarter, although any product mix changes could offset some of it. 
We did not take any meaningful price increase in the first half of the year nor do we anticipate doing so for the rest of the year. Therefore, we now expect net earnings for the year in a range of $3.55 to $3.70 per diluted share, down from our previous guidance of $3.70 to $3.80 per diluted share, with earnings declining in the third quarter, as we have previously forecast, followed by a resumption of growth in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, before, our reduced earnings forecast for the year primarily reflects a more conservative assumption for sales growth in the fourth quarter, as well as the related margin effect from less sales leverage. We believe our new guidance incorporates an appropriate degree of near-term caution at this point in time. Longer term, our management team remains enthusiastic about the opportunities we are pursuing in store expansion, product introductions, and marketing that will contribute to solid growth. The challenges we are facing this year are pretty obvious, but I want to emphasize that we remain committed to achieving our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. We believe that Tiffany and Co. is well positioned to achieve those objectives.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
Now let's review the results. When we reported first quarter results on May 24, we indicated that worldwide sales in the first few weeks of the second quarter were increasing by a low single-digit percentage and that we expected net earnings in the second quarter to decline from the prior year when excluding last year's nonrecurring costs. The overall results we report today were in line with those internal expectations. Net worldwide sales rose 2%, led by strong growth in Japan, while sales in the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe were virtually equal to the prior year. And while net earnings on a GAAP basis rose 2%, adjusted net earnings declined 17% from the prior year, which was about what we expected when excluding nonrecurring costs in last year's second quarter related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff. The year-over-year comparisons we faced in the quarter could not have been much more difficult, so it's worth reminding you that in last year's second quarter, worldwide sales had increased 30%, net earnings had increased 33% and net earnings excluding nonrecurring costs had surged 58%. 
Let's now look at second quarter sales by region. In the Americas, total sales declined 1% in the quarter. An increase in the average price per unit sold was offset by a decline in unit volume. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales were equal to the prior year, and comp store sales were down 5% on top of a 23% comp increase last year. Of that 5% comp decline in the quarter, brand store comps were down 4% on top of a 19% increase last year, with most regions performing in a relatively narrow band except for solid growth in Florida, Texas and our Pacific market of Hawaii and Guam. Sales in the New York flagship store declined 9% on top of a staggering 41% increase last year. Data published by MasterCard Spendingpulse continues to indicate weak customer spending for the entire U.S. jewelry industry and most pronounced among the high-tier jewelers. 
From a customer mix perspective, the sales decline in the U.S. in the quarter was entirely due to lower spending by local customers. While overall sales to foreign tourists were roughly unchanged from the prior year, higher sales to Japanese and Chinese visitors were offset by a decline in spending by European tourists in the U.S., which obviously affected the New York flagship store as well. Also in the Americas region, total sales rose in Canada although comps declined, while we had strong growth in local currency comps in Latin America. 
Beyond stores, combined e-commerce and catalog sales in the Americas rose 3% in the quarter due to an increase in the average sales per order. That was on top of a 16% increase last year. I'm pleased to add that based on successful results measured both quantitatively and creatively from a test mailing of a new catalog format we did earlier this year, our catalogs will soon have a fresh new look starting with the upcoming holiday season. 
During the quarter, we added one store in the Americas when we opened our ninth store in Mexico in the Altavista neighborhood of Mexico City. In the second half of the year, we will be adding 3 stores in the U.S., 1 in Brazil and 5 in Canada, which now includes converting from a wholesale distribution 4 Tiffany boutiques in Hold Renfrew department stores into company-operated locations. 
Turning to the Asia Pacific region, total sales rose 1% in the second quarter, resulting from increased unit volume with an offsetting decline in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 3%, and comp store sales in local currencies declined 5%, which compared with an extraordinary 41% comp increase in last year's second quarter. Australia posted the strongest growth in the quarter in contrast to softness in Hong Kong tied to restrained Chinese consumer spending and softness in Korea. 
We remain enthusiastic about Tiffany's longer-term potential in China, and we continued to expand our store base in the second quarter by opening our 18th and 19th stores there, one in Nanjing and the other in Shanghai's Grand Gateway mall, which represents our fifth store in that city. We have 5 additional stores on track to open in the Asia Pacific region in the second half of the year. 
Among our various regions, the strongest performance in the quarter came from Japan, where total sales rose 11% due to a healthy increase in jewelry unit volume and an increase in the average price per unit sold. In local currency, both total sales and comparable store sales rose 10% in the quarter. This came on top of an 8% comp in last year's second quarter. Sales growth was broad based throughout Japan, with no significant variations by region. The number of Tiffany stores in Japan remained unchanged. 
Turning to Europe, total sales declined 1% in the quarter due to a modest decline in units, although mixed by category and a small increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales increased 8%, and comp store sales rose 2%, which was on top of an 11% comp increase in the second quarter of last year. Considering the obvious challenging economic conditions, we're pleased with our European results, although we do acknowledge that sales are getting a boost from non-European tourists who are offsetting spending declines by local customers in some markets. By market, sales growth in Germany, France and some other countries was largely offset by weakness in the U.K. and Italy. We opened one European store during the quarter when we entered the south of France with a store in nice, and initial results are very encouraging. We plan to open one more European store later in the year. 
Lastly, other sales increased 12% in the second quarter. In addition to increased wholesale sales to independent distributors in certain markets, we assumed control in July of 5 Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi. We are now operating those stores and recording the retail sales and expenses as opposed to previously recording wholesale sales. As we expected, it will take some time for us to get that business fully up to speed, but we are pleased with initial results and very excited about long-term prospects throughout the Middle East. 
That wraps up the regional sales review. From a global merchandising perspective, most product categories posted sales that were relatively close to last year's levels. In addition, our worldwide price stratification analysis in the second quarter indicated fluctuating demand at various price point levels from which we can't draw any conclusions.

Other expenses, net of $14.3 million in the second quarter, were $4.6 million above the prior year. This primarily resulted from increased interest expense. 
Tiffany's effective tax rate in the quarter came in at the expected 34.6%. The prior year rate of 31.2% had reflected a reversal of the tax valuation allowance. In total, second quarter net earnings increased 2% on a GAAP basis but excluding last year's nonrecurring costs, declined 17%, which was in line with our last forecast.

The year-over-year comparisons we faced in the quarter could not have been much more difficult, so it's worth reminding you that in last year's second quarter, worldwide sales had increased 30%, net earnings had increased 33% and net earnings excluding nonrecurring costs had surged 58%. 
Let's now look at second quarter sales by region. In the Americas, total sales declined 1% in the quarter. An increase in the average price per unit sold was offset by a decline in unit volume. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales were equal to the prior year, and comp store sales were down 5% on top of a 23% comp increase last year. Of that 5% comp decline in the quarter, brand store comps were down 4% on top of a 19% increase last year, with most regions performing in a relatively narrow band except for solid growth in Florida, Texas and our Pacific market of Hawaii and Guam. Sales in the New York flagship store declined 9% on top of a staggering 41% increase last year. Data published by MasterCard Spendingpulse continues to indicate weak customer spending for the entire U.S. jewelry industry and most pronounced among the high-tier jewelers. 
From a customer mix perspective, the sales decline in the U.S. in the quarter was entirely due to lower spending by local customers. While overall sales to foreign tourists were roughly unchanged from the prior year, higher sales to Japanese and Chinese visitors were offset by a decline in spending by European tourists in the U.S., which obviously affected the New York flagship store as well. Also in the Americas region, total sales rose in Canada, although comps declined, while we had strong growth in local currency comps in Latin America. 
Beyond stores, combined e-commerce and catalog sales in the Americas rose 3% in the quarter due to an increase in the average sales per order. That was on top of a 16% increase last year. I'm pleased to add that based on successful results measured both quantitatively and creatively from a test mailing of a new catalog format we did earlier this year, our catalogs will soon have a fresh new look starting with the upcoming holiday season. 
During the quarter, we added one store in the Americas when we opened our ninth store in Mexico in the Altavista neighborhood of Mexico City. In the second half of the year, we will be adding 3 stores in the U.S., 1 in Brazil and 5 in Canada, which now includes converting from wholesale distribution 4 Tiffany boutiques in Holt Renfrew department stores into company-operated locations. 
Turning to the Asia Pacific region, total sales rose 1% in the second quarter, resulting from increased unit volume with an offsetting decline in the average price per unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 3%, and comp store sales in local currencies declined 5%, which compared with an extraordinary 41% comp increase in last year's second quarter. Australia posted the strongest growth in the quarter in contrast to softness in Hong Kong tied to restrained Chinese consumer spending and softness in Korea. 
We remain enthusiastic about Tiffany's longer-term potential in China, and we continued to expand our store base in the second quarter by opening our 18th and 19th stores there, one in Nanjing and the other in Shanghai's Grand Gateway mall, which represents our fifth store in that city. We have 5 additional stores on track to open in the Asia Pacific region in the second half of the year. 
Among our various regions, the strongest performance in the quarter came from Japan, where total sales rose 11% due to a healthy increase in jewelry unit volume and an increase in the average price per unit sold. In local currency, both total sales and comparable store sales rose 10% in the quarter. This came on top of an 8% comp in last year's second quarter. Sales growth was broad-based throughout Japan, with no significant variations by region. The number of Tiffany stores in Japan remained unchanged. 
Turning to Europe, total sales declined 1% in the quarter due to a modest decline in units, although mixed by category, and a small increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total European sales increased 8% and comp store sales rose 2%, which was on top of an 11% comp increase in the second quarter of last year. Considering the obvious challenging economic conditions, we're pleased with our European results, although we do acknowledge that sales are getting a boost from non-European tourists who are offsetting spending declines by local customers in some markets. By market, sales growth in Germany, France and some other countries was largely offset by weakness in the U.K. and Italy. We opened one European store during the quarter when we entered the south of France with a store in Nice, and initial results are very encouraging. We plan to open one more European store later in the year. 
Lastly, other sales increased 12% in the second quarter. In addition to increased wholesale sales to independent distributors in certain markets, we assumed control in July of 5 Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi. We are now operating those stores and recording the retail sales and expenses as opposed to previously recording wholesale sales. As we expected, it will take some time for us to get that business fully up to speed, but we are pleased with initial results and very excited about long-term prospects throughout the Middle East. 
That wraps up the regional sales review. From a global merchandising perspective, most product categories posted sales that were relatively close to last year's levels. In addition, our worldwide price stratification analysis in the second quarter indicated fluctuating demand at various price point levels from which we can't draw any conclusions. Not to belabor the point, but the year-over-year comparisons were tough in pretty much all product categories and, therefore, difficult to analyze. There are quite a few exciting product introductions coming in the next few months that Pat will address shortly. 
Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 56.3% in the second quarter was 2.7 points below last year and virtually on our expectations mostly tied to higher product acquisition costs from last year as well as the lack of sales leverage on fixed costs. SG&A expenses in the quarter on a GAAP basis declined 8% from last year. However, excluding roughly $34 million of nonrecurring costs in the second quarter of last year related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff, SG&A expenses rose but only by 1%, which was modestly below our expectation and not indicative of future increases as higher store occupancy costs were mostly offset by the timing of marketing spending. Other expenses net of $14.3 million in the second quarter were $4.6 million above the prior year. This primarily resulted from increased interest expense. 
Tiffany's effective tax rate in the quarter came in at the expected 34.6%. The prior year rate of 31.2% had reflected a reversal of the tax valuation allowance. In total, second quarter net earnings increased 2% on a GAAP basis but, excluding last year's nonrecurring costs, declined 17%, which was in line with our last forecast. 
I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat."

While Tiffany's sales growth in the second quarter was restrained due to both macroeconomic reasons and difficult year-over-year comparisons, we were pleased that operating results met our expectations. From a balance sheet perspective, duri",1152,"Thanks, Mark. While Tiffany's sales growth in the second quarter was restrained due to both macroeconomic reasons and difficult year-over-year comparisons, we were pleased that operating results met our expectations. From a balance sheet perspective, during the quarter, we took advantage of attractive interest rates to secure $250 million of long-term debt with principal payments due over a 10- to 30-year period at a coupon of 4.4%. Of the $250 million of proceeds, $60 million went toward repaying in full our 6.56% senior notes that came due. The remaining $190 million of proceeds is for general corporate purposes, including reducing short-term debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 
At July 31, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $367 million versus $565 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $940 million versus $694 million a year ago, and total debt represented 39% of stockholders' equity versus 29% a year ago. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were in very good shape, declining 6% from the prior year, and the receivables turnover remained at a very high 18x per year. 
The largest use of cash over the past year has been in net inventories, which were up 21% from July 31 last year. By stages of inventory, there were similar rates of growth for both finished goods and combined raw material and work in process, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, new store openings, expanded product assortments and an expansion of our rough diamond supply chain and internal jewelry manufacturing. We continue to expect net inventories to increase approximately 10% for the full year, and we continue to exceed our objective for returns on assets and equity. ROA was 11%, and ROE was 19% through the second quarter. 
I now want to review the full year outlook. Starting at the top, we are now projecting net worldwide sales growth of 6% to 7% for the year versus our previous expectation of 7% to 8% growth. We moderated our sales growth expectation for the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific and the Americas to reflect lingering economic uncertainties. At the moment, we continue to compare against unusually strong growth in most regions at this time last year as well as challenging economic conditions in a number of countries. We believe we have appropriately considered those factors in our current forecast. Our full year plan now calls for adding 28 Tiffany-operated stores versus 24 previously, which are inclusive of the 13 stores we added in the first half of the year. 
In the second half of the year, we have exciting plans in the Americas to open a store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood; a second store in San Francisco in the San Francisco Centre; a store in La Jolla, California; a store in Rio de Janeiro and a third store in Toronto in Sherway Gardens. On top of that, we recently completed an agreement to directly operate 4 existing Tiffany boutiques within Holt Renfrew department stores that were previously operated on a wholesale basis. Earlier this month, we began operation of the stores in Ottawa, Montréal and Calgary, and we'll begin to operate a shop in their Vancouver store later in the year. In Asia Pacific, we plan to open a store in Bondi Junction, Australia, a second store in Singapore's Changi Airport and new stores in China in Harbin, Shenyang and Tianjin. And in Europe, we will soon enter the Czech Republic when we open a store in Prague next month. 
We have an attractive lineup of product introductions planned for the second half of the year, including Tiffany's new Enchant jewelry collection, with designs inspired by the natural world and crafted in platinum and diamonds with rose gold and tanzanite. At the same time, we will be expanding our assortment of yellow diamond jewelry, and we're introducing pink diamond accents to a number of our collections. 
Building on the success of RUBEDO, which we introduced in the newly designed 1837 collection launched earlier this year, we will also be incorporating RUBEDO into our iconic Return to Tiffany collection. This fall, we will be introducing a spectacular collection of new statement jewelry, and we're pleased with the recent launch of Tiffany Harmony engagement rings and wedding bands, which are currently offered exclusively in Japan. 
We've postponed the launch of jewelry designs that we created in relation to the premiere of the movie The Great Gatsby. The movie's premiere, originally scheduled for December, was recently moved to the middle of 2013, and it makes sense for our product launch to coincide with the marketing surrounding the movie's premiere. The lack of expected sales revenues for those collections should not have any meaningful effect on our fourth quarter results. 
Moving down the earnings statement, we continue to expect that the full year operating margin will be below last year's 20.6%, which had excluded nonrecurring items. That is based on assumptions for a gross margin decline and that SG&A expense growth after excluding the nonrecurring cost from last year will be roughly in line with sales growth. Product cost pressure is moderating, and we expect to soon benefit from reductions over the past year in precious metal and diamond costs. An expected year-over-year gross margin decline in the third quarter should be smaller than we experienced in the second quarter, and we expect gross margin to increase in the fourth quarter, although any product mix changes could offset some of it. 
We did not take any meaningful price increases in the first half of the year, nor do we anticipate doing so for the rest of the year. Therefore, we now expect net earnings for the year in a range of $3.55 to $3.70 per diluted share, down from our previous guidance of $3.70 to $3.80 per diluted share, with earnings declining in the third quarter, as we had previously forecast, followed by a resumption of growth in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned before, our reduced earnings forecast for the year primarily reflects a more conservative assumption for sales growth in the fourth quarter as well as the related margin effect from less sales leverage. We believe our new guidance incorporates an appropriate degree of near-term caution at this point in time. 
Longer term, our management team remains enthusiastic about the opportunities we are pursuing in store expansion, product introductions and marketing that will contribute to solid growth. The challenges we are facing this year are pretty obvious, but I want to emphasize that we remain committed to achieving our longer-term financial objectives to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. We believe that Tiffany & Co. is well positioned to achieve those objectives.

Now let's talk about the results. In summary, a 4% increase in worldwide net sales in the third quarter was virtually on our expectation with some offsets by region. The gross margin declined more than we expected. SG&A spending was very close to our expectation, but the effective tax rate was higher than expected. All of this resulted in net earnings of $63 million, which were 30% below the prior year and below the expectation that was embedded in our previous annual guidance. While these results partly reflect the weak consumer demand in a number of markets, among other factors, let's remember that we also faced very difficult year-over-year comparisons when net sales that increased 21% and net earnings have grown 52%, excluding nonrecurring items in last year's third quarter. But having said that, these results were below what we had forecast. 
Let's start by reviewing third quarter sales by region, which ranged from modest growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in the Americas, Japan and Asia Pacific to solid growth in Europe. In the Americas, sales rose 3% with an increase in average price partly offset by lower jewelry unit volume. Not to minimize the unit decline, but it is worth noting that the entire volume drop was in silver jewelry at price points below $500, while every other jewelry category at higher price strata posted increased volume. 
On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales also rose 3% and comparable store sales rose 1%, which was on top of a 15% comp in last year's third quarter. Despite a tough comparison, this was still below our expectation. Geographically, Americas brand store comps declined 1% but had a difficult comparison to a 13% comp increase last year. Most markets performed in a narrow range and there were no noteworthy market deviations from the norm. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 5% on top of  a 24% increase last year, benefiting from some growth in sales to foreign tourists and U.S. customers. 
While we can no longer report foreign tourism data for the U.S. in its entirety due to legal restrictions on the collection of customer data in several of our important markets, sales to foreign visitors will continue to be a growing importance to certain of our U.S. stores. 
In early October, we had hosted a successful selling event in New York for Tiffany's highest spending customers. Their marked enthusiasm was encouraging. In the last few days of the quarter, sales were obviously affected by Hurricane Sandy, which caused the temporary closing of 24 of our U.S. stores from DC up to Boston. Most stores reopened within a few days when power was restored in their markets. The New York flagship itself was closed for today's. It's hard to know how much of a residual effect on sales might be felt in the fourth quarter, but regional management has factored some into their latest forecast. Most important, the hurricane was a tragic occurrence for millions of people and our thoughts are with those have suffered from it. 
Elsewhere in the Americas, comp store sales declined in Canada, but we achieved double-digit comp store sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in both Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we added 7 stores in the Americas region, including our new SoHo store in Manhattan, a store in the San Francisco Centre marking our second in that city, a store in Sherway Gardens, which is our third store in Toronto, and we converted 4 locations in Renfrew department stores in Canada and Calgary, Montréal, Ottawa and Vancouver from wholesale distribution to company-operated stores. We now operate a total of 11 stores in Canada. 
Rounding out the region, our combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas rose modestly in the quarter. We recently mailed a newly designed catalog with a fresh and enticing look that customers should be seeing in their mailboxes around now. Please let me know if you'd like a copy. 
Without a doubt, the most difficult year-over-year sales comparison we had in the quarter was in the Asia Pacific region, but sales did meet our expectations. Total sales rose 2% in the quarter, driven by higher jewelry unit volume in all categories and a small decline in average price. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales also rose 2% and comp store sales declined 4% on top of a huge 36% comp increase last year. 
Tiffany is certainly not alone in experiencing some softness in Chinese consumer spending due to a plethora of economic and other factors. Geographically, the softness in greater China, especially in Hong Kong, mostly offset modest growth in other Asia Pacific markets. Notwithstanding what we have seen this year, we remain confident that China will experience significant economic growth in the years ahead and that the Chinese will continue to increase in importance as customers of Tiffany and other luxury goods purveyors. 
During the quarter, we added 2 new stores in China, in Harbin and Shenyang and opened our second store in Singapore's Changi Airport. We were pleased with our performance in Japan with sales in the quarter fractionally higher than last year and meeting our expectations. Higher average price offset lower jewelry unit volume. In yen, total sales rose 3% and comps rose 5% on top of a 4% increase last year. Sales growth was a bit stronger in the Tokyo region than elsewhere. During the quarter, we opened a new department store location in Chiba that replaces a soon-to-be closed shop in a different department store. 
We were also pleased with the results in Europe where sales rose 6% in the quarter due to a combination of increased price and a slight increase in jewelry unit volume. This exceeded our expectation. In constant currencies, European sales rose 11% and the comp stores sales rose 8% on top of a 6% comp increase from last year's third quarter. Geographically, local currency comp store sales growth throughout Continental Europe, except Italy, more than offset some softness in the U.K. The sales increase benefited from higher foreign tourists sales. 
During the quarter, we added our 34th location in Europe when we opened a store in Prague. And just a few weeks ago, we were excited to announce that we will open a flagship store in Paris on the magnificent Champs-Elysées in 2014. While we have developed a successful but still relatively small business in Paris over the past decade, we believe this store will take Tiffany's presence to new heights by providing an extraordinary location and experience to international visitors and French customers. 
Lastly, our other sales increased 73% in the third quarter. This mostly reflected the realignments in the second quarter when we converted 5 Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates from previously wholesale distribution to now company-operated stores in which we record retail sales and expenses. We are progressing very well in making merchandising, marketing and service enhancements as part of our longer-term plan to develop a significant presence in the Middle East. That concludes the regional sales review. 
From a product and pricing perspective, we achieved growth in sales and units at most price points above $500. Therefore, from a product category perspective, sales of silver jewelry continued to be the weakest category. At higher price points, we posted modest sales growth in engagement rings and wedding bands, designer jewelry sales were up, and the fine and fashion jewelry categories we're seeing good growth in our expanding Yellow Diamond Collection, the Enchant jewelry collection is enjoying a good launch and the 1837 collection with the new RUBEDO metal is doing well. 
As we said 3 months ago, the difficult year-over-year comparisons in most categories make it challenging to assess more fundamental performance, except to say that sales of higher price point jewelry continue to outperform entry-level silver jewelry. 
Supporting product sales is a robust marketing campaign. Our advertising through print and digital media and catalogs only showcases the extraordinary beauty and range of our product offerings, but this year and next, the advertising also highlights Tiffany's 175th anniversary and our heritage. An eye-catching example of that advertising is in the November issue of Vogue magazine where we ran an unprecedented 10-page opening spread about the legacy gemstones of Tiffany. If you haven't seen the ad, please contact me for a copy. And I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat."

I will now take everyone through the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 54.4% in the third quarter was below the 57.9% gross margin in last year's third quarter. We are already forecasting a margin decline",1298,"Thanks, Mark, for that sales review. I will now take everyone through the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 54.4% in the third quarter was below the 57.9% gross margin in last year's third quarter. We are already forecasting a margin decline in the quarter, but this is more than we expected. So what changed from our previous forecast? Part of it was higher-than-expected product costs tied to the sales mix by product category. In essence, our sales of fashion jewelry specifically silver jewelry, were softer than we expected and this slower turn meant that lower silver costs did not flow through the earnings statement as quickly as we had expected. 
In addition, our product sales mix that is skewed towards higher-priced lower margin products, puts pressure on gross margin and we are not yet seen the benefit we expected from lower diamond costs flowing through the system. We saw some reduced leveraging of fixed expenses, but we expected that due to the modest sales growth. As a result, the lower gross margin cost us about $0.08 per share of earnings in the quarter. We expect that gross margin will improve as we flow through the lower product costs by the end of this year, but fourth quarter margin will still be lower than last year's fourth quarter. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% in the third quarter. This was close to what we expected due to the growth in store occupancy and marketing spending. Our labor cost in the quarter were mostly offset by reduced variable incentive compensation. The ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales was 40.7% versus 40.1% in last year's third quarter. Other expenses net of $14.8 million were up from $10.4 million last year and in line with what we expected. This reflected higher interest expense related to increased debt which included the $250 million of long-term debt with a 4.4% coupon that we issued during the second quarter. 
The effective tax rate of 38.4% in the third quarter was up from a rate of 33.9% in last year's third quarter. The higher-than-expected rate was primarily due to the true up of the prior year's tax provision upon filing our tax return, as well as some changes in our geographic mix of earnings that affected our overall tax rate. The higher rate was equivalent to about $0.03 in earnings per share. 
Adding it all up, the modest sales growth, the lower gross margin and the higher effective tax rate resulted in net earnings of $63 million being 30% below last year's third quarter and below our internal forecast. Return on average stockholders' equity was 17% on a trailing basis and return on average assets was 10%. 
While the near-term economic outlook remains uncertain, we do think we are well positioned for the holiday season and we are moving forward with exciting store, product and marketing plans that will benefit Tiffany over the longer term, and we have the financial means to pursue those initiatives. 
Looking at our balance sheet, we finished the third quarter with $346 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus $297 million a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt was $978 million versus $709 million a year ago and that total debt represented 40% of stockholders' equity versus 31% a year ago. And as we noted in today's news release, we did not repurchase any of our shares in the third quarter. 
Net inventories of $2.3 billion at October 31 were 11% higher than a year ago. Looking more closely at it, finished goods inventories were up 17% from last year while the total of raw materials and working process inventories were 2% above last year. These increases reflected a variety of factors, primarily new store openings, expanded product assortments and higher product acquisition costs. 
Looking at inventory growth sequentially, we've experienced detail rate of inventory growth over the past few quarters. Net inventories at January 31, 2012, were 28% over the prior year. At April 30, they were 27% above the prior year. At July 31, they were 21% above the prior year and they are now 11% higher than a year ago. We projected net inventories at year end will be approximately 10% above the prior year. 
Tiffany's 2 major distribution centers in New Jersey were closed for a few days after Hurricane Sandy which temporarily affected store replenishment and customer order fulfillment, but they are now operating normally. 
Now let's now turn to our financial outlook, which we updated in today's news release. We are now projecting full year sales to increase 5% to 6% versus our previous 6% to 7% forecast. Our annual forecast implies that total sales growth in the fourth quarter will be in a mid to high single-digit range with a low to mid-single digit comp store sales increase. 
While we have moderated our expectations for the Americas and Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter, we are still looking for the year-over-year sales growth in all regions. By early December, we had anniversaried all of last year's price increases, so our fourth quarter forecast assumes improvement in unit volume growth primarily coming from the easier year-over-year comparison. 
We've been pleased overall with initial results in the stores we've opened in 2012. We continue to project a net of 28 stores added in 2012, with just 4 more stores opening in the fourth quarter, including 1 in La Jolla, California, which opened 2 weeks ago; our fourth store in Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro; our sixth store in Australia; and second in Sydney in Bondi Junction; and our 22nd store in China, in Macau and Tianjin. And we'll soon close a store in Chiba, Japan that was replaced by a new one that opened in the third quarter. 
As Mark alluded to earlier, we have been very encouraged with initial customer reaction to our newly introduced jewelry collections this year. This has included the launch of the new RUBEDO metal in our 1837 collection and which we have just now expanded into our Return to Tiffany collection; the new Enchant collection crafted in platinum with diamonds, rose gold and tanzanite; the introduction of pink diamonds which expands our assortment of fancy color diamonds; Tiffany's Harmony collection of engagement rings and wedding bands, which was launched exclusively in Japan and will be distributed globally next year; and we have expanded our layer them and collection and our assortment of important engagement jewelry. We are projecting that operating margin for the full year will be lower than last year. All of the decline will come from the lower gross margin with SG&A expense growth in line with sales growth. 
Adding it all up, we now expect earnings in a range of $409 million to $435 million for the year, with $3.20 to $3.40 per diluted share versus a previous forecast of $3.55 to $3.70 per diluted share. About 1/3 of the delta comes from the third quarter shortfall and 2/3 comes from our reduced sales and gross margin assumptions for the fourth quarter. This implies fourth quarter EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.55 versus $1.39 per diluted share last year. 
We are now almost halfway through the holiday season calendar, but from a sales perspective, the most important part of the holiday season is clearly still ahead of us. Third quarter earnings were below what we had expected. However, the competitive advantages are in place for Tiffany to achieve better performance.

Now let's talk about the results. In summary, a 4% increase in worldwide net sales in the third quarter was virtually on our expectation with some offsets by region. The gross margin declined more than we expected. SG&A spending was very close to our expectation, but the effective tax rate was higher than expected. All of these resulted in net earnings of $63 million, which were 30% below the prior year and below the expectation that was embedded in our previous annual guidance. While these results partly reflect the weak consumer demand in a number of markets, among other factors, let's remember that we also faced very difficult year-over-year comparisons when net sales have increased 21% and net earnings have grown 52%, excluding nonrecurring items in last year's third quarter. But having said that, these results were below what we had forecast.
Let's start by reviewing third quarter sales by region, which ranged from modest growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in the Americas, Japan and Asia Pacific to solid growth in Europe. In the Americas, sales rose 3%, with an increase in average price partly offset by lower jewelry unit volume. Not to minimize the unit decline, but it is worth noting that the entire volume drop was in silver jewelry at price points below $500, while every other jewelry category at higher price strata posted increased volume. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales also rose 3% and comparable store sales rose 1%, which was on top of a 15% comp in last year's third quarter despite a tough comparison that was still below our expectation.
Geographically, Americas brand store comps declined 1% but had a difficult comparison to a 13% comp increase last year. Most markets performed in a narrow range, and there were no noteworthy market deviations from the norm. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 5% on top of the 24% increase last year, benefiting from some growth in sales to foreign tourists and U.S. customers. While we can no longer report foreign tourism data for the U.S. in its entirety due to legal restrictions on the collection of customer data in several of our important markets, sales to foreign visitors will continue to be of growing importance to certain of our U.S. stores. In early October, we had hosted a successful selling event in New York for Tiffany's highest spending customers. Their marked enthusiasm was encouraging. In the last few days of the quarter, sales were obviously affected by Hurricane Sandy, which caused the temporary closing of 24 of our U.S. stores from D.C. up to Boston. Most stores reopened within a few days as power was restored in their markets. The New York flagship itself was closed for 2 days. It's hard to know how much of a residual effect on sales might be felt in the fourth quarter, but regional management has factored some into their latest forecast. Most important, the hurricane was a tragic occurrence for millions of people and our thoughts are with those have suffered from it.
Elsewhere in the Americas, comp store sales declined in Canada, but we achieved double-digit comp store sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in both Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we added 7 stores in the Americas region, including our new SoHo store in Manhattan; a store in the San Francisco Centre, marking our second in that city; a store in Sherway Gardens, which is our third store in Toronto; and we converted 4 locations in Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada and Calgary, Montréal, Ottawa and Vancouver from wholesale distribution to company-operated stores. We now operate a total of 11 stores in Canada. 
Rounding out the region, our combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas rose modestly in the quarter. We recently mailed a newly designed catalog with a fresh and enticing look that customers should be seeing in their mailboxes around now. Please let me know if you'd like a copy.
Without a doubt, the most difficult year-over-year sales comparison we had in the quarter was in the Asia Pacific region, but sales did meet our expectations. Total sales rose 2% in the quarter, driven by higher jewelry unit volume in all categories and a small decline in average price. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales also rose 2% and comp store sales declined 4% on top of a huge 36% comp increase last year. Tiffany is certainly not alone in experiencing some softness in Chinese consumer spending due to a plethora of economic and other factors.
Geographically, the softness in Greater China, especially in Hong Kong, mostly offset modest growth in other Asia Pacific markets. Notwithstanding what we have seen this year, we remain confident that China will experience significant economic growth in the years ahead and that the Chinese will continue to increase in importance as customers of Tiffany and other luxury goods purveyors. During the quarter, we added 2 new stores in China, in Harbin and Shenyang, and opened our second store in Singapore's Changi Airport. We were pleased with our performance in Japan, with sales in the quarter fractionally higher than last year and meeting our expectations. Higher average price offset lower jewelry unit volume. In yen, total sales rose 3% and comps rose 5% on top of a 4% increase last year. Sales growth was a bit stronger in the Tokyo region than elsewhere. During the quarter, we opened a new department store location in Chiba that replaces a soon-to-be closed shop in a different department store. 
We were also pleased with the results in Europe, where sales rose 6% in the quarter due to a combination of increased price and a slight increase in jewelry unit volume. This exceeded our expectation. In constant currencies, European sales rose 11% and comp stores sales rose 8% on top of a 6% comp increase from last year's third quarter.
Geographically, local currency comp store sales growth throughout Continental Europe, except Italy, more than offset some softness in the U.K. The sales increase benefited from higher foreign tourist sales. During the quarter, we added our 34th location in Europe when we opened a store in Prague. And just a few weeks ago, we were excited to announce that we will open a flagship store in Paris on the magnificent Champs-Elysées in 2014. While we have developed a successful but still relatively small business in Paris over the past decade, we believe this store will take Tiffany's presence to new heights by providing an extraordinary location and experience to international visitors and French customers. 
Lastly, our other sales increased 73% in the third quarter. This mostly reflected the realignment in the second quarter when we converted 5 Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates from previously wholesale distribution to now company-operated stores in which we record retail sales and expenses. We are progressing very well in making merchandising, marketing and service enhancements as part of our longer-term plan to develop a significant presence in the Middle East.
That concludes the regional sales review. From a product and pricing perspective, we achieved growth in sales and units at most price points above $500. Therefore, from a product category perspective, sales of silver jewelry continued to be the weakest category. At higher price points, we posted modest sales growth in engagement rings and wedding bands. Designer jewelry sales were up. In the fine and fashion jewelry categories, we're seeing good growth in our expanding Yellow Diamonds collection, the Enchant jewelry collection is enjoying a good launch and the 1837 collection with the new RUBEDO metal is doing well. As we said 3 months ago, the difficult year-over-year comparisons in most categories make it challenging to assess more fundamental performance except to say that sales of higher price point jewelry continue to outperform entry-level silver jewelry. 
Supporting product sales is a robust marketing campaign. Our advertising through print and digital media and catalogs always showcases the extraordinary beauty and range of our product offerings. But this year and next, the advertising also highlights Tiffany's 175th anniversary and our heritage. An eye-catching example of that advertising is in the November issue of Vogue magazine, where we ran an unprecedented 10-page opening spread about the legacy gemstones of Tiffany. If you haven't seen the ad, please contact me for a copy.
And I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat."

I will now take everyone through the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 54.4% in the third quarter was below the 57.9% gross margin in last year's third quarter. We are already forecasting a margin decline",1297,"Thanks, Mark, for that sales review. I will now take everyone through the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 54.4% in the third quarter was below the 57.9% gross margin in last year's third quarter. We are already forecasting a margin decline in the quarter, but this is more than we expected. So what changed from our previous forecast? Part of it was higher-than-expected product cost tied to the sales mix by product category. In essence, our sales of fashion jewelry, specifically silver jewelry, were softer than we expected and this slower turn meant that lower silver cost did not flow through the earnings statement as quickly as we had expected. In addition, our product sales mix that is skewed towards higher-priced lower margin products puts pressure on gross margin and we are not yet seeing the benefit we expected from lower diamond cost flowing through the system. We saw some reduced leveraging of fixed expenses, but we expected that due to the modest sales growth. As a result, the lower gross margin cost us about $0.08 per share of earnings in the quarter. We expect that gross margin will improve as we flow through the lower product cost by the end of this year, but fourth quarter margin will still be lower than last year's fourth quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% in the third quarter. This was close to what we expected due to the growth in store occupancy and marketing spending. Higher labor cost in the quarter were mostly offset by reduced variable incentive compensation. The ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales was 40.7% versus 40.1% in last year's third quarter.
Other expenses net of $14.8 million were up from $10.4 million last year and in line with what we expected. This reflected higher interest expense related to increased debt, which included the $250 million of long-term debt with a 4.4% coupon that we issued during the second quarter. 
The effective tax rate of 38.4% in the third quarter was up from a rate of 33.9% in last year's third quarter. The higher-than-expected rate was primarily due to the true-up of the prior year's tax provision upon filing our tax return, as well as some changes in our geographic mix of earnings that affected our overall tax rate. The higher rate was equivalent to about $0.03 in earnings per share. 
Adding it all up, the modest sales growth, the lower gross margin and the higher effective tax rate resulted in net earnings of $63 million, being 30% below last year's third quarter and below our internal forecast. Return on average stockholders' equity was 17% on a trailing basis and return on average assets was 10%. 
While the near-term economic outlook remains uncertain, we do think we are well positioned for the holiday season and we are moving forward with exciting store, product and marketing plans that will benefit Tiffany over the longer term, and we have the financial means to pursue those initiatives. Looking at our balance sheet, we finished the third quarter with $346 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus $297 million a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt was $978 million versus $709 million a year ago. And that total debt represented 40% of stockholders' equity versus 31% a year ago. And as we noted in today's news release, we did not repurchase any of our shares in the third quarter. 
Net inventories of $2.3 billion at October 31, were 11% higher than a year ago. Looking more closely at it, finished goods inventories were up 17% from last year while the total of raw materials and working process inventories were 2% above last year. These increases reflected a variety of factors, primarily new store openings, expanded product assortments and higher product acquisition costs. Looking at inventory growth sequentially, we have experienced decelerating rate of inventory growth over the past few quarters. Net inventories at January 31, 2012, were 28% over the prior year. At April 30, they were 27% above the prior year. At July 31, they were 21% above the prior year, and they are now 11% higher than a year ago. We project that net inventories at year end will be approximately 10% above the prior year. 
Tiffany's 2 major distribution centers in New Jersey were closed for a few days after Hurricane Sandy, which temporarily affected store replenishment and customer order fulfillment, but they are now operating normally. 
Now -- let's now turn to our financial outlook, which we updated in today's news release. We are now projecting full year sales to increase 5% to 6% versus our previous 6% to 7% forecast. Our annual forecast implies that total sales growth in the fourth quarter will be in a mid- to high-single-digit range with a low- to mid-single-digit comp store sales increase. 
While we have moderated our expectations for the Americas and Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter, we are still looking for year-over-year sales growth in all regions. By early December, we have anniversaried all of last year's price increases. So our fourth quarter forecast assumes improvement in unit volume growth primarily coming from the easier year-over-year comparison. 
We've been pleased overall with initial results in the stores we've opened in 2012. We continue to project a net of 28 stores added in 2012, with just 4 more stores opening in the fourth quarter, including 1 in La Jolla, California, which opened 2 weeks ago; our fourth store in Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro; our sixth store in Australia and second in Sydney in Bondi Junction; and our 22nd store in China in the Galaxy Mall in Tianjin. And we'll soon close a store in Chiba, Japan that was replaced by a new one that opened in the third quarter. 
As Mark alluded to earlier, we have been very encouraged with initial customer reaction to our newly introduced jewelry collections this year. This has included the launch of the new RUBEDO metal in our 1837 collection and which we have just now expanded into our Return to Tiffany collection; the new Enchant collection crafted in platinum with diamonds, rose gold and tanzanite; the introduction of pink diamonds, which expands our assortment of fancy-colored diamonds; Tiffany's Harmony collection of engagement rings and wedding bands, which was launched exclusively in Japan and will be distributed globally next year; and we have expanded our Yellow Diamonds collection and our assortment of important engagement jewelry.
We are projecting that operating margin for the full year will be lower than last year. All of the decline will come from a lower gross margin with SG&A expense growth in line with sales growth. 
Adding it all up, we now expect earnings in a range of $409 million to $435 million for the year, with $3.20 to $3.40 per diluted share versus a previous forecast of $3.55 to $3.70 per diluted share. About 1/3 of the delta comes from the third quarter shortfall and 2/3 comes from our reduced sales and gross margin assumptions for the fourth quarter. This implies fourth quarter EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.55 versus $1.39 per diluted share last year.
We are now almost halfway through the holiday season calendar, but from a sales perspective, the most important part of the holiday season is clearly still ahead of us. Third quarter earnings were below what we had expected. However, the competitive advantages are in place for Tiffany to achieve better performance. We will not compromise on our proven approach to investing in and managing our business for long-term success.
Thanks for listening to today's conference call. Please note that we expect to report Tiffany's sales for the November-December holiday sales period on January 10. Here is Mark again."

Now let's talk about the results. In summary, a 4% increase in worldwide net sales in the third quarter was virtually on our expectation with some offsets by region. The gross margin declined more than we expected. SG&A spending was very close to our expectation, but the effective tax rate was higher than expected. All of this resulted in net earnings of $63 million, which were 30% below the prior year and below the expectation that was embedded in our previous annual guidance. While these results partly reflect the weak consumer demand in a number of markets, among other factors, let's remember that we also faced very difficult year-over-year comparisons when net sales had increased 21% and net earnings had grown 52%, excluding nonrecurring items in last year's third quarter. But having said that, these results were below what we had forecast.
Let's start by reviewing third quarter sales by region, which ranged from modest growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in the Americas, Japan and Asia Pacific to solid growth in Europe. In the Americas, sales rose 3%, with an increase in average price partly offset by lower jewelry unit volume. Not to minimize the unit decline, but it is worth noting that the entire volume drop was in silver jewelry at price points below $500, while every other jewelry category at higher price strata posted increased volume. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales also rose 3% and comparable store sales rose 1%, which was on top of a 15% comp in last year's third quarter. Despite the tough comparison, this was still below our expectation.
Geographically, Americas branch store comps declined 1% but had a difficult comparison to a 13% comp increase last year. Most markets performed in a narrow range, and there were no noteworthy market deviations from the norm. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 5% on top of a 24% increase last year, benefiting from some growth in sales to foreign tourists and U.S. customers. While we can no longer report foreign tourism data for the U.S. in its entirety due to legal restrictions on the collection of customer data in several of our important markets, sales to foreign visitors will continue to be of growing importance to certain of our U.S. stores. 
In early October, we had hosted a successful selling event in New York for Tiffany's highest spending customers. Their marked enthusiasm was encouraging. In the last few days of the quarter, sales were obviously affected by Hurricane Sandy, which caused the temporary closing of 24 of our U.S. stores from D.C. up to Boston. Most stores reopened within a few days as power was restored in their markets. The New York flagship itself was closed for 2 days. 
It's hard to know how much of a residual effect on sales might be felt in the fourth quarter, but regional management has factored some into their latest forecast. Most important, the hurricane was a tragic occurrence for millions of people and our thoughts are with those who have suffered from it.
Elsewhere in the Americas, comp store sales declined in Canada, but we achieved double-digit comp store sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in both Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we added 7 stores in the Americas region, including our new SoHo store in Manhattan; a store in the San Francisco Centre, marking our second in that city; a store in Sherway Gardens, which is our third store in Toronto; and we converted 4 locations in Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada and Calgary, Montréal, Ottawa and Vancouver from wholesale distribution to company-operated stores. We now operate a total of 11 stores in Canada. 
Rounding out the region, our combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas rose modestly in the quarter. We recently mailed a newly designed catalog with a fresh and enticing look that customers should be seeing in their mailboxes around now. Please let me know if you'd like a copy.
Without a doubt, the most difficult year-over-year sales comparison we had in the quarter was in the Asia Pacific region, but sales did meet our expectations. Total sales rose 2% in the quarter, driven by higher jewelry unit volume in all categories and a small decline in average price. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales also rose 2% and comp store sales declined 4% on top of a huge 36% comp increase last year. Tiffany is certainly not alone in experiencing some softness in Chinese consumer spending due to a plethora of economic and other factors.
Geographically, the softness in Greater China, especially in Hong Kong, mostly offset modest growth in other Asia Pacific markets. Notwithstanding what we have seen this year, we remain confident that China will experience significant economic growth in the years ahead and that the Chinese will continue to increase in importance as customers of Tiffany and other luxury goods purveyors. During the quarter, we added 2 new stores in China, in Harbin and Shenyang, and opened our second store in Singapore's Changi Airport. 
We were pleased with our performance in Japan, with sales in the quarter fractionally higher than last year and meeting our expectations. Higher average price offset lower jewelry unit volume. In yen, total sales rose 3% and comps rose 5% on top of a 4% increase last year. Sales growth was a bit stronger in the Tokyo region than elsewhere. During the quarter, we opened a new department store location in Chiba that replaces a soon-to-be closed shop in a different department store. 
We were also pleased with the results in Europe, where sales rose 6% in the quarter due to a combination of increased price and a slight increase in jewelry unit volume. This exceeded our expectations. In constant currencies, European sales rose 11% and comp stores sales rose 8% on top of a 6% comp increase from last year's third quarter.
Geographically, local currency comp store sales growth throughout Continental Europe, except Italy, more than offset some softness in the U.K. The sales increase benefited from higher foreign tourist sales. During the quarter, we added our 34th location in Europe when we opened a store in Prague. And just a few weeks ago, we were excited to announce that we will open a flagship store in Paris on the magnificent Champs-Elysées in 2014. While we have developed a successful but still relatively small business in Paris over the past decade, we believe this store will take Tiffany's presence to new heights by providing an extraordinary location and experience to international visitors and French customers. 
Lastly, our other sales increased 73% in the third quarter. This mostly reflected the realignment in the second quarter when we converted 5 Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates from previously wholesale distribution to now company-operated stores in which we record retail sales and expenses. We are progressing very well in making merchandising, marketing and service enhancements as part of our longer-term plan to develop a significant presence in the Middle East.
That concludes the regional sales review. From a product and pricing perspective, we achieved growth in sales and units at most price points above $500. Therefore, from a product category perspective, sales of silver jewelry continued to be the weakest category. At higher price points, we posted modest sales growth in engagement rings and wedding bands. Designer jewelry sales were up. In the fine and fashion jewelry categories, we're seeing good growth in our expanding Yellow Diamonds collection, the Enchant jewelry collection is enjoying a good launch and the 1837 collection with the new RUBEDO metal is doing well. As we said 3 months ago, the difficult year-over-year comparisons in most categories make it challenging to assess more fundamental performance except to say that sales of higher price point jewelry continue to outperform entry-level silver jewelry.

Other expenses net of $14.8 million were up from $10.4 million last year and in line with what we expected. This reflected higher interest expense related to increased debt, which included the $250 million of long-term debt with a 4.4% coupon that we issued during the second quarter. 
The effective tax rate of 38.4% in the third quarter was up from a rate of 33.9% in last year's third quarter. The higher-than-expected rate was primarily due to the true-up of the prior year's tax provision upon filing our tax return, as well as some changes in our geographic mix of earnings that affected our overall tax rate. The higher rate was equivalent to about $0.03 in earnings per share. 
Adding it all up, the modest sales growth, the lower gross margin and the higher effective tax rate resulted in net earnings of $63 million, being 30% below last year's third quarter and below our internal forecast. Return on average stockholders' equity was 17% on a trailing basis and return on average assets was 10%. 
While the near-term economic outlook remains uncertain, we do think we are well positioned for the holiday season and we are moving forward with exciting store, product and marketing plans that will benefit Tiffany over the longer term, and we have the financial means to pursue those initiatives. Looking at our balance sheet, we finished the third quarter with $346 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus $297 million a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt was $978 million versus $709 million a year ago. And that total debt represented 40% of stockholders' equity versus 31% a year ago. And as we noted in today's news release, we did not repurchase any of our shares in the third quarter. 
Net inventories of $2.3 billion at October 31, were 11% higher than a year ago. Looking more closely at it, finished goods inventories were up 17% from last year while the total of raw materials and working process inventories were 2% above last year. These increases reflected a variety of factors, primarily new store openings, expanded product assortments and higher product acquisition costs. Looking at inventory growth sequentially, we have experienced decelerating rate of inventory growth over the past few quarters. Net inventories at January 31, 2012 were 28% over the prior year. At April 30, they were 27% above the prior year. At July 31, they were 21% above the prior year, and they are now 11% higher than a year ago. We project that net inventories at year end will be approximately 10% above the prior year. 
Tiffany's 2 major distribution centers in New Jersey were closed for a few days after Hurricane Sandy, which temporarily affected store replenishment and customer order fulfillment, but they are now operating normally. 
Now -- let's now turn to our financial outlook, which we updated in today's news release. We are now projecting full year sales to increase 5% to 6% versus our previous 6% to 7% forecast. Our annual forecast implies that total sales growth in the fourth quarter will be in a mid- to high-single-digit range with a low- to mid-single-digit comp store sales increase. 
While we have moderated our expectations for the Americas and Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter, we are still looking for year-over-year sales growth in all regions. By early December, we have anniversaried all of last year's price increases. So our fourth quarter forecast assumes improvement in unit volume growth primarily coming from the easier year-over-year comparisons. 
We've been pleased overall with initial results in the stores we've opened in 2012. We continue to project a net of 28 stores added in 2012, with just 4 more stores opening in the fourth quarter, including 1 in La Jolla, California, which opened 2 weeks ago; our fourth store in Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro; our sixth store in Australia and second in Sydney in Bondi Junction; and our 22nd store in China in the Galaxy Mall in Tianjin. And we'll soon close a store in Chiba, Japan that was replaced by a new one that opened in the third quarter. 
As Mark alluded to earlier, we have been very encouraged with initial customer reaction to our newly introduced jewelry collections this year. This has included the launch of the new RUBEDO metal in our 1837 collection and which we have just now expanded into our Return to Tiffany collection; the new Enchant collection crafted in platinum with diamonds, rose gold and tanzanite; the introduction of pink diamonds, which expands our assortment of fancy-colored diamonds; Tiffany's Harmony collection of engagement rings and wedding bands, which was launched exclusively in Japan and will be distributed globally next year; and we have expanded our Yellow Diamond collection and our assortment of important engagement jewelry.
We are projecting that operating margin for the full year will be lower than last year. All of the decline will come from a lower gross margin with SG&A expense growth in line with sales growth. 
Adding it all up, we now expect earnings in a range of $409 million to $435 million for the year, or $3.20 to $3.40 per diluted share versus a previous forecast of $3.55 to $3.70 per diluted share. About 1/3 of the delta comes from the third quarter shortfall and 2/3 comes from our reduced sales in gross margin assumptions for the fourth quarter. This implies fourth quarter EPS in a range of $1.35 to $1.55 versus $1.39 per diluted share last year.
We are now almost halfway through the holiday season calendar, but from a sales perspective, the most important part of the holiday season is clearly still ahead of us. Third quarter earnings were below what we had expected. However, the competitive advantages are in place for Tiffany to achieve better performance. We will not compromise on our proven approach to investing in and managing our business for long-term success.
Thanks for listening to today's conference call. Please note that we expect to report Tiffany's sales for the November-December holiday sales period on January 10. Here is Mark again."

Now let's talk about the results. In summary, a 4% increase in worldwide net sales in the third quarter was virtually on our expectation with some offsets by region. The gross margin declined more than we expected. SG&A spending was very close to our expectation, but the effective tax rate was higher than expected. All of this resulted in net earnings of $63 million, which were 30% below the prior year and below the expectation that was embedded in our previous annual guidance. While these results partly reflect the weak consumer demand in a number of markets, among other factors, let's remember that we also faced very difficult year-over-year comparisons when net sales had increased 21% and net earnings had grown 52%, excluding nonrecurring items in last year's third quarter. But having said that, these results were below what we had forecast.
Let's start by reviewing third quarter sales by region, which ranged from modest growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in the Americas, Japan and Asia Pacific to solid growth in Europe. In the Americas, sales rose 3%, with an increase in average price partly offset by lower jewelry unit volume. Not to minimize the unit decline, but it is worth noting that the entire volume drop was in silver jewelry at price points below $500, while every other jewelry category at higher price strata posted increased volume. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales also rose 3% and comparable store sales rose 1%, which was on top of a 15% comp in last year's third quarter. Despite the tough comparison, this was still below our expectation.
Geographically, Americas branch store comps declined 1% but had a difficult comparison to a 13% comp increase last year. Most markets performed in a narrow range, and there were no noteworthy market deviations from the norm. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 5% on top of a 24% increase last year, benefiting from some growth in sales to foreign tourists and U.S. customers. While we can no longer report foreign tourism data for the U.S. in its entirety due to legal restrictions on the collection of customer data in several of our important markets, sales to foreign visitors will continue to be of growing importance to certain of our U.S. stores. 
In early October, we had hosted a successful selling event in New York for Tiffany's highest spending customers. Their marked enthusiasm was encouraging. In the last few days of the quarter, sales were obviously affected by Hurricane Sandy, which caused the temporary closing of 24 of our U.S. stores from D.C. up to Boston. Most stores reopened within a few days as power was restored in their markets. The New York flagship itself was closed for 2 days. 
It's hard to know how much of a residual effect on sales might be felt in the fourth quarter, but regional management has factored some into their latest forecast. Most important, the hurricane was a tragic occurrence for millions of people and our thoughts are with those who have suffered from it.
Elsewhere in the Americas, comp store sales declined in Canada, but we achieved double-digit comp store sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis in both Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we added 7 stores in the Americas region, including our new SoHo store in Manhattan; a store in the San Francisco Centre, marking our second in that city; a store in Sherway Gardens, which is our third store in Toronto; and we converted 4 locations in Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada and Calgary, Montréal, Ottawa and Vancouver from wholesale distribution to company-operated stores. We now operate a total of 11 stores in Canada. 
Rounding out the region, our combined Internet and catalog sales in the Americas rose modestly in the quarter. We recently mailed a newly designed catalog with a fresh and enticing look that customers should be seeing in their mailboxes around now. Please let me know if you'd like a copy.
Without a doubt, the most difficult year-over-year sales comparison we had in the quarter was in the Asia Pacific region, but sales did meet our expectations. Total sales rose 2% in the quarter, driven by higher jewelry unit volume in all categories and a small decline in average price. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales also rose 2% and comp store sales declined 4% on top of a huge 36% comp increase last year. Tiffany is certainly not alone in experiencing some softness in Chinese consumer spending due to a plethora of economic and other factors.
Geographically, the softness in Greater China, especially in Hong Kong, mostly offset modest growth in other Asia Pacific markets. Notwithstanding what we have seen this year, we remain confident that China will experience significant economic growth in the years ahead and that the Chinese will continue to increase in importance as customers of Tiffany and other luxury goods purveyors. During the quarter, we added 2 new stores in China, in Harbin and Shenyang, and opened our second store in Singapore's Changi Airport. 
We were pleased with our performance in Japan, with sales in the quarter fractionally higher than last year and meeting our expectations. Higher average price offset lower jewelry unit volume. In yen, total sales rose 3% and comps rose 5% on top of a 4% increase last year. Sales growth was a bit stronger in the Tokyo region than elsewhere. During the quarter, we opened a new department store location in Chiba that replaces a soon-to-be closed shop in a different department store. 
We were also pleased with the results in Europe, where sales rose 6% in the quarter due to a combination of increased price and a slight increase in jewelry unit volume. This exceeded our expectations. In constant currencies, European sales rose 11% and comp stores sales rose 8% on top of a 6% comp increase from last year's third quarter.
Geographically, local currency comp store sales growth throughout Continental Europe, except Italy, more than offset some softness in the U.K. The sales increase benefited from higher foreign tourist sales. During the quarter, we added our 34th location in Europe when we opened a store in Prague. And just a few weeks ago, we were excited to announce that we will open a flagship store in Paris on the magnificent Champs-Elysées in 2014. While we have developed a successful but still relatively small business in Paris over the past decade, we believe this store will take Tiffany's presence to new heights by providing an extraordinary location and experience to international visitors and French customers. 
Lastly, our other sales increased 73% in the third quarter. This mostly reflected the realignment in the second quarter when we converted 5 Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates from previously wholesale distribution to now company-operated stores in which we record retail sales and expenses. We are progressing very well in making merchandising, marketing and service enhancements as part of our longer-term plan to develop a significant presence in the Middle East.
That concludes the regional sales review. From a product and pricing perspective, we achieved growth in sales and units at most price points above $500. Therefore, from a product category perspective, sales of silver jewelry continued to be the weakest category. At higher price points, we posted modest sales growth in engagement rings and wedding bands. Designer jewelry sales were up. In the fine and fashion jewelry categories, we're seeing good growth in our expanding Yellow Diamonds collection, the Enchant jewelry collection is enjoying a good launch and the 1837 collection with the new RUBEDO metal is doing well. As we said 3 months ago, the difficult year-over-year comparisons in most categories make it challenging to assess more fundamental performance except to say that sales of higher price point jewelry continue to outperform entry-level silver jewelry. 
Supporting product sales is a robust marketing campaign. Our advertising through print and digital media and catalogs always showcases the extraordinary beauty and range of our product offerings. But this year and next, the advertising also highlights Tiffany's 175th anniversary and our heritage. An eye-catching example of that advertising is in the November issue of Vogue magazine, where we ran an unprecedented 10-page opening spread about the legacy gemstones of Tiffany. If you haven't seen the ad, please contact me for a copy.
And I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat."

I will now take everyone through the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 54.4% in the third quarter was below the 57.9% gross margin in last year's third quarter. We are already forecasting a margin decline",1297,"Thanks, Mark, for that sales review. I will now take everyone through the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 54.4% in the third quarter was below the 57.9% gross margin in last year's third quarter. We are already forecasting a margin decline in the quarter, but this is more than we expected. 
So what changed from our previous forecast? Part of it was higher-than-expected product cost tied to the sales mix by product category. In essence, our sales of fashion jewelry, specifically silver jewelry, were softer than we expected and this slower turn meant that lower silver cost did not flow through the earnings statement as quickly as we had expected. In addition, a product sales mix that is skewed towards higher-priced lower margin products puts pressure on gross margin and we are not yet seeing the benefit we expected from lower diamond cost flowing through the system. We saw some reduced leveraging of fixed expenses, but we expected that due to the modest sales growth. As a result, the lower gross margin cost us about $0.08 per share of earnings in the quarter. We expect that gross margin will improve as we flow through the lower product cost by the end of this year, but fourth quarter margin will still be lower than last year's fourth quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% in the third quarter. This was close to what we expected due to the growth in store occupancy and marketing spending. Higher labor cost in the quarter were mostly offset by reduced variable incentive compensation. The ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales was 40.7% versus 40.1% in last year's third quarter.
Other expenses net of $14.8 million were up from $10.4 million last year and in line with what we expected. This reflected higher interest expense related to increased debt, which included the $250 million of long-term debt with a 4.4% coupon that we issued during the second quarter. 
The effective tax rate of 38.4% in the third quarter was up from a rate of 33.9% in last year's third quarter. The higher-than-expected rate was primarily due to the true-up of the prior year's tax provision upon filing our tax return, as well as some changes in our geographic mix of earnings that affected our overall tax rate. The higher rate was equivalent to about $0.03 in earnings per share. 
Adding it all up, the modest sales growth, the lower gross margin and the higher effective tax rate resulted in net earnings of $63 million, being 30% below last year's third quarter and below our internal forecast. Return on average stockholders' equity was 17% on a trailing basis and return on average assets was 10%. 
While the near-term economic outlook remains uncertain, we do think we are well positioned for the holiday season and we are moving forward with exciting store, product and marketing plans that will benefit Tiffany over the longer term, and we have the financial means to pursue those initiatives. Looking at our balance sheet, we finished the third quarter with $346 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus $297 million a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt was $978 million versus $709 million a year ago. And that total debt represented 40% of stockholders' equity versus 31% a year ago. And as we noted in today's news release, we did not repurchase any of our shares in the third quarter. 
Net inventories of $2.3 billion at October 31, were 11% higher than a year ago. Looking more closely at it, finished goods inventories were up 17% from last year while the total of raw materials and working process inventories were 2% above last year. These increases reflected a variety of factors, primarily new store openings, expanded product assortments and higher product acquisition costs. Looking at inventory growth sequentially, we have experienced decelerating rate of inventory growth over the past few quarters. Net inventories at January 31, 2012 were 28% over the prior year. At April 30, they were 27% above the prior year. At July 31, they were 21% above the prior year, and they are now 11% higher than a year ago. We project that net inventories at year end will be approximately 10% above the prior year. 
Tiffany's 2 major distribution centers in New Jersey were closed for a few days after Hurricane Sandy, which temporarily affected store replenishment and customer order fulfillment, but they are now operating normally. 
Now -- let's now turn to our financial outlook, which we updated in today's news release. We are now projecting full year sales to increase 5% to 6% versus our previous 6% to 7% forecast. Our annual forecast implies that total sales growth in the fourth quarter will be in a mid- to high-single-digit range with a low- to mid-single-digit comp store sales increase. 
While we have moderated our expectations for the Americas and Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter, we are still looking for year-over-year sales growth in all regions. By early December, we have anniversaried all of last year's price increases. So our fourth quarter forecast assumes improvement in unit volume growth primarily coming from the easier year-over-year comparisons. 
We've been pleased overall with initial results in the stores we've opened in 2012. We continue to project a net of 28 stores added in 2012, with just 4 more stores opening in the fourth quarter, including 1 in La Jolla, California, which opened 2 weeks ago; our fourth store in Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro; our sixth store in Australia and second in Sydney in Bondi Junction; and our 22nd store in China in the Galaxy Mall in Tianjin. And we'll soon close a store in Chiba, Japan that was replaced by a new one that opened in the third quarter. 
As Mark alluded to earlier, we have been very encouraged with initial customer reaction to our newly introduced jewelry collections this year. This has included the launch of the new RUBEDO metal in our 1837 collection and which we have just now expanded into our Return to Tiffany collection; the new Enchant collection crafted in platinum with diamonds, rose gold and tanzanite; the introduction of pink diamonds, which expands our assortment of fancy-colored diamonds; Tiffany's Harmony collection of engagement rings and wedding bands, which was launched exclusively in Japan and will be distributed globally next year; and we have expanded our Yellow Diamond collection and our assortment of important engagement jewelry.
We are projecting that operating margin for the full year will be lower than last year. All of the decline will come from a lower gross margin with SG&A expense growth in line with sales growth. 
Adding it all up, we now expect earnings in a range of $409 million to $435 million for the year, or $3.20 to $3.40 per diluted share versus a previous forecast of $3.55 to $3.70 per diluted share. About 1/3 of the delta comes from the third quarter shortfall and 2/3 comes from our reduced sales and gross margin assumptions for the fourth quarter. This implies fourth quarter EPS in a range of $1.35 to $1.55 versus $1.39 per diluted share last year.
