Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights and I’ll then speak to recent regulatory developments and finish with comments on our outlook for 2012. After our prepared remarks, we’ll be happy to respond to your questions.
Fourth quarter revenue of $567 million was flat as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. With strong performance by Moody’s Analytics and global structured finance offsetting a decline from the strong prior year period in corporate finance. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $172 million, a 12% decrease from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.43 decreased 26% year-over-year.
For full year 2011, Moody’s revenue of $2.3 billion was a 12% increase from full year 2010. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody’s Investors Service revenue by $28 million and was negligible for Moody’s Analytics. Operating income of $888 million increased 15% from a year ago and included a $4 million favorable impact from foreign currency translations.
Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service was $1.6 billion, an increase of 12% from last year. Moody’s Analytics revenue was $712 million, 14% higher than the prior year. Diluted earnings per share of $2.49 for 2011 increased 16% and included a legacy tax benefit of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2011 as well as other tax benefits of $0.09 in the second and third quarters of 2011 resulting from a favorable tax ruling in a settlement of state tax audits.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates.

As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter was essentially flat at $567 million. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. fourth quarter revenue decreased 3",793,"Thanks, Ray. I’ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter was essentially flat at $567 million. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. fourth quarter revenue decreased 3% to $286 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 4% to $281 million and represented 50% of Moody’s total revenue, up from 48% in the year ago period. Recurring revenue of $318 million represented 56% of the total, compared to 52% in the prior year period.
And looking now at each of our businesses, Moody’s Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $367 million, a 4% decrease year-over-year. U.S. revenue decreased 9% over the prior year period, while outside the U.S. revenue increased 2% and represented 44% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 14% from the year ago period to $141 million. Revenue was down 13% in the U.S. while outside the U.S. revenue was lower by 16% year-over-year. The decline in global corporate finance revenue reflected weaker issuance, primarily in speculative grade bonds and loans in both the U.S. and Europe.
Global structured finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $87 million, 14% above the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 13% year-over-year primarily due to strength in asset-backed securities. Most other areas of U.S. structured finance market remained weak. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue rose 15%, driven primarily by European asset-backed and residential mortgage backed securities, as well as covered bonds in Europe and Asia.
Global financial institutions revenue of $67 million increased 2% from the same quarter in 2010, with U.S. revenue declining 7%, while non-U.S. revenue grew 7%.
Global revenue for public, project and Infrastructure declined 6% year-over-year to $72 million. Revenue decreased 14% in the U.S., reflecting a reduction in new financing for projects and infrastructure programs. Non-U.S. revenue increased 14% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector.
And turning now to Moody’s Analytics, global revenue for Moody’s Analytics of $200 million is up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2010. U.S. revenue grew by 15% year-over-year to $81 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 7% to $119 million and represented 60% of total Moody’s Analytics revenue. Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $115 million increased 6% from the prior-year period due primarily to higher customer retention rates and represented 58% of total MA revenue.
Revenue from risk management software of $56 million fell 3% from last year’s record revenue in this segment. Due to the variable nature of project timing, risk management software revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility. The December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert had a negligible impact on software revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. Professional services revenue doubled to $29 million reflecting both organic growth and the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Moody’s fourth quarter expenses were $395 million, an increase of 7% compared to fourth quarter 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation on fourth quarter expenses was negligible. Moody’s reported operating margin for the quarter was 30.3%, down from 34.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to increased head count and technology investments to support growth initiatives, as well as acquisition related costs. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37% compared with 19.5% for the prior-year period. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to utilization of foreign tax credits and lower state taxes in 2010.
Now I’ll provide an update on capital allocation. Moody’s increased its quarterly dividend on December 14 by 14% to $0.16 per share of common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Moody’s did not repurchase any shares, but did issue 0.4 million shares under employee stock based compensation plans. For the full year 2011, Moody’s repurchased 11 million shares at a total cost of $334 million for an average price of $30.30 per share and issued 2.9 million shares under employee based stock compensation plans.
Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2011, totaled $222 million, representing a 4% decline from a year earlier. As of year-end, Moody’s had $0.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. As of December 31, Moody’s had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $760 million, an increase of $100 million from a year earlier. Approximately 70% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. Share repurchase remains subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.
And with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Ray.

I’ll continue with an update on regulatory developments. In the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act.

In the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer comment deadline for rule proposals relevant to NRSROs, the SEC recently revised its timetable and is expected to adopt final rules by year-end 2012.
It is also expected to publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products, otherwise known as the Franken Amendment, by about the same time. Both banking and securities regulatory authorities are in the process of reviewing their use of ratings and regulation and considering alternative measures as replacements.
Turing to Europe, Moody’s was registered in the European Union in late October 2011, and as I have indicated on previous calls, the transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities Markets Authority, ESMA, became effective in July 2011. Our European operations are therefore under the full examination and oversight authority of ESMA and we expect ESMA to publish the first report on its review of the industry sometime in the second quarter of 2012.
In addition, the European Commission has proposed a new round of regulatory measures for the rating agency industry. Specifically, the suggested measures address, among other ideas, the use of ratings and regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability. The various concepts the Commission has introduced in its proposal focus on how and to what extent rating agencies operate in the EU.
If implemented as currently constructed, however, the Commission suggested measures may have significant and negative ramifications on the European credit markets. Consequently, the debate on CRA 3 has been active and ongoing since its formal release by the Commission. In particular, on January 24, the European Parliament held a hearing through which it solicited views from a broad spectrum of market participants who generally sounded a cautionary note. Because of the tone of the debate thus far, it is possible that during the coming months, the Commission’s proposals will be amended.
The next stages of the legislative process include deliberation and potential amendments by both the European Parliament and the Council of European Finance Ministers. The Parliament, Council and Commission must all confer and agree on a final text. We expect this process to take anywhere from 4 months to 8 months during which time we will continue to consult with relevant authorities and market participants as to the impact of the specific proposals.
While new rules entail various changes in our rating agency processes and operations and require us to adapt our business, we will not alter our fundamental objective to provide the highest quality independent credit opinions, research and analysis. We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20’s statements and directives.
Before concluding today’s remarks by reviewing our 2012 outlook, I’ll briefly comment on our acquisitions of a majority stake in Copal Partners and of Barrie & Hibbert during the fourth quarter of 2011. Copal is an India-based, outsource research and consulting business that strongly complements the research, analysis, and professional services offerings of Moody’s Analytics. The acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, a Scotland-based, leading provider of analytical tools for the global insurance industry, is consistent with our ongoing commitment to build a comprehensive suite of enterprise risk management solutions for financial institutions. Together, these acquisitions are expected to be accretive to EPS in 2012.
I will conclude this morning’s prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance for 2012. Moody’s outlook for 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity and consumer borrowing and securitization. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. We expect business conditions to remain challenging, particularly early in the year, but still project growth across most areas of our business in 2012. For Moody’s overall, the company expects full year 2012 growth to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also projected to increase in the high single to low double-digit percent range.
Full year 2012 operating margin is projected to be approximately 39%, which includes the full year impact of our fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions. Our effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 33%. We continue - we expect to continue share repurchase subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. The company expects diluted earnings per share for the full year 2012 in the range of $2.62 to $2.72.
For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2012 is expected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range. Within the U.S. MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenue is expected to be about flat.
Corporate finance revenue is forecasted to grow in the high single digit percent range. Revenue from each of structured finance and financial institutions is projected to be flat to slightly down while public, project and Infrastructure finance revenue is expected to increase in the low-teens percent range.
For Moody’s Analytics, full year 2012 revenue is expected to increase in the high teens percent range both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Revenue growth is projected in the mid single digit percent range for research data and analytics and in the low 20%s range for risk management software, reflecting growth in the core business as well as the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert. Professional services revenue is projected to grow by approximately 70%, inclusive of revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners and continued growth in our legacy businesses.
This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question and answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s Analytics. We’d be pleased to take any questions you may have.

I think first, though, we should note that 2011 was a year of record revenue for Moody’s and we’re back above our 2007 high. So we think we should get that into the mix, Peter.
Let me talk a little bit about fourth quarter 2011 as compared to fourth quarter of 2010. And the fourth quarter of 2010 we put up $0.58 and the number is $0.43 for the fourth quarter of 2011. The main bridge that gets you there is just a difference in the tax rate. We had an abnormally low tax rate in fourth quarter of 2010. As we had said earlier, the tax rate for 2010 was about 19% and we’re running about 37% for the fourth quarter of 2011. So basically we have a doubling of the effective tax rate for the quarter. That change gets you about $0.12.
And then the remainder of the $0.03 to get to the bridge, we have some deal costs from these acquisitions we’ve done in the fourth quarter. We had some other expenses including a sales tax matter and a contribution to our foundation. And then we’ve got some other things in terms of bringing some IT costs and other systems online. So the main driver in the difference for the fourth quarter of 2011 is really the tax rate and there’s not much more to it than that.

So we’re looking at about a $28 million increase over that period. Basically, it splits, as I’ve mentioned, about a third, a third, a third in terms of deal costs. The two deals that we did in the fourth quarter were expensive to get done. We had a success fee in the Copal deal, which is unusual for us to pay, so take $9-ish million on deal costs and other things related to those acquisitions.
Another third of it, another chunk of it would be, as I said, another tax matter, which revolves around sales tax and a donation to our foundation, the sort of two costs in the other category. And then thirdly, we have these systems we’re bringing online and some consulting fees mainly to get ready for Dodd-Frank. So basically those are the three components of the $28 million of expense difference between this year’s fourth quarter and last year’s fourth quarter.

We didn’t - as it turned out, we really didn’t see that. The business held up throughout the year better than I had anticipated and we are currently looking at that run rate to continue through 2012.
Obviously, there are going to be areas of relative strength and relative weakness in structured finance. For example, we still don’t see any significant RMBS activity here in the U.S. and we will have to see what the impact in Europe is of some of the one-time items that were driving business last year. But the ABS market in particular, both in the U.S. and in Europe, has held up well. And to the extent that there is a willingness to - well, to the extent that there are interest rates and spreads that make securitization attractive, there is potentially some upside to that business. But right now, we would say that we expect the run rate from 2011 to be reflected in the business in 2012.
As to share, I think that’s more - probably more driven by which parts of structured finance happen to be active or inactive at any given point in time. There are some areas where we have strength relative to our competitors in terms of our analytic framework and there are some other areas where issuers and investors may prefer the business from our competitors. So it really is driven by which areas are active from quarter-to-quarter.

But what we’re seeing, and this is very recent, is an improvement in market tone, volatility has come down, spreads have been coming in, and those are all leading indicators of what helps build the pipeline. So early January, I would say we were pretty cautious about how the pipelines looked and what that meant for the business. As I said, more recently, some of the leading indicators are more promising.
We do still expect that the second half of the year is going to be the stronger half. We do not expect this year to look like last year. So we would not anticipate having strong growth in the first half this year in the corporate area, off of what we saw last year because it was so strong last year.

January investment grade issuance is on track with 2011, about an $80 billion issuance month for the month of January. Interestingly, there are seven deals in the market today and activity has been very active in February so far. What’s interesting is if you look at the forward calendar for high yield, we see 13 high yield deals in the pipeline, which is better than we’ve seen for quite some time.
Spreads are sort of around 650 basis points or over for high yield right now. If we can get under 600 basis points, we think we’re going to start to see a lot of those deals coming. So conditions are for this moment, and again to follow-up on what Ray said, can change it any moment, but for this moment conditions are looking relatively good and you’ll see a lot of companies coming to market getting record low all-in financing costs, which obviously is very helpful to our business.

Let’s talk about expenses for 2012.

After our prepared remarks, we’ll be happy to respond to your questions.
Fourth quarter revenue of $567 million was flat as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, with strong performance by Moody’s Analytics and global structured finance offsetting a decline from the strong prior year period in corporate finance. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $172 million, a 12% decrease from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.43 decreased 26% year-over-year.
For full year 2011, Moody’s revenue of $2.3 billion was a 12% increase from full year 2010. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody’s Investors Service revenue by $28 million and was negligible for Moody’s Analytics. Operating income of $888 million increased 15% from a year ago and included a $4 million favorable impact from foreign currency translations.
Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service was $1.6 billion, an increase of 12% from last year. Moody’s Analytics revenue was $712 million, 14% higher than the prior year. Diluted earnings per share of $2.49 for 2011 increased 16% and included a legacy tax benefit of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2011, as well as other tax benefits of $0.09 in the second and third quarters of 2011 resulting from a favorable tax ruling in a settlement of state tax audits.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates."

As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter was essentially flat at $567 million. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. fourth quarter revenue decreased 3",790,"Thanks, Ray. I’ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter was essentially flat at $567 million. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. fourth quarter revenue decreased 3% to $286 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 4% to $281 million and represented 50% of Moody’s total revenue, up from 48% in the year ago period. Recurring revenue of $318 million represented 56% of the total, compared to 52% in the prior year period.
And looking now at each of our businesses, Moody’s Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $367 million, a 4% decrease year-over-year. U.S. revenue decreased 9% over the prior year period, while outside the U.S. revenue increased 2% and represented 44% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 14% from the year ago period to $141 million. Revenue was down 13% in the U.S., while outside the U.S. revenue was lower by 16% year-over-year. The decline in global corporate finance revenue reflected weaker issuance, primarily in speculative grade bonds and loans in both the U.S. and Europe.
Global structured finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $87 million, 14% above the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 13% year-over-year primarily due to strength in asset-backed securities. Most other areas of U.S. structured finance market remained weak. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue rose 15%, driven primarily by European asset-backed and residential mortgage-backed securities, as well as covered bonds in Europe and Asia.
Global financial institutions revenue of $67 million increased 2% from the same quarter in 2010, with U.S. revenue declining 7%, while non-U.S. revenue grew 7%.
Global revenue for public, project and infrastructure declined 6% year-over-year to $72 million. Revenue decreased 14% in the U.S., reflecting a reduction in new financing for projects and infrastructure programs. Non-U.S. revenue increased 14% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector.
And turning now to Moody’s Analytics, global revenue for Moody’s Analytics of $200 million is up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2010. U.S. revenue grew by 15% year-over-year to $81 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 7% to $119 million and represented 60% of total Moody’s Analytics revenue. Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $115 million increased 6% from the prior-year period due primarily to higher customer retention rates and represented 58% of total MA revenue.
Revenue from risk management software of $56 million fell 3% from last year’s record revenue in this segment. Due to the variable nature of project timing, risk management software revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility. The December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert had a negligible impact on software revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. Professional services revenue doubled to $29 million ,reflecting both organic growth and the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Moody’s fourth quarter expenses were $395 million, an increase of 7% compared to fourth quarter 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation on fourth quarter expenses was negligible. Moody’s reported operating margin for the quarter was 30.3%, down from 34.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to increased headcount and technology investments to support growth initiatives, as well as acquisition-related costs. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37% compared with 19.5% for the prior year period. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to utilization of foreign tax credits and lower state taxes in 2010.
Now I’ll provide an update on capital allocation. Moody’s increased its quarterly dividend on December 14 by 14% to $0.16 per share of common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Moody’s did not repurchase any shares, but did issue 0.4 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. For the full year 2011, Moody’s repurchased 11 million shares at a total cost of $334 million for an average price of $30.30 per share, and issued 2.9 million shares under employee-based stock compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2011, totaled $222 million, representing a 4% decline from a year earlier. As of year end, Moody’s had $0.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. 
As of December 31, Moody’s had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $760 million, an increase of $100 million from a year earlier. Approximately 70% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. Share repurchase remains subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.
And with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Ray."

I’ll continue with an update on regulatory developments. In the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer comment deadline for rule proposals rele",1037,"Thanks, Linda. I’ll continue with an update on regulatory developments. In the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer comment deadline for rule proposals relevant to NRSROs, the SEC recently revised its timetable and is expected to adopt final rules by year end 2012.
It is also expected to publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products, otherwise known as the Franken Amendment, by about the same time. Both banking and securities regulatory authorities are in the process of reviewing their use of ratings and regulation and considering alternative measures as replacements.
Turing to Europe, Moody’s was registered in the European Union in late October 2011, and as I have indicated on previous calls, the transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities Markets Authority, ESMA, became effective in July 2011. Our European operations are therefore under the full examination and oversight authority of ESMA and we expect ESMA to publish the first report on its review of the industry sometime in the second quarter of 2012.
In addition, the European Commission has proposed a new round of regulatory measures for the rating agency industry. Specifically, the suggested measures address, among other ideas, the use of ratings and regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability. The various concepts the Commission has introduced in its proposal focus on how and to what extent rating agencies operate in the EU.
If implemented as currently constructed, however, the Commission’s suggested measures may have significant and negative ramifications on the European credit markets. Consequently, the debate on CRA 3 has been active and ongoing since its formal release by the Commission. In particular, on January 24, the European Parliament held a hearing through which it solicited views from a broad spectrum of market participants, who generally sounded a cautionary note. Because of the tone of the debate thus far, it is possible that during the coming months, the Commission’s proposals will be amended.
The next stages of the legislative process include deliberation and potential amendments by both the European Parliament and the Council of European Finance Ministers. The Parliament, Council and Commission must all confer and agree on a final text. We expect this process to take anywhere from 4 months to 8 months during which time we will continue to consult with relevant authorities and market participants as to the impact of the specific proposals.
While new rules entail various changes in our rating agency processes and operations and require us to adapt our business, we will not alter our fundamental objective to provide the highest quality independent credit opinions, research and analysis. We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20’s statements and directives.
Before concluding today’s remarks by reviewing our 2012 outlook, I’ll briefly comment on our acquisitions of a majority stake in Copal Partners and of Barrie & Hibbert during the fourth quarter of 2011. Copal is an India-based outsourced research and consulting business that strongly complements the research, analysis, and professional services offerings of Moody’s Analytics. The acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, a Scotland-based leading provider of analytical tools for the global insurance industry, is consistent with our ongoing commitment to build a comprehensive suite of enterprise risk management solutions for financial institutions. Together, these acquisitions are expected to be accretive to EPS in 2012.
I will conclude this morning’s prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance for 2012. Moody’s outlook for 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity and consumer borrowing and securitization. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. We expect business conditions to remain challenging, particularly early in the year, but still project growth across most areas of our business in 2012. For Moody’s overall, the company expects full year 2012 growth to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also projected to increase in the high single- to low double-digit percent range.
Full year 2012 operating margin is projected to be approximately 39%, which includes the full-year impact of our fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions. Our effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 33%. We continue -- we expect to continue share repurchase subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. The company expects diluted earnings per share for the full year 2012 in the range of $2.62 to $2.72.
For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2012 is expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is expected to be about flat.
Corporate finance revenue is forecasted to grow in the high single-digit percent range. Revenue from each of structured finance and financial institutions is projected to be flat to slightly down while public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is expected to increase in the low-teens percent range.
For Moody’s Analytics, full year 2012 revenue is expected to increase in the high teens percent range both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Revenue growth is projected in the mid single-digit percent range for research data and analytics and in the low-20s percent range for risk management software, reflecting growth in the core business as well as the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert. Professional services revenue is projected to grow by approximately 70%, inclusive of revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners and continued growth in our legacy businesses.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and joining us for the question and answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s Analytics. We’d be pleased to take any questions you may have."

Let me talk a little bit about fourth quarter 2011 as compared to fourth quarter of 2010. And the fourth quarter of 2010 we put up $0.58 and the number is $0.43 for the fourth quarter of 2011. The main bridge that gets you there is just a difference in the tax rate. We had an abnormally low tax rate in fourth quarter of 2010. As we had said earlier, the tax rate for 2010 was about 19% and we’re running about 37% for the fourth quarter of 2011. So basically we have a doubling of the effective tax rate for the quarter. That change gets you about $0.12. And then the remainder of the $0.03 to get to the bridge, we have some deal costs from these acquisitions we’ve done in the fourth quarter. We had some other expenses including a sales tax matter and a contribution to our foundation. And then we’ve got some other things in terms of bringing some IT costs and other systems online. So the main driver in the difference for the fourth quarter of 2011 is really the tax rate, and there’s not much more to it than that."

So we’re looking at about a $28 million increase over that period. Basically, it splits, as I’ve mentioned, about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of deal costs. The 2 deals that we did in the fourth quarter were expensive to get done. We had a success fee in the Copal deal, which is unusual for us to pay, so take $9-ish million on deal costs and other things related to those acquisitions. Another third of it, another chunk of it would be, as I said, another tax matter, which revolves around sales tax, and a donation to our foundation, the sort of 2 costs in the other category. And then thirdly, we have these systems we’re bringing online and some consulting fees, mainly to get ready for Dodd-Frank. So basically those are the 3 components of the $28 million of expense difference between this year’s fourth quarter and last year’s fourth quarter."

We didn’t -- as it turned out, we really didn’t see that. The business held up throughout the year better than I had anticipated, and we are currently looking at that run rate to continue through 2012.
Obviously, there are going to be areas of relative strength and relative weakness in structured finance. For example, we still don’t see any significant RMBS activity here in the U.S. and we will have to see what the impact in Europe is of some of the one-time items that were driving business last year. But the ABS market in particular, both in the U.S. and in Europe, has held up well. And to the extent that there is a willingness to -- well, to the extent that there are interest rates and spreads that make securitization attractive, there is potentially some upside to that business. But right now, we would say that we expect the run rate from 2011 to be reflected in the business in 2012. As to share, I think that’s more -- probably more driven by which parts of structured finance happen to be active or inactive at any given point in time. There are some areas where we have strength relative to our competitors in terms of our analytic framework, and there are some other areas where issuers and investors may prefer the business from our competitors. So it really is driven by which areas are active from quarter-to-quarter."

You can see from our guidance that we’re expecting both the financial institutions and structured finance areas to be flat, perhaps slightly down, but essentially flat. We do expect to see growth in the public, project and infrastructure finance area and we expect to see that all the way through the year. The -- probably the most interesting area is corporate finance and I think right now the pipelines could be characterized as steady, but probably not more than steady. A little bit of an uptick in high-yield recently. But what we’re seeing, and this is very recent, is an improvement in market tone. Volatility has come down, spreads have been coming in, and those are all leading indicators of what helps build the pipeline. So early January, I would say we were pretty cautious about how the pipelines looked and what that meant for the business. As I said, more recently, some of the leading indicators are more promising. We do still expect that the second half of the year is going to be the stronger half. We do not expect this year to look like last year. So we would not anticipate having strong growth in the first half this year in the corporate area, off of what we saw last year because it was so strong last year."

So conditions are for this moment, and again to follow-up on what Ray said, can change it any moment, but for this moment conditions are looking relatively good.

Copal serves substantially the same customer set that we serve with our research and our data and our other related services. So we see this as a very nice synergistic opportunity to expand our footprint with those customers. And then on the -- with the Barrie & Hibbert acquisition that we closed in December, that’s just a market extension within the software business. And it allows us to have a much more compelling offering for insurance companies and will let us take advantage of what we see as a very robust opportunity associated with the Solvency II and related regulations that are being imposed on insurance companies. So we see both of those as very nice fits with various parts of the Moody’s Analytics business. In terms of the scale, I think we’d indicated before that about half of our revenue growth in 2011 was organic and about half was from acquisitions that we made, primarily the CSI acquisition that we made in late 2010. And that can -- that’ll be -- those proportions will be the same, roughly the same in 2012. So again, you should expect that about half of our revenue growth in 2012 will be organic and about half from these recently acquired businesses."

After our prepared remarks, we’ll be happy to respond to your questions.
Fourth quarter revenue of $567 million was flat as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, with strong performance by Moody’s Analytics and global structured finance offsetting a decline from the strong prior year period in corporate finance. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $172 million, a 12% decrease from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.43 decreased 26% year-over-year.
For full year 2011, Moody’s revenue of $2.3 billion was a 12% increase from full year 2010. Foreign currency translation favorably impacted Moody’s Investors Service revenue by $28 million and was negligible for Moody’s Analytics. Operating income of $888 million increased 15% from a year ago and included a $4 million favorable impact from foreign currency translations.
Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service was $1.6 billion, an increase of 12% from last year. Moody’s Analytics revenue was $712 million, 14% higher than the prior year. Diluted earnings per share of $2.49 for 2011 increased 16% and included a legacy tax benefit of $0.03 in the second quarter of 2011, as well as other tax benefits of $0.09 in the second and third quarters of 2011 resulting from a favorable tax ruling in a settlement of state tax audits.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates."

As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter was essentially flat at $567 million. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. fourth quarter revenue decreased 3",790,"Thanks, Ray. I’ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter was essentially flat at $567 million. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. fourth quarter revenue decreased 3% to $286 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 4% to $281 million and represented 50% of Moody’s total revenue, up from 48% in the year ago period. Recurring revenue of $318 million represented 56% of the total, compared to 52% in the prior year period.
And looking now at each of our businesses, Moody’s Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $367 million, a 4% decrease year-over-year. U.S. revenue decreased 9% over the prior year period, while outside the U.S. revenue increased 2% and represented 44% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 14% from the year ago period to $141 million. Revenue was down 13% in the U.S., while outside the U.S. revenue was lower by 16% year-over-year. The decline in global corporate finance revenue reflected weaker issuance, primarily in speculative grade bonds and loans in both the U.S. and Europe.
Global structured finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $87 million, 14% above the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 13% year-over-year primarily due to strength in asset-backed securities. Most other areas of U.S. structured finance market remained weak. Non-U.S. structured finance revenue rose 15%, driven primarily by European asset-backed and residential mortgage-backed securities, as well as covered bonds in Europe and Asia.
Global financial institutions revenue of $67 million increased 2% from the same quarter in 2010, with U.S. revenue declining 7%, while non-U.S. revenue grew 7%.
Global revenue for public, project and infrastructure declined 6% year-over-year to $72 million. Revenue decreased 14% in the U.S., reflecting a reduction in new financing for projects and infrastructure programs. Non-U.S. revenue increased 14% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector.
And turning now to Moody’s Analytics, global revenue for Moody’s Analytics of $200 million is up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2010. U.S. revenue grew by 15% year-over-year to $81 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 7% to $119 million and represented 60% of total Moody’s Analytics revenue. Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $115 million increased 6% from the prior-year period due primarily to higher customer retention rates and represented 58% of total MA revenue.
Revenue from risk management software of $56 million fell 3% from last year’s record revenue in this segment. Due to the variable nature of project timing, risk management software revenue remained subject to quarterly volatility. The December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert had a negligible impact on software revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. Professional services revenue doubled to $29 million ,reflecting both organic growth and the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Moody’s fourth quarter expenses were $395 million, an increase of 7% compared to fourth quarter 2010. The impact of foreign currency translation on fourth quarter expenses was negligible. Moody’s reported operating margin for the quarter was 30.3%, down from 34.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to increased headcount and technology investments to support growth initiatives, as well as acquisition-related costs. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37% compared with 19.5% for the prior year period. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily due to utilization of foreign tax credits and lower state taxes in 2010.
Now I’ll provide an update on capital allocation. Moody’s increased its quarterly dividend on December 14 by 14% to $0.16 per share of common stock. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Moody’s did not repurchase any shares, but did issue 0.4 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. For the full year 2011, Moody’s repurchased 11 million shares at a total cost of $334 million for an average price of $30.30 per share, and issued 2.9 million shares under employee-based stock compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2011, totaled $222 million, representing a 4% decline from a year earlier. As of year end, Moody’s had $0.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. 
As of December 31, Moody’s had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $760 million, an increase of $100 million from a year earlier. Approximately 70% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. Share repurchase remains subject to available cash flow and other capital allocation decisions.
And with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Ray."
528325,153949104,257522,"Moody's Corp., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2012",2012-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Moody's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Linda. I’ll continue with an update on regulatory developments. In the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer comment deadline for rule proposals rele",1037,"Thanks, Linda. I’ll continue with an update on regulatory developments. In the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer comment deadline for rule proposals relevant to NRSROs, the SEC recently revised its timetable and is expected to adopt final rules by year end 2012.
It is also expected to publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products, otherwise known as the Franken Amendment, by about the same time. Both banking and securities regulatory authorities are in the process of reviewing their use of ratings and regulation and considering alternative measures as replacements.
Turing to Europe, Moody’s was registered in the European Union in late October 2011, and as I have indicated on previous calls, the transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities Markets Authority, ESMA, became effective in July 2011. Our European operations are therefore under the full examination and oversight authority of ESMA and we expect ESMA to publish the first report on its review of the industry sometime in the second quarter of 2012.
In addition, the European Commission has proposed a new round of regulatory measures for the rating agency industry. Specifically, the suggested measures address, among other ideas, the use of ratings and regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability. The various concepts the Commission has introduced in its proposal focus on how and to what extent rating agencies operate in the EU.
If implemented as currently constructed, however, the Commission’s suggested measures may have significant and negative ramifications on the European credit markets. Consequently, the debate on CRA 3 has been active and ongoing since its formal release by the Commission. In particular, on January 24, the European Parliament held a hearing through which it solicited views from a broad spectrum of market participants, who generally sounded a cautionary note. Because of the tone of the debate thus far, it is possible that during the coming months, the Commission’s proposals will be amended.
The next stages of the legislative process include deliberation and potential amendments by both the European Parliament and the Council of European Finance Ministers. The Parliament, Council and Commission must all confer and agree on a final text. We expect this process to take anywhere from 4 months to 8 months during which time we will continue to consult with relevant authorities and market participants as to the impact of the specific proposals.
While new rules entail various changes in our rating agency processes and operations and require us to adapt our business, we will not alter our fundamental objective to provide the highest quality independent credit opinions, research and analysis. We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20’s statements and directives.
Before concluding today’s remarks by reviewing our 2012 outlook, I’ll briefly comment on our acquisitions of a majority stake in Copal Partners and of Barrie & Hibbert during the fourth quarter of 2011. Copal is an India-based outsourced research and consulting business that strongly complements the research, analysis, and professional services offerings of Moody’s Analytics. The acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, a Scotland-based leading provider of analytical tools for the global insurance industry, is consistent with our ongoing commitment to build a comprehensive suite of enterprise risk management solutions for financial institutions. Together, these acquisitions are expected to be accretive to EPS in 2012.
I will conclude this morning’s prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance for 2012. Moody’s outlook for 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity and consumer borrowing and securitization. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. We expect business conditions to remain challenging, particularly early in the year, but still project growth across most areas of our business in 2012. For Moody’s overall, the company expects full year 2012 growth to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also projected to increase in the high single- to low double-digit percent range.
Full year 2012 operating margin is projected to be approximately 39%, which includes the full-year impact of our fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions. Our effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 33%. We continue -- we expect to continue share repurchase subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. The company expects diluted earnings per share for the full year 2012 in the range of $2.62 to $2.72.
For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2012 is expected to increase in the mid single-digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is expected to be about flat.
Corporate finance revenue is forecasted to grow in the high single-digit percent range. Revenue from each of structured finance and financial institutions is projected to be flat to slightly down while public, project and infrastructure finance revenue is expected to increase in the low-teens percent range.
For Moody’s Analytics, full year 2012 revenue is expected to increase in the high teens percent range both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Revenue growth is projected in the mid single-digit percent range for research data and analytics and in the low-20s percent range for risk management software, reflecting growth in the core business as well as the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert. Professional services revenue is projected to grow by approximately 70%, inclusive of revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners and continued growth in our legacy businesses.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and joining us for the question and answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s Analytics. We’d be pleased to take any questions you may have."

I think first, though, we should note that 2011 was a year of record revenue for Moody’s, and we’re back above our 2007 high. So we think we should get that into the mix, Peter.
Let me talk a little bit about fourth quarter 2011 as compared to fourth quarter of 2010. And the fourth quarter of 2010 we put up $0.58 and the number is $0.43 for the fourth quarter of 2011. The main bridge that gets you there is just a difference in the tax rate. We had an abnormally low tax rate in fourth quarter of 2010. As we had said earlier, the tax rate for 2010 was about 19% and we’re running about 37% for the fourth quarter of 2011. So basically we have a doubling of the effective tax rate for the quarter. That change gets you about $0.12. And then the remainder of the $0.03 to get to the bridge, we have some deal costs from these acquisitions we’ve done in the fourth quarter. We had some other expenses including a sales tax matter and a contribution to our foundation. And then we’ve got some other things in terms of bringing some IT costs and other systems online. So the main driver in the difference for the fourth quarter of 2011 is really the tax rate, and there’s not much more to it than that."

The 2 deals that we did in the fourth quarter were expensive to get done. We had a success fee in the Copal deal, which is unusual for us to pay, so take $9-ish million on deal costs and other things related to those acquisitions. Another third of it, another chunk of it would be, as I said, another tax matter, which revolves around sales tax, and a donation to our foundation, the sort of 2 costs in the other category. And then thirdly, we have these systems we’re bringing online and some consulting fees, mainly to get ready for Dodd-Frank. So basically those are the 3 components of the $28 million of expense difference between this year’s fourth quarter and last year’s fourth quarter."

We didn’t -- as it turned out, we really didn’t see that. The business held up throughout the year better than I had anticipated, and we are currently looking at that run rate to continue through 2012.
Obviously, there are going to be areas of relative strength and relative weakness in structured finance. For example, we still don’t see any significant RMBS activity here in the U.S. and we will have to see what the impact in Europe is of some of the one-time items that were driving business last year. But the ABS market in particular, both in the U.S. and in Europe, has held up well. And to the extent that there is a willingness to -- well, to the extent that there are interest rates and spreads that make securitization attractive, there is potentially some upside to that business. But right now, we would say that we expect the run rate from 2011 to be reflected in the business in 2012. As to share, I think that’s more -- probably more driven by which parts of structured finance happen to be active or inactive at any given point in time. There are some areas where we have strength relative to our competitors in terms of our analytic framework, and there are some other areas where issuers and investors may prefer the business from our competitors. So it really is driven by which areas are active from quarter-to-quarter."

You can see from our guidance that we’re expecting both the financial institutions and structured finance areas to be flat, perhaps slightly down, but essentially flat. We do expect to see growth in the public, project and infrastructure finance area and we expect to see that all the way through the year. The -- probably the most interesting area is corporate finance and I think right now the pipelines could be characterized as steady, but probably not more than steady. A little bit of an uptick in high-yield recently. But what we’re seeing, and this is very recent, is an improvement in market tone. Volatility has come down, spreads have been coming in, and those are all leading indicators of what helps build the pipeline. So early January, I would say we were pretty cautious about how the pipelines looked and what that meant for the business. As I said, more recently, some of the leading indicators are more promising. We do still expect that the second half of the year is going to be the stronger half. We do not expect this year to look like last year. So we would not anticipate having strong growth in the first half this year in the corporate area, off of what we saw last year because it was so strong last year."

So conditions are for this moment, and again to follow-up on what Ray said, can change it any moment, but for this moment conditions are looking relatively good.

And it allows us to have a much more compelling offering for insurance companies and will let us take advantage of what we see as a very robust opportunity associated with the Solvency II and related regulations that are being imposed on insurance companies. So we see both of those as very nice fits with various parts of the Moody’s Analytics business. In terms of the scale, I think we’d indicated before that about half of our revenue growth in 2011 was organic and about half was from acquisitions that we made, primarily the CSI acquisition that we made in late 2010.

After our prepared remarks, we’ll be happy to respond to your questions.
First quarter revenue of $647 million increased 12% over the prior year period primarily reflecting increased corporate and public project and infrastructure debt issuance as well as continued solid performance from Moody’s Analytics. All reporting units of both Moody’s Investor Service and Moody’s Analytics grew in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year period.
Operating income for the first quarter was $269 million, an 8% increased from the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.76 increased 13% year-over-year. While the level of issuance activity was strong in first quarter, we remain cautious about market conditions for the remainder of the year. As a result we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance of $2.62 to $2.72, but now expect to be toward the upper end of the range.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates.

As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 12% to $647 million. The US first quarter revenue increased 14% to $344 million while revenue outside the US grew 10% to $303",867,"Thanks, Ray. I’ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 12% to $647 million. The US first quarter revenue increased 14% to $344 million while revenue outside the US grew 10% to $303 million and represented 47% of Moody’s total revenue, down slightly from the 48% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $330 million represented 51% of the total, essentially flat to the prior year period. 
Now looking at each of our businesses starting with Moody’s Investor Service, revenue for the quarter was $453 million, a 10% increase year-over-year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody’s Investor Service revenue by $4 million. US revenue for MIS increased 13% over the prior year period, while revenue outside the US increased 6% and represented 43% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the first quarter increased 10% from the year-ago period to $201 million. Revenue grew 8% in the US while outside the US revenue increased 15% year-over-year. The growth in global corporate finance revenue reflected stronger investment grade and solid speculative grade bond issuance activity.
Global structured finance revenue for the first quarter was $94 million, 5% above the prior-year period. In the US revenue increased 15% year-over-year primarily due to strength asset backed securities and commercial real estate. Most other areas of the US structured finance market remained weak. International structured finance revenue was down 2% reflecting weaker issuance volumes in European asset-backed securities in the first quarter of 2012 as well as demand in the first quarter of 2011 for ratings of outstanding securitization placed with the European Government sponsored facility.
Global financial institutions revenue of $79 million increased 2% from the same quarter of 2011. US revenue was essentially flat as compared to the first quarter of 2011 while non-US revenue grew 4%. Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure business rose 23% year-over-year to $79 million. Revenue was up 37% in the US reflecting strength in both public finance and project finance.
Non-US revenue increased 4% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector in Latin America and Asia. And turning now to Moody’s Analytics. Global revenue for Moody’s Analytics of $194 million was up 18% from the first quarter of 2011. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. US revenue grew by 19% year over year to $85 million. Non-US revenue increased by 17% to $109 million and represented 56% of total Moody’s Analytics revenue.
Globally revenue from research data and analytics of $120 million increased 9% from the prior-year period due primarily to increased sales of credit research and related data and represented 62% of the total MA revenue. Revenue from enterprise risk solutions formerly known as risk management software of $48 million grew 11% from last year driven by the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert.
Due to the variable nature of the project timing, enterprise risk solution revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue more than doubled to $27 million reflecting both the acquisition of the majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011 and growth in our existing training and education business. Turning now to expenses. Moody’s first quarter expenses were $378 million, an increase of 16% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Incremental compensation expense which accounted for over half of the growth was primarily driven by additional headcount in the operating businesses and from the acquisition. Other incremental expenses were largely composed of non-compensation expenses related to the acquisitions including purchased price amortization and IT related costs.
The impact of foreign currency translation on first quarter expenses was negligible. Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter was 41.6%, down from 43.3% from the first quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.1% compared with 33.2% for the prior-year period. Decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to benefits derived from international tax initiatives and tax audit settlement partially offset by miscellaneous discrete items.
Now I will provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2012, Moody's did not repurchase any shares, but did issue 2.6 million shares under employee stock based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2012 totaled $225 million representing a 1% decline from a year ago. As of quarter end, Moody's had 900 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current programs and as we have previously noted, we still expect to repurchase approximately 200 million of Moody's shares over the course of 2012, subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation provision.
As of March 31, Moody's had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Additionally on April 18, 2012 we renewed our $1 billion credit facility for another five-year term. Cash and cash equivalents were $815 million, an increase of $95 million from a year earlier. Approximately 80% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the US. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. And with that I will turn the call back over to Ray.

I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. Starting in the US, regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer 2011 common deadline for rule pro",924,"Thanks, Linda. I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. Starting in the US, regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer 2011 common deadline for rule proposals relevant to NRSROs, the SEC revised its timetable and is expected to adopt final rules by year-end 2012.
Within the same time, the SEC is also is expected to publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products, otherwise known as the Franken Amendment.
Turing to Europe, Moody’s was registered in the European Union in late October 2011, and as I have indicated on previous calls, the transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA, became effective in July 2011. Our European operations are therefore under the full examination and oversight authority of ESMA and ESMA published its first inspection report in March. ESMA report had not identified any breaches of the current regulation by Moody’s.
As discussed on previous calls in November 2011, the European Commission release new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry known as CRA 3 that seek to address among other ideas, the use of ratings and regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability.
If implemented as currently constructed, the Commission suggested measures are likely to have significant negative implications for Europe’s credit markets.
Consequently, the debate on CRA 3 which began in the European Parliament and European Council of Finance Ministers in mid-January has involved the growing number of market participants. The focus on the debate has been on the potential negative impact of CRA 3 on the broader European economy and the ability of European insurers to access funds. Because of the tone of the debate thus far, it is possible that during the coming months, the Commission’s proposals will be amended.
The next stages of the legislative process include deliberation and potential amendments by both the European Parliament and the Council of European Finance Ministers. Parliament, Council and Commission must also confer and agree on final text. We expect this process to be completed by year-end and we will continue to consult with relevant authorities and market participants as of the impact of the specific proposals.
While new rules could entail various changes in our rating processes and operations and require us adapt our business. We will not abandon our fundamental objective to provide the highest quality, independent credit opinions, research and analysis.
We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives. I will conclude this morning’s prepared remarks by discussing on full-year guidance.
Moody’s outlook for 2012 is based on assumption about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency transition at end of quarter exchange rates. As I mentioned earlier, we are re-affirming our 2012 EPS guidance of $2.62 to $2.72 but now expect to be toward the upper end of the range. That we have re-affirmed our EPS guidance, certain components of 2012 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market condition.
For Moody’s overall, the company now expects full-year 2012 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Full-year 2012 expenses are also projected to increase in the low double digit percent range. Full-year 2012 operating margin is still projected to be approximately 39%, which included the full-year impact of our fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions. Effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 33%.
As Linda mentioned earlier, we still expect approximately $200 million of share repurchase over the course of 2012 subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other on going capital allocation decisions.
For the global MIS business, revenue for full-year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range. Within the U.S. MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit percentage range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single digit percentage range.
The finance revenue is now forecasted to grow in the low double digit percentage range. Revenue from each of the structured finance and financial institution is now projected to be flat to slightly up, while public project and infrastructure finances is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For Moody’s analytics for full-year 2012, revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range both inside and outside the U.S. Revenue growth is still projected in mid-single digit percent range for our research, data and analytics and in the low 20% range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting growth in the core business as well of December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 80%, inclusive of the revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners and continued growth in our existing training and education businesses.
This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investors Service and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s analytics. We will be pleased to take any questions you may have.

So our margin is lower in the first quarter of 2012 by 170 basis points.
And as we noted in the script about half of that is acquisition related or 90 basis points. Of that, the purchase price amortization for the acquisitions was about half of the 90 basis points or 45. The other piece of that, 80 basis points was IT related costs. And we have a little bit of an anomalous situation here on the IT front as we’re getting ready for Dodd-Frank implementation. Because we are not building permanent systems, but rather making enhancements to our existing systems we have to expense those costs. So our expenses are running a little bit higher on the IT front than they might usually for this couple of quarters.
So if you want to think about that you might have certainly a 120 basis points or so that would normally go back to the margins that would not be doing so for the first quarter of this year.
Looking forward, I think in the longer term we do expect our margin to be back over 40, but I think we've got to get through this period of expense ramp relating to these regulatory changes we've talked about.

The pipeline, and obviously the first quarter was a strong quarter particularly in the corporate and public project in infrastructure finance areas. We do believe that that has incorporated some pull-forwards, so issuance that we were expecting later in the year has been pulled into the early part of the year.
So for Moody’s Investor Service, I think at this point we now expect to see a stronger first half than second half of the year. For Moody’s Analytics, we would still expect to see a stronger second half than first half of the year.
That being said, most of the activity we’ve seen has been refinance and so we have not seen an active market particularly in the corporate area around mergers and acquisitions, base financing, share repurchase, business investment spending. And depending on how confidence evolves throughout this year, we may have a stronger second half than would be implied from a more purely refinance based environment.
Before turning this over to Linda on what the pipeline, it looks like the only other comment I would make here is that as we’ve seen over the last 18 months, we expect to see periods of optimism and pessimism really related to the macroeconomic condition and the European sovereign debt crisis. So the pipelines are going to be subject to whether those periods of optimism, pessimism are causing investors to move away from risk and so just expect some volatility in issuance, both positively and negatively.

As you know we’ve just come off a gang-busters first quarter in which average monthly US high grade volume issuance was about $95 billion. Then we came into April and the April high grade volume is expected to be about $30 billion for the month.
If we look at recent trends, we would have expected $42 billion that would be the 10 year average for April. So April is running light. Last week we saw about $5 billion of issuance. This week we have seen $5 billion to $10 billion of issuance. So April’s saw quite a bit of softening coming off a very strong first quarter.
May, is calling for $70 billion to $ 80 billion of high grade issuance and we’re starting to see pipelines we build, but again we are concerned about the situation in Europe and any sort of week that auctions coming out of Europe can grow a range into the process pretty quickly.
2012 quoting from some of the banks here we’re still looking at $850 billion of issuance, that’s up 15% from last year, but as Ray said, we have seen some pull-forward so it’s going to be interesting to see what happens for the rest of the year.
And turning to high yield, a bit of a different story and this is actually quite interesting because the high yield pipeline is still reasonably strong. For second quarter of 2011, the entire leverage market, about $27 billion of pipeline, high yield financing is about $6 billion of that, leverage loans about $21 billion.
That’s the next highest after second quarter of last year where we saw $64 billion of pipeline. So high yield looks pretty good and if it all keeps coming that will be pretty helpful to us. But again, as Ray mentioned, we are very, very conscious about the risk on, risk off sort of phenomenon that we’ve been seeing.

As we said before, we expect our expenses to ramp up by about $40 million over the course of the year. And we will continue to expect that to happen and the ramp maybe a little bit deeper in the second and third quarters than some of the analysts have noted, so just something to look at in terms of the quarter-by-quarter spread on that.
And so there are a number of things we are doing in terms of our investments and more than half of the growth in those expenses are due to headcount growth and those are in the revenue area as we noted, for the rating agency its corporate finance, public projects and infrastructure and for Moody’s Analytics in enterprise with solutions and sales.
So the expense growth that we are projecting about half of it is headcount growth to drive the revenue lines in those growing businesses. About $7 million is acquisition related costs, some of that is the amortization of the intangibles. We mentioned this on the last quarter call. We said this would be something that we would be working, that would take our expenses.
And then lastly as I mentioned to Peter, we are seeing a bit of a bump up in the expense side of our IT budget, running a little bit more heavily towards expense ramp and capitalization as we get things ready for Dodd-Frank so that would explain the majority of the cost ramp coming in 2012. Does that help you?

In the rating agency, we’ve added a 156 people; we’re supporting the higher volumes particularly as I said in corporate and PPIF, we’ve not added heads in structured finance. We have added few people as we get ready for Dodd-Frank and some of the regulatory functions.

First quarter revenue of $647 million increased 12% over the prior year period primarily reflecting increased corporate and public project and infrastructure debt issuance, as well as continued solid performance from Moody’s Analytics. All reporting units of both Moody’s Investor Service and Moody’s Analytics grew in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year period.
Operating income for the first quarter was $269 million, an 8% increased from the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.76 increased 13% year-over-year. While the level of issuance activity was strong in first quarter, we remain cautious about market conditions for the remainder of the year. As a result we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance of $2.62 to $2.72, but now expect to be toward the upper end of the range.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates."

As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 12% to $647 million. The U.S. first quarter revenue increased 14% to $344 million while revenue outside the U.S. grew 10% to $",869,"Thanks, Ray. I’ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 12% to $647 million. The U.S. first quarter revenue increased 14% to $344 million while revenue outside the U.S. grew 10% to $303 million and represented 47% of Moody’s total revenue, down slightly from the 48% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $330 million represented 51% of the total, essentially flat to the prior year period.
Now looking at each of our businesses starting with Moody’s Investor Service, revenue for the quarter was $453 million, a 10% increase year-over-year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody’s Investor Service revenue by $4 million. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 13% over the prior year period, while revenue outside the U.S. increased 6% and represented 43% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the first quarter increased 10% from the year-ago period to $201 million. Revenue grew 8% in the U.S., while outside the U.S. revenue increased 15% year-over-year. The growth in global corporate finance revenue reflected stronger investment grade and solid speculative grade bond issuance activity.
Global structured finance revenue for the first quarter was $94 million, 5% above the prior-year period. In the U.S. revenue increased 15% year-over-year primarily due to strength in asset backed securities and commercial real estate. Most other areas of the U.S. structured finance market remained weak. International structured finance revenue was down 2% reflecting weaker issuance volumes in European asset-backed securities in the first quarter of 2012, as well as demand in the first quarter of 2011 for ratings of outstanding securitization placed with the European Government sponsored facility.
Global financial institutions revenue of $79 million increased 2% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was essentially flat as compared to the first quarter of 2011 while non-U.S. revenue grew 4%. Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure business rose 23% year-over-year to $79 million. Revenue was up 37% in the U.S. reflecting strength in both public finance and project finance.
Non-U.S. revenue increased 4% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector in Latin America and Asia. And turning now to Moody’s Analytics. Global revenue for Moody’s Analytics of $194 million was up 18% from the first quarter of 2011. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. revenue grew by 19% year over year to $85 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 17% to $109 million and represented 56% of total Moody’s Analytics revenue.
Globally revenue from research data and analytics of $120 million increased 9% from the prior-year period due primarily to increased sales of credit research and related data and represented 62% of the total MA revenue. Revenue from enterprise risk solutions formerly known as risk management software of $48 million grew 11% from last year driven by the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert.
Due to the variable nature of the project timing, enterprise risk solution revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue more than doubled to $27 million reflecting both the acquisition of the majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011 and growth in our existing training and education business. Turning now to expenses. Moody’s first quarter expenses were $378 million, an increase of 16% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Incremental compensation expense which accounted for over half of the growth was primarily driven by additional headcount in the operating businesses and from the acquisition. Other incremental expenses were largely composed of non-compensation expenses related to the acquisitions including purchased price amortization and IT related costs.
The impact of foreign currency translation on first quarter expenses was negligible. Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter was 41.6%, down from 43.3% from the first quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.1% compared with 33.2% for the prior-year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to benefits derived from international tax initiatives and tax audit settlement partially offset by miscellaneous discrete items.
Now I will provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2012, Moody's did not repurchase any shares, but did issue 2.6 million shares under employee stock based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2012 totaled 225 million representing a 1% decline from a year ago. As of quarter end, Moody's had 900 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current programs and as we have previously noted, we still expect to repurchase approximately 200 million of Moody's shares over the course of 2012, subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation provision.
As of March 31, Moody's had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Additionally on April 18, 2012 we renewed our $1 billion credit facility for another five-year term. Cash and cash equivalents were $815 million, an increase of $95 million from a year earlier. Approximately 80% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. And with that I will turn the call back over to Ray."
528325,183801369,290511,"Moody's Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Moody's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Linda. I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. Starting in the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer 2011 common deadline for rule p",924,"Thanks, Linda. I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. Starting in the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer 2011 common deadline for rule proposals relevant to NRSROs, the SEC revised its timetable and is expected to adopt final rules by year-end 2012.
Within the same time, the SEC is also is expected to publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products, otherwise known as the Franken Amendment.
Turing to Europe, Moody’s was registered in the European Union in late October 2011, and as I have indicated on previous calls, the transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA, became effective in July, 2011. Our European operations are therefore under the full examination and oversight authority of ESMA and ESMA published its first inspection report in March. ESMA report had not identified any breaches of the current regulation by Moody’s.
As discussed on previous calls, in November 2011, the European Commission release new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry known as CRA 3 that seek to address among other ideas, the use of ratings and regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability.
If implemented as currently constructed, the Commission's suggested measures are likely to have significant negative implications for Europe’s credit markets.
Consequently, the debate on CRA 3 which began in the European Parliament and European Council of Finance Ministers in mid-January has involved the growing number of market participants. The focus on the debate has been on the potential negative impact of CRA 3 on the broader European economy and the ability of European insurers to access funds. Because of the tone of the debate thus far, it is possible that during the coming months, the Commission’s proposals will be amended.
The next stages of the legislative process include deliberation and potential amendments by both the European Parliament and the Council of European Finance Ministers. The Parliament, Council and Commission must also confer and agree on final text. We expect this process to be completed by year-end and we will continue to consult with relevant authorities and market participants as of the impact of the specific proposals.
While new rules could entail various changes in our rating processes and operations and require us adapt our business. We will not abandon our fundamental objective to provide the highest quality, independent credit opinions, research and analysis.
We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives. I will conclude this morning’s prepared remarks by discussing on full-year guidance.
Moody’s outlook for 2012 is based on assumption about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency transition at end of quarter exchange rates. As I mentioned earlier, we are re-affirming our 2012 EPS guidance of $2.62 to $2.72 but now expect to be toward the upper end of the range. That we have re-affirmed our EPS guidance, certain components of 2012 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market condition.
For Moody’s overall, the company now expects full-year 2012 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Full-year 2012 expenses are also projected to increase in the low double digit percent range. Full-year 2012 operating margin is still projected to be approximately 39%, which included the full-year impact of our fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions. Effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 33%.
As Linda mentioned earlier, we still expect approximately $200 million of share repurchase over the course of 2012 subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
For the global MIS business, revenue for full-year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit percentage range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single digit percentage range.
The finance revenue is now forecasted to grow in the low double digit percentage range. Revenue from each of the structured finance and financial institution is now projected to be flat to slightly up, while public project and infrastructure finances is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For Moody’s analytics for full-year 2012, revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range both inside and outside the U.S. Revenue growth is still projected in mid-single digit percent range for our research, data and analytics and in the low 20% range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting growth in the core business as well of December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 80%, inclusive of the revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners and continued growth in our existing training and education businesses.
This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investors Service and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s analytics. We would be pleased to take any questions you may have."

So our margin is lower in the first quarter of 2012 by 170 basis points. And as we noted in the script about 1/2 of that is acquisition related or 90 basis points. Of that, the purchase price amortization for the acquisitions was about 1/2 of the 90 basis points or 45. The other piece of that, 80 basis points was IT related costs. And we have a little bit of an anomalous situation here on the IT front as we’re getting ready for Dodd-Frank implementation. Because we are not building permanent systems, but rather making enhancements to our existing systems we have to expense those costs. So our expenses are running a little bit higher on the IT front than they might usually for this couple of quarters. So if you want to think about that you might have certainly a 120 basis points or so that would normally go back to the margins that would not be doing so for the first quarter of this year. Looking forward, I think in the longer term we do expect our margin to be back over 40, but I think we've got to get through this period of expense ramp relating to these regulatory changes we've talked about."

The pipeline, and obviously the first quarter was a strong quarter particularly in the corporate and public project in infrastructure finance areas. We do believe that, that has incorporated some pull-forwards, so issuance that we were expecting later in the year has been pulled into the early part of the year. So for Moody’s Investor Service, I think at this point we now expect to see a stronger first half than second half of the year. For Moody’s Analytics, we would still expect to see a stronger second half than first half of the year. That being said, most of the activity we’ve seen has been refinance and so we have not seen an active market particularly in the corporate area around mergers and acquisitions, base financing, share repurchase, business investment spending. And depending on how confidence evolves throughout this year, we may have a stronger second half than would be implied from a more purely refinance based environment. Before turning this over to Linda on what the pipeline, it looks like the only other comment I would make here is that as we’ve seen over the last 18 months, we expect to see periods of optimism and pessimism really related to the macroeconomic condition and the European sovereign debt crisis. So the pipelines are going to be subject to whether those periods of optimism, pessimism are causing investors to move away from risk and so just expect some volatility in issuance, both positively and negatively."

As you know we’ve just come off a gang-busters first quarter in which average monthly U.S. high grade volume issuance was about $95 billion. Then we came into April and the April high grade volume is expected to be about $30 billion for the month. If we look at recent trends, we would have expected $42 billion that would be the 10 year average for April. So April is running light. Last week we saw about $5 billion of issuance. This week we have seen $5 billion to $10 billion of issuance. So April’s saw quite a bit of softening coming off a very strong first quarter. May, is calling for $70 billion to $ 80 billion of high grade issuance and we’re starting to see pipelines we build, but again we are concerned about the situation in Europe and any sort of week that auctions coming out of Europe can grow a range into the process pretty quickly. 2012 quoting from some of the banks here we’re still looking at $850 billion of issuance, that’s up 15% from last year, but as Ray said, we have seen some pull-forward so it’s going to be interesting to see what happens for the rest of the year. And turning to high yield, a bit of a different story and this is actually quite interesting because the high yield pipeline is still reasonably strong. For second quarter of 2011, the entire leverage market, about $27 billion of pipeline, high yield financing is about $6 billion of that, leverage loans about $21 billion. That’s the next highest after second quarter of last year where we saw $64 billion of pipeline. So high yield looks pretty good and if it all keeps coming that will be pretty helpful to us. But again, as Ray mentioned, we are very, very conscious about the risk on, risk off sort of phenomenon that we’ve been seeing."

And so there are a number of things we are doing in terms of our investments and more than 1/2 of the growth in those expenses are due to headcount growth and those are in the revenue area as we noted, for the rating agency its corporate finance, public projects and infrastructure and for Moody’s Analytics in enterprise with solutions and sales. So of the expense growth that we are projecting about 1/2 of it is headcount growth to drive the revenue lines in those growing businesses. About $7 million is acquisition related costs, some of that is the amortization of the intangibles. We mentioned this on the last quarter call. We said this would be something that we would be working with, that would take our expenses. And then lastly as I mentioned to Peter, we are seeing a bit of a bump up in the expense side of our IT budget, running a little bit more heavily towards expense ramp and capitalization as we get things ready for Dodd-Frank.

Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights and I will then speak to recent regulatory developments and finish with comments on our outlook for 2012. After our prepared remarks, we’ll be happy to respond to your questions.
First quarter revenue of $647 million increased 12% over the prior year period primarily reflecting increased corporate and public project and infrastructure debt issuance, as well as continued solid performance from Moody’s Analytics. All reporting units of both Moody’s Investor Service and Moody’s Analytics grew in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year period.
Operating income for the first quarter was $269 million, an 8% increased from the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.76 increased 13% year-over-year. While the level of issuance activity was strong in first quarter, we remain cautious about market conditions for the remainder of the year. As a result we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance of $2.62 to $2.72, but now expect to be toward the upper end of the range.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates."

As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 12% to $647 million. The U.S. first quarter revenue increased 14% to $344 million while revenue outside the U.S. grew 10% to $",869,"Thanks, Ray. I’ll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 12% to $647 million. The U.S. first quarter revenue increased 14% to $344 million while revenue outside the U.S. grew 10% to $303 million and represented 47% of Moody’s total revenue, down slightly from the 48% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $330 million represented 51% of the total, essentially flat to the prior year period.
Now looking at each of our businesses starting with Moody’s Investor Service, revenue for the quarter was $453 million, a 10% increase year-over-year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Moody’s Investor Service revenue by $4 million. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 13% over the prior year period, while revenue outside the U.S. increased 6% and represented 43% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the first quarter increased 10% from the year-ago period to $201 million. Revenue grew 8% in the U.S., while outside the U.S. revenue increased 15% year-over-year. The growth in global corporate finance revenue reflected stronger investment grade and solid speculative grade bond issuance activity.
Global structured finance revenue for the first quarter was $94 million, 5% above the prior-year period. In the U.S. revenue increased 15% year-over-year primarily due to strength in asset backed securities and commercial real estate. Most other areas of the U.S. structured finance market remained weak. International structured finance revenue was down 2% reflecting weaker issuance volumes in European asset-backed securities in the first quarter of 2012, as well as demand in the first quarter of 2011 for ratings of outstanding securitization placed with the European Government sponsored facility.
Global financial institutions revenue of $79 million increased 2% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was essentially flat as compared to the first quarter of 2011 while non-U.S. revenue grew 4%. Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure business rose 23% year-over-year to $79 million. Revenue was up 37% in the U.S. reflecting strength in both public finance and project finance.
Non-U.S. revenue increased 4% primarily due to gains in the infrastructure sector in Latin America and Asia. And turning now to Moody’s Analytics. Global revenue for Moody’s Analytics of $194 million was up 18% from the first quarter of 2011. The impact of foreign currency translation was negligible. U.S. revenue grew by 19% year over year to $85 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 17% to $109 million and represented 56% of total Moody’s Analytics revenue.
Globally revenue from research data and analytics of $120 million increased 9% from the prior-year period due primarily to increased sales of credit research and related data and represented 62% of the total MA revenue. Revenue from enterprise risk solutions formerly known as risk management software of $48 million grew 11% from last year driven by the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert.
Due to the variable nature of the project timing, enterprise risk solution revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue more than doubled to $27 million reflecting both the acquisition of the majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011 and growth in our existing training and education business. Turning now to expenses. Moody’s first quarter expenses were $378 million, an increase of 16% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Incremental compensation expense which accounted for over half of the growth was primarily driven by additional headcount in the operating businesses and from the acquisition. Other incremental expenses were largely composed of non-compensation expenses related to the acquisitions including purchased price amortization and IT related costs.
The impact of foreign currency translation on first quarter expenses was negligible. Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter was 41.6%, down from 43.3% from the first quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.1% compared with 33.2% for the prior-year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to benefits derived from international tax initiatives and tax audit settlement partially offset by miscellaneous discrete items.
Now I will provide an update on capital allocation. During the first quarter of 2012, Moody's did not repurchase any shares, but did issue 2.6 million shares under employee stock based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of March 31, 2012 totaled 225 million representing a 1% decline from a year ago. As of quarter end, Moody's had 900 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current programs and as we have previously noted, we still expect to repurchase approximately 200 million of Moody's shares over the course of 2012, subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation provision.
As of March 31, Moody's had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Additionally on April 18, 2012 we renewed our $1 billion credit facility for another five-year term. Cash and cash equivalents were $815 million, an increase of $95 million from a year earlier. Approximately 80% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. And with that I will turn the call back over to Ray."
528325,183801369,290981,"Moody's Corp., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2012",2012-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Moody's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Linda. I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. Starting in the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer 2011 common deadline for rule p",924,"Thanks, Linda. I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. Starting in the U.S., regulatory authorities are moving forward on implementing the various parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Following the SEC’s summer 2011 common deadline for rule proposals relevant to NRSROs, the SEC revised its timetable and is expected to adopt final rules by year-end 2012.
Within the same time, the SEC is also is expected to publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products, otherwise known as the Franken Amendment.
Turing to Europe, Moody’s was registered in the European Union in late October 2011, and as I have indicated on previous calls, the transfer of oversight of registered credit rating agencies to the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA, became effective in July, 2011. Our European operations are therefore under the full examination and oversight authority of ESMA and ESMA published its first inspection report in March. ESMA report had not identified any breaches of the current regulation by Moody’s.
As discussed on previous calls, in November 2011, the European Commission release new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry known as CRA 3 that seek to address among other ideas, the use of ratings and regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability.
If implemented as currently constructed, the Commission's suggested measures are likely to have significant negative implications for Europe’s credit markets.
Consequently, the debate on CRA 3 which began in the European Parliament and European Council of Finance Ministers in mid-January has involved the growing number of market participants. The focus on the debate has been on the potential negative impact of CRA 3 on the broader European economy and the ability of European insurers to access funds. Because of the tone of the debate thus far, it is possible that during the coming months, the Commission’s proposals will be amended.
The next stages of the legislative process include deliberation and potential amendments by both the European Parliament and the Council of European Finance Ministers. The Parliament, Council and Commission must also confer and agree on final text. We expect this process to be completed by year-end and we will continue to consult with relevant authorities and market participants as of the impact of the specific proposals.
While new rules could entail various changes in our rating processes and operations and require us adapt our business. We will not abandon our fundamental objective to provide the highest quality, independent credit opinions, research and analysis.
We will also continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives. I will conclude this morning’s prepared remarks by discussing on full-year guidance.
Moody’s outlook for 2012 is based on assumption about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency transition at end of quarter exchange rates. As I mentioned earlier, we are re-affirming our 2012 EPS guidance of $2.62 to $2.72 but now expect to be toward the upper end of the range. That we have re-affirmed our EPS guidance, certain components of 2012 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market condition.
For Moody’s overall, the company now expects full-year 2012 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Full-year 2012 expenses are also projected to increase in the low double digit percent range. Full-year 2012 operating margin is still projected to be approximately 39%, which included the full-year impact of our fourth quarter 2011 acquisitions. Effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 33%.
As Linda mentioned earlier, we still expect approximately $200 million of share repurchase over the course of 2012 subject to available cash flow, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
For the global MIS business, revenue for full-year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-to-high single digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low double-digit percentage range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the low single digit percentage range.
The finance revenue is now forecasted to grow in the low double digit percentage range. Revenue from each of the structured finance and financial institution is now projected to be flat to slightly up, while public project and infrastructure finances is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For Moody’s analytics for full-year 2012, revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range both inside and outside the U.S. Revenue growth is still projected in mid-single digit percent range for our research, data and analytics and in the low 20% range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting growth in the core business as well of December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 80%, inclusive of the revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners and continued growth in our existing training and education businesses.
This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investors Service and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s analytics. We would be pleased to take any questions you may have."

So our margin is lower in the first quarter of 2012 by 170 basis points. And as we noted in the script about 1/2 of that is acquisition related or 90 basis points. Of that, the purchase price amortization for the acquisitions was about 1/2 of the 90 basis points or 45. The other piece of that, 80 basis points was IT related costs. And we have a little bit of an anomalous situation here on the IT front as we’re getting ready for Dodd-Frank implementation. Because we are not building permanent systems, but rather making enhancements to our existing systems we have to expense those costs. So our expenses are running a little bit higher on the IT front than they might usually for this couple of quarters. So if you want to think about that you might have certainly a 120 basis points or so that would normally go back to the margins that would not be doing so for the first quarter of this year. Looking forward, I think in the longer term we do expect our margin to be back over 40, but I think we've got to get through this period of expense ramp relating to these regulatory changes we've talked about."

The pipeline, and obviously the first quarter was a strong quarter particularly in the corporate and public project in infrastructure finance areas. We do believe that, that has incorporated some pull-forwards, so issuance that we were expecting later in the year has been pulled into the early part of the year. So for Moody’s Investor Service, I think at this point we now expect to see a stronger first half than second half of the year. For Moody’s Analytics, we would still expect to see a stronger second half than first half of the year. That being said, most of the activity we’ve seen has been refinance and so we have not seen an active market particularly in the corporate area around mergers and acquisitions, base financing, share repurchase, business investment spending. And depending on how confidence evolves throughout this year, we may have a stronger second half than would be implied from a more purely refinance based environment. Before turning this over to Linda on what the pipeline, it looks like the only other comment I would make here is that as we’ve seen over the last 18 months, we expect to see periods of optimism and pessimism really related to the macroeconomic condition and the European sovereign debt crisis. So the pipelines are going to be subject to whether those periods of optimism, pessimism are causing investors to move away from risk and so just expect some volatility in issuance, both positively and negatively."

As you know we’ve just come off a gang-busters first quarter in which average monthly U.S. high grade volume issuance was about $95 billion. Then we came into April and the April high grade volume is expected to be about $30 billion for the month. If we look at recent trends, we would have expected $42 billion that would be the 10 year average for April. So April is running light. Last week we saw about $5 billion of issuance. This week we have seen $5 billion to $10 billion of issuance. So April’s saw quite a bit of softening coming off a very strong first quarter. May, is calling for $70 billion to $ 80 billion of high grade issuance and we’re starting to see pipelines we build, but again we are concerned about the situation in Europe and any sort of week that auctions coming out of Europe can grow a range into the process pretty quickly. 2012 quoting from some of the banks here we’re still looking at $850 billion of issuance, that’s up 15% from last year, but as Ray said, we have seen some pull-forward so it’s going to be interesting to see what happens for the rest of the year. And turning to high yield, a bit of a different story and this is actually quite interesting because the high yield pipeline is still reasonably strong. For second quarter of 2011, the entire leverage market, about $27 billion of pipeline, high yield financing is about $6 billion of that, leverage loans about $21 billion. That’s the next highest after second quarter of last year where we saw $64 billion of pipeline. So high yield looks pretty good and if it all keeps coming that will be pretty helpful to us. But again, as Ray mentioned, we are very, very conscious about the risk on, risk off sort of phenomenon that we’ve been seeing."

So total MIS is 62 and 38. Moody’s Analytics of course runs sort in reserve of that 20% transaction and 80% relationships. So for the company as a whole first quarter 2012, 49% transaction and 51% relationships."

Again the dramatic swing for us was the change in high-yield revenues for example the fourth quarter of 2011 which was only $15 million. So $36.5 million increase in high yield is obviously very helpful to us. Let me go on to structured and see if we can get those for you. So the total structured line was $94.3 million, asset backs 29% of that revenue or $27 million, RMBS was 25% at $23.3 million. Again that does include cover bonds, commercial real estate 26% or $24 million and derivative 21%, $19.6 million.

As we said before, we expect our expenses to ramp up by about $40 million over the course of the year. And we will continue to expect that to happen and the ramp may be a little bit deeper in the second and third quarters than some of the analysts have noted, so just something to look at in terms of the quarter-by-quarter spread on that. And so there are a number of things we are doing in terms of our investments and more than 1/2 of the growth in those expenses are due to headcount growth and those are in the revenue area as we noted, for the rating agency its corporate finance, public projects and infrastructure and for Moody’s Analytics in enterprise with solutions and sales. So of the expense growth that we are projecting about 1/2 of it is headcount growth to drive the revenue lines in those growing businesses. About $7 million is acquisition related costs, some of that is the amortization of the intangibles. We mentioned this on the last quarter call. We said this would be something that we would be working with, that would take our expenses. And then lastly as I mentioned to Peter, we are seeing a bit of a bump up in the expense side of our IT budget, running a little bit more heavily towards expense ramp and capitalization as we get things ready for Dodd-Frank. So that would explain the majority of the cost ramp coming in 2012. Does that help you?"

Second quarter revenue was $641 million, increased 6% over the prior year period, reflecting solid growth in public finance and structured finance, as well as continued strong results for Moody’s Analytics. Expenses for the second quarter were $362 million, an 8% increase from the second quarter of 2011. Operating income for the second quarter was $279 million, a 3% increase from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share was $0.76 for the second quarter, decreased $0.06 from the prior year period which had included a $0.06 favorable tax impact related to a foreign tax ruling and a $0.03 legacy tax benefit.
While market conditions remain volatile, we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance range of $2.62 to $2.72, and still expect to be towards the upper end of the range. Turning to the year-to-date performance, revenue for the first six months of 2012 was $1.3 billion, a 9% increase from the first half of 2011. Expenses were $740 million, up 12%, and operating income of $548 million, increased 5% from the prior year period.
Diluted earnings per share of $1.52 for the first half of 2012, increased $0.03 from the prior year period, which again had included a $0.06 favorable tax impact related to a foreign tax ruling a $0.03 legacy tax benefit. Revenue of Moody’s Investors Service for the first six months of 2012 was $894 million, an increase of 5% from a year ago. Moody’s Analytics revenue of $394 million was 19% higher than the prior year period.

I will begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $641 million. U.S. second quarter revenue increased 9% to $344 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 2% to $297 m",841,"Thanks, Ray. I will begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $641 million. U.S. second quarter revenue increased 9% to $344 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 2% to $297 million and represented 46% of Moody’s total revenue, down slightly from 48% in the year ago period. Recurring revenue of $338 million represented 53% of the total, up from 51% in the prior year period.
And looking now at each of our businesses. Moody’s Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $441 million, about flat to prior year periods. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 3%. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 5% over the prior year period, while revenue outside the U.S. decreased 5% and represented 42% of total ratings revenue. Global Corporate Finance revenue in the second quarter declined 4% from the year ago period to $192 million. Revenue was down 4% year-over-year both inside and outside the U.S.
The decline in Global Corporate Finance revenue reflected weaker speculative grade bond and bank loan issuance against a near record prior year period. Investment grade issuance for non-financial corporate was higher year-over-year, reflecting continued historically low borrowing rates. Global Structured Finance revenue for the second quarter was $91 million, 5% above prior year period. In the U.S. revenue increased 22% year-over-year primarily due to strength in ratings of collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities.
International Structured Finance revenue was down 9% reflecting issuance declines in European covered bonds and after-tax securities. Global financial institutions revenue of $78 million decreased 2% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was essentially flat as compared to the second quarter of 2011, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%. Global revenue for the public, project and infrastructure business rose 12% year-over-year to $81 million. Revenue was up 19% in U.S., primarily due to gains in ratings for regional government and higher education. While non-U.S. revenue declined 3%.
Turning now to Moody’s Analytics. Global revenue for Moody’s Analytics of $200 million was up 19% from the second quarter of 2011. Slightly more than half of growth was from the late 2011 acquisitions of Copal Partners and Barrie & Hibbert. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21%. U.S. revenue grew by 23% year-over-year to $86 million. Non-U.S. revenue grew to 17%, to $114 million and represented 57% of the total Moody’s Analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $121 million, increased 9% from the prior year period and represented 61% of the total MA revenue. We continue to see demand for credit research via our CreditView offering and solid growth in data licensing arrangements. Revenue from enterprise and risk solutions of $52 million, grew 24% from last year reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert and growth in the base business.
Due to the variable nature of project timing, enterprise risk solutions revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue grew 84% to $27 million, reflecting the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Turning now to expenses. Moody’s second quarter expenses were $362 million, an increase of 8% compared to second quarter 2011 or a 10% increase excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Compensation expense accounted for over half of the year-on-year expense increase, and was due to increased headcount from the acquisitions in late 2011, and from growth in our existing business. Incremental non-compensation expense was driven by higher information technology expense, supporting business growth and regulatory initiative, as well as purchase price amortization associated with acquisition.
Moody’s reported operating margin for the quarter was 43.5%, down from 44.6% in the second quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.6% compared with 27.8% for the prior year period. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower tax rate in 2011 resulting from a favorable foreign tax ruling.
Now I will provide an update on capital allocation. During second quarter of 2012, Moody’s repurchased 2.7 million shares at a total cost of $100 million, and issued 0.3 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Shares outstanding as of June 30, 2012, totaled 222.3 million representing a 3% decline from the year earlier. As of quarter end, Moody’s had $800 million of share purchase authority remaining under its current program. We still expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $200 million subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decision.
As of June 30, 2012, Moody’s had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $824 million, as of June 30, 2012. A decrease of $114 million from a year earlier. Approximately 85% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Ray.

I will continue with an update on regulatory developments.

I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. First in the U.S. We continue to expect the SEC will adopt final rules relevant to nationally recognized credit rating agencies by year-end 2012 and publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products by about the same time.
Both banking and securities regulatory authorities continue to assess their use of ratings and regulations and are in the process of developing potential alternative measures as replacements. Turning to Europe. Moody’s was registered in European Union in late October 2011, and our European operations are under the full examination and oversight authority of the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA. As discussed on previous calls, in November 2011 the European Commission released new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry, commonly referred to as CRA3, that seek to address among other ideas, the use of ratings in regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability.
If implemented as originally proposed by the commission, many believe CRA3 would likely have significant negative implications for Europe’s credit markets. Consequently, the debate among public policy makers and the private sector has focused on CRA3s potential damaging impact on the broader European economy and European issuers access to debt markets. The European legislative process requires that the European Parliament and council of finance ministers of the individual EU member states, each produce its own version of the tax and then enter into discussions with the commission.
During these discussions the three institutions seek to resolve any differences among their respective drafts. And once a compromised document produce, put to a vote. In May of June of 2012, the council and the Parliament respectively finalized their positions on CRA3. We expect the necessary compromise discussions to continue through the autumn months and for CRA3 to be finalized before year-end 2012. It is still too early to assess what the likely outcome of these deliberations would be. As always we will continue to advocate globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives.
I will conclude this morning’s prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance. Moody’s outlook for 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending. Merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There is a important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, especially as they relate to Europe. And if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. As I mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance range of $2.62 to $2.72 and still expect to be towards the upper end of the range. Now that we have reaffirmed our EPS guidance, certain components of 2012 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moody’s overall, the company still expects full year 2012 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also still projected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 operating margin is still projected to be approximately 39%, including the full year impact of our fourth quarter 2012 acquisitions.
Our effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 33%. As Linda mentioned earlier, we still expect full year 2012 share repurchase of approximately $200 million subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately $60 million to $70 million. We still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is still projected to be in the $10 million to $15 million range.
For the global MIS business, revenue for full year 2012 is still expected to increase in the mid to high single digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the low single digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the high single to low double-digit percent range. Revenue from each of structured finance and financial institutions is still projected to be flat to slightly up, while public project and infrastructure finance revenue is still expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For MA, full year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is now expected to increase in the high teens to 20% range, while non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the high teens percent range. Revenue growth is still projected in the mid-single digit percent range for research, data and analytics, and in the low 20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, as well as growth in the base business.
Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 75%, inclusive of revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of the majority stake in Copal Partners, and growth in MA’s existing financial training and certification business.
This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question and answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investors Service; Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s Analytics. We would be pleased to take any questions you might have.

I think from prior calls you know that we are very sportive of that. But frankly the progress on that has not been particularly strong in my view. And there have been probably as many changes in use of ratings in regulation that would seek to increase the use of ratings as there are to decrease the use. So net-net, I don’t think there has been a lot of change.
If nothing else, what we would argue for is at least to reduce the mechanistic use of ratings in regulation. So it reduces some of the [core] risk or pro-cyclicality that’s associated with this. And we do have some views on how that can be done. So as I said, we are supportive of the overall effort even if it has not made a lot of progress and we don’t see it having a negative impact on our business.
And then with respect to liability, yes, we are playing close attention to the discussions in Europe around liability and obviously we will accommodate our business to make sure that we have the maximum protections we can have depending on what kind of liability regime the Europeans determine for our business. And there are -- again there are ways for us to mitigate those risks but we have to wait and see what the final conclusions are at these three party discussions that go on the fall.

First half volume, $469 billion, it’s the largest first half on record, 5% more than the first half of 2008 which is recent high, and more than the first half of 2011. The month-to-date volume has been $51 billion and close to the July 2010 record amount of $59 billion, we may have surpassed that. The last week has been okay and the pipeline looked reasonably good. Right now we have historically low interest rates. I just saw before coming up here the 10-year’s at 1.42, so we are sort of back to Eisenhower level long-term rates. So that is helpful to the pipeline.
And high-yield year-to-date volume is $187 billion, that’s down 13% versus 2011. The first half volume is $152 billion which is down 25% from the first half of last year. Leverage loans year-to-date volume $136 billion, which is down 30% from 2011 year-to-date. And first half volume was $123 billion which is down 31% from the first half. Now high yield market is grinding tighter. We saw a little bit more activity recently. Bu the pipeline seems to be pretty well constrained right now looking at the $10 billion of visible high yield issuance in the pipeline and $13 billion in leverage loans in the pipeline. And again that’s one where you are going to see a little bit of movement depending on who you source for information.
But generally again, high yield pipeline, limited investment grade pipeline, pretty strong. Now on cost costs, Peter, you are correct, we did move down from the first quarter to the second quarter. A couple of things going on there. The first quarter had some unusually high expenses in it. Our big comp quarter is the first quarter and the second quarter has some reductions in that. First quarter obviously was stronger so we had a higher incentive compensation amount and the second quarter was little bit more reasonable. And so that basically is the main driver of what's happened with the quarter-over-quarter expenses.

But this was mitigated by the fact that we do have a large number of frequent issuer pricing agreements in Europe. And those provide a steadier base of revenue. What we are missing though is the growth opportunity in Europe that comes from issuance and that’s why we would look for whether market tone and sentiment improves in the second half or remains as volatile and choppy as it has been in the first half. Because that would bring more of the speculative grade credit to market and those are the credit that are less likely to be under frequent issuer pricing agreements and would increase our transaction based revenue.
Also to the extent that there is a strengthening in market tone in Europe, I would expect that that’s going to be a good news for structured finance issuance, so we would have to keep a close eye on that. And that is transaction-based revenue for the most part.

Let me talk about the back half of the year compared to the first half of the year. And let me start by saying that we don’t give quarterly guidance so you are going to have to do the math on some of it. On the revenue side, we expect that or revenue pattern will lay out approximately like it did this last year. With our revenue coming in with a balance towards the first half of the year with a little bit of weakening towards the second half of the year. So the split on that we are thinking is about 52% first half, 48% back half. So we do, at this point, expect revenue in the second half of the year to be a little bit lower.
Now on the expense side, you are right, we had talked about $40 million ramp coming off our $377 million first quarter expense number. We did do better in the second quarter. We do expect $40 million expense ramp from $377 million as we get to the fourth quarter. And obviously that was would result in a tick-up in expenses in the third quarter and that will move up in the fourth quarter.
Now the reason for that is we have more headcount coming on in the second half of the year. We also have raises that come into play in the back half of the year and some other expenditures that we have to make in terms of IT, particularly to get ready for Dodd-Frank compliance. Many of those are expensed items, so they are changes to existing systems which have to be expensed as opposed to building new systems which are of course capitalized.
So, yes, we expect the continued expense ramp. We expect that revenue may weaken a bit and traditionally our pattern has been that the third quarter is the most challenged on the revenue side. So that might make for a little bit of a tougher situation in the third quarter. So that’s how we see it laying out at this point.

Second quarter revenue was $641 million, increased 6% over the prior year period, reflecting solid growth in public finance and structured finance, as well as continued strong results for Moody’s Analytics. Expenses for the second quarter were $362 million, an 8% increase from the second quarter of 2011. Operating income for the second quarter was $279 million, a 3% increase from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share was $0.76 for the second quarter, decreased $0.06 from the prior year period which had included a $0.06 favorable tax impact related to a foreign tax ruling and a $0.03 legacy tax benefit.
While market conditions remain volatile, we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance range of $2.62 to $2.72, and still expect to be towards the upper end of the range. Turning to the year-to-date performance, revenue for the first six months of 2012 was $1.3 billion, a 9% increase from the first half of 2011. Expenses were $740 million, up 12%, and operating income of $548 million, increased 5% from the prior year period.
Diluted earnings per share of $1.52 for the first half of 2012, increased $0.03 from the prior year period, which again had included a $0.06 favorable tax impact related to a foreign tax ruling a $0.03 legacy tax benefit. Revenue of Moody’s Investors Service for the first six months of 2012 was $894 million, an increase of 5% from a year ago. Moody’s Analytics revenue of $394 million was 19% higher than the prior year period.

I will begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $641 million. U.S. second quarter revenue increased 9% to $344 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 2% to $297 m",839,"Thanks, Ray. I will begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $641 million. U.S. second quarter revenue increased 9% to $344 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 2% to $297 million and represented 46% of Moody’s total revenue, down slightly from 48% in the year ago period. Recurring revenue of $338 million represented 53% of the total, up from 51% in the prior year period.
And looking now at each of our businesses. Moody’s Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $441 million, about flat to prior year periods. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 3%. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 5% over the prior year period, while revenue outside the U.S. decreased 5% and represented 42% of total ratings revenue. Global Corporate Finance revenue in the second quarter declined 4% from the year ago period to $192 million. Revenue was down 4% year-over-year both inside and outside the U.S.
The decline in Global Corporate Finance revenue reflected weaker speculative grade bond and bank loan issuance against a near record prior year period. Investment grade issuance for non-financial corporate was higher year-over-year, reflecting continued historically low borrowing rates. Global Structured Finance revenue for the second quarter was $91 million, 5% above prior year period. In the U.S. revenue increased 22% year-over-year primarily due to strength in ratings of collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities.
International Structured Finance revenue was down 9% reflecting issuance declines in European covered bonds and after-tax securities. Global financial institutions revenue of $78 million decreased 2% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was essentially flat as compared to the second quarter of 2011, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%. Global revenue for the public, project and infrastructure business rose 12% year-over-year to $81 million. Revenue was up 19% in U.S., primarily due to gains in ratings for regional government and higher education. While non-U.S. revenue declined 3%.
Turning now to Moody’s Analytics. Global revenue for Moody’s Analytics of $200 million was up 19% from the second quarter of 2011. Slightly more than half of growth was from the late 2011 acquisitions of Copal Partners and Barrie & Hibbert. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21%. U.S. revenue grew by 23% year-over-year to $86 million. Non-U.S. revenue grew to 17%, to $114 million and represented 57% of the total Moody’s Analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $121 million, increased 9% from the prior year period and represented 61% of the total MA revenue. We continue to see demand for credit research via our CreditView offering and solid growth in data licensing arrangements. Revenue from Enterprise Risk Solutions of $52 million, grew 24% from last year reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert and growth in the base business.
Due to the variable nature of project timing, enterprise risk solutions revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Professional Services revenue grew 84% to $27 million, reflecting the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Turning now to expenses. Moody’s second quarter expenses were $362 million, an increase of 8% compared to second quarter 2011 or a 10% increase excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Compensation expense accounted for over half of the year-on-year expense increase, and was due to increased headcount from the acquisitions in late 2011, and from growth in our existing business. Incremental non-compensation expense was driven by higher information technology expense, supporting business growth and regulatory initiative, as well as purchase price amortization associated with acquisition.
Moody’s reported operating margin for the quarter was 43.5%, down from 44.6% in the second quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.6% compared with 27.8% for the prior year period. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower taxes in 2011 resulting from a favorable foreign tax ruling.
Now I will provide an update on capital allocation. During second quarter of 2012, Moody’s repurchased 2.7 million shares at a total cost of $100 million, and issued 0.3 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Shares outstanding as of June 30, 2012, totaled 222.3 million representing a 3% decline from the year earlier. As of quarter end, Moody’s had $800 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. We still expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $200 million subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decision.
As of June 30, 2012, Moody’s had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $824 million, as of June 30, 2012. A decrease of $114 million from a year earlier. Approximately 85% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Ray."

I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. First in the U.S. We continue to expect the SEC will adopt final rules relevant to nationally recognized credit rating agencies by year-end 2012 and publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products by about the same time.
Both banking and securities regulatory authorities continue to assess their use of ratings and regulations and are in the process of developing potential alternative measures as replacements. Turning to Europe. Moody’s was registered in European Union in late October 2011, and our European operations are under the full examination and oversight authority of the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA. As discussed on previous calls, in November 2011 the European Commission released new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry, commonly referred to as CRA3, that seek to address among other ideas, the use of ratings in regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability.
If implemented as originally proposed by the commission, many believe CRA3 would likely have significant negative implications for Europe’s credit markets. Consequently, the debate among public policy makers and the private sector has focused on CRA3s potential damaging impact on the broader European economy and European issuers access to debt markets. The European legislative process requires that the European Parliament and council of finance ministers of the individual EU member states, each produce its own version of the text and then enter into discussions with the commission.
During these discussions the three institutions seek to resolve any differences among their respective drafts. And once a compromised document is produced, put to a vote. In May and June of 2012, the council and the Parliament respectively finalized their positions on CRA3. We expect the necessary compromise discussions to continue through the autumn months and for CRA3 to be finalized before year-end 2012. It is still too early to assess what the likely outcome of these deliberations will be. As always we will continue for advocate globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives.
I will conclude this morning’s prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance. Moody’s outlook for 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending. Merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There is a important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, especially as they relate to Europe. And if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. As I mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance range of $2.62 to $2.72 and still expect to be towards the upper end of the range. Now that we have reaffirmed our EPS guidance, certain components of 2012 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moody’s overall, the company still expects full year 2012 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also still projected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 operating margin is still projected to be approximately 39%, including the full year impact of our fourth quarter 2012 acquisitions.
Our effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 33%. As Linda mentioned earlier, we still expect full year 2012 share repurchase of approximately $200 million subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately $60 million to $70 million. We still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is still projected to be in the $10 million to $15 million range.
For the global MIS business, revenue for full year 2012 is still expected to increase in the mid to high single digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the low single digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the high single to low double-digit percent range. Revenue from each of structured finance and financial institutions is still projected to be flat to slightly up, while public project and infrastructure finance revenue is still expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For MA, full year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is now expected to increase in the high teens to 20% range, while non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the high teens percent range. Revenue growth is still projected in the mid-single digit percent range for research, data and analytics, and in the low 20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, as well as growth in the base business.
Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 75%, inclusive of revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of the majority stake in Copal Partners, and growth in MA’s existing financial training and certification business.
This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question and answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investors Service, and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s Analytics. We would be pleased to take any questions you might have."

I think from prior calls you know that we are very supportive of that. But frankly the progress on that has not been particularly strong in my view. And there have been probably as many changes in use of ratings in regulation that would seek to increase the use of ratings as there are to decrease the use. So net-net, I don’t think there has been a lot of change.
If nothing else, what we would argue for is at least to reduce the mechanistic use of ratings in regulation. So it reduces some of the quick [ph] risk or pro-cyclicality that’s associated with this. And we do have some views on how that can be done. So as I said, we are supportive of the overall effort even if it has not made a lot of progress and we don’t see it having a negative impact on our business.
And then with respect to liability, yes, we are paying close attention to the discussions in Europe around liability and obviously we will accommodate our business to make sure that we have the maximum protections we can have depending on what kind of liability regime the Europeans determine for our business. And there are -- again there are ways for us to mitigate those risks but we have to wait and see what the final conclusions are at these three party discussions that go on the fall."

Year-to-date investment grade volume here in the U.S. is $512 billion which is up 6% from 2011. First half volume, $469 billion, it’s the largest first half on record, 5% more than the first half of 2008 which was our recent high, and more than the first half of 2011. The month-to-date volume has been $51 billion and close to the July 2010 record amount of $59 billion, we may have surpassed that. The last week has been okay and the pipeline looked reasonably good. Right now we have historically low interest rates. I just saw before coming up here the 10-year’s at 1.42, so we are sort of back to Eisenhower level long-term rates. So that is helpful to the pipeline.
And high-yield year-to-date volume is $187 billion, that’s down 13% versus 2011. The first half volume is $152 billion which is down 25% from the first half of last year. Leverage loans year-to-date volume $136 billion, which is down 30% from 2011 year-to-date. And first half volume was $123 billion which is down 31% from the first half. Now high yield market is grinding tighter. We saw a little bit more activity recently. But the pipeline seems to be pretty well constrained right now looking at about $10 billion of visible high yield issuance in the pipeline and $13 billion in leverage loans in the pipeline. And again that’s one view you are going to see a little bit of movement depending on who you source for information.
But generally again, high yield pipeline, limited investment grade pipeline, pretty strong. Now on cost costs, Peter, you are correct, we did move down from the first quarter to the second quarter. A couple of things going on there. The first quarter had some unusually high expenses in it. Our big comp quarter is the first quarter and the second quarter has some reductions in that. First quarter obviously was stronger so we had a higher incentive compensation amount and the second quarter was little bit more reasonable. And so that basically is the main driver of what's happened with the quarter-over-quarter expenses."

But this was mitigated by the fact that we do have a large number of frequent issuer pricing agreements in Europe. And those provide a steadier base of revenue. What we are missing though is the growth opportunity in Europe that comes from issuance and that’s why we would look for whether market tone and sentiment improves in the second half or remains as volatile and choppy as it has been in the first half. Because that would bring more of the speculative grade credit to market and those are the credit that are less likely to be under frequent issuer pricing agreements and would increase our transaction based revenue.
Also to the extent that there is a strengthening in market tone in Europe, I would expect that that’s going to be a good news for structured finance issuance, so we would have to keep a close eye on that. And that is transaction-based revenue for the most part."

Let me talk about the back half of the year compared to the first half of the year. And let me start by saying that we don’t give quarterly guidance so you are going to have to do the math on some of it. On the revenue side, we expect that our revenue pattern will lay out approximately like it did this last year. With our revenue coming in with a balance towards the first half of the year with a little bit of weakening towards the second half of the year. So the split on that we are thinking is about 52% first half, 48% back half. So we do, at this point, expect revenue in the second half of the year to be a little bit lower.
Now on the expense side, you are right, we had talked about $40 million ramp coming off our $377 million first quarter expense number. We did do better in the second quarter. We do expect $40 million expense ramp from that $377 million as we get to the fourth quarter. And obviously that would result in a tick-up in expenses in the third quarter and another move up in the fourth quarter.
Now the reason for that is we have more headcount coming on in the second half of the year. We also have raises that come into play in the back half of the year and some other expenditures that we have to make in terms of IT, particularly to get ready for Dodd-Frank compliance. Many of those are expensed items, so they are changes to existing systems which have to be expensed as opposed to building new systems which are of course capitalized.
So, yes, we expect the continued expense ramp. We expect that revenue may weaken a bit and traditionally our pattern has been that the third quarter is the most challenged on the revenue side. So that might make for a little bit of a tougher situation in the third quarter. So that’s how we see it laying out at this point."

Second quarter revenue was $641 million, increased 6% over the prior year period, reflecting solid growth in public finance and structured finance, as well as continued strong results for Moody’s Analytics. Expenses for the second quarter were $362 million, an 8% increase from the second quarter of 2011. Operating income for the second quarter was $279 million, a 3% increase from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share was $0.76 for the second quarter, decreased $0.06 from the prior year period which had included a $0.06 favorable tax impact related to a foreign tax ruling and a $0.03 legacy tax benefit.
While market conditions remain volatile, we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance range of $2.62 to $2.72, and still expect to be towards the upper end of the range. Turning to the year-to-date performance, revenue for the first 6 months of 2012 was $1.3 billion, a 9% increase from the first half of 2011. Expenses were $740 million, up 12%, and operating income of $548 million, increased 5% from the prior year period.
Diluted earnings per share of $1.52 for the first half of 2012, increased $0.03 from the prior year period, which again had included a $0.06 favorable tax impact related to a foreign tax ruling a $0.03 legacy tax benefit. Revenue of Moody’s Investors Service for the first 6 months of 2012 was $894 million, an increase of 5% from a year ago. Moody’s Analytics revenue of $394 million was 19% higher than the prior year period.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on or financial results and other updates."

I will begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $641 million. U.S. second quarter revenue increased 9% to $344 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 2% to $297 m",839,"Thanks, Ray. I will begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody’s total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $641 million. U.S. second quarter revenue increased 9% to $344 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 2% to $297 million and represented 46% of Moody’s total revenue, down slightly from 48% in the year ago period. Recurring revenue of $338 million represented 53% of the total, up from 51% in the prior year period.
And looking now at each of our businesses. Moody’s Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $441 million, about flat to prior year periods. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 3%. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 5% over the prior year period, while revenue outside the U.S. decreased 5% and represented 42% of total ratings revenue. Global Corporate Finance revenue in the second quarter declined 4% from the year ago period to $192 million. Revenue was down 4% year-over-year both inside and outside the U.S.
The decline in Global Corporate Finance revenue reflected weaker speculative grade bond and bank loan issuance against a near record prior year period. Investment grade issuance for non-financial corporate was higher year-over-year, reflecting continued historically low borrowing rates. Global Structured Finance revenue for the second quarter was $91 million, 5% above prior year period. In the U.S. revenue increased 22% year-over-year primarily due to strength in ratings of collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities.
International Structured Finance revenue was down 9% reflecting issuance declines in European covered bonds and after-tax securities. Global financial institutions revenue of $78 million decreased 2% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was essentially flat as compared to the second quarter of 2011, while non-U.S. revenue was down 3%. Global revenue for the public, project and infrastructure business rose 12% year-over-year to $81 million. Revenue was up 19% in U.S., primarily due to gains in ratings for regional government and higher education. While non-U.S. revenue declined 3%.
Turning now to Moody’s Analytics. Global revenue for Moody’s Analytics of $200 million was up 19% from the second quarter of 2011. Slightly more than half of growth was from the late 2011 acquisitions of Copal Partners and Barrie & Hibbert. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21%. U.S. revenue grew by 23% year-over-year to $86 million. Non-U.S. revenue grew to 17%, to $114 million and represented 57% of the total Moody’s Analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $121 million, increased 9% from the prior year period and represented 61% of the total MA revenue. We continue to see demand for credit research via our CreditView offering and solid growth in data licensing arrangements. Revenue from Enterprise Risk Solutions of $52 million, grew 24% from last year reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert and growth in the base business.
Due to the variable nature of project timing, enterprise risk solutions revenue remains subject to quarterly volatility. Professional Services revenue grew 84% to $27 million, reflecting the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Turning now to expenses. Moody’s second quarter expenses were $362 million, an increase of 8% compared to second quarter 2011 or a 10% increase excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Compensation expense accounted for over half of the year-on-year expense increase, and was due to increased headcount from the acquisitions in late 2011, and from growth in our existing business. Incremental non-compensation expense was driven by higher information technology expense, supporting business growth and regulatory initiative, as well as purchase price amortization associated with acquisition.
Moody’s reported operating margin for the quarter was 43.5%, down from 44.6% in the second quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.6% compared with 27.8% for the prior year period. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower taxes in 2011 resulting from a favorable foreign tax ruling.
Now I will provide an update on capital allocation. During second quarter of 2012, Moody’s repurchased 2.7 million shares at a total cost of $100 million, and issued 0.3 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Shares outstanding as of June 30, 2012, totaled 222.3 million representing a 3% decline from the year earlier. As of quarter end, Moody’s had $800 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. We still expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $200 million subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decision.
As of June 30, 2012, Moody’s had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $824 million, as of June 30, 2012. A decrease of $114 million from a year earlier. Approximately 85% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Ray."

I will continue with an update on regulatory developments.

I will continue with an update on regulatory developments. First in the U.S. We continue to expect the SEC will adopt final rules relevant to nationally recognized credit rating agencies by year-end 2012 and publish its feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products by about the same time.
Both banking and securities regulatory authorities continue to assess their use of ratings and regulations and are in the process of developing potential alternative measures as replacements. Turning to Europe. Moody’s was registered in European Union in late October 2011, and our European operations are under the full examination and oversight authority of the European Securities and Markets Authority or ESMA. As discussed on previous calls, in November 2011 the European Commission released new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry, commonly referred to as CRA3, that seek to address among other ideas, the use of ratings in regulation, business models, competition, rotation of rating agencies and liability.
If implemented as originally proposed by the commission, many believe CRA3 would likely have significant negative implications for Europe’s credit markets. Consequently, the debate among public policy makers and the private sector has focused on CRA3s potential damaging impact on the broader European economy and European issuers access to debt markets. The European legislative process requires that the European Parliament and council of finance ministers of the individual EU member states, each produce its own version of the text and then enter into discussions with the commission.
During these discussions the 3 institutions seek to resolve any differences among their respective drafts. And once a compromised document is produced, put to a vote. In May and June of 2012, the council and the Parliament respectively finalized their positions on CRA3. We expect the necessary compromise discussions to continue through the autumn months and for CRA3 to be finalized before year-end 2012. It is still too early to assess what the likely outcome of these deliberations will be. As always we will continue for advocate globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives.
I will conclude this morning’s prepared comments by discussing our full year guidance. Moody’s outlook for 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending. Merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the amount of debt issued. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, especially as they relate to Europe. And if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook.
Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. As I mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2012 EPS guidance range of $2.62 to $2.72 and still expect to be towards the upper end of the range. Now that we have reaffirmed our EPS guidance, certain components of 2012 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moody’s overall, the company still expects full year 2012 revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also still projected to increase in the low double-digit percent range. Full year 2012 operating margin is still projected to be approximately 39%, including the full year impact of our fourth quarter 2012 acquisitions.
Our effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 33%. As Linda mentioned earlier, we still expect full year 2012 share repurchase of approximately $200 million subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are still projected to be approximately $60 million to $70 million. We still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is still projected to be in the $10 million to $15 million range.
For the global MIS business, revenue for full year 2012 is still expected to increase in the mid to high single digit percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is still expected to increase in the low double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the low single digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the high single to low double-digit percent range. Revenue from each of structured finance and financial institutions is still projected to be flat to slightly up, while public project and infrastructure finance revenue is still expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For MA, full year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is now expected to increase in the high teens to 20% range, while non-U.S. revenue is still expected to increase in the high teens percent range. Revenue growth is still projected in the mid-single digit percent range for research, data and analytics, and in the low 20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, as well as growth in the base business.
Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 75%, inclusive of revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of the majority stake in Copal Partners, and growth in MA’s existing financial training and certification business.
This concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question and answer session is Michel Madelain, President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investors Service, and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s Analytics. We would be pleased to take any questions you might have."

So what's your thought in terms of the move to replace ratings in regulations in term of the implications of that. Are you seeing any changes in the portion of debt securities that are issued that are rated versus not rated? That was part one. And then part 2, with regard to CRA3, the liability issue seems like it might be the bugaboo. What's your read on how that’s going to play out?"

I think from prior calls you know that we are very supportive of that. But frankly the progress on that has not been particularly strong in my view. And there have been probably as many changes in use of ratings in regulation that would seek to increase the use of ratings as there are to decrease the use. So net-net, I don’t think there has been a lot of change. If nothing else, what we would argue for is at least to reduce the mechanistic use of ratings in regulation. So it reduces some of the quick [ph] risk or pro-cyclicality that’s associated with this. And we do have some views on how that can be done. So as I said, we are supportive of the overall effort even if it has not made a lot of progress and we don’t see it having a negative impact on our business. And then with respect to liability, yes, we are paying close attention to the discussions in Europe around liability and obviously we will accommodate our business to make sure that we have the maximum protections we can have depending on what kind of liability regime the Europeans determine for our business. And there are -- again there are ways for us to mitigate those risks but we have to wait and see what the final conclusions are at these 3 party discussions that go on the fall."

First half volume, $469 billion, it’s the largest first half on record, 5% more than the first half of 2008 which was our recent high, and more than the first half of 2011. The month-to-date volume has been $51 billion and close to the July 2010 record amount of $59 billion, we may have surpassed that. The last week has been okay and the pipeline looked reasonably good. Right now we have historically low interest rates. I just saw before coming up here the 10-year’s at 1.42, so we are sort of back to Eisenhower level long-term rates. So that is helpful to the pipeline. And high-yield year-to-date volume is $187 billion, that’s down 13% versus 2011. The first half volume is $152 billion which is down 25% from the first half of last year. Leverage loans year-to-date volume $136 billion, which is down 30% from 2011 year-to-date. And first half volume was $123 billion which is down 31% from the first half. Now high yield market is grinding tighter. We saw a little bit more activity recently. But the pipeline seems to be pretty well constrained right now looking at about $10 billion of visible high yield issuance in the pipeline and $13 billion in leverage loans in the pipeline. And again that’s one view you are going to see a little bit of movement depending on who you source for information. But generally again, high yield pipeline, limited investment grade pipeline, pretty strong. Now on cost costs, Peter, you are correct, we did move down from the first quarter to the second quarter. A couple of things going on there. The first quarter had some unusually high expenses in it. Our big comp quarter is the first quarter and the second quarter has some reductions in that. First quarter obviously was stronger so we had a higher incentive compensation amount and the second quarter was little bit more reasonable. And so that basically is the main driver of what's happened with the quarter-over-quarter expenses."

But this was mitigated by the fact that we do have a large number of frequent issuer pricing agreements in Europe. And those provide a steadier base of revenue. What we are missing though is the growth opportunity in Europe that comes from issuance and that’s why we would look for whether market tone and sentiment improves in the second half or remains as volatile and choppy as it has been in the first half. Because that would bring more of the speculative grade credit to market and those are the credit that are less likely to be under frequent issuer pricing agreements and would increase our transaction based revenue. Also to the extent that there is a strengthening in market tone in Europe, I would expect that that’s going to be a good news for structured finance issuance, so we would have to keep a close eye on that. And that is transaction-based revenue for the most part."

Let me talk about the back half of the year compared to the first half of the year. And let me start by saying that we don’t give quarterly guidance so you are going to have to do the math on some of it. On the revenue side, we expect that our revenue pattern will lay out approximately like it did this last year. With our revenue coming in with a balance towards the first half of the year with a little bit of weakening towards the second half of the year. So the split on that we are thinking is about 52% first half, 48% back half. So we do, at this point, expect revenue in the second half of the year to be a little bit lower. Now on the expense side, you are right, we had talked about $40 million ramp coming off our $377 million first quarter expense number. We did do better in the second quarter. We do expect $40 million expense ramp from that $377 million as we get to the fourth quarter. And obviously that would result in a tick-up in expenses in the third quarter and another move up in the fourth quarter. Now the reason for that is we have more headcount coming on in the second half of the year. We also have raises that come into play in the back half of the year and some other expenditures that we have to make in terms of IT, particularly to get ready for Dodd-Frank compliance. Many of those are expensed items, so they are changes to existing systems which have to be expensed as opposed to building new systems which are of course capitalized. So, yes, we expect the continued expense ramp. We expect that revenue may weaken a bit and traditionally our pattern has been that the third quarter is the most challenged on the revenue side. So that might make for a little bit of a tougher situation in the third quarter. So that’s how we see it laying out at this point."

Third quarter revenue of $689 million, increased 30% over the prior-year period, and was the highest quarterly revenue Moody's has achieved in its history. We benefited from double-digit revenue growth in all lines of business at MIS, with particularly strong performance in corporate finance, as well as continued strong growth in all areas of Moody's Analytics.
Expenses for the third quarter were $419 million, a 25% increase from the third quarter of 2011. Operating income for the third quarter was $270 million, a 38% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $294 million, up 36% from the same period last year.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.81 for the third quarter, which included a $0.06 legacy tax benefit, increased 42% from the prior-year period. Excluding the legacy tax benefit in the current quarter, diluted earnings per share of $0.75 for the third quarter of 2012, were up 32% from the prior-year period. Based on strong third quarter performance, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.05, or $2.89 to $2.99, excluding legacy tax benefit in the third quarter.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Revenue for the first nine months of 2012 was $2 billion, a 15% increase from the first nine months of 2011. Revenue of Moody's Investor Service was $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2012, an increase of 14% from a year ago.
Moody's Analytics revenue of $609 million was 19% higher than the prior-year period. Expenses for the first nine months of 2012 were $1.2 billion, up 16% from the prior-year period. Operating income of $817 million increased 14% from $716 million for the same period of 2011. Diluted earnings per share of $2.34 for the first nine months of 2012, which included the $0.06 legacy tax benefit increased 14% from the prior-year period.

U.S. third quarter revenue increased 37% to $375 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 22% to $313 million and represented 45% of Moody's total revenue, down slightly from 48% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $346 million represented 50% of the total, down from 59% in the prior-year period.
Looking now at each of our businesses, Moody's Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $474 million, up 35% from the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 4%. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 45% over the prior-year period. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 21% and represented 39% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the third quarter increased 71% from the year-ago period to $221 million. Revenue was up 81% year-over-year in the U.S., primarily driven by issuance in the speculative grade market, including high-yield bonds and bank loans. Investment grade issuance was also strong in the U.S. The corporation is taking advantage of historically low rates. Outside the U.S., corporate finance revenue grew 53%, primarily reflecting increased investment grade issuance across all regions.
Global structured finance revenue for the third quarter was $93 million, 14% above the prior-year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 27% year-over-year, primarily due to strong issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligation. International structured finance revenue was essentially flat to the prior-year period.
Global financial institutions revenue of $83 million increased 15% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was up 22% as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily driven by increased insurance company issuance, corporate financing and debt-funded M&A activity. Non-U.S. revenue was up 10%, primarily due to increased issuance in Latin America and Asia, prompted by refinancing of short-term debt, credit expansion due to economic growth, and reduced lending by European banks in this regions.
Global revenue for the public, project and infrastructure business rose 13% year-over-year to $77 million. Revenue was up 11% in the U.S., primarily due to gains in public and infrastructure finance, while non-U.S. revenue increased 16%, reflecting growth in European infrastructure finance.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for Moody's Analytics of $215 million was up 20% from the third quarter of 2011. Slightly more than half of the growth was from the late 2011 acquisitions of Copal Partners and Barrie & Hibbert. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21%. U.S. revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to $86 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 23% to $129 million, and represented 60% of total Moody's Analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $124 million increased 7% from the prior-year period and represented 58% of total MA revenue. We continue to see demand for credit research via our CreditView offering as well as new sales of our other analytic data and analytics product.
Revenues from enterprise risk solutions of $64 million grew 26% from last year, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, and strong growth in products and services that support the regulatory compliance needs of our financial services customers. Due to the variable nature of project timing, enterprise risk solutions revenue remain subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue grew 97% to $27 million, reflecting the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expenses were $419 million, an increase of 25% compared to third quarter of 2011 or a 27% increase, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Higher accruals for incentive compensation and Moody's profit sharing plan, reflecting a stronger full year outlook accounting for about half of the year-on-year expense growth.
More specifically, we recorded additional incentive compensation in the third quarter to align with stronger than expected year-to-date financial performance, and the increased full year outlook as reflected in our updated guidance. Therefore, incentive compensation for the third quarter was $59 million versus $28 million in each of the first and second quarters.
Additionally, in the third quarter, we recorded approximately $8 million of profit sharing expense, given the increase in our EPS guidance. As you may remember, our 2012 compensation plan were profit sharing, when our pro forma EPS grows more than 10% from the prior-year period. Our current pro forma EPS guidance results in a growth of over 10% from 2011's pro forma EPS, whereas our guidance at the end of the second quarter did not.
Excluding growth in incentive compensation and profit sharing, expenses for the third quarter were 15% higher from the prior-year period, primarily due to increased headcount from growth in our existing businesses and from acquisitions in late 2011. Moody's reported operating margin expanded 230 basis points year-over-year from 36.9% in the third quarter of 2011 to 39.2% for the current quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 42.7% for the quarter, up from 40.5% for the same period last year.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5% compared with 28.5% for the prior-year period. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower taxes in 2011 resulting from the settlement of state tax audit, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign tax planning initiatives in 2012.
Now, I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2012, Moody's repurchased 600,000 shares at a total cost of $25 million and issued 1.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Shares outstanding as of September 30, 2012, totaled 223 million, essentially flat from the year earlier.
As of quarter-end, Moody's had $700 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. We now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
As of September 30, Moody's had $1.7 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2012, an increase of $664 million from a year earlier, largely due to our $500 million bond deal in August this year. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 52% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S.
For the first nine months of 2012, free cash flow was $461 million, a decrease of $152 million from a year ago, due in part to payments of approximately $121 million related to the settlement of state and local tax matters as well as movement in other working capital accounts. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray.

In the U.S., the SEC's rulemaking pursuant to Dodd-Frank is pending. The timing is uncertain regarding final rules relevant to NRSROs as well as the feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocation rating assignments for structured finance products. Both banking and securities regulatory authorities continue to assess their use of ratings and regulation and are in the process of developing potential alternative measures as replacements.
Turning to Europe, as discussed on previous calls, in November 2011, the European Commission released new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry, commonly referred to as CRA3. The European legislative process requires that the European Parliament and the Council of Finance Ministers of the individual EU member states, each produce its own version of the text, and then enter into discussions with the Commission. During these discussions, the three institutions seek to resolve any differences among their respective drafts, and once the compromised document is produced, put to a vote.
In May and June of 2012, the Council and the Parliament respectively finalized their positions on CRA3. The discussions among the three institutions are underway. However, currently we can't predict the timeline for finalization of CRA3 with any degree of precision. Additionally, it's still too early to assess what the likely outcome of these deliberations will be. As always, we will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that aligns with the G20 statements and directives.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance. Moody's outlook for the remainder of 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing, and securitization, and the amount of debt issued.
There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, especially as they relate to Europe. And if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates.
As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance to a range of $2.95 to $3.05 from the previous range of $2.76 to $2.86. Full year pro forma EPS, which excludes the impact of a legacy tax benefit, is now expected to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.99.
Certain components of our 2012 guidance have also been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moody's overall, the company now expects full year 2012 revenue to grow in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also now projected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 operating margin is now projected to be approximately 40% and adjusted operating margin for the year is still expected to be approximately 43%. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 32%.
As Linda mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $40 million to $50 million, and we still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is now projected to be approximately $15 million.
For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the low-20s percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the mid-20s percent range. Revenue from structured finance is expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. And public project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For Moody's Analytics, full year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens to 20% range. Non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Research, data and analytics is now projected to grow in the high-single digit percent range.
While revenue growth is still projected in the low-20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert as well as growth in the base business. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 70%, reflecting revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners.
In closing, I'd like to point out a couple of additional positive developments at Moody's. Moody's Investors Service was voted the best credit rating agency in 2012 poll of U.S. fixed-income investors, conducted by the well-known publisher, Institutional Investor. Also this past week, Automatic Data Processing Incorporated, a leading provider of business outsourcing solutions announced that it has chosen to collaborate with Moody's Analytics to enhance widely followed ADP National Employment Report. I am extremely pleased with the accomplishments of both businesses and appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is, Michel Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics.
We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have.

It's going to be difficult to achieve that matter, because the issuance was so robust in the third quarter, and we have some external events, such as the election in a couple of short months, in the fourth quarter. But nonetheless, we still see healthy pipelines. And barring something really unanticipated, I think we believe the fourth quarter will be another good quarter.

First looking at high grade and all this information comes from Morgan Stanley as of this morning.
October, right now, stands at $78 billion of issuance for U.S. high grades and that has been the strongest October on record. The month could break $100 billion, if some big deals that are said to be in the pipeline come next week. But we did experience a warning regarding potential weather delays, which is something new.
For November, expectations are about $70 billion for U.S. hybrid issuance, last year it was $77 billion and the average is about $63 billion, so a little bit above the average for November. For high yield and leveraged, last week we saw $12 billion in high-yield issuance and $9.3 billion in leverage loan, that's still very active. This week we've seen $7.5 billion both in high yield and in leverage loan. October saw $41 billion in high yields and $32 billion in leverage loans. Our Q3 issuance was a record post of financial crisis for the leveraged area, $112 billion in high-yield issuance for the third quarter and $81 billion in leverage loans.
As Ray said, the fourth quarter will not be as strong as the third quarter, but will still be very active. The list of pipeline so far that can be seen for November is $19 billion in high yield and $10 billion in leverage loans. And again, a bit of concern that the first week of November could be low, due to the weather and then following with the elections, and obviously the usual watch outs for anything changing in the European situation.

Commercial mortgage-backed securities, CLOs, the asset-backed market, covered bonds are the more promising sectors.
We still don't anticipate a big rebound in 2013 in the residential mortgage-backed securities area. But I guess the further reason for optimism in that sector is, we seem to be moving away from some of the more regulatory-driven causes of issuance into more real market issuance, and I would take that as a sign of health.

And if you look at the Q3 year-over-year, you'll see that last year we had $335 million of expenses, this year in the third quarter we had $418 million of expenses. The vast majority of that change, $59 million or 70% of that, is compensation. So very important to remember that three times this year we've increased guidance, and the main driver of expense increase is in fact the over-performance and the resulting incentive compensation, which results.
Another cause of expense growth is our acquisitions, which added $18 million to the expenses in the third quarter. Now, some of that breaks out into compensation for new people, about $10 million of it. We had the increase in depreciation and amortization and some other non-comp expenses, and then we have a few other things in there. But again, if you look at the expense increase, which is 25% year-over-year, it would be 15% without the incentive compensation.
So probably the best way to think about it is, if we normalize back to more normal performance last year. We try as hard as we can to have expense growth not exceed, and in fact be less than revenue growth. So we'll see where get to, as Ray said, for that in 2013. But we're mindful of expense growth, but this is a very fast growing business and we are continuing to support it.

I think it's clear that we have seen pull-forward throughout this year, including in the third quarter. So firms are looking at the potential for some market uncertainty around the fiscal cliff, potentially as developments occur in Europe. And they are taking advantage of low official rates and good spreads, not historically tight spreads, but good.
That being said, much of the activity that we have seen this year, most of the activity continues to be refinancing, as oppose to issuance for mergers and acquisitions, and business expansion, share repurchase, et cetera. So similar to comments I've made in the last couple of quarters, it has been a very powerful refinancing engine that we have been experiencing over the course of the year. But most of the traditional drivers of debt issuance have really not been very strong this year and so. And that's what we'll be looking for going into 2013, 2014. Linda, do you want to take the share repurchase?

Because we realized that our performance was pretty good, we could not go back into the market opportunistically.

Now, the bigger changes there would be, as Ray had noted in the commercial real estate lines, and also interestingly in the derivatives line, we saw more CLO issuance thus far in 2012 than we did in the entire period of 2008 to 2011. In fact, last week, there were five CLOs. So that market is doing quite well.
Let me go on and go to financial institutions group, total revenue for the quarter $82.7 million, banking about $57 million of that or 69%; insurance $21 million, 26% of it; and managed investments $4.6 million, about 6% of the total; and each of those lines are pretty consistent to what we saw last year.
For PPIF, $77 million for the quarter, $38 million in public finance and sovereign, 49% of the total; munis $4.4 million, 6% of the total; and project and infrastructure $34.5 million, about 45% of the total; so everything now looks relatively similar, little bit of an increase in project and infrastructure.

We will continue to add headcounts to drive very strong growth in both of these businesses. But it does take investment in people and resources to achieve double-digit revenue growth, which is pretty unusual in terms of the companies that have been reporting this week. We're feeling pretty good about these numbers, but we will need to continue to invest. And hopefully yes, that will continue to go to the revenue generating part of the business.

There's not a lot new in recent months in the CalPERS litigation. As we mentioned on a prior earnings call, we filed an appeal in the California Court of Appeals seeking reversal of the lower court's decision, which deny our motion to dismiss under this anti-SLAPP statute in California. And the briefing on that appeal is not going to be completed until the end of the year. And after that the court will set a date for all arguments. So currently we don't know when the case will be argued or when it will be decided. So it's moving along quite slowly.
With respect to de-leveraging and the banking sector, I'll make just a quick comment and then Linda or Michel may wish to add to that. The de-leveraging is continuing. We are seeing reduction in bank loans, particularly in Europe and the de-leveraging that's associated with that. We believe that is going to continue for a relatively long time as the banking system retrenches.
The benefit of that as we've talked about is that that encourages corporations and municipal entities to go to the bond market and seek ratings. And our financial institutions area is the area that is most dominated of the ratings businesses by recurring revenue. Majority of our revenue in that area is recurring, and so we are less sensitive to the de-leveraging in that area. We also don't get the benefits of banks leveraging up when they do that, but in this environment we get the benefit of not having revenue reductions in the same degree that there is de-leveraging or retrenching.

Third quarter revenue of $689 million, increased 30% over the prior-year period, and was the highest quarterly revenue Moody's has achieved in its history. We benefited from double-digit revenue growth in all lines of business at MIS, with particularly strong performance in corporate finance, as well as continued strong growth in all areas of Moody's Analytics.
Expenses for the third quarter were $419 million, a 25% increase from the third quarter of 2011. Operating income for the third quarter was $270 million, a 38% increase from the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $294 million, up 36% from the same period last year.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.81 for the third quarter, which included a $0.06 legacy tax benefit, increased 42% from the prior-year period. Excluding the legacy tax benefit in the current quarter, diluted earnings per share of $0.75 for the third quarter of 2012, were up 32% from the prior-year period. Based on strong third quarter performance, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.05, or $2.89 to $2.99, excluding legacy tax benefit in the third quarter.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Revenue for the first 9 months of 2012 was $2 billion, a 15% increase from the first 9 months of 2011. Revenue of Moody's Investor Service was $1.4 billion for the first 9 months of 2012, an increase of 14% from a year ago.
Moody's Analytics revenue of $609 million was 19% higher than the prior-year period. Expenses for the first 9 months of 2012 were $1.2 billion, up 16% from the prior-year period. Operating income of $817 million increased 14% from $716 million for the same period of 2011. Diluted earnings per share of $2.34 for the first 9 months of 2012, which included the $0.06 legacy tax benefit increased 14% from the prior-year period.

Global corporate finance revenue in the third quarter increased 71% from the year-ago period to $221 million. Revenue was up 81% year-over-year in the U.S., primarily driven by issuance in the speculative grade market, including high-yield bonds and bank loans. Investment grade issuance was also strong in the U.S. The corporation is taking advantage of historically low rates.

In the U.S., revenue increased 27% year-over-year, primarily due to strong issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations. International structured finance revenue was essentially flat to the prior-year period.
Global financial institutions revenue of $83 million increased 15% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was up 22% as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily driven by increased insurance company issuance, corporate financing and debt-funded M&A activity. Non-U.S. revenue was up 10%, primarily due to increased issuance in Latin America and Asia, prompted by refinancing of short-term debt, credit expansion due to economic growth and reduced lending by European banks in these regions.
Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure business rose 13% year-over-year to $77 million. Revenue was up 11% in the U.S., primarily due to gains in public and infrastructure finance, while non-U.S. revenue increased 16%, reflecting growth in European infrastructure finance.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for Moody's Analytics of $215 million was up 20% from the third quarter of 2011. Slightly more than half of the growth was from the late 2011 acquisitions of Copal Partners and Barrie & Hibbert. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21%. U.S. revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to $86 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 23% to $129 million, and represented 60% of Moody's Analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $124 million increased 7% from the prior-year period and represented 58% of total MA revenue. We continue to see demand for credit research via our CreditView offering as well as new sales of our other analytic data and -- excuse me, data and analytic products.
Revenues from enterprise risk solutions of $64 million grew 26% from last year, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, and strong growth in products and services that support the regulatory compliance needs of our financial services customers. Due to the variable nature of project timing, enterprise risk solutions revenue remain subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue grew 97% to $27 million, reflecting the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expenses were $419 million, an increase of 25% compared to third quarter 2011 or a 27% increase, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Higher accruals for incentive compensation and Moody's profit sharing plan, reflecting a stronger full year outlook, accounted for about half of the year-on-year expense growth.
More specifically, we recorded additional incentive compensation in the third quarter to align with stronger than expected year-to-date financial performance, and the increased full year outlook as reflected in our updated guidance. Therefore, incentive compensation for the third quarter was $59 million versus $28 million in each of the first and second quarters.
Additionally, in the third quarter, we recorded approximately $8 million of profit sharing expense, given the increase in our EPS guidance. As you may remember, our 2012 compensation plan awards profit sharing when our pro forma EPS grows more than 10% from the prior-year period. Our current pro forma EPS guidance results in a growth of over 10% from 2011's pro forma EPS, whereas our guidance at the end of the second quarter did not.
Excluding growth in incentive compensation and profit sharing, expenses for the third quarter were 15% higher from the prior-year period, primarily due to increased headcount from growth in our existing businesses and from acquisitions in late 2011. Moody's reported operating margin expanded 230 basis points year-over-year from 36.9% in the third quarter of 2011 to 39.2% for the current quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 42.7% for the quarter, up from 40.5% for the same period last year.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5% compared with 28.5% for the prior-year period. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower taxes in 2011 resulting from the settlement of state tax audit, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign tax planning initiatives in 2012.
Now, I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2012, Moody's repurchased 600,000 shares at a total cost of $25 million and issued 1.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Shares outstanding as of September 30, 2012, totaled 223 million, essentially flat from the year earlier.
As of quarter-end, Moody's had $700 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. We now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
As of September 30, Moody's had $1.7 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2012, an increase of $664 million from a year earlier, largely due to our $500 million bond deal in August this year. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 52% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S.
For the first 9 months of 2012, free cash flow was $461 million, a decrease of $152 million from a year ago, due in part to payments of approximately $121 million related to the settlement of state and local tax matters as well as movement in other working capital accounts. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

The timi",926,"Thanks, Linda. I'll continue with comments on our regulatory environment, which has not changed materially since the update we provided during our second quarter earnings call.
In the U.S., the SEC's rulemaking pursuant to Dodd-Frank is pending. The timing is uncertain regarding final rules relevant to NRSROs as well as the feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products. Both banking and securities regulatory authorities continue to assess their use of ratings and regulation and are in the process of developing potential alternative measures as replacements.
Turning to Europe, as discussed on previous calls, in November 2011, the European Commission released new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry, commonly referred to as CRA3. The European legislative process requires that the European Parliament and the Council of Finance Ministers of the individual EU member states, each produce its own version of the text, and then enter into discussions with the Commission. During these discussions, the three institutions seek to resolve any differences among their respective drafts, and once the compromised document is produced, put to a vote.
In May and June of 2012, the Council and the Parliament respectively finalized their positions on CRA3. The discussions among the three institutions are under way. However, currently we can't predict the timeline for finalization of CRA3 with any degree of precision. Additionally, it's still too early to assess what the likely outcome of these deliberations will be. As always, we will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance. Moody's outlook for the remainder of 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued.
There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, especially as they relate to Europe. And if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates.
As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance to a range of $2.95 to $3.05 from the previous range of $2.76 to $2.86. Full year pro forma EPS, which excludes the impact of a legacy tax benefit, is now expected to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.99.
Certain components of our 2012 guidance have also been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moody's overall, the company now expects full year 2012 revenue to grow in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also now projected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 operating margin is now projected to be approximately 40% and adjusted operating margin for the year is still expected to be approximately 43%. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 32%.
As Linda mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $40 million to $50 million, and we still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is now projected to be approximately $15 million.
For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the low-20s percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the mid-20s percent range. Revenue from structured finance is expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. And public project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For Moody's Analytics, full year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens to 20% range. Non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Research, data and analytics is now projected to grow in the high-single digit percent range.
While revenue growth is still projected in the low-20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert as well as growth in the base business. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 70%, reflecting revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners.
In closing, I'd like to point out a couple of additional positive developments at Moody's. Moody's Investors Service was voted the best credit rating agency in a 2012 poll of U.S. fixed-income investors, conducted by the well-known publisher Institutional Investor. Also this past week, Automatic Data Processing Incorporated, a leading provider of business outsourcing solutions, announced that it has chosen to collaborate with Moody's Analytics to enhance widely followed ADP National Employment Report. I am extremely pleased with the accomplishments of both businesses and appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics.
We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have."

First looking at high grade, and all this information comes from Morgan Stanley as of this morning.
October, right now, stands at $78 billion of issuance for U.S. high grades and that has been the strongest October on record. The month could break $100 billion, if some big deals that are said to be in the pipeline come next week. But we did experience a warning regarding potential weather delays, which is something new.
For November, expectations are about $70 billion for U.S. high-grade issuance. Last year it was $77 billion and the 8-year average is about $63 billion, so a little bit above average for November. For high yield and leveraged, last week we saw $12 billion in high-yield issuance and $9.3 billion in leverage loan, that's still very active. This week we've seen $7.5 billion both in high yield and in leverage loan. October saw $41 billion in high yield and $32 billion in leverage loans. Q3 issuance was a record post the financial crisis for the leveraged area, $112 billion in high-yield issuance for the third quarter and $81 billion in leverage loans.
As Ray said, the fourth quarter will not be as strong as the third quarter, but will still be very active. The listed pipeline so far that can be seen for November is $19 billion in high yield and $10 billion in leverage loans. And again, a bit of a concern that the first week of November could be slow due to the weather and then following with the election, and obviously the usual watch outs for anything changing in the European situation."

We still don't anticipate a big rebound in 2013 in the residential mortgage-backed securities area. But I guess the further reason for optimism in that sector is, we seem to be moving away from some of the more regulatorily-driven causes of issuance into more real market issuance, and I would take that as a sign of health."

And if you look at the Q3 year-over-year, you'll see that last year we had $335 million of expenses, this year in the third quarter we have $418 million of expenses. The vast majority of that change, $59 million or 70% of that, is compensation. So very important to remember that three times this year we've increased guidance, and the main driver of expense increase is in fact the over-performance and the resulting incentive compensation which results.
Another cause of expense growth is our acquisitions, which added $18 million to the expenses in the third quarter. Now, some of that breaks out into compensation for new people, about $10 million of it. We had the increase in depreciation and amortization and some other non-comp expenses, and then we have a few other things in there. But again, if you look at the expense increase, which is 25% year-over-year, it would be 15% without the incentive compensation.
So probably the best way to think about it is, if we normalize back to more normal performance last year. We try as hard as we can to have expense growth not exceed, and in fact be less than revenue growth. So we'll see where we get to, as Ray said, for that in 2013. But we're mindful of expense growth, but this is a very fast growing business and we are continuing to support it."

So firms are looking at the potential for some market uncertainty around the fiscal cliff, potentially as developments occur in Europe. And they are taking advantage of low official rates and good spreads, not historically tight spreads, but good.
That being said, much of the activity that we have seen this year, most of the activity continues to be refinancing, as opposed to issuance for mergers and acquisitions, and business expansion, share repurchase, et cetera. So similar to comments I've made in the last couple of quarters, it has been a very powerful refinancing engine that we have been experiencing over the course of the year.

Now, the bigger changes there would be, as Ray had noted in the commercial real estate lines, and also interestingly in the derivatives line, we saw more CLO issuance thus far in 2012 than we did in the entire period of 2008 to 2011. In fact, last week, there were 5 CLOs. So that market is doing quite well.
Let me go on and go to financial institutions group. Total revenue for the quarter $82.7 million.

So currently we don't know when the case will be argued or when it will be decided. So it's moving along quite slowly.
With respect to de-leveraging and the banking sector, I'll make just a quick comment and then Linda or Michel may wish to add to that. The de-leveraging is continuing. We are seeing reduction in bank loans, particularly in Europe and the de-leveraging that's associated with that. We believe that is going to continue for a relatively long time as the banking system retrenches.
The benefit of that, as we've talked about, is that, that encourages corporations and municipal entities to go to the bond market and seek ratings. And our financial institutions area is the area that is most dominated of the ratings businesses by recurring revenue. A majority of our revenue in that area is recurring, and so we are less sensitive to the de-leveraging in that area. We also don't get the benefits of banks leveraging up when they do that, but in this environment we get the benefit of not having revenue reductions in the same degree that there is de-leveraging or retrenching."

Third quarter revenue of $689 million, increased 30% over the prior year period, and was the highest quarterly revenue Moody's has achieved in its history. We benefited from double-digit revenue growth in all lines of business at MIS, with particularly strong performance in corporate finance, as well as continued strong growth in all areas of Moody's Analytics.
Expenses for the third quarter were $419 million, a 25% increase from the third quarter of 2011. Operating income for the third quarter was $270 million, a 38% increase from the prior year period. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $294 million, up 36% from the same period last year.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.81 for the third quarter, which included a $0.06 legacy tax benefit, increased 42% from the prior year period. Excluding the legacy tax benefit in the current quarter, diluted earnings per share of $0.75 for the third quarter of 2012, were up 32% from the prior year period. Based on strong third quarter performance, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.05, or $2.89 to $2.99, excluding legacy tax benefit in the third quarter.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Revenue for the first 9 months of 2012 was $2 billion, a 15% increase from the first 9 months of 2011. Revenue of Moody's Investor Service was $1.4 billion for the first 9 months of 2012, an increase of 14% from a year ago.
Moody's Analytics revenue of $609 million was 19% higher than the prior year period. Expenses for the first 9 months of 2012 were $1.2 billion, up 16% from the prior year period. Operating income of $817 million increased 14% from $716 million for the same period of 2011. Diluted earnings per share of $2.34 for the first 9 months of 2012, which included the $0.06 legacy tax benefit increased 14% from the prior year period.

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the quarter increased 30% to $689 million. U.S. third quarter revenue increased 37% to $375 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 22% to $313 mil",1145,"Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the quarter increased 30% to $689 million. U.S. third quarter revenue increased 37% to $375 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 22% to $313 million and represented 45% of Moody's total revenue, down slightly from 48% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $346 million represented 50% of the total, down from 59% in the prior year period.
Looking now at each of our businesses. Moody's Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $474 million, up 35% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 4%. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 45% over the prior year period. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 21% and represented 39% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the third quarter increased 71% from the year-ago period to $221 million. Revenue was up 81% year-over-year in the U.S., primarily driven by issuance in the speculative grade market, including high-yield bonds and bank loans. Investment grade issuance was also strong in the U.S. The corporation is taking advantage of historically low rates. Outside the U.S., corporate finance revenue grew 53%, primarily reflecting increased investment grade issuance across all regions.
Global structured finance revenue for the third quarter was $93 million, 14% above the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 27% year-over-year, primarily due to strong issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations. International structured finance revenue was essentially flat to the prior year period.
Global financial institutions revenue of $83 million increased 15% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was up 22% as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily driven by increased insurance company issuance, corporate financing and debt-funded M&A activity. Non-U.S. revenue was up 10%, primarily due to increased issuance in Latin America and Asia, prompted by refinancing of short-term debt, credit expansion due to economic growth and reduced lending by European banks in these regions.
Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure business rose 13% year-over-year to $77 million. Revenue was up 11% in the U.S., primarily due to gains in public and infrastructure finance, while non-U.S. revenue increased 16%, reflecting growth in European infrastructure finance.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for Moody's Analytics of $215 million was up 20% from the third quarter of 2011. Slightly more than half of the growth was from the late 2011 acquisitions of Copal Partners and Barrie & Hibbert. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21%. U.S. revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to $86 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 23% to $129 million, and represented 60% of Moody's Analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $124 million increased 7% from the prior year period and represented 58% of total MA revenue. We continue to see demand for credit research via our CreditView offering as well as new sales of our other analytic data and -- excuse me, data and analytic products.
Revenues from enterprise risk solutions of $64 million grew 26% from last year, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, and strong growth in products and services that support the regulatory compliance needs of our financial services customers. Due to the variable nature of project timing, enterprise risk solutions revenue remain subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue grew 97% to $27 million, reflecting the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expenses were $419 million, an increase of 25% compared to third quarter 2011 or a 27% increase, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Higher accruals for incentive compensation and Moody's profit sharing plan, reflecting a stronger full year outlook, accounted for about half of the year-on-year expense growth.
More specifically, we recorded additional incentive compensation in the third quarter to align with stronger than expected year-to-date financial performance, and the increased full year outlook as reflected in our updated guidance. Therefore, incentive compensation for the third quarter was $59 million versus $28 million in each of the first and second quarters.
Additionally, in the third quarter, we recorded approximately $8 million of profit sharing expense, given the increase in our EPS guidance. As you may remember, our 2012 compensation plan awards profit sharing when our pro forma EPS grows more than 10% from the prior year period. Our current pro forma EPS guidance results in a growth of over 10% from 2011's pro forma EPS, whereas our guidance at the end of the second quarter did not.
Excluding growth in incentive compensation and profit sharing, expenses for the third quarter were 15% higher from the prior year period, primarily due to increased headcount from growth in our existing businesses and from acquisitions in late 2011. Moody's reported operating margin expanded 230 basis points year-over-year from 36.9% in the third quarter of 2011 to 39.2% for the current quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 42.7% for the quarter, up from 40.5% for the same period last year.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5% compared with 28.5% for the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower taxes in 2011 resulting from the settlement of state tax audit, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign tax planning initiatives in 2012.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2012, Moody's repurchased 600,000 shares at a total cost of $25 million and issued 1.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Shares outstanding as of September 30, 2012, totaled 223 million, essentially flat from the year earlier.
As of quarter end, Moody's had $700 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. We now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
As of September 30, Moody's had $1.7 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2012, an increase of $664 million from a year earlier, largely due to our $500 million bond deal in August this year. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 52% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S.
For the first 9 months of 2012, free cash flow was $461 million, a decrease of $152 million from a year ago, due in part to payments of approximately $121 million related to the settlement of state and local tax matters as well as movement in other working capital accounts. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

The timi",926,"Thanks, Linda. I'll continue with comments on our regulatory environment, which has not changed materially since the update we provided during our second quarter earnings call.
In the U.S., the SEC's rulemaking pursuant to Dodd-Frank is pending. The timing is uncertain regarding final rules relevant to NRSROs as well as the feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products. Both banking and securities regulatory authorities continue to assess their use of ratings and regulation and are in the process of developing potential alternative measures as replacements.
Turning to Europe. As discussed on previous calls, in November 2011, the European Commission released new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry, commonly referred to as CRA3. The European legislative process requires that the European Parliament and the Council of Finance Ministers of the individual EU member states, each produce its own version of the text, and then enter into discussions with the Commission. During these discussions, the 3 institutions seek to resolve any differences among their respective drafts, and once the compromised document is produced, put to a vote.
In May and June of 2012, the Council and the Parliament respectively finalized their positions on CRA3. The discussions among the 3 institutions are under way. However, currently we can't predict the timeline for finalization of CRA3 with any degree of precision. Additionally, it's still too early to assess what the likely outcome of these deliberations will be. As always, we will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance. Moody's outlook for the remainder of 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued.
There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, especially as they relate to Europe. And if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates.
As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance to a range of $2.95 to $3.05 from the previous range of $2.76 to $2.86. Full year pro forma EPS, which excludes the impact of a legacy tax benefit, is now expected to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.99.
Certain components of our 2012 guidance have also been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moody's overall, the company now expects full year 2012 revenue to grow in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also now projected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 operating margin is now projected to be approximately 40% and adjusted operating margin for the year is still expected to be approximately 43%. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 32%.
As Linda mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $40 million to $50 million, and we still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is now projected to be approximately $15 million.
For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the low-20s percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the mid-20s percent range. Revenue from structured finance is expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. And public project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For Moody's Analytics, full year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens to 20% range. Non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Research, data and analytics is now projected to grow in the high-single digit percent range.
While revenue growth is still projected in the low-20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert as well as growth in the base business. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 70%, reflecting revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners.
In closing, I'd like to point out a couple of additional positive developments at Moody's. Moody's Investors Service was voted the best credit rating agency in a 2012 poll of U.S. fixed-income investors, conducted by the well-known publisher Institutional Investor. Also this past week, Automatic Data Processing Incorporated, a leading provider of business outsourcing solutions, announced that it has chosen to collaborate with Moody's Analytics to enhance widely followed ADP National Employment Report. I am extremely pleased with the accomplishments of both businesses and appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics.
We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have."

First looking at high grade and all this information comes from Morgan Stanley as of this morning. October, right now, stands at $78 billion of issuance for U.S. high grades and that has been the strongest October on record. The month could break $100 billion, if some big deals that are said to be in the pipeline come next week. But we did experience a warning regarding potential weather delays, which is something new. For November, expectations are about $70 billion for U.S. high-grade issuance. Last year it was $77 billion and the 8-year average is about $63 billion, so a little bit above average for November. For high yield and leveraged, last week we saw $12 billion in high-yield issuance and $9.3 billion in leverage loan, that's still very active. This week we've seen $7.5 billion both in high yield and in leverage loan. October saw $41 billion in high yield and $32 billion in leverage loans. Q3 issuance was a record post the financial crisis for the leveraged area, $112 billion in high-yield issuance for the third quarter and $81 billion in leverage loans. As Ray said, the fourth quarter will not be as strong as the third quarter, but will still be very active. The listed pipeline so far that can be seen for November is $19 billion in high yield and $10 billion in leverage loans. And again, a bit of a concern that the first week of November could be slow due to the weather and then following with the election, and obviously the usual watch outs for anything changing in the European situation."

We still don't anticipate a big rebound in 2013 in the residential mortgage-backed securities area. But I guess the further reason for optimism in that sector is, we seem to be moving away from some of the more regulatory-driven causes of issuance into more real market issuance, and I would take that as a sign of health."

And if you look at the Q3 year-over-year, you'll see that last year we had $335 million of expenses, this year in the third quarter we have $418 million of expenses. The vast majority of that change, $59 million or 70% of that, is compensation. So very important to remember that 3 times this year we've increased guidance, and the main driver of expense increase is in fact the over performance and the resulting incentive compensation which results. Another cause of expense growth is our acquisitions, which added $18 million to the expenses in the third quarter. Now some of that breaks out into compensation for new people, about $10 million of it. We had the increase in depreciation and amortization and some other non-comp expenses, and then we have a few other things in there. But again, if you look at the expense increase, which is 25% year-over-year, it would be 15% without the incentive compensation. So probably the best way to think about it is, if we normalize back to more normal performance last year. We try as hard as we can to have expense growth not exceed, and in fact be less than revenue growth. So we'll see where we get to, as Ray said, for that in 2013. But we're mindful of expense growth, but this is a very fast growing business and we are continuing to support it."

I think it's clear that we have seen pull-forward throughout this year, including in the third quarter. So firms are looking at the potential for some market uncertainty around the fiscal cliff, potentially as developments occur in Europe. And they are taking advantage of low official rates and good spreads, not historically tight spreads, but good. That being said, much of the activity that we have seen this year, most of the activity continues to be refinancing, as opposed to issuance for mergers and acquisitions, and business expansion, share repurchase, et cetera. So similar to comments I've made in the last couple of quarters, it has been a very powerful refinancing engine that we have been experiencing over the course of the year. But most of the traditional drivers of debt issuance have really not been very strong this year and so that's what we'd be looking for going into 2013, 2014. Linda, did you want to take the share repurchase?"

Because we realized that our performance was pretty good, we could not go back into the market opportunistically.

Now the bigger changes there would be, as Ray had noted in the commercial real estate lines, and also interestingly in the derivatives line, we saw more CLO issuance thus far in 2012 than we did in the entire period of 2008 to 2011. In fact, last week, there were 5 CLOs. So that market is doing quite well. Let me go on and go to financial institutions group. Total revenue for the quarter $82.7 million. Banking about $57 million of that or 69%; insurance $21 million, 26% of it; and managed investments $4.6 million, about 6% of the total. And each of those lines are pretty consistent to what we saw last year.

With respect to de-leveraging and the banking sector, I'll make just a quick comment and then Linda or Michel may wish to add to that. The de-leveraging is continuing. We are seeing reduction in bank loans, particularly in Europe and the de-leveraging that's associated with that. We believe that is going to continue for a relatively long time as the banking system retrenches. The benefit of that, as we've talked about, is that, that encourages corporations and municipal entities to go to the bond market and seek ratings. And our financial institutions area is the area that is most dominated of the ratings businesses by recurring revenue. A majority of our revenue in that area is recurring, and so we are less sensitive to the de-leveraging in that area. We also don't get the benefits of banks leveraging up when they do that, but in this environment we get the benefit of not having revenue reductions in the same degree that there is de-leveraging or retrenching."

Third quarter revenue of $689 million, increased 30% over the prior year period, and was the highest quarterly revenue Moody's has achieved in its history. We benefited from double-digit revenue growth in all lines of business at MIS, with particularly strong performance in corporate finance, as well as continued strong growth in all areas of Moody's Analytics.
Expenses for the third quarter were $419 million, a 25% increase from the third quarter of 2011. Operating income for the third quarter was $270 million, a 38% increase from the prior year period. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $294 million, up 36% from the same period last year.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.81 for the third quarter, which included a $0.06 legacy tax benefit, increased 42% from the prior year period. Excluding the legacy tax benefit in the current quarter, diluted earnings per share of $0.75 for the third quarter of 2012, were up 32% from the prior year period. Based on strong third quarter performance, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.05, or $2.89 to $2.99, excluding legacy tax benefit in the third quarter.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Revenue for the first 9 months of 2012 was $2 billion, a 15% increase from the first 9 months of 2011. Revenue of Moody's Investor Service was $1.4 billion for the first 9 months of 2012, an increase of 14% from a year ago.
Moody's Analytics revenue of $609 million was 19% higher than the prior year period. Expenses for the first 9 months of 2012 were $1.2 billion, up 16% from the prior year period. Operating income of $817 million increased 14% from $716 million for the same period of 2011. Diluted earnings per share of $2.34 for the first 9 months of 2012, which included the $0.06 legacy tax benefit increased 14% from the prior year period.

As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the quarter increased 30% to $689 million. U.S. third quarter revenue increased 37% to $375 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 22% to $313 million and represented 45% of Moody's total revenue, down slightly from 48% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $346 million represented 50% of the total, down from 59% in the prior year period.
Looking now at each of our businesses. Moody's Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $474 million, up 35% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 4%. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 45% over the prior year period. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 21% and represented 39% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the third quarter increased 71% from the year-ago period to $221 million. Revenue was up 81% year-over-year in the U.S., primarily driven by issuance in the speculative grade market, including high-yield bonds and bank loans. Investment grade issuance was also strong in the U.S. The corporation is taking advantage of historically low rates. Outside the U.S., corporate finance revenue grew 53%, primarily reflecting increased investment grade issuance across all regions.
Global structured finance revenue for the third quarter was $93 million, 14% above the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 27% year-over-year, primarily due to strong issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations. International structured finance revenue was essentially flat to the prior year period.
Global financial institutions revenue of $83 million increased 15% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was up 22% as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily driven by increased insurance company issuance, corporate financing and debt-funded M&A activity. Non-U.S. revenue was up 10%, primarily due to increased issuance in Latin America and Asia, prompted by refinancing of short-term debt, credit expansion due to economic growth and reduced lending by European banks in these regions.
Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure business rose 13% year-over-year to $77 million. Revenue was up 11% in the U.S., primarily due to gains in public and infrastructure finance, while non-U.S. revenue increased 16%, reflecting growth in European infrastructure finance.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for Moody's Analytics of $215 million was up 20% from the third quarter of 2011. Slightly more than half of the growth was from the late 2011 acquisitions of Copal Partners and Barrie & Hibbert. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21%. U.S. revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to $86 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 23% to $129 million, and represented 60% of Moody's Analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $124 million increased 7% from the prior year period and represented 58% of total MA revenue. We continue to see demand for credit research via our CreditView offering as well as new sales of our other analytic data and -- excuse me, data and analytic products.
Revenues from enterprise risk solutions of $64 million grew 26% from last year, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, and strong growth in products and services that support the regulatory compliance needs of our financial services customers. Due to the variable nature of project timing, enterprise risk solutions revenue remain subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue grew 97% to $27 million, reflecting the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expenses were $419 million, an increase of 25% compared to third quarter 2011 or a 27% increase, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Higher accruals for incentive compensation and Moody's profit sharing plan, reflecting a stronger full year outlook, accounted for about half of the year-on-year expense growth.
More specifically, we recorded additional incentive compensation in the third quarter to align with stronger than expected year-to-date financial performance, and the increased full year outlook as reflected in our updated guidance. Therefore, incentive compensation for the third quarter was $59 million versus $28 million in each of the first and second quarters.
Additionally, in the third quarter, we recorded approximately $8 million of profit sharing expense, given the increase in our EPS guidance. As you may remember, our 2012 compensation plan awards profit sharing when our pro forma EPS grows more than 10% from the prior year period. Our current pro forma EPS guidance results in a growth of over 10% from 2011's pro forma EPS, whereas our guidance at the end of the second quarter did not.
Excluding growth in incentive compensation and profit sharing, expenses for the third quarter were 15% higher from the prior year period, primarily due to increased headcount from growth in our existing businesses and from acquisitions in late 2011. Moody's reported operating margin expanded 230 basis points year-over-year from 36.9% in the third quarter of 2011 to 39.2% for the current quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 42.7% for the quarter, up from 40.5% for the same period last year.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5% compared with 28.5% for the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower taxes in 2011 resulting from the settlement of state tax audit, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign tax planning initiatives in 2012.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2012, Moody's repurchased 600,000 shares at a total cost of $25 million and issued 1.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Shares outstanding as of September 30, 2012, totaled 223 million, essentially flat from the year earlier.
As of quarter end, Moody's had $700 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. We now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
As of September 30, Moody's had $1.7 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2012, an increase of $664 million from a year earlier, largely due to our $500 million bond deal in August this year. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 52% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S.
For the first 9 months of 2012, free cash flow was $461 million, a decrease of $152 million from a year ago, due in part to payments of approximately $121 million related to the settlement of state and local tax matters as well as movement in other working capital accounts. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

The timi",926,"Thanks, Linda. I'll continue with comments on our regulatory environment, which has not changed materially since the update we provided during our second quarter earnings call.
In the U.S., the SEC's rulemaking pursuant to Dodd-Frank is pending. The timing is uncertain regarding final rules relevant to NRSROs as well as the feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products. Both banking and securities regulatory authorities continue to assess their use of ratings and regulation and are in the process of developing potential alternative measures as replacements.
Turning to Europe. As discussed on previous calls, in November 2011, the European Commission released new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry, commonly referred to as CRA3. The European legislative process requires that the European Parliament and the Council of Finance Ministers of the individual EU member states, each produce its own version of the text, and then enter into discussions with the Commission. During these discussions, the 3 institutions seek to resolve any differences among their respective drafts, and once the compromised document is produced, put to a vote.
In May and June of 2012, the Council and the Parliament respectively finalized their positions on CRA3. The discussions among the 3 institutions are under way. However, currently we can't predict the timeline for finalization of CRA3 with any degree of precision. Additionally, it's still too early to assess what the likely outcome of these deliberations will be. As always, we will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance. Moody's outlook for the remainder of 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued.
There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, especially as they relate to Europe. And if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates.
As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance to a range of $2.95 to $3.05 from the previous range of $2.76 to $2.86. Full year pro forma EPS, which excludes the impact of a legacy tax benefit, is now expected to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.99.
Certain components of our 2012 guidance have also been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moody's overall, the company now expects full year 2012 revenue to grow in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also now projected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 operating margin is now projected to be approximately 40% and adjusted operating margin for the year is still expected to be approximately 43%. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 32%.
As Linda mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $40 million to $50 million, and we still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is now projected to be approximately $15 million.
For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the low-20s percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the mid-20s percent range. Revenue from structured finance is expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. And public project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For Moody's Analytics, full year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens to 20% range. Non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Research, data and analytics is now projected to grow in the high-single digit percent range.
While revenue growth is still projected in the low-20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert as well as growth in the base business. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 70%, reflecting revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners.
In closing, I'd like to point out a couple of additional positive developments at Moody's. Moody's Investors Service was voted the best credit rating agency in a 2012 poll of U.S. fixed-income investors, conducted by the well-known publisher Institutional Investor. Also this past week, Automatic Data Processing Incorporated, a leading provider of business outsourcing solutions, announced that it has chosen to collaborate with Moody's Analytics to enhance widely followed ADP National Employment Report. I am extremely pleased with the accomplishments of both businesses and appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics.
We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have."

It's obviously in terms of sequential growth from the third quarter, it's going to be difficult to achieve that in that area, because the issuance was so robust in the third quarter, and we have some external events, such as the election and a couple of short months in the fourth quarter. But nonetheless, we still see healthy pipelines. And barring something really unanticipated, I think we believe the fourth quarter will be another good quarter."

First looking at high grade and all this information comes from Morgan Stanley as of this morning. October, right now, stands at $78 billion of issuance for U.S. high grades and that has been the strongest October on record. The month could break $100 billion, if some big deals that are said to be in the pipeline come next week. But we did experience a warning regarding potential weather delays, which is something new. For November, expectations are about $70 billion for U.S. high-grade issuance. Last year it was $77 billion and the 8-year average is about $63 billion, so a little bit above average for November. For high yield and leveraged, last week we saw $12 billion in high-yield issuance and $9.3 billion in leverage loan, that's still very active. This week we've seen $7.5 billion both in high yield and in leverage loan. October saw $41 billion in high yield and $32 billion in leverage loans. Q3 issuance was a record post the financial crisis for the leveraged area, $112 billion in high-yield issuance for the third quarter and $81 billion in leverage loans. As Ray said, the fourth quarter will not be as strong as the third quarter, but will still be very active. The listed pipeline so far that can be seen for November is $19 billion in high yield and $10 billion in leverage loans. And again, a bit of a concern that the first week of November could be slow due to the weather and then following with the election, and obviously the usual watch outs for anything changing in the European situation."

We still don't anticipate a big rebound in 2013 in the residential mortgage-backed securities area. But I guess the further reason for optimism in that sector is, we seem to be moving away from some of the more regulatory-driven causes of issuance into more real market issuance, and I would take that as a sign of health."

And if you look at the Q3 year-over-year, you'll see that last year we had $335 million of expenses, this year in the third quarter we have $418 million of expenses. The vast majority of that change, $59 million or 70% of that, is compensation. So very important to remember that 3 times this year we've increased guidance, and the main driver of expense increase is in fact the over performance and the resulting incentive compensation which results. Another cause of expense growth is our acquisitions, which added $18 million to the expenses in the third quarter. Now some of that breaks out into compensation for new people, about $10 million of it. We had the increase in depreciation and amortization and some other non-comp expenses, and then we have a few other things in there. But again, if you look at the expense increase, which is 25% year-over-year, it would be 15% without the incentive compensation. So probably the best way to think about it is, if we normalize back to more normal performance last year. We try as hard as we can to have expense growth not exceed, and in fact be less than revenue growth. So we'll see where we get to, as Ray said, for that in 2013. But we're mindful of expense growth, but this is a very fast growing business and we are continuing to support it."

I think it's clear that we have seen pull-forward throughout this year, including in the third quarter. So firms are looking at the potential for some market uncertainty around the fiscal cliff, potentially as developments occur in Europe. And they are taking advantage of low official rates and good spreads, not historically tight spreads, but good. That being said, much of the activity that we have seen this year, most of the activity continues to be refinancing, as opposed to issuance for mergers and acquisitions, and business expansion, share repurchase, et cetera. So similar to comments I've made in the last couple of quarters, it has been a very powerful refinancing engine that we have been experiencing over the course of the year. But most of the traditional drivers of debt issuance have really not been very strong this year and so that's what we'd be looking for going into 2013, 2014.

Now the bigger changes there would be, as Ray had noted in the commercial real estate lines, and also interestingly in the derivatives line, we saw more CLO issuance thus far in 2012 than we did in the entire period of 2008 to 2011. In fact, last week, there were 5 CLOs. So that market is doing quite well. Let me go on and go to financial institutions group. Total revenue for the quarter $82.7 million. Banking about $57 million of that or 69%; insurance $21 million, 26% of it; and managed investments $4.6 million, about 6% of the total.

There's not a lot new in recent months in the CalPERS litigation.

And the briefing on that appeal is not going to be completed until the end of the year. And after that the court will set a date for oral arguments. So currently we don't know when the case will be argued or when it will be decided. So it's moving along quite slowly. With respect to de-leveraging and the banking sector, I'll make just a quick comment and then Linda or Michel may wish to add to that. The de-leveraging is continuing. We are seeing reduction in bank loans, particularly in Europe and the de-leveraging that's associated with that. We believe that is going to continue for a relatively long time as the banking system retrenches. The benefit of that, as we've talked about, is that, that encourages corporations and municipal entities to go to the bond market and seek ratings. And our financial institutions area is the area that is most dominated of the ratings businesses by recurring revenue. A majority of our revenue in that area is recurring, and so we are less sensitive to the de-leveraging in that area. We also don't get the benefits of banks leveraging up when they do that, but in this environment we get the benefit of not having revenue reductions in the same degree that there is de-leveraging or retrenching."

Third quarter revenue of $689 million, increased 30% over the prior year period, and was the highest quarterly revenue Moody's has achieved in its history. We benefited from double-digit revenue growth in all lines of business at MIS, with particularly strong performance in corporate finance, as well as continued strong growth in all areas of Moody's Analytics.
Expenses for the third quarter were $419 million, a 25% increase from the third quarter of 2011. Operating income for the third quarter was $270 million, a 38% increase from the prior year period. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $294 million, up 36% from the same period last year.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.81 for the third quarter, which included a $0.06 legacy tax benefit, increased 42% from the prior year period. Excluding the legacy tax benefit in the current quarter, diluted earnings per share of $0.75 for the third quarter of 2012, were up 32% from the prior year period. Based on strong third quarter performance, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.05, or $2.89 to $2.99, excluding legacy tax benefit in the third quarter.
Turning to year-to-date performance. Revenue for the first 9 months of 2012 was $2 billion, a 15% increase from the first 9 months of 2011. Revenue of Moody's Investor Service was $1.4 billion for the first 9 months of 2012, an increase of 14% from a year ago.
Moody's Analytics revenue of $609 million was 19% higher than the prior year period. Expenses for the first 9 months of 2012 were $1.2 billion, up 16% from the prior year period. Operating income of $817 million increased 14% from $716 million for the same period of 2011. Diluted earnings per share of $2.34 for the first 9 months of 2012, which included the $0.06 legacy tax benefit increased 14% from the prior year period.

U.S. third quarter revenue increased 37% to $375 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 22% to $313 mil",1145,"Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue at the company level. As Ray mentioned, Moody's total revenue for the quarter increased 30% to $689 million. U.S. third quarter revenue increased 37% to $375 million, while revenue outside the U.S. grew 22% to $313 million and represented 45% of Moody's total revenue, down slightly from 48% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue of $346 million represented 50% of the total, down from 59% in the prior year period.
Looking now at each of our businesses. Moody's Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $474 million, up 35% from the prior year period. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by 4%. U.S. revenue for MIS increased 45% over the prior year period. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 21% and represented 39% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the third quarter increased 71% from the year-ago period to $221 million. Revenue was up 81% year-over-year in the U.S., primarily driven by issuance in the speculative grade market, including high-yield bonds and bank loans. Investment grade issuance was also strong in the U.S. The corporation is taking advantage of historically low rates. Outside the U.S., corporate finance revenue grew 53%, primarily reflecting increased investment grade issuance across all regions.
Global structured finance revenue for the third quarter was $93 million, 14% above the prior year period. In the U.S., revenue increased 27% year-over-year, primarily due to strong issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations. International structured finance revenue was essentially flat to the prior year period.
Global financial institutions revenue of $83 million increased 15% from the same quarter of 2011. U.S. revenue was up 22% as compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily driven by increased insurance company issuance, corporate financing and debt-funded M&A activity. Non-U.S. revenue was up 10%, primarily due to increased issuance in Latin America and Asia, prompted by refinancing of short-term debt, credit expansion due to economic growth and reduced lending by European banks in these regions.
Global revenue for the public project and infrastructure business rose 13% year-over-year to $77 million. Revenue was up 11% in the U.S., primarily due to gains in public and infrastructure finance, while non-U.S. revenue increased 16%, reflecting growth in European infrastructure finance.
And turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue for Moody's Analytics of $215 million was up 20% from the third quarter of 2011. Slightly more than half of the growth was from the late 2011 acquisitions of Copal Partners and Barrie & Hibbert. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 21%. U.S. revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to $86 million. Non-U.S. revenue increased by 23% to $129 million, and represented 60% of Moody's Analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $124 million increased 7% from the prior year period and represented 58% of total MA revenue. We continue to see demand for credit research via our CreditView offering as well as new sales of our other analytic data and -- excuse me, data and analytic products.
Revenues from enterprise risk solutions of $64 million grew 26% from last year, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert, and strong growth in products and services that support the regulatory compliance needs of our financial services customers. Due to the variable nature of project timing, enterprise risk solutions revenue remain subject to quarterly volatility. Professional services revenue grew 97% to $27 million, reflecting the acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners in November 2011.
Turning now to expenses. Moody's third quarter expenses were $419 million, an increase of 25% compared to third quarter 2011 or a 27% increase, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Higher accruals for incentive compensation and Moody's profit sharing plan, reflecting a stronger full year outlook, accounted for about half of the year-on-year expense growth.
More specifically, we recorded additional incentive compensation in the third quarter to align with stronger than expected year-to-date financial performance, and the increased full year outlook as reflected in our updated guidance. Therefore, incentive compensation for the third quarter was $59 million versus $28 million in each of the first and second quarters.
Additionally, in the third quarter, we recorded approximately $8 million of profit sharing expense, given the increase in our EPS guidance. As you may remember, our 2012 compensation plan awards profit sharing when our pro forma EPS grows more than 10% from the prior year period. Our current pro forma EPS guidance results in a growth of over 10% from 2011's pro forma EPS, whereas our guidance at the end of the second quarter did not.
Excluding growth in incentive compensation and profit sharing, expenses for the third quarter were 15% higher from the prior year period, primarily due to increased headcount from growth in our existing businesses and from acquisitions in late 2011. Moody's reported operating margin expanded 230 basis points year-over-year from 36.9% in the third quarter of 2011 to 39.2% for the current quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 42.7% for the quarter, up from 40.5% for the same period last year.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5% compared with 28.5% for the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to lower taxes in 2011 resulting from the settlement of state tax audit, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign tax planning initiatives in 2012.
Now I'll provide an update on capital allocation. During the third quarter of 2012, Moody's repurchased 600,000 shares at a total cost of $25 million and issued 1.2 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plan. Shares outstanding as of September 30, 2012, totaled 223 million, essentially flat from the year earlier.
As of quarter end, Moody's had $700 million of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program. We now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
As of September 30, Moody's had $1.7 billion of outstanding debt and $1 billion of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2012, an increase of $664 million from a year earlier, largely due to our $500 million bond deal in August this year. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 52% of our cash holdings are maintained outside the U.S.
For the first 9 months of 2012, free cash flow was $461 million, a decrease of $152 million from a year ago, due in part to payments of approximately $121 million related to the settlement of state and local tax matters as well as movement in other working capital accounts. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

The timi",926,"Thanks, Linda. I'll continue with comments on our regulatory environment, which has not changed materially since the update we provided during our second quarter earnings call.
In the U.S., the SEC's rulemaking pursuant to Dodd-Frank is pending. The timing is uncertain regarding final rules relevant to NRSROs as well as the feasibility study on establishing an alternative system for allocating rating assignments for structured finance products. Both banking and securities regulatory authorities continue to assess their use of ratings and regulation and are in the process of developing potential alternative measures as replacements.
Turning to Europe. As discussed on previous calls, in November 2011, the European Commission released new regulatory reform proposals for the rating agency industry, commonly referred to as CRA3. The European legislative process requires that the European Parliament and the Council of Finance Ministers of the individual EU member states, each produce its own version of the text, and then enter into discussions with the Commission. During these discussions, the 3 institutions seek to resolve any differences among their respective drafts, and once the compromised document is produced, put to a vote.
In May and June of 2012, the Council and the Parliament respectively finalized their positions on CRA3. The discussions among the 3 institutions are under way. However, currently we can't predict the timeline for finalization of CRA3 with any degree of precision. Additionally, it's still too early to assess what the likely outcome of these deliberations will be. As always, we will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G20 statements and directives.
I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance. Moody's outlook for the remainder of 2012 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued.
There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions, especially as they relate to Europe. And if actual conditions differ from these assumptions, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from the current outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates.
As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our 2012 EPS guidance to a range of $2.95 to $3.05 from the previous range of $2.76 to $2.86. Full year pro forma EPS, which excludes the impact of a legacy tax benefit, is now expected to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.99.
Certain components of our 2012 guidance have also been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions. For Moody's overall, the company now expects full year 2012 revenue to grow in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 expenses are also now projected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Full year 2012 operating margin is now projected to be approximately 40% and adjusted operating margin for the year is still expected to be approximately 43%. Our effective tax rate is still projected to be approximately 32%.
As Linda mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2012 share repurchases of approximately $225 million, subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation decisions. Capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $40 million to $50 million, and we still expect approximately $100 million in depreciation and amortization expense. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is now projected to be approximately $15 million.
For the global MIS business, revenue for the full year 2012 is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MIS revenue is now expected to increase in the low-20s percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range.
Corporate finance revenue is now projected to grow in the mid-20s percent range. Revenue from structured finance is expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is now expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range. And public project and infrastructure finance revenue is now expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range.
For Moody's Analytics, full year 2012 revenue is still expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Within the U.S., MA revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens to 20% range. Non-U.S. revenue is now expected to increase in the high-teens percent range. Research, data and analytics is now projected to grow in the high-single digit percent range.
While revenue growth is still projected in the low-20s percent range for enterprise risk solutions, reflecting the December 2011 acquisition of Barrie & Hibbert as well as growth in the base business. Professional services revenue is now projected to grow by approximately 70%, reflecting revenue from the late 2011 acquisition of a majority stake in Copal Partners.
In closing, I'd like to point out a couple of additional positive developments at Moody's. Moody's Investors Service was voted the best credit rating agency in a 2012 poll of U.S. fixed-income investors, conducted by the well-known publisher Institutional Investor. Also this past week, Automatic Data Processing Incorporated, a leading provider of business outsourcing solutions, announced that it has chosen to collaborate with Moody's Analytics to enhance widely followed ADP National Employment Report. I am extremely pleased with the accomplishments of both businesses and appreciate the market's recognition of our efforts.
This concludes our prepared remarks. And joining us for the question-and-answer session is Michel Madelain, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Moody's Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics.
We'd be pleased to take any questions you may have."

First looking at high grade and all this information comes from Morgan Stanley as of this morning. October, right now, stands at $78 billion of issuance for U.S. high grades and that has been the strongest October on record. The month could break $100 billion, if some big deals that are said to be in the pipeline come next week. But we did experience a warning regarding potential weather delays, which is something new. For November, expectations are about $70 billion for U.S. high-grade issuance. Last year it was $77 billion and the 8-year average is about $63 billion, so a little bit above average for November. For high yield and leveraged, last week we saw $12 billion in high-yield issuance and $9.3 billion in leverage loan, that's still very active. This week we've seen $7.5 billion both in high yield and in leverage loan. October saw $41 billion in high yield and $32 billion in leverage loans. Q3 issuance was a record post the financial crisis for the leveraged area, $112 billion in high-yield issuance for the third quarter and $81 billion in leverage loans. As Ray said, the fourth quarter will not be as strong as the third quarter, but will still be very active. The listed pipeline so far that can be seen for November is $19 billion in high yield and $10 billion in leverage loans. And again, a bit of a concern that the first week of November could be slow due to the weather and then following with the election, and obviously the usual watch outs for anything changing in the European situation."

But I guess the further reason for optimism in that sector is, we seem to be moving away from some of the more regulatory-driven causes of issuance into more real market issuance, and I would take that as a sign of health."

And if you look at the Q3 year-over-year, you'll see that last year we had $335 million of expenses, this year in the third quarter we have $418 million of expenses. The vast majority of that change, $59 million or 70% of that, is compensation. So very important to remember that 3 times this year we've increased guidance, and the main driver of expense increase is in fact the over performance and the resulting incentive compensation which results. Another cause of expense growth is our acquisitions, which added $18 million to the expenses in the third quarter. Now some of that breaks out into compensation for new people, about $10 million of it. We had the increase in depreciation and amortization and some other non-comp expenses, and then we have a few other things in there. But again, if you look at the expense increase, which is 25% year-over-year, it would be 15% without the incentive compensation. So probably the best way to think about it is, if we normalize back to more normal performance last year. We try as hard as we can to have expense growth not exceed, and in fact be less than revenue growth. So we'll see where we get to, as Ray said, for that in 2013. But we're mindful of expense growth, but this is a very fast growing business and we are continuing to support it."

I think it's clear that we have seen pull-forward throughout this year, including in the third quarter. So firms are looking at the potential for some market uncertainty around the fiscal cliff, potentially as developments occur in Europe. And they are taking advantage of low official rates and good spreads, not historically tight spreads, but good. That being said, much of the activity that we have seen this year, most of the activity continues to be refinancing, as opposed to issuance for mergers and acquisitions, and business expansion, share repurchase, et cetera. So similar to comments I've made in the last couple of quarters, it has been a very powerful refinancing engine that we have been experiencing over the course of the year. But most of the traditional drivers of debt issuance have really not been very strong this year and so that's what we'd be looking for going into 2013, 2014.

With respect to de-leveraging and the banking sector, I'll make just a quick comment and then Linda or Michel may wish to add to that. The de-leveraging is continuing. We are seeing reduction in bank loans, particularly in Europe and the de-leveraging that's associated with that. We believe that is going to continue for a relatively long time as the banking system retrenches. The benefit of that, as we've talked about, is that, that encourages corporations and municipal entities to go to the bond market and seek ratings. And our financial institutions area is the area that is most dominated of the ratings businesses by recurring revenue. A majority of our revenue in that area is recurring, and so we are less sensitive to the de-leveraging in that area. We also don't get the benefits of banks leveraging up when they do that, but in this environment we get the benefit of not having revenue reductions in the same degree that there is de-leveraging or retrenching."
