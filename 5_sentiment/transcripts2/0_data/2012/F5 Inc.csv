For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, F5 achieved sequential revenue gains and solid year-over-year growth exceeding both revenue and earnings guidance. Revenue of $322.4 million, which exceeded the high end of our $315 million to $320 million guided range grew 2.5% from the prior quarter and 20% year-over-year.

On a geographic basis, all regions contributed to the company's solid year-over-year growth. Accounting for 59% of the total, revenue from the Americas grew 20% from the first quarter of fiscal 2011. EMEA, which represented 21% of revenue grew 14% from the first quarter of last year. 
APAC accounted for 14% of revenue and grew 28% year-over-year. And Japan contributed 6% of revenue, a 22% increase year-over-year.
During Q1, our Application Delivery Networking business contributed $316.9 million. This compares to $307.3 million in Q4 and $261.7 million in the first quarter a year ago. 
Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $5.5 million compares to $7.3 million in Q4 and $7.2 million in Q1 of last year.
Telco was our strongest vertical in Q1, representing 23% of total sales. Financial was 21%; technology, 17%; and government was 9%, including U.S. federal, which accounted for 4% of the total.
In Q1, we have 2 greater than 10% distributors, Avnet, which represented 17.9% of total revenue and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 13.7%.
Driven by exceptional strength in software sales, our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.8%. Excluding approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 83.5%. 
GAAP operating expenses of $167 million were above our target range of $161 million to $165 million. Excluding $19.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $147.5 million. GAAP operating margin was 30.9%. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 37.8%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 34.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.6%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $131.9 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1.1 billion at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $126 million. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.9 million and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.8 million.
DSO at the end of Q1 was 52 days. Inventories were $17.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% sequentially to $380 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,615 employees, an increase of 125 from the prior quarter. During Q1, we repurchased approximately 320,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $107.65 per share for a total of $34 million.
Approximately, $332 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
Looking ahead to Q2. Based on our solid year-over-year growth, the strength of our pipeline and the productivity of our sales organization, we believe F5 will continue to generate sequential revenue growth throughout fiscal 2012. We remain confident in achieving revenue growth of at least 20% for fiscal year 2012, and expect to see acceleration in year-over-year product revenue growth in the current quarter. 
Our revenue target for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 is $332 million to $337 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 82% to 83% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. 
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $170.5 million to $174.5 million. This includes approximately $20.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.84 to $0.86 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.05 to $1.07 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35%. 
Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within the range of $19 million to $21 million. And we believe our cash flow from operations will be an excess of $100 million, reflecting a large sequential increase in our federal tax payments as is customary in our fiscal second quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

All major regions met or exceeded our internal sales forecast. 
From a sales perspective, North America produced solid year-over-year growth. A relatively weak performance in our federal business was more than compensated for by strong performances in both our North American enterprise and service provider businesses. 
I was also pleased with our results in APAC and EMEA and especially in Japan where we continue to see improvement in deal sizes and the current penetration.
Our Services business had another excellent quarter, exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as testing a significant increase in deferred revenue of approximately $37 million. 
Sales of the new midrange VIPRION 2400 products were very strong in the quarter, and sales from the entire VIPRION family almost tripled from a year ago. The combination of VIPRION sales and the increase in our software module attach rate has been major factors in maintaining deal sizes at record levels.
TMOS version 11 continues to gain traction with a lot of interest in features like BCMP for multiple software licenses and iApps for application optimization and deployment. 
The iApp functionality in v11 has proven to be very popular with our customers especially for those deploying Microsoft exchange and SharePoint applications. One example of the pair of iApp is a customer who, prior to the introduction of iApp, need a full week to set up an exchange environment within the network. By using an iApp, the same customer has now reduced the setup time to only 5 minutes. 
IApps give customer the ability to access the full capabilities and part of our products, which we believe will generate additional deployments and sales opportunities. 
We also opened a second technology center in London during the quarter to complement our facility in Seattle. F5 technology centers enable our customers and prospective customers to see how F5 products will operate in their own networking environments. 
I'm very pleased with a number of customer engagements that have already arrived at the London technology center, and I believe it is a great showcase for power and effectiveness of our solutions. iApps are the most frequently requested DMO for people visiting the technology centers.
In addition to the growth we have enjoyed with our hardware-based solutions, I'm also very pleased with the sales of software-only virtualization of our products, which have increased 149% year-over-year.
F5 has introduced the most comprehensive set of virtual product divisions in the market, and I believe this has enabled us to significantly expand our addressable market and offer new and exciting capabilities to our customer base. 
We also saw strong sales momentum with our security products during the quarter. Our application firewall solution, the ASM module, has its best quarter and we also experienced good sequential growth in our Edge Gateway And EPM access solutions. We achieved some important milestones with our security strategy last quarter including network firewall certification for TMOS version 11. 
F5 was also positioned in the leader's quadrant of to SSL VPN. You may also have seen our recent press release announcing that our BIG-IP client has an industry SSL VPN solution that provides comprehensive security and mobile access for all devices running Android 4.x operating systems. 
F5 downloadable client enhances mobile productivity by providing accelerated client access to corporate resources via or through a SSL VPN connection. We have already announced similar functionality for the Apple IOS iPhone environment.
TMOS version 11.1 was released in the quarter, and included a number of features specifically designed for the security market and their telco and service provider customers. Version 11.1 also included a trial version of a DPI functionality. 
Over the next few quarters, we will be extending -- expanding these features to include full DPI capability, advanced telco oriented I rules, DNS caching and other features requested by our telco and service provider customers. 
Upcoming product release includes the new Centaur Blade for the VIPRION 4400 platform, which will double the performance to become high end 200 VIPRION blades. We believe this new platform will be the highest performing ADC currently available. 
An 8-slot version of this platform is expected later in the year and will double the performance of our center blade platform. As we mentioned at the Analyst Investor meeting in November, we were start a refresh of our one-year and two-year this year leveraging the technology that was developed for the VIPRION 2400. 
With our Virtual Edition, we now support Xen and hypervisor. All our software modules will be supporting addition this year and we are continuing to develop new features for our centralized management system to better support application scalability in cloud environments and virtualized data centers.
Finally, towards the end of the calendar year, we expect to deliver significant new security capabilities with our Topaz project, including a network firewall, protocol protection and enhanced application security. 
F5 solutions are being used more and more in data centers where strategic control points to secure and optimize mission-critical applications. With our expanding addressable market in areas like security and service providers, we intend to continue to aggressively invest in our sales resources, Services business and other available facilities. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that they expect to see continued sequential growth in the coming quarter. As we mentioned at the start of the year, our important financial objective is to deliver accelerating product revenue growth. Assuming no major change in the macroeconomic environment, we expect to deliver product revenue growth acceleration in this coming quarter. 
We also continued to target year-over-year total revenue growth of at least 20% in fiscal 2012.
Our current pipeline of business is very strong and with a technology leadership position, we enjoy world-class competitive win rates in all our major markets. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the TMOS v11 and new products like the VIPRION 2400 will continue to be a key growth driver throughout fiscal 2012. 
The F5 team should be proud of the great start we've made in fiscal 2012. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team under partners and look forward to the continued support throughout the year. 
So with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

And the other thing to think about in our business is that, and I think I've said this before, is when you think about the plumbing that puts in and us networks are being built. We do get involved in the architecture. However, as the data is increasing and the complexities increasing and as more need to mass size that data, to monetize it, that's when our products really come into our own.

That continues to progress and one of other things to. The other thing is I rules. We get involved a lot with helping scale in various parts of the infrastructure including things such as diameter or set or some of the other protocols they're running there. We also get called upon to do things like traffic steering, and traffic steering based upon content and the connections.

And then to follow on into the virtual conversation portion of your question, as these applications begin to travel around within people's network and data centers, it becomes important to have these policies follow them. So what we're up to is absolutely having our way for our functionality to follow their application to be paired with them so that those policies do work out. And really in terms of what we're up to and sort of the permission that we have with our customers, they see that security portion of what we do is just a natural extension of our abilities and things that we offer them. So they're looking for us to provide those solutions. So sort of beginning endings in terms of having stuff around and being paired up on a virtual front, you can expect to see much more from us in that in that area."

And as we penetrate more into those accounts, we're also doing more advanced things in terms of how we're working with traffic and providing security features and functionality and other things. And so that just puts more demand on capacity. And so I think parts of it are for vCMP and some other functionality around iApps because we're able to slice up their infrastructure and build a virtuals with the BIG-IP. And so that's attractive because you can reduce the number of clients and around there. And also just to note, our revenue grew both for the 2400 and the 4400, it wasn't just one or the other. So that it encompasses both when you talk about VIPRION. But really, it's traffic, it's also security and other applications that are getting attached and I think telco included in it."

On a geographic basis, all regions contributed to the company's solid year-over-year growth. Accounting for 59% of the total, revenue from the Americas grew 20% from the first quarter of fiscal 2011. EMEA, which represented 21% of revenue, grew 14% from the first quarter of last year. 
APAC accounted for 14% of revenue and grew 28% year-over-year. And Japan contributed 6% of revenue, a 22% increase year-over-year.
During Q1, our Application Delivery Networking business contributed $316.9 million. This compares to $307.3 million in Q4 and $261.7 million in the first quarter a year ago. 
Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $5.5 million compares to $7.3 million in Q4 and $7.2 million in Q1 of last year.
Telco was our strongest vertical in Q1, representing 23% of total sales. Financial was 21%; technology, 17%; and government was 9%, including U.S. federal, which accounted for 4% of the total.
In Q1, we have 2 greater than 10% distributors, Avnet, which represented 17.9% of total revenue, and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 13.7%.
Driven by exceptional strength in software sales, our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.8%. Excluding approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 83.5%. 
GAAP operating expenses of $167 million were above our target range of $161 million to $165 million. Excluding $19.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $147.5 million. GAAP operating margin was 30.9%. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense was 37.8%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 34.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.6%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $131.9 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1.1 billion at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $126 million. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.9 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.8 million.
DSO at the end of Q1 was 52 days. Inventories were $17.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% sequentially to $380 million. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,615 employees, an increase of 125 from the prior quarter. During Q1, we repurchased approximately 320,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $107.65 per share for a total of $34 million.
Approximately, $332 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
Looking ahead to Q2. Based on our solid year-over-year growth, the strength of our pipeline and the productivity of our sales organization, we believe F5 will continue to generate sequential revenue growth throughout fiscal 2012. We remain confident in achieving revenue growth of at least 20% for fiscal year 2012 and expect to see acceleration in year-over-year product revenue growth in the current quarter. 
Our revenue target for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 is $332 million to $337 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 82% to 83% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. 
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $170.5 million to $174.5 million. This includes approximately $20.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.84 to $0.86 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.05 to $1.07 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35%. 
Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within the range of $19 million to $21 million. And we believe our cash flow from operations will be an excess of $100 million, reflecting a large sequential increase in our federal tax payments as is customary in our fiscal second quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."
90323,144130742,208386,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2012",2012-01-18,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with our Q1 results, which have given us a solid start to fiscal 2012. All major regions met or exceeded our internal sales forecast. From a sales bookings perspective, North America produce",1075,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with our Q1 results, which have given us a solid start to fiscal 2012. All major regions met or exceeded our internal sales forecast. 
From a sales bookings perspective, North America produced solid year-over-year growth. A relatively weak performance in our federal business was more than compensated for by strong performances in both our North American enterprise and service provider businesses. 
I was also pleased with our results in APAC and EMEA and especially in Japan where we continue to see improvement in deal sizes under current penetration.
Our Services business had another excellent quarter, exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue of approximately $37 million. 
Sales of the new midrange VIPRION 2400 products were very strong in the quarter, and sales from the entire VIPRION family almost tripled from a year ago. The combination of VIPRION sales and the increase in our software module attach rate has been major factors in maintaining deal sizes at record levels.
TMOS version 11 continues to gain traction with a lot of interest in features like BCMP for multiple software licenses and iApps for application optimization and deployment. 
The iApp functionality in v11 is proving to be very popular with our customers, especially for those deploying Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint applications. One example of the pair of iApps is a customer who, prior to the introduction of iApp, needed a full week to set up an Exchange environment within the network. By using an iApp, the same customer has now reduced the setup time to only 5 minutes. 
iApps give our customers the ability to access the full capabilities and part [ph] of our products, which we believe will generate additional deployments and sales opportunities. 
We also opened a second Technology Center in London during the quarter to complement our facility in Seattle. F5 Technology Centers enable our customers and prospective customers to see how F5 products will operate in their own networking environments. 
I'm very pleased with the number of customer engagements that have already occurred at the London Technology Center, and I believe this is a great showcase for power and effectiveness of our solutions. iApps are the most frequently requested demo from people visiting the Technology Centers.
In addition to the growth we have enjoyed with our hardware-based solutions, I'm also very pleased with the sales of software-only virtualizations of our products, which have increased 149% year-over-year.
F5 has introduced the most comprehensive set of virtual product additions in the market, and I believe this has enabled us to significantly expand our addressable market and offer new and exciting capabilities to our customer base. 
We also saw strong sales momentum with our security products during the quarter. Our application firewall solution, the ASM module, had its best ever quarter, and we also experienced good sequential growth with our Edge Gateway and APM access solutions. We achieved some important milestones with our security strategy last quarter including ICSA network firewall certification for TMOS version 11. 
F5 was also positioned in the leader's quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for SSL VPN. You may also have seen our recent press release announcing that our BIG-IP Edge client has the industry's first SSL VPN solution that provides comprehensive security and mobile access for all devices running Android 4.x operating systems. 
F5's free downloadable client enhances mobile user productivity by providing accelerated client access to corporate resources via or through SSL VPN connection. We have already announced similar functionality for the Apple IOS iPhone environment.
TMOS version 11.1 was released in the quarter, and included a number of features specifically designed for the security market and their telco and service provider customers. Version 11.1 also included a trial version of our DPI functionality. 
Over the next few quarters, we will be extending -- expanding these features to include full DPI capability, advanced telco oriented iRules, DNS caching and other features requested by our telco and service provider customers. 
Upcoming product release includes the new Centaur Blade for the VIPRION 4400 platform, which will double the performance to become high end PB200 VIPRION blades. We believe this new platform will be the highest performing ADC currently available. 
An 8-slot version of this platform is expected later in the year and will double the performance of the center blade platform. As we mentioned at the Analyst Investor meeting in November, we will start a refresh of our one-year and two-year appliances this year leveraging the technology that was developed for the VIPRION 2400. 
With our Virtual Edition, we now support Xen and hypervisor. All our software modules will be supported as virtual editions this year, and we are continuing to develop new features for our centralized management system to better support application scalability in cloud environments and virtualized data centers.
Finally, towards the end of the calendar year, we expect to deliver significant new security capabilities with our Topaz project, including a network firewall, protocol protection and enhanced DDoS application security. 
F5 solutions are being used more and more in data centers [indiscernible] as strategic control points to secure and optimize mission-critical applications. With our expanding addressable market in areas like security and service providers, we intend to continue to aggressively invest in our sales resources, Services business and their development facilities. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to see continued sequential growth in the coming quarter. As we mentioned at the start of the year, one of our important financial objectives is to deliver accelerating product revenue growth. Assuming no major change in the macroeconomic environment, we expect to deliver product revenue growth acceleration in this coming quarter. 
We also continue to target year-over-year total revenue growth of at least 20% in fiscal 2012.
Our current pipeline of business is very strong. And with our technology leadership position, we enjoy world-class competitive win rates in all our major markets. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the TMOS v11, our new products like the VIPRION 2400 will continue to be key growth drivers throughout fiscal 2012. 
The F5 team should be proud of the great start we've made in fiscal 2012. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team under partners and look forward to the continued support throughout the year. 
So with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

I think what the investment community is really trying to get their arms around is with respect to that 20% growth target and how much of that is related to mobile being a piece of that. And really, your ability to physically sit behind the old packet core or the GGSN et cetera over time and then of all the business from where you are today to potentially where you're going, I think just any commentary across the board with respect to that strategy would be very helpful. I know it's been asked several times over the last several calls, but never really answered in a definitive way.

And the other thing to think about our business is that -- and I think I've said this before, is while we don't tend to be looked upon as the plumbing that's put in as networks are being built, we do get involved in the architecture. However, as the data is increasing and the complexities are increasing and there's more need to mass size that data, to monetize it, that's when our products really come into their own. And clearly, VIPRION, the chassis, has been very, very popular there.

That's what we've talked about at the Analyst Day and so  -- and that continues to progress. There's lot of other things, too. The other piece is iRules. And we get involved a lot with helping scale various parts of their infrastructure, including things such as diameter or set or some of the other protocols that are running there. We also get called upon to do things like traffic steering, and traffic steering based upon content and the connections. And so VIPRION is really good at that, and our infrastructure is very good at that.

I think we're pretty uniquely positioned to be able to deliver on that. One, because the number of application level decisions per second to achieve that is very, very high, and that plays right into our wheelhouse. 
And then to follow on into the virtual conversation portion of your question, as these applications begin to travel around within people's network and data centers, it becomes important to have those policies follow them. And so what we're up to is absolutely having a way for our functionality to follow those application be paired with them, so that those policies do work out.

Based on our solid year-over-year growth, the strength of our pipeline and the productivity of our sales organization, we believe F5 will continue to generate sequential revenue growth throughout fiscal 2012. We remain confident in achieving revenue growth of at least 20% for fiscal year 2012 and expect to see acceleration in year-over-year product revenue growth in the current quarter. 
Our revenue target for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 is $332 million to $337 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 82% to 83% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. 
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $170.5 million to $174.5 million. This includes approximately $20.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.84 to $0.86 per diluted share. Excluding stock compensation, our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.05 to $1.07 per diluted share. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 35%. 
Excluding stock-based compensation, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%.
We plan to increase our headcount by more than 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the upper-40-day range. We expect inventory levels within the range of $19 million to $21 million. And we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $100 million, reflecting a large sequential increase in our federal tax payments, as is customary in our fiscal second quarter.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."
90323,144130742,208412,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 18, 2012",2012-01-18,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with our Q1 results, which have given us a solid start to fiscal 2012. All major regions met or exceeded our internal sales forecast. From a sales bookings perspective, North America produce",1075,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with our Q1 results, which have given us a solid start to fiscal 2012. All major regions met or exceeded our internal sales forecast. 
From a sales bookings perspective, North America produced solid year-over-year growth. A relatively weak performance in our federal business was more than compensated for by strong performances in both our North American enterprise and service provider businesses. 
I was also pleased with our results in APAC and EMEA and especially in Japan, where we continue to see improvement in deal sizes under current penetration.
Our Services business had another excellent quarter, exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue of approximately $37 million. 
Sales of the new midrange VIPRION 2400 products were very strong in the quarter, and sales from the entire VIPRION family almost tripled from a year ago. The combination of VIPRION sales and the increase in our software module attach rate have been major factors in maintaining deal sizes at record levels.
TMOS version 11 continues to gain traction with a lot of interest in features like VCMP for multiple software licenses and iApp for application optimization and deployment. 
The iApp functionality in v11 is proving to be very popular with our customers, especially for those deploying Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint applications. One example of the power of iApps is a customer who, prior to the introduction of iApp, needed a full week to set up an Exchange environment within the network. By using an iApp, the same customer has now reduced the setup time to only 5 minutes. 
iApps give our customers the ability to access the full capabilities and power of our product, which we believe will generate additional deployments and sales opportunities. 
We also opened a second Technology Center in London during the quarter to complement our facility in Seattle. F5 Technology Centers enable our customers and prospective customers to see how F5 products will operate in their own networking environments. 
I'm very pleased with the number of customer engagements that have already occurred at the London Technology Center, and I believe it is a great showcase for power and effectiveness of our solutions. iApps are the most frequently requested demo from people visiting the Technology Centers.
In addition to the growth we have enjoyed with our hardware-based solutions, I'm also very pleased with the sales of software-only virtualizations of our products, which have increased 149% year-over-year.
F5 has introduced the most comprehensive set of virtual product additions in the market, and I believe this has enabled us to significantly expand our addressable market and offer new and exciting capabilities to our customer base. 
We also saw strong sales momentum with our security products during the quarter. Our application firewall solution, the ASM module, had its best-ever quarter, and we also experienced good sequential growth with our Edge Gateway and APM access solutions. We achieved some important milestones with our security strategy last quarter, including ICSA network firewall certification for TMOS version 11. 
F5 was also positioned in the leader's quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for SSL VPN. You may also have seen our recent press release announcing that our BIG-IP Edge client has the industry's first SSL VPN solution that provides comprehensive security and mobile access for all devices running Android 4.x operating systems. 
F5's free downloadable client enhances mobile user productivity by providing accelerated client access to corporate resources via a full SSL VPN connection. We have already announced similar functionality for the Apple IOS iPhone environment.
TMOS version 11.1 was released in the quarter and included a number of features specifically designed for the security market and their telco and service provider customers. Version 11.1 also included a trial version of our DPI functionality. 
Over the next few quarters, we will be extending -- expanding these features to include full DPI capability, advanced telco-oriented iRules, DNS caching and other features requested by our telco and service provider customers. 
Upcoming product releases includes the new Centaur Blade for the VIPRION 4400 platform, which will double the performance of the current high-end PB200 VIPRION blades. We believe this new platform will be the highest-performing ADC currently available. 
An 8-slot version of this platform is expected later in the year and will double the performance of the center blade platform. As we mentioned at the Analyst Investor meeting in November, we will start a refresh of our one-year and two-year appliances this year leveraging the technology that was developed for the VIPRION 2400. 
With our Virtual Edition, we now support Xen and Hyper-V hypervisors. All our software modules will be supported as virtual editions this year, and we are continuing to develop new features for our centralized management system to better support application scalability in cloud environments and virtualized data centers.
Finally, towards the end of the calendar year, we expect to deliver significant new security capabilities with our Topaz project, including a network firewall, protocol protection and enhanced DDoS application security. 
F5 solutions are being used more and more in data centers throughout the world as strategic control points to secure and optimize mission-critical applications. With our expanding addressable market in areas like security and service providers, we intend to continue to aggressively invest in our sales resources, Services business and our development facilities. 
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to see continued sequential growth in the coming quarter. As we mentioned at the start of the year, one of our important financial objectives is to deliver accelerating product revenue growth. Assuming no major change in the macroeconomic environment, we expect to deliver product revenue growth acceleration in this coming quarter. 
We also continue to target year-over-year total revenue growth of at least 20% in fiscal 2012.  Our current pipeline of business is very strong. And with our technology leadership position, we enjoy world-class competitive win rates in all our major markets. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the TMOS v11 and new products like the VIPRION 2400 will continue to be key growth drivers throughout fiscal 2012. 
The F5 team should be proud of the great start we've made in fiscal 2012. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners and look forward to the continued support throughout the year. 
So with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

So by definition there, we're going to see more software on the 2400 platform.

I think what the investment community is really trying to get their arms around is with respect to that 20% growth target and how much of that is related to mobile being a piece of that. And really, your ability to physically sit behind the all packet core or the GGSN, et cetera, over time, and then of all the business from where you are today to potentially where you're going, I think just any commentary across the board with respect to that strategy would be very helpful. I know it's been asked several times over the last several calls but never really answered in a definitive way.

And the other thing to think about our business is that -- and I think I've said this before, is while we don't tend to be looked upon as the plumbing that's put in as networks are being built, we do get involved in the architecture. However, as the data is increasing and the complexities are increasing and there's more need to mass-size that data, to monetize it, that's when our products really come into their own. And clearly, VIPRION, the chassis, has been very, very popular there.

That's what we've talked about at the Analyst Day.  And so  -- and that continues to progress. There's a lot of other things, too. The other piece is iRules. And we get involved a lot with helping scale various parts of their infrastructure, including things such as diameter or SIP or some of the other protocols that are running there. We also get called upon to do things like traffic steering, and traffic steering's based upon content and the connections. And so VIPRION is really good at that, and our infrastructure is very good at that.

I think we're pretty uniquely positioned to be able to deliver on that. One, because the number of application-level decisions per second to achieve that is very, very high, and that plays right into our wheelhouse. 
And then to follow on into the virtual conversation portion of your question, as these applications begin to travel around within people's network and data centers, it becomes important to have those policies follow them. And so what we're up to is absolutely having a way for our functionality to follow those applications, be paired with them so that those policies do work out.

Prior to Q2, our non-GAAP results have excluded only stock-based compensation expense. 
Following the acquisition of Traffix Systems in February, we have decided to adopt common industry practice and exclude amortization of purchased intangibles and all acquisition-related charges as well. Going forward, we believe this practice will provide investors with a more accurate representation of our operating business model.
A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results for Q2 and/or Q3 earnings guidance is provided in our press release and the consolidated statements of operations included in the press release, and also posted in our website.

F5's fiscal second quarter marked the return-to-product revenue acceleration as strong telco sales and continued momentum in software and security drove revenue ahead of our guidance. Revenue of $339.6 million, which exceeded the high end of our $332 million to $337 million guided range grew 5.3% from the prior quarter and 22.4% year-over-year. In line with our expectations, Q2 revenue from Traffix Systems was not material to results.
GAAP EPS of $0.86 per diluted share was at the high end of our guided range of $0.84 to $0.86. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition charges for Traffix, was $1.09 per diluted share, above our guidance of $1.05 to $1.07.
Product revenue of $205.2 million grew 18% year-over-year, and represented 60% of total revenue. Service revenue of $134.5 million grew 29% year-over-year and accounted for 40% of total revenue.
Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than 1. On a geographic basis, Americas revenue increased 21% from the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and accounted for 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue, which represented 21% of the total, increased 19% from the second quarter of last year. APAC contributed 14% of revenue, up 24% year-over-year. And Japan accounted for 7% of revenue, a 47% increase year-over-year.
During Q2, our Application Delivery Networking business contributed $333.1 million in revenue. This compares to $316.9 million in Q1 and $270.5 million in the second quarter a year ago. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $6.5 million compared to $5.5 million in Q1 and $7.1 million in Q2 of last year.
Telco was our strongest vertical in Q2, representing 27% of total sales. Financial was 16%; technology, 19%; and government was 12%, including U.S. federal, which accounted for 6% of the total.
In Q2, we had 2 greater-than-10% distributors, Avnet, which represented 16.6% of total revenues and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 13.9%.
Behind continued strong sales of software, GAAP gross margin improved in Q2 to 83%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.2%.
GAAP operating expenses of $177.3 million were above our targeted range of $170.5 million to $174.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $155.7 million. GAAP operating margin was 30.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.3%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 35.3% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $101.6 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1,034,000,000 at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $94.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $7 million.
DSO at the end of Q2 was 49 days. Inventories were $17 million. Deferred revenue increased 8.6% sequentially to $412.8 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,805 employees, an increase of 190 from the prior quarter.
During Q2, we repurchased approximately 404,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.44 per share for a total of $50.3 million. Approximately, 281 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
For our outlook. We continue to believe F5 will generate sequential revenue growth throughout fiscal year 2012 and achieve annual revenue growth for the fiscal year of at least 20%. We are very happy with the early sales activity around the Traffix technology acquired this quarter, and John will discuss Traffix in more detail. 
However, for Q3, we do not anticipate a material revenue contribution from Traffix Systems. With that in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 is $350 million to $355 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 82% to 83% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $180.5 million to $184.5 million, including approximately $22 million of stock-based compensation expense and $200,000 in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.12 to $1.14 per diluted share.
We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range.
We expect inventory levels within the range of $17 million to $19 million. And we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $110 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

Each region produced solid year-over-year sales bookings growth. The Asia-Pacific Japan region had a very strong quarter, especially in Japan and China. North America had another well-executed quarter, driven by very strong service provided sales and an improvement in our U.S. federal business. EMEA had an excellent quarter with solid year-over-year and sequential sales growth. 
Our Services business had another stellar quarter in seeing both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue of approximately $33 million.
Continuing the momentum from Q1, sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were very strong, with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 200% from last year. We also continued to experience strong sequential and year-over-year growth and sales from our software-only virtualization solutions. With standalone virtualization over the past week of software module, we now have the most comprehensive portfolio of software-only ADCs in the market. Our tax rates for all our software modules also showed strong growth, especially those that are part of our integrated security offering. All of our security products continued to gain momentum in Q2.
In addition to strong sales of ASM, APM, EDGE Gateway and DNS security modules, we saw a growing demand for our TMOS-based data center firewall solution, which have attained ICSA certification. 
During the quarter, we enjoyed a large number of significant wins, protecting large web-based application environments for traditional firewalls lack the functionality and scalability needed to deal with these new advanced persistent threats. Our large customer facing applications. With TMOS v11 running on our high and systems like the VIPRION 4400, we can deliver more than 8 times throughout compared to the firewall solutions at a significantly lower price while still providing the layer 3 to layer 7 security and application functionality. 
In late February, we augmented our expanding array of telco-related capabilities with the acquisition of Traffix Systems, the leading provider of the signaling product for service providers. The Diameter protocol has gained industry-wide acceptance by the 3G PP and GS and may as a standard for the network signaling and all 4G/LTE networks. DIAMETER played a vital role in the management of 4G LTE and IMS networks including billing and rented deployments, enabling service providers to monetize their networks by providing a menu of subscription-based services.
The Traffix team deep understanding of the need for service providers and the scale in developing technology to manage scale secure integrate and apply diameter services within legacy and next-generation network is a uniquely valuable asset. No other company in the industry has a wide and rich functionality to simplify and enable the next-generation DIAMETER signaling infrastructure.
It's recently addressed and introduced signal delivery control STC provides a strategic point of control in the service provider's network, acting as an intelligent tier in those networks enabling interoperability, security, scale and flexibility in managing and optimizing signaling traffic. That should sound familiar to anyone who follows F5. Our vision has been to create a diverse carrier architecture that unifies IT services end to end across the application data and control plan. DIAMETER's a foundational piece of our puzzle and we are delighted to have the Traffix team join F5 family.
As Andy mentioned, while we do not expect to see any material revenue contribution from this Traffix DIAMETER products in Q3, we are very pleased with the progress we have made and the growing number of proof of concepts we have engaged in our underworld as service providers accelerate the launch of 4G or LTE network. Early indications from these POCs are quite positive, and we believe validate the unique value of proposition, the combination of F5 and Traffix offer to service providers in this rapidly expanding market.
With respect to our core ADC business, we continue to extend the technology leadership last quarter with the introduction of the VIPRION 4480. Our newest chassis-based product specifically designed to enable service providers and the enterprises to address rapidly increasing traffic and the growing demand for enhanced services. 
With the industry-leading capabilities of the VIPRION 4480 and other high-end platforms, organizations can more efficiently scale their infrastructures and seamlessly integrate security, including data center firewall and ICS solutions without sacrificing performance or ease of management.
VIPRION 4480 extends our performance leaderships in all key metrics including SSL, and L7 and includes the market's first of 40-gigabit per second Ethernet support for an application and services platform.
By leveraging F5's hardware and virtual platforms under powerful Clustered Multiprocessing technologies, organizations can remain more flexible as they build their dynamic infrastructures, including cloud and virtualization technologies, to support business initiatives and ever-growing user requirements. Unlike other vendors product, which can be difficult and costly to upgrade, our VIPRION solutions automatically pool resources as new enabling organizations to implement a true scale in demand strategy.
The new blade and 4 blade VIPRION 4480 chassis effectively double the performance of the VIPRION 4400. And an 8 blade version is plan for this year. We're also making good progress in our plan to refresh the 1-year and 2-year this year, leveraging technology for the development of VIPRION 4300, including next-generation CPUs, FPGAs and other components. 
In addition, we have another major release of TMOS plan for late in the year, which will include DPI functionality, a host of new security features and major enhancements for private and public cloud environments.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see solid sequential growth this quarter. I feel very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as strong as it has ever been. Our competitive win rate in the field remain at world-class levels, and our pipeline of future sales opportunity is extremely robust as we enter the second half of fiscal 2012.
We are really well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC market, as well as exploiting new expanding marketing or market opportunities in cloud-based architectures, the security market and the service provider market. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners, and look forward to their continued support throughout the year. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

You can also listen to a telephone replay at (866) 503-3214 or (203) 369-1863. As we indicated in our press release, financial results for the second quarter reflect some changes in the way we report our non-GAAP measurements. Prior to Q2, our non-GAAP results have excluded only stock-based compensation expense. Following the acquisition of Traffix Systems in February, we have decided to adopt common industry practice and exclude amortization of purchased intangibles and all acquisition-related charges as well. Going forward, we believe this practice will provide investors with a more accurate representation of our operating business model.
A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results for Q2 and our Q3 earnings guidance is provided in our press release and the consolidated statements of operations included in the press release, and also posted on our website.
During today's call, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which include words such as believe, anticipate, expect and target. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized in the quarterly press release and described in detail in our SEC filings.

F5's fiscal second quarter marked a return-to-product revenue acceleration as strong telco sales and continued momentum in software and security drove revenue ahead of our guidance. Revenue of $339.6 million, which exceeded the high end of our $332 million to $337 million guided range grew 5.3% from the prior quarter and 22.4% year-over-year. In line with our expectations, Q2 revenue from Traffix Systems was not material to results.
GAAP EPS of $0.86 per diluted share was at the high end of our guided range of $0.84 to $0.86. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition charges for Traffix, was $1.09 per diluted share, above our guidance of $1.05 to $1.07.
Product revenue of $205.2 million grew 18% year-over-year, and represented 60% of total revenue. Service revenue of $134.5 million grew 29% year-over-year and accounted for 40% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than 1. 
On a geographic basis, Americas revenue increased 21% from the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and accounted for 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue, which represented 21% of the total, increased 19% from the second quarter of last year. APAC contributed 14% of revenue, up 24% year-over-year, and Japan accounted for 7% of revenue, a 47% increase year-over-year.
During Q2, our Application Delivery Networking business contributed $333.1 million in revenue. This compares to $316.9 million in Q1 and $270.5 million in the second quarter a year ago. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $6.5 million compared to $5.5 million in Q1 and $7.1 million in Q2 of last year.
Telco was our strongest vertical in Q2, representing 27% of total sales. Financial was 16%; technology, 19%; and government was 12%, including U.S. Federal, which accounted for 6% of the total.
In Q2, we had 2 greater-than-10% distributors: Avnet, which represented 16.6% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 13.9%. Behind continued strong sales of software, GAAP gross margin improved in Q2 to 83%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.2%.
GAAP operating expenses of $177.3 million were above our target range of $170.5 million to $174.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $155.7 million. GAAP operating margin was 30.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.3%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 35.3%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $101.6 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1,034,000,000 at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $94.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $7 million. DSO at the end of Q2 was 49 days. Inventories were $17 million. Deferred revenue increased 8.6% sequentially to $412.8 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,805 employees, an increase of 190 from the prior quarter.
During Q2, we repurchased approximately 404,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.44 per share for a total of $50.3 million. Approximately 281 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
For our outlook, we continue to believe F5 will generate sequential revenue growth throughout fiscal year 2012 and achieve annual revenue growth for the fiscal year of at least 20%. We are very happy with the early sales activity around the Traffix technology acquired this quarter, and John will discuss Traffix in more detail. However, for Q3, we do not anticipate a material revenue contribution from Traffix Systems.
With that in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 is $350 million to $355 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 82% to 83% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $180.5 million to $184.5 million, including approximately $22 million of stock-based compensation expense and $200,000 in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.12 to $1.14 per diluted share.
We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within the range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $110 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with our Q2 results. We delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 22% and 18% year-over-year product revenue growth.

We delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 22% and 18% year-over-year product revenue growth. I was also pleased with the performance of all our major sales regions. Each region produced solid year-over-year sales bookings growth. The Asia-Pacific, Japan region had a very strong quarter, especially in Japan and China. North America had another well-executed quarter, driven by very strong service provider sales and an improvement in our U.S. Federal business. EMEA had an excellent quarter with solid year-over-year and sequential sales growth. Our Services business had another stellar quarter, exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue of approximately $33 million.
Continuing the momentum from Q1, sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were very strong, with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 200% from last year. We also continued to experience strong sequential and year-over-year growth and sales from our software-only virtualization solutions. With standalone virtualizations of our entire suite of software modules, we now have the most comprehensive portfolio of software-only ADCs in the market. Our tax rates for all our software modules also showed strong growth, especially those that are part of our integrated security offering. All of our security products continued to gain momentum in Q2. In addition to strong sales of ASM, APM, EDGE Gateway and DNS security modules, we saw growing demand for our TMOS-based data center firewall solution, which has attained ICSA certification. 
During the quarter, we enjoyed a large number of significant wins, protecting large web-based application environments where traditional firewalls lack the functionality and scalability needed to deal with these new advanced persistent threats on large customer-facing applications. With TMOS v11 running on our high-end systems like the VIPRION 4400, we can deliver more than 8x the throughput of our competitors' firewall solutions at a significantly lower price while still providing the industry-best layer 3 to layer 7 security and application functionality. 
In late February, we augmented our expanding array of telco-related capabilities with the acquisition of Traffix Systems, the leading provider of Diameter signaling product for service providers. The Diameter protocol has gained industry-wide acceptance by the 3G PP and GSMA as the standard for the network signaling in all 4G/LTE networks. 
Diameter plays a vital role in the management of 4G/LTE and IMS networks including billing and policy deployments, enabling service providers to monetize their network by providing a menu of subscription-based services.
The Traffix team's deep understanding of the needs of service providers and their scale in developing technology to manage scale, secure, integrate and apply Diameter services within legacy and next-generation network is a uniquely valuable asset. No other company in the industry has a wide and rich functionality to simplify and enable the next-generation Diameter signaling infrastructure.
Its recently introduced signaling delivery controller, SDC, provides a strategic point of control in the service provider's networks, acting as an intelligent tier in those networks enabling interoperability, security, scale and flexibility in managing and optimizing signaling traffic. That should sound familiar to anyone who follows F5. Our vision has been to create a converged carrier architecture that unifies IT services end-to-end across the application, data and control plan. Diameter is a foundational piece of that puzzle, and we are delighted to have the Traffix team join F5 family.
As Andy mentioned, while we do not expect to see any material revenue contribution from the Traffix Diameter products in Q3, we are very pleased with the progress we have made and the growing number of proof of concepts we are engaged in around the world as service providers accelerate the launch of 4G or LTE networks. Early indications from these POCs are quite positive, and we believe validate the unique value proposition the combination of F5 and Traffix offer to service providers in this rapidly expanding market.
With respect to our core ADC business, we continue to extend our technology leadership last quarter with the introduction of the VIPRION 4480, our newest chassis-based product specifically designed to enable service providers and the enterprises to address rapidly increasing traffic levels and the growing demand for enhanced services. 
With the industry-leading capabilities of the VIPRION 4480 and other -- our other high-end platforms, organizations can more efficiently scale their infrastructures and seamlessly integrate security, including data center firewall and ICS solutions without sacrificing performance or ease of management. VIPRION 4480 extends our performance leaderships on all key metrics including SSL, layer 4 and layer 7 and includes the market's first 40-gigabit per second Ethernet support for an applications and services platform.
By leveraging F5's hardware and virtual platforms under our powerful Clustered Multiprocessing technologies, organizations can remain more flexible as they build their dynamic infrastructures, including cloud and virtualization technologies to support business initiatives and ever-growing user requirements. Unlike other vendor's product, which can be difficult and costly to upgrade, our VIPRION solutions automatically pool resources as new blades are added, enabling organizations to implement a true 'scale on demand' strategy.
The new blades and the 4 blade VIPRION 4480 chassis effectively double the performance of the VIPRION 4400. And an 8 blade version is planned for later this year. We're also making good progress on our plan to refresh the current 1-year and 2-year appliances this year, leveraging technology that was developed for the VIPRION 2400, including next-generation CPUs, FPGAs and other components. In addition, we have another major lease of TMOS planned for later in the year, which will include DPI functionality, a host of new security features and major enhancements for private and public cloud environments.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see solid sequential growth this quarter. I feel very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as strong as it has ever been. Our competitive win rates in the field remain at world-class levels, and our pipeline of future sales opportunity is extremely robust as we enter the second half of fiscal 2012.
We are really well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC market, as well as exploiting new expanding marketing -- market opportunities in cloud-based architectures, the security market and the service provider market. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners, and look forward to the continued support throughout the year. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

If you look at the verticals, clearly, financial vertical was down somewhat from its normal value. We don't think there's anything systemic there at all. In fact, we expect it to be up in this coming quarter. Telco was very high and that expect that to be down somewhat in this -- the coming quarter, which I guess, balances that. And really, when we look at the pipeline, that's the way we manage the business, the overall pipeline. And I mentioned, it was really good. So I was pretty pleased. I was obviously very pleased with security and what we're doing there right across the board. The data center firewall solutions are coming on very strongly.

The use case that we provide a lot of value today, that doesn't mean we're not going to expand the portfolio, but today is really an inbound firewall.

In that type of environment, what we're trying to do is provide layer 3 through level 7 controls, protect those web applications, should beat [ph] after-tax, application vulnerabilities, et cetera. And we are protecting those applications, which are very well defined from millions, if not tens of millions or billions of users trying to access those applications. In that situation, our firewall capability not only is much more extensible but also provide deeper visibility, inspection and extensibility than anybody else out there. The Palo Alto use case does not scale. They stop at about 40-gig from a performance characteristics point of view. We start and keep on going beyond that. So it's not an equal comparison in the inbound side.

Following the acquisition of Traffix Systems in February, we have decided to adopt common industry practice and exclude amortization of purchased intangibles and all acquisition-related charges as well. Going forward, we believe this practice will provide investors with a more accurate representation of our operating business model.

Revenue of $339.6 million, which exceeded the high end o",752,"Thank you, John. F5's fiscal second quarter marked a return-to-product revenue acceleration as strong telco sales and continued momentum in software and security drove revenue ahead of our guidance. Revenue of $339.6 million, which exceeded the high end of our $332 million to $337 million guided range grew 5.3% from the prior quarter and 22.4% year-over-year. In line with our expectations, Q2 revenue from Traffix Systems was not material to results.
GAAP EPS of $0.86 per diluted share was at the high end of our guided range of $0.84 to $0.86. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition charges for Traffix, was $1.09 per diluted share, above our guidance of $1.05 to $1.07.
Product revenue of $205.2 million grew 18% year-over-year, and represented 60% of total revenue. Service revenue of $134.5 million grew 29% year-over-year and accounted for 40% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than one. 
On a geographic basis, Americas revenue increased 21% from the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and accounted for 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue, which represented 21% of the total, increased 19% from the second quarter of last year. APAC contributed 14% of revenue, up 24% year-over-year, and Japan accounted for 7% of revenue, a 47% increase year-over-year.
During Q2, our Application Delivery Networking business contributed $333.1 million in revenue. This compares to $316.9 million in Q1 and $270.5 million in the second quarter a year ago. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $6.5 million compared to $5.5 million in Q1 and $7.1 million in Q2 of last year.
Telco was our strongest vertical in Q2, representing 27% of total sales. Financial was 16%; technology, 19%; and government was 12%, including U.S. Federal, which accounted for 6% of the total.
In Q2, we had 2 greater-than-10% distributors: Avnet, which represented 16.6% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 13.9%. Behind continued strong sales of software, GAAP gross margin improved in Q2 to 83%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.2%.
GAAP operating expenses of $177.3 million were above our target range of $170.5 million to $174.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $155.7 million. GAAP operating margin was 30.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.3%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 35.3%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $101.6 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1,034,000,000 at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $94.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $7 million. DSO at the end of Q2 was 49 days. Inventories were $17 million. Deferred revenue increased 8.6% sequentially to $412.8 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,805 employees, an increase of 190 from the prior quarter.
During Q2, we repurchased approximately 404,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.44 per share for a total of $50.3 million. Approximately 281 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
For our outlook, we continue to believe F5 will generate sequential revenue growth throughout fiscal year 2012 and achieve annual revenue growth for the fiscal year of at least 20%. We are very happy with the early sales activity around the Traffix technology acquired this quarter, and John will discuss Traffix in more detail. However, for Q3, we do not anticipate a material revenue contribution from Traffix Systems.
With that in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 is $350 million to $355 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 82% to 83% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $180.5 million to $184.5 million, including approximately $22 million of stock-based compensation expense and $200,000 in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.12 to $1.14 per diluted share.
We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within the range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $110 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with our Q2 results. We delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 22% and 18% year-over-year product revenue growth.

We delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 22% and 18% year-over-year product revenue growth. I was also pleased with the performance of all our major sales regions. Each region produced solid year-over-year sales bookings growth. The Asia-Pacific, Japan region had a very strong quarter, especially in Japan and China. North America had another well-executed quarter, driven by very strong service provider sales and an improvement in our U.S. Federal business. EMEA had an excellent quarter with solid year-over-year and sequential sales growth. Our Services business had another stellar quarter, exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue of approximately $33 million.
Continuing the momentum from Q1, sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were very strong, with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 200% from last year. We also continued to experience strong sequential and year-over-year growth and sales from our software-only virtualization solutions. With standalone virtualizations of our entire suite of software modules, we now have the most comprehensive portfolio of software-only ADCs in the market. Our tax rates for all our software modules also showed strong growth, especially those that are part of our integrated security offering. All of our security products continued to gain momentum in Q2. In addition to strong sales of ASM, APM, EDGE Gateway and DNS security modules, we saw growing demand for our TMOS-based data center firewall solution, which has attained ICSA certification. 
During the quarter, we enjoyed a large number of significant wins, protecting large web-based application environments where traditional firewalls lack the functionality and scalability needed to deal with these new advanced persistent threats on large customer-facing applications. With TMOS v11 running on our high-end systems like the VIPRION 4400, we can deliver more than 8x the throughput of our competitors' firewall solutions at a significantly lower price while still providing the industry-best layer 3 to layer 7 security and application functionality. 
In late February, we augmented our expanding array of telco-related capabilities with the acquisition of Traffix Systems, the leading provider of Diameter signaling product for service providers. The Diameter protocol has gained industry-wide acceptance by the 3G PP and GSMA as the standard for the network signaling in all 4G/LTE networks. 
Diameter plays a vital role in the management of 4G/LTE and IMS networks including billing and policy deployments, enabling service providers to monetize their network by providing a menu of subscription-based services.
The Traffix team's deep understanding of the needs of service providers and their skill in developing technology to manage scale, secure, integrate and apply Diameter services within legacy and next-generation network is a uniquely valuable asset. No other company in the industry has a wide and rich functionality to simplify and enable the next-generation Diameter signaling infrastructure.
Its recently introduced signaling delivery controller, SDC, provides a strategic point of control in the service provider's networks, acting as an intelligent tier in those networks enabling interoperability, security, scale and flexibility in managing and optimizing signaling traffic. That should sound familiar to anyone who follows F5. Our vision has been to create a converged carrier architecture that unifies IP services end-to-end across the application, data and control plan. Diameter is a foundational piece of that puzzle, and we are delighted to have the Traffix team join F5 family.
As Andy mentioned, while we do not expect to see any material revenue contribution from the Traffix Diameter products in Q3, we are very pleased with the progress we have made and the growing number of proof of concepts we are engaged in around the world as service providers accelerate the launch of 4G or LTE networks. Early indications from these POCs are quite positive, and we believe validate the unique value proposition the combination of F5 and Traffix offer to service providers in this rapidly expanding market.
With respect to our core ADC business, we continue to extend our technology leadership last quarter with the introduction of the VIPRION 4480, our newest chassis-based product specifically designed to enable service providers and the enterprises to address rapidly increasing traffic levels and the growing demand for enhanced services. 
With the industry-leading capabilities of the VIPRION 4480 and other -- our other high-end platforms, organizations can more efficiently scale their infrastructures and seamlessly integrate security, including data center firewall and ICS solutions without sacrificing performance or ease of management. VIPRION 4480 extends our performance leaderships on all key metrics including SSL, layer 4 and layer 7 and includes the market's first 40-gigabit per second Ethernet support for an applications and services platform.
By leveraging F5's hardware and virtual platforms and our powerful Clustered Multiprocessing technologies, organizations can remain more flexible as they build their dynamic infrastructures, including cloud and virtualization technologies to support business initiatives and ever-growing user requirements. Unlike other vendor's product, which can be difficult and costly to upgrade, our VIPRION solutions automatically pool resources as new blades are added, enabling organizations to implement a true 'scale on demand' strategy.
The new blades in the 4 blade VIPRION 4480 chassis effectively double the performance of the VIPRION 4400. And an 8 blade version is planned for later this year. We're also making good progress on our plan to refresh the current 1-year and 2-year appliances this year, leveraging technology that was developed for the VIPRION 2400, including next-generation CPUs, FPGAs and other components. In addition, we have another major lease of TMOS planned for later in the year, which will include DPI functionality, a host of new security features and major enhancements for private and public cloud environments.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see solid sequential growth this quarter. I feel very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as strong as it has ever been. Our competitive win rates in the field remain at world-class levels, and our pipeline of future sales opportunity is extremely robust as we enter the second half of fiscal 2012.
We are really well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC market, as well as exploiting new expanding marketing -- market opportunities in cloud-based architectures, the security market and the service provider market. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners, and look forward to the continued support throughout the year. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

And really, when we look at the pipeline, that's the way we manage the business, the overall pipeline. And I mentioned, it was really good. So I was pretty pleased. I was obviously very pleased with security and what we're doing there right across the board. The data center firewall solutions are coming on very strongly.

As we indicated in our press release, financial results for the second quarter reflect some changes in the way we report our non-GAAP measurements. Prior to Q2, our non-GAAP results have excluded only stock-based compensation expense. Following the acquisition of Traffix Systems in February, we have decided to adopt common industry practice and exclude amortization of purchased intangibles and all acquisition-related charges as well. Going forward, we believe this practice will provide investors with a more accurate representation of our operating business model.
A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results for Q2 and our Q3 earnings guidance is provided in our press release and the consolidated statements of operations included in the press release, and also posted on our website.
During today's call, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which include words such as believe, anticipate, expect and target. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized in the quarterly press release and described in detail in our SEC filings.

F5's fiscal second quarter marked a return-to-product revenue acceleration as strong telco sales and continued momentum in software and security drove revenue ahead of our guidance. Revenue of $339.6 million, which exceeded the high end of our $332 million to $337 million guided range grew 5.3% from the prior quarter and 22.4% year-over-year. In line with our expectations, Q2 revenue from Traffix Systems was not material to results.
GAAP EPS of $0.86 per diluted share was at the high end of our guided range of $0.84 to $0.86. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition charges for Traffix, was $1.09 per diluted share, above our guidance of $1.05 to $1.07.
Product revenue of $205.2 million grew 18% year-over-year, and represented 60% of total revenue. Service revenue of $134.5 million grew 29% year-over-year and accounted for 40% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than one. 
On a geographic basis, Americas revenue increased 21% from the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and accounted for 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue, which represented 21% of the total, increased 19% from the second quarter of last year. APAC contributed 14% of revenue, up 24% year-over-year, and Japan accounted for 7% of revenue, a 47% increase year-over-year.
During Q2, our Application Delivery Networking business contributed $333.1 million in revenue. This compares to $316.9 million in Q1 and $270.5 million in the second quarter a year ago. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $6.5 million compared to $5.5 million in Q1 and $7.1 million in Q2 of last year.
Telco was our strongest vertical in Q2, representing 27% of total sales. Financial was 16%; technology, 19%; and government was 12%, including U.S. Federal, which accounted for 6% of the total.
In Q2, we had 2 greater-than-10% distributors: Avnet, which represented 16.6% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 13.9%. Behind continued strong sales of software, GAAP gross margin improved in Q2 to 83%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.2%.
GAAP operating expenses of $177.3 million were above our target range of $170.5 million to $174.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $155.7 million. GAAP operating margin was 30.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.3%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 35.3%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $101.6 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1,034,000,000 at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $94.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $7 million. DSO at the end of Q2 was 49 days. Inventories were $17 million. Deferred revenue increased 8.6% sequentially to $412.8 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,805 employees, an increase of 190 from the prior quarter.
During Q2, we repurchased approximately 404,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.44 per share for a total of $50.3 million. Approximately 281 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
For our outlook, we continue to believe F5 will generate sequential revenue growth throughout fiscal year 2012 and achieve annual revenue growth for the fiscal year of at least 20%. We are very happy with the early sales activity around the Traffix technology acquired this quarter, and John will discuss Traffix in more detail. However, for Q3, we do not anticipate a material revenue contribution from Traffix Systems.
With that in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 is $350 million to $355 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 82% to 83% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $180.5 million to $184.5 million, including approximately $22 million of stock-based compensation expense and $200,000 in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.12 to $1.14 per diluted share.
We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within the range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $110 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with our Q2 results. We delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 22% and 18% year-over-year product revenue growth.

We delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 22% and 18% year-over-year product revenue growth. I was also pleased with the performance of all our major sales regions. Each region produced solid year-over-year sales bookings growth. The Asia-Pacific, Japan region had a very strong quarter, especially in Japan and China. North America had another well-executed quarter, driven by very strong service provider sales and an improvement in our U.S. Federal business. EMEA had an excellent quarter with solid year-over-year and sequential sales growth. Our Services business had another stellar quarter, exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue of approximately $33 million.
Continuing the momentum from Q1, sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were very strong, with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 200% from last year. We also continued to experience strong sequential and year-over-year growth and sales from our software-only virtualization solutions. With standalone virtualizations of our entire suite of software modules, we now have the most comprehensive portfolio of software-only ADCs in the market. Our tax rates for all our software modules also showed strong growth, especially those that are part of our integrated security offering. All of our security products continued to gain momentum in Q2. In addition to strong sales of ASM, APM, EDGE Gateway and DNS security modules, we saw growing demand for our TMOS-based data center firewall solution, which has attained ICSA certification. 
During the quarter, we enjoyed a large number of significant wins, protecting large web-based application environments where traditional firewalls lack the functionality and scalability needed to deal with these new advanced persistent threats on large customer-facing applications. With TMOS v11 running on our high-end systems like the VIPRION 4400, we can deliver more than 8x the throughput of our competitors' firewall solutions at a significantly lower price while still providing the industry-best layer 3 to layer 7 security and application functionality. 
In late February, we augmented our expanding array of telco-related capabilities with the acquisition of Traffix Systems, the leading provider of Diameter signaling product for service providers. The Diameter protocol has gained industry-wide acceptance by the 3G PP and GSMA as the standard for the network signaling in all 4G/LTE networks. 
Diameter plays a vital role in the management of 4G/LTE and IMS networks including billing and policy deployments, enabling service providers to monetize their network by providing a menu of subscription-based services.
The Traffix team's deep understanding of the needs of service providers and their skill in developing technology to manage scale, secure, integrate and apply Diameter services within legacy and next-generation network is a uniquely valuable asset. No other company in the industry has a wide and rich functionality to simplify and enable the next-generation Diameter signaling infrastructure.
Its recently introduced signaling delivery controller, SDC, provides a strategic point of control in the service provider's networks, acting as an intelligent tier in those networks enabling interoperability, security, scale and flexibility in managing and optimizing signaling traffic. That should sound familiar to anyone who follows F5. Our vision has been to create a converged carrier architecture that unifies IP services end-to-end across the application, data and control plan. Diameter is a foundational piece of that puzzle, and we are delighted to have the Traffix team join F5 family.
As Andy mentioned, while we do not expect to see any material revenue contribution from the Traffix Diameter products in Q3, we are very pleased with the progress we have made and the growing number of proof of concepts we are engaged in around the world as service providers accelerate the launch of 4G or LTE networks. Early indications from these POCs are quite positive, and we believe validate the unique value proposition the combination of F5 and Traffix offer to service providers in this rapidly expanding market.
With respect to our core ADC business, we continue to extend our technology leadership last quarter with the introduction of the VIPRION 4480, our newest chassis-based product specifically designed to enable service providers and the enterprises to address rapidly increasing traffic levels and the growing demand for enhanced services. 
With the industry-leading capabilities of the VIPRION 4480 and other -- our other high-end platforms, organizations can more efficiently scale their infrastructures and seamlessly integrate security, including data center firewall and ICS solutions without sacrificing performance or ease of management. VIPRION 4480 extends our performance leaderships on all key metrics including SSL, layer 4 and layer 7 and includes the market's first 40-gigabit per second Ethernet support for an applications and services platform.
By leveraging F5's hardware and virtual platforms and our powerful Clustered Multiprocessing technologies, organizations can remain more flexible as they build their dynamic infrastructures, including cloud and virtualization technologies to support business initiatives and ever-growing user requirements. Unlike other vendor's product, which can be difficult and costly to upgrade, our VIPRION solutions automatically pool resources as new blades are added, enabling organizations to implement a true 'scale on demand' strategy.
The new blades in the 4 blade VIPRION 4480 chassis effectively double the performance of the VIPRION 4400. And an 8 blade version is planned for later this year. We're also making good progress on our plan to refresh the current 1-year and 2-year appliances this year, leveraging technology that was developed for the VIPRION 2400, including next-generation CPUs, FPGAs and other components. In addition, we have another major lease of TMOS planned for later in the year, which will include DPI functionality, a host of new security features and major enhancements for private and public cloud environments.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see solid sequential growth this quarter. I feel very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as strong as it has ever been. Our competitive win rates in the field remain at world-class levels, and our pipeline of future sales opportunity is extremely robust as we enter the second half of fiscal 2012.
We are really well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC market, as well as exploiting new expanding marketing -- market opportunities in cloud-based architectures, the security market and the service provider market. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners, and look forward to the continued support throughout the year. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

The use case that we provide a lot of value today, that doesn't mean we're not going to expand the portfolio, but today is really an inbound firewall.

In that type of environment, what we're trying to do is provide layer 3 through level 7 controls, protect those web applications should DDoS attack, application vulnerabilities, et cetera. And we are protecting those applications, which are very well defined from millions, if not tens of millions or billions of users trying to access those applications. In that situation, our firewall capability not only is much more extensible but also provides deeper visibility, inspection and extensibility than anybody else out there. The Palo Alto use case does not scale. They stop at about 40-gig from a performance characteristics point of view. We start and keep on going beyond that.

Prior to Q2, our non-GAAP results have excluded only stock-based compensation expense. Following the acquisition of Traffix Systems in February, we have decided to adopt common industry practice and exclude amortization of purchased intangibles and all acquisition-related charges as well. Going forward, we believe this practice will provide investors with a more accurate representation of our operating business model.
A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results for Q2 and our Q3 earnings guidance is provided in our press release and the consolidated statements of operations included in the press release, and also posted on our website.
During today's call, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which include words such as believe, anticipate, expect and target. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized in the quarterly press release and described in detail in our SEC filings.

Product revenue of $205.2 million grew 18% year-over-year, and represented 60% of total revenue. Service revenue of $134.5 million grew 29% year-over-year and accounted for 40% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than one. 
On a geographic basis, Americas revenue increased 21% from the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and accounted for 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue, which represented 21% of the total, increased 19% from the second quarter of last year. APAC contributed 14% of revenue, up 24% year-over-year, and Japan accounted for 7% of revenue, a 47% increase year-over-year.
During Q2, our Application Delivery Networking business contributed $333.1 million in revenue. This compares to $316.9 million in Q1 and $270.5 million in the second quarter a year ago. Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $6.5 million compared to $5.5 million in Q1 and $7.1 million in Q2 of last year.
Telco was our strongest vertical in Q2, representing 27% of total sales. Financial was 16%; technology, 19%; and government was 12%, including U.S. Federal, which accounted for 6% of the total.
In Q2, we had 2 greater-than-10% distributors: Avnet, which represented 16.6% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 13.9%. Behind continued strong sales of software, GAAP gross margin improved in Q2 to 83%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.2%.
GAAP operating expenses of $177.3 million were above our target range of $170.5 million to $174.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $155.7 million. GAAP operating margin was 30.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.3%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 35.3%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.8%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $101.6 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1,034,000,000 at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $94.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $7 million. DSO at the end of Q2 was 49 days. Inventories were $17 million. Deferred revenue increased 8.6% sequentially to $412.8 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,805 employees, an increase of 190 from the prior quarter.
During Q2, we repurchased approximately 404,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.44 per share for a total of $50.3 million. Approximately 281 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
For our outlook, we continue to believe F5 will generate sequential revenue growth throughout fiscal year 2012 and achieve annual revenue growth for the fiscal year of at least 20%. We are very happy with the early sales activity around the Traffix technology acquired this quarter, and John will discuss Traffix in more detail. However, for Q3, we do not anticipate a material revenue contribution from Traffix Systems.
With that in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 is $350 million to $355 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 82% to 83% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $180.5 million to $184.5 million, including approximately $22 million of stock-based compensation expense and $200,000 in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.12 to $1.14 per diluted share.
We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33.5%. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within the range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $110 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with our Q2 results. We delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 22% and 18% year-over-year product revenue growth. I was also pleased with the performance of all our major sales regio",1084,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with our Q2 results. We delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 22% and 18% year-over-year product revenue growth. I was also pleased with the performance of all our major sales regions. Each region produced solid year-over-year sales bookings growth. The Asia-Pacific, Japan region had a very strong quarter, especially in Japan and China. North America had another well-executed quarter, driven by very strong service provider sales and an improvement in our U.S. Federal business. EMEA had an excellent quarter with solid year-over-year and sequential sales growth. Our Services business had another stellar quarter, exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue of approximately $33 million.
Continuing the momentum from Q1, sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were very strong, with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 200% from last year. We also continued to experience strong sequential and year-over-year growth and sales from our software-only virtualization solutions. With standalone virtualizations of our entire suite of software modules, we now have the most comprehensive portfolio of software-only ADCs in the market. Our tax rates for all our software modules also showed strong growth, especially those that are part of our integrated security offering. All of our security products continued to gain momentum in Q2. In addition to strong sales of ASM, APM, EDGE Gateway and DNS security modules, we saw growing demand for our TMOS-based data center firewall solution, which has attained ICSA certification. 
During the quarter, we enjoyed a large number of significant wins, protecting large web-based application environments where traditional firewalls lack the functionality and scalability needed to deal with these new advanced persistent threats on large customer-facing applications. With TMOS v11 running on our high-end systems like the VIPRION 4400, we can deliver more than 8x the throughput of our competitors' firewall solutions at a significantly lower price while still providing the industry-best layer 3 to layer 7 security and application functionality. 
In late February, we augmented our expanding array of telco-related capabilities with the acquisition of Traffix Systems, the leading provider of Diameter signaling product for service providers. The Diameter protocol has gained industry-wide acceptance by the 3G PP and GSMA as the standard for the network signaling in all 4G/LTE networks. 
Diameter plays a vital role in the management of 4G/LTE and IMS networks including billing and policy deployments, enabling service providers to monetize their network by providing a menu of subscription-based services.
The Traffix team's deep understanding of the needs of service providers and their skill in developing technology to manage scale, secure, integrate and apply Diameter services within legacy and next-generation network is a uniquely valuable asset. No other company in the industry has a wide and rich functionality to simplify and enable the next-generation Diameter signaling infrastructure.
Its recently introduced signaling delivery controller, SDC, provides a strategic point of control in the service provider's networks, acting as an intelligent tier in those networks enabling interoperability, security, scale and flexibility in managing and optimizing signaling traffic. That should sound familiar to anyone who follows F5. Our vision has been to create a converged carrier architecture that unifies IP services end-to-end across the application, data and control plan. Diameter is a foundational piece of that puzzle, and we are delighted to have the Traffix team join F5 family.
As Andy mentioned, while we do not expect to see any material revenue contribution from the Traffix Diameter products in Q3, we are very pleased with the progress we have made and the growing number of proof of concepts we are engaged in around the world as service providers accelerate the launch of 4G or LTE networks. Early indications from these POCs are quite positive, and we believe validate the unique value proposition the combination of F5 and Traffix offer to service providers in this rapidly expanding market.
With respect to our core ADC business, we continue to extend our technology leadership last quarter with the introduction of the VIPRION 4480, our newest chassis-based product specifically designed to enable service providers and the enterprises to address rapidly increasing traffic levels and the growing demand for enhanced services. 
With the industry-leading capabilities of the VIPRION 4480 and other -- our other high-end platforms, organizations can more efficiently scale their infrastructures and seamlessly integrate security, including data center firewall and ICS solutions without sacrificing performance or ease of management. VIPRION 4480 extends our performance leaderships on all key metrics including SSL, layer 4 and layer 7 and includes the market's first 40-gigabit per second Ethernet support for an applications and services platform.
By leveraging F5's hardware and virtual platforms and our powerful Clustered Multiprocessing technologies, organizations can remain more flexible as they build their dynamic infrastructures, including cloud and virtualization technologies to support business initiatives and ever-growing user requirements. Unlike other vendor's product, which can be difficult and costly to upgrade, our VIPRION solutions automatically pool resources as new blades are added, enabling organizations to implement a true 'scale on demand' strategy.
The new blades in the 4 blade VIPRION 4480 chassis effectively double the performance of the VIPRION 4400. And an 8 blade version is planned for later this year. We're also making good progress on our plan to refresh the current 1-year and 2-year appliances this year, leveraging technology that was developed for the VIPRION 2400, including next-generation CPUs, FPGAs and other components. In addition, we have another major lease of TMOS planned for later in the year, which will include DPI functionality, a host of new security features and major enhancements for private and public cloud environments.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see solid sequential growth this quarter. I feel very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as strong as it has ever been. Our competitive win rates in the field remain at world-class levels, and our pipeline of future sales opportunity is extremely robust as we enter the second half of fiscal 2012.
We are really well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC market, as well as exploiting new expanding marketing -- market opportunities in cloud-based architectures, the security market and the service provider market. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners, and look forward to the continued support throughout the year. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A."

In fact, we expect it to be up in this coming quarter. Telco was very high and that expect that to be down somewhat in this -- the coming quarter, which I guess, balances that. And really, when we look at the pipeline, that's the way we manage the business, the overall pipeline. And I mentioned, it was really good. So I was pretty pleased. I was obviously very pleased with security and what we're doing there right across the board. The data center firewall solutions are coming on very strongly.

So let me start off by kind of explaining a little bit the use case that we go after because it's a little different than the use cases of Palo Alto predominantly goes after. The use case that we provide a lot of value today, that doesn't mean we're not going to expand the portfolio, but today is really an inbound firewall. And what I mean by that is the firewall that's defending a set of web-based applications and inbound traffic, users from the Internet are coming into a business trying to access that application. In that type of environment, what we're trying to do is provide layer 3 through level 7 controls, protect those web applications should DDoS attack, application vulnerabilities, et cetera. And we are protecting those applications, which are very well defined from millions, if not tens of millions or billions of users trying to access those applications. In that situation, our firewall capability not only is much more extensible but also provides deeper visibility, inspection and extensibility than anybody else out there. The Palo Alto use case does not scale. They stop at about 40-gig from a performance characteristics point of view. We start and keep on going beyond that. So it's not an equal comparison in the inbound side. On the -- what Palo Alto does really well is provide firewall capabilities for an enterprise when an enterprise is trying to access outside to the Internet-based applications. And in that situation today, we're not bringing to market yet our solution."

In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth in what proved to be a challenging macro environment. Revenue of $352.6 million grew 4% from the prior quarter to 21% from the third quarter of last year, and was within our guided range of $350 million to $355 million.
GAAP EPS of $0.91 per diluted share was above our guidance of $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.14 per diluted share was at the high end of our $1.12 to $1.14 guided range.
Product revenue of $207.1 million grew 15% year-over-year and represented 59% of total revenue. Service revenue of $145.5 million grew 31% year-over-year and accounted for 41% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was less than 1.
During Q3, our core Application Delivery Networking business accounted for $346.3 million and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $6.3 million.
From a geographic perspective, all feeders generated sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. At 57% of total, the Americas grew 22% year-over-year; EMEA accounted for 21% of revenue, an increase of 27% versus Q3 of 2011; APAC represented 15% of the revenue mix, with 17% growth year-over-year; and Japan was 7% of revenue, up 9% over a strong Q3 of 2011.
Looking at our key verticals, telco accounted for 22% of sales. Sales into the finance vertical represented 23% of total; our U.S. Federal business equaled 6% of sales, with total government at 12%; and technology accounted for 16% of total sales.
In Q3, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors: Avnet, which represented 17.3% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 14.8%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.2%.
GAAP operating expenses of $182.3 million were within our guided range of $180.5 million to $184.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $161.3 million. GAAP operating margin was 31.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 35.2%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q3, we continued to strengthen our financial position. Cash flow from operations was $113.4 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1.1 billion at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $107.7 million.
DSO at the end of Q3 was 49 days. Inventories were $17 million. Deferred revenue increased 5% sequentially to $433.9 million.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.7 million and depreciation and amortization expense was $10.1 million.
We ended the quarter with approximately 2,905 employees, an increase of 100 from the prior quarter.
During Q3, we repurchased approximately 425,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $117.59 per share for a total of $50 million. Approximately $231 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
Looking ahead to Q4. We continue to see the key drivers of our business, including mobile traffic growth, data center consolidation, growth in virtual environments and security concerns, trending in our favor. We see solid growth in our software sales and we see strong momentum with our security products.
We also have an exciting product roadmap that positions us to take advantage of an expanding addressable market. As a result, we continued to believe our prospects for long-term growth remains strong.
That said, the context of a weak global economy leads us to be more cautious in our near-term outlook. With this in mind, our guidance for the current quarter is as follows: Our revenue target for Q4 is $360 million to $370 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to remain strong in the 83% range, including approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $188 million to $195 million, including approximately $24 million of stock-based compensation expense and $200,000 in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.90 to $0.93 per diluted share, and our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.16 to $1.19 per diluted share.
We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter.
We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $135 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with our Q3 performance. In a difficult macro environment, we delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 21% and world-class non-GAAP operating margins above 38%, and continued to strengthen our balance sheet with strong cash generation.
Our major sales regions all -- each major sales region features double-digit sales bookings growth. Our Services business had another solid quarter exceeding both revenue and profit goals as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue.
Sales of our VIPRION chassis base products were very strong with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 82% from last year. Software module sales during the quarter were also very strong and the percentage attached rate for our software sales reached a record high in Q3, driven by rapidly accelerating sales of our security software products.
Sales of our data center firewall solution grew sequentially over last quarter, and we expect that momentum to continue into next year.
Our Security Solution portfolio now includes the most comprehensive application firewall solution in the market, the highest performing data center firewall solution for protecting large-scale web-based applications and industry-leading access and policy management solutions. I believe that F5 continues to be well positioned to capitalize in major market trends. Our platforms deliver an array of intelligent services for enterprises service providers and clouds. Our customers use F5 technology as strategic points of control to consolidate functions on our platforms and to design and deploy our dynamic networks to sufficiently deal with the ever-increasing challenges presented by the growth in video traffic, evolving and more sophisticated securities ware and adoption of mobile devices.
Our product roadmap contains several growth drivers including our comprehensive product refresh of all our appliances, which will deliver a very significant price performance advantage to our customers. In addition, performance of our virtual additions for all hypervisor platforms will be tripled. We also are building an 8-slot VIPRION chassis solution which will leverage the central blades released in Q3 and set a new bar the layer 4 to 7 performance, so ADC functions including security and optimization.
The next major release of TMOS contains significant software deliverables including DTI, Deepak inspection functionality for the service provider market, as well as a market leading layer 3 to layer 7 firewall solution. This integrated firewall will be a module available across all F5 platforms, allowing customers to consolidate the firewall infrastructure while provided unprecedented performance and flexibility by allowing security policies to be applied at the network and the application levels.
The DTI functionality will be another strategic offering to the service provider market. We now have a broad portfolio of solutions for the service provider market, including our recently acquired Diameter signaling products to the management of 4G/LTE and IMS network, our carrier grade NAT and IPv6 capability and the steaming functionality derived from our sophisticated iRules running on TMOS.
We will also introduce significant updates to our virtualizations and management products which will make it easier for customers to adopt hybrid cloud architectures and optimize the delivery of web-based applications.
We continue to focus on delivering to our customers as many application layer decisions per second as possible and using that noise to drive orchestration application both real and virtual within and across data centers.
We believe these capabilities generate significant value and benefits to our customers and clearly differentiate our technology from our competitors. Many companies in this market talk about performance just from a throughput perspective or intelligence at the application layer. F5 not only provides the highest bandwidth, but also is the only ADC vendor to deliver application intelligence at network speeds and beyond. As traffic and applications continue to become more web centric, I believe the market is rapidly moving towards F5 sweet spot. Our world-class connection and transaction processing capabilities, combined with high-speed patent margin and caused us to built hardware enable F5 to deliver advanced solutions for optimization, security and application delivery for many years to come.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we see sequential growth this quarter. There is no doubt that we experienced a cautious spending environment last quarter, and we expect that caution to continue into this quarter. Even with these economic headwinds, I remain very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as a strong as it has ever been and our product roadmap will extend that leadership. We will continue to invest in hiring world-class people to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC market and to enable us to finally exploit new expanding market opportunities in cloud and cloud-based architectures in the security market and the service provider market.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and their partners and look for their continued support throughout the year. We will now hand the call over for Q&A."

It's still a small proportion of our business, but a very fast high percentage growing portion. We see a lot of hybrid sales.

So one with the virtual additions themselves, we're going to be increasing the performance we already have great performance within our virtual additions. But we'll crank that up even more. Another aspect that we're working on, too, is allowing people to string multiple versions of those together and act as one coherent unit, too. So as we think about many of these larger players and thinking about having a totally softer defined data center, if you will. So everything looks the same inside of it and you're changing the personality of the devices solely by software. We think that we've got a very interesting way to help them do that and utilize our software from that perspective. The other piece that I mentioned, too, is different go-to-market models as well. We think there are other ways to exploit and better get our products into what I've called the generations. So people coming up with new companies who are not likely to build their own data centers or purchase servers or anything like. They are just going to be renting infrastructure from various players out there. We just want to make sure that we've got that covered. And then also we recognized that people have different ways of adopting cloud technology, whether they're doing it internally in private clouds or the generation purely in public or those in between with hybrid. So we definitely have technology coming that allows people to use as much or as little of both of those or simultaneously use both as they would like and make it seamless so that the cloud is just another resource that they're able to drop on."

And then another thing that's critical is sales execution in this area, sales and service execution, where not just -- we started off with North America being the leader, but now we're seeing areas like Japan, the rest of APAC, Europe also doing extremely well with the modules and realizing it's a differentiator. And then the fact that we have our VIPRION chassis solutions, ideal for building more and more modules on the one platform.

First of all, we have 2 major use cases if you will. One of them is really around what we call unified access. And around unified access is the whole concept of ensuring that we know who the user is and we contextually can create an identity of that user, identifying the who, what, when, where and how of what the user's trying to do and then enable him to access those services, whether they be on network or off network. That's a very strong use case we've been getting a lot of market share there, and not just recently as it was reported by Infonetics where we move to the position number 2 from a market share perspective. The other use case that we've been working a lot, which is around project Topaz, is really a web firewall defending your applications. And that is a layer 3 to layer 7 firewall technology, high performance, high throughput, [indiscernible] connection count, high, high concurrent connections. And what that basically has is everything from layer 3 protection all the way to the application and protection. All wrapped up in one solution set. And that by all means is a product that we currently have in the market, highly successful with that market and we're going to continue to create further integration with project Topaz in the next software release. So when you think about the competitors across those 2 different markets. From one end, we're competing against identity bridges and then vendors of that size and the data center firewall will compete against Juniper, Cisco, Palo Alto. But to be perfectly frank, none of those companies have focused on a web solution set. So although they are our competitors, they're not really the right solution in the market at this time."

In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth in what proved to be a challenging macro environment. Revenue of $352.6 million grew 4% from the prior quarter and 21% from the third quarter of last year and was within our guided range of $350 million to $355 million.
GAAP EPS of $0.91 per diluted share was above our guidance of $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.14 per diluted share was at the high end of our $1.12 to $1.14 guided range.  Product revenue of $207.1 million grew 15% year-over-year and represented 59% of total revenue. Service revenue of $145.5 million grew 31% year-over-year and accounted for 41% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was less than 1.
During Q3, our core Application Delivery Networking business accounted for $346.3 million and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $6.3 million. From a geographic perspective, all feeders generated sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. At 57% of total, the Americas grew 22% year-over-year; EMEA accounted for 21% of revenue, an increase of 27% versus Q3 of 2011; APAC represented 15% of the revenue mix, with 17% growth year-over-year; and Japan was 7% of revenue, up 9% over a strong Q3 of 2011.
Looking at our key verticals, telco accounted for 22% of sales. Sales into the finance vertical represented 23% of total; our U.S. Federal business equaled 6% of sales, with total government at 12%; and technology accounted for 16% of total sales.
In Q3, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors: Avnet, which represented 17.3% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 14.8%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.2%. GAAP operating expenses of $182.3 million were within our guided range of $180.5 million to $184.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $161.3 million. GAAP operating margin was 31.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 35.2%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q3, we continued to strengthen our financial position. Cash flow from operations was $113.4 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1.1 billion at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $107.7 million.
DSO at the end of Q3 was 49 days. Inventories were $17 million. Deferred revenue increased 5% sequentially to $433.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.7 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $10.1 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,905 employees, an increase of 100 from the prior quarter.
During Q3, we repurchased approximately 425,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $117.59 per share for a total of $50 million. Approximately $231 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program. 
Looking ahead to Q4. We continue to see the key drivers of our business, including mobile traffic growth, data center consolidation, growth in virtual environments and security concerns, trending in our favor. We see solid growth in our software sales, and we see strong momentum with our security products. We also have an exciting product roadmap that positions us to take advantage of an expanding addressable market. As a result, we continued to believe our prospects for long-term growth remains strong.
That said, the context of a weak global economy lead us to be more cautious in our near-term outlook. With this in mind, our guidance for the current quarter is as follows: Our revenue target for Q4 is $360 million to $370 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to remain strong in the 83% range, including approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $188 million to $195 million, including approximately $24 million of stock-based compensation expense and $200,000 in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.90 to $0.93 per diluted share, and our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.16 to $1.19 per diluted share. We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter.
We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $135 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with our Q3 performance. In a difficult macro environment, we delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 21% and world-class non-GAAP operating margins above 38%, and continued to strengthen our balance sheet with strong cash generation.
Our major sales regions all -- each major sales region produce double-digit sales bookings growth. Our Services business had another stellar quarter, exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue.
Sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were very strong with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 82% from last year. Software module sales during the quarter were also very strong, and the percentage attache rate for our software sales reached a record high in Q3, driven by rapidly accelerating sales of our security software products. Sales of our data center firewall solution grew sequentially over last quarter, and we expect that momentum to continue into next year.
Our security solution portfolio now includes the most comprehensive application firewall solution in the market, the highest performing data center firewall solution for protecting large-scale web-based applications and industry-leading access and policy management solutions. 
I believe that F5 continues to be well positioned to capitalize in major market trends. Our platforms deliver an array of intelligent services for enterprises, service providers and clouds. Our customers use F5's technology as strategic points of control to consolidate functions on our platforms and to design and deploy our dynamic networks to efficiently deal with the ever-increasing challenges presented by the growth in video traffic, evolving and more sophisticated securities threats and adoption of mobile devices.
Our product roadmap contains several growth drivers, including our comprehensive product refresh of all our appliances, which will deliver a very significant price performance advantage to our customers. In addition, performance of our virtual additions for all hypervisor platforms will be tripled. We also are building an 8-slot VIPRION chassis solution which will leverage the centaur blades released in Q3 and set a new bar for layer 4 to 7 performance, so ADC functions, including security and optimization.
The next major release of TMOS contains significant software deliverables including, DPI, DPAC [ph] inspection functionality for the service provider market, as well as a market-leading layer 3 to layer 7 firewall solution. This integrated firewall will be a module available across all F5 platforms, allowing customers to consolidate their current firewall infrastructure while provided unprecedented performance and flexibility by allowing security policies to be applied at the network and the application levels.
The DPI functionality will be another strategic offering to the service provider market. We now have a broad portfolio of solutions for the service provider market, including our recently acquired Diameter signaling products to the management of 4G/LTE and IMS networks, our carrier-grade NAT and IPv6 capability and the steering functionality derived from our sophisticated iRules running on TMOS.
We will also introduce significant updates to our virtualizations and management products which will make it easier for customers to adopt hybrid cloud architectures and optimize the delivery of web-based applications. We continue to focus on delivering to our customers as many application layer decisions per second as possible and using that knowledge to drive orchestration applications, both real and virtual within and across data centers.
We believe these capabilities generate significant value and benefits to our customers and clearly differentiate our technology from that of our competitors. Many companies in this market talk about performance just from throughput perspective or intelligence at the application layer. F5 not only provides the highest bandwidth, but also is the only ADC vendor to deliver application intelligence at network speeds and beyond. 
As traffic and applications continue to become more web centric, I believe the market is rapidly moving towards the F5 sweet spot. Our world-class connection and transaction processing capabilities, combined with high-speed pattern matching, and purpose built hardware enable F5 to deliver advanced solutions for optimization, security and application delivery for many years to come.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see sequential growth this quarter. There is no doubt that we experienced a cautious spending environment last quarter, and we expect that caution to continue into this quarter. Even with these economic headwinds, I remain very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as a strong as it has ever been, and our product roadmap will extend that leadership. We will continue to invest in hiring world-class people to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC market and to enable us to further exploit new expanding market opportunities in cloud-based architectures, the security market and the service provider market.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners, and look forward to their continued support throughout the year. 
We will now hand the call over for Q&A."

We've done some other work there with productizing some of the carrier grade NAT features, and a lot of focus on IPv6 and carrying that forward. So there's a lot of work that's been done there. And, obviously, on the security, a lot of the development that's been done there has been extending essentially what's been done in the past, but really productizing things and adding capabilities around rules, having the new rules language and other things that can be applied not only at the network layer, but at the application layer as well, and then having these things all tied together cleanly in the management framework. So it's a very complete and a very big upgrade to what we've had previously."

Another aspect that we're working on, too, is allowing people to string multiple versions of those together and act as one coherent unit, too. So as we think about many of these larger players and thinking about having a totally software-defined data center, if you will, so everything looks the same inside of it and you're changing the personality of the devices solely by software, we think that we've got a very interesting way to help them do that and utilize our software from that perspective. The other piece that I mentioned, too, is different go-to-market models as well. So we think there are other ways to exploit and take -- better get our products into what I've called the serverless generations. So people coming up with new companies who are not likely to build their own data centers or purchase servers or anything like that. They are just going to be renting infrastructure from various players out there. So I want to make sure we've got that covered. And then also we recognize that people have different ways of adopting cloud technology. And whether they're doing it internally in private clouds or as I've said, the serverless generation purely in a public or those in between, with hybrid. So we definitely have technology coming that allows people to use as much or as little of both of those or simultaneously use both as they would like and make it seamless so that the cloud is just another resource that they're able to draw upon."

I mean, I mentioned security, the application firewall is a very good example in the access policy manager for access. They have 2 very, very strong momentum modules right now. But as we add more modules, like DPI, like the bigger function firewall that's coming, I think you'll see a more module connect. And then the another thing that's critical is sales execution in this area, sales in SE and service execution, where not just -- we started off with North America being the leader, but we're now seeing areas like Japan, the rest of APAC, Europe, also doing extremely well with the modules and realizing it's a differentiator. And then the fact that we have our VIPRION chassis solutions that are ideal for building more and more modules on the one platform. So I do -- I think it's the right strategy, and it should increase the attach rate."

One of them is really around what I would call unified access. And around unified access is the whole concept of ensuring that we know who the user is, and we contextually can create an identity of that user, identifying the who, what, when, where and how of what that user is trying to do and then enable him to access those services, whether they be on network or off network. So that's a very strong use case. We've been gaining a lot of market share there. And just recently, it was reported by Infonetics where we moved to the position #2 from a market share perspective. The other use case that we've been working a lot, which is around project Topaz, is really a web firewall defending your applications. And that is a layer 3 to layer 7 firewall technology, high performance, high throughput, high connection count, high, high concurrent connections. And what that basically has is everything from layer 3 DDoS protection, all the way to application vulnerability protection, all wrapped up in one solution set. And that, by all means, is a product that we currently have in the market, widely successful with that market, and we're going to continue to create further integration with project Topaz in the next software release. So if you think about our competitors across those 2 different market. On one end, we're competing against identity bridges and vendors of that size and in the data center firewall, we'll compete against Juniper, Cisco, Palo Alto. But to be perfectly frank, none of those companies have focused on a web solution set. So although they are competitors, they're not really the right solution in the market at this time."

In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth in what proved to be a challenging macro environment. Revenue of $352.6 million grew 4% from the prior quarter and 21% from the third quarter of last year and was within our guided range of $350 million to $355 million.
GAAP EPS of $0.91 per diluted share was above our guidance of $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.14 per diluted share was at the high end of our $1.12 to $1.14 guided range.  Product revenue of $207.1 million grew 15% year-over-year and represented 59% of total revenue. Service revenue of $145.5 million grew 31% year-over-year and accounted for 41% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was less than 1.
During Q3, our core Application Delivery Networking business accounted for $346.3 million and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $6.3 million. From a geographic perspective, all feeders generated sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. At 57% of total, the Americas grew 22% year-over-year; EMEA accounted for 21% of revenue, an increase of 27% versus Q3 of 2011; APAC represented 15% of the revenue mix, with 17% growth year-over-year; and Japan was 7% of revenue, up 9% over a strong Q3 of 2011.
Looking at our key verticals, telco accounted for 22% of sales. Sales into the finance vertical represented 23% of total; our U.S. Federal business equaled 6% of sales, with total government at 12%; and technology accounted for 16% of total sales.
In Q3, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors: Avnet, which represented 17.3% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 14.8%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.2%. GAAP operating expenses of $182.3 million were within our guided range of $180.5 million to $184.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $161.3 million. GAAP operating margin was 31.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 35.2%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q3, we continued to strengthen our financial position. Cash flow from operations was $113.4 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1.1 billion at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $107.7 million.
DSO at the end of Q3 was 49 days. Inventories were $17 million. Deferred revenue increased 5% sequentially to $433.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.7 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $10.1 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,905 employees, an increase of 100 from the prior quarter.
During Q3, we repurchased approximately 425,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $117.59 per share for a total of $50 million. Approximately $231 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program. 
Looking ahead to Q4. We continue to see the key drivers of our business, including mobile traffic growth, data center consolidation, growth in virtual environments and security concerns, trending in our favor. We see solid growth in our software sales, and we see strong momentum with our security products. We also have an exciting product roadmap that positions us to take advantage of an expanding addressable market. As a result, we continued to believe our prospects for long-term growth remains strong.
That said, the context of a weak global economy lead us to be more cautious in our near-term outlook. With this in mind, our guidance for the current quarter is as follows: Our revenue target for Q4 is $360 million to $370 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to remain strong in the 83% range, including approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $188 million to $195 million, including approximately $24 million of stock-based compensation expense and $200,000 in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.90 to $0.93 per diluted share, and our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.16 to $1.19 per diluted share. We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter.
We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $135 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with our Q3 performance. In a difficult macro environment, we delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 21% and world-class non-GAAP operating margins above 38%, and continued to strengthen our balance sheet with strong cash generation.
Our major sales regions all -- each major sales region produced double-digit sales bookings growth. Our Services business had another stellar quarter, exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue.
Sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were very strong with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 82% from last year. Software module sales during the quarter were also very strong, and the percentage attach rate for our software sales reached a record high in Q3, driven by rapidly accelerating sales of our security software products. Sales of our data center firewall solution grew sequentially over last quarter, and we expect that momentum to continue into next year.
Our security solution portfolio now includes the most comprehensive application firewall solution in the market, the highest performing data center firewall solution for protecting large-scale web-based applications and industry-leading access and policy management solutions. 
I believe that F5 continues to be well positioned to capitalize on major market trends. Our platforms deliver an array of intelligent services for enterprises, service providers and clouds. Our customers use F5's technology as strategic points of control to consolidate functions on our platforms and to design and deploy our dynamic networks to efficiently deal with the ever-increasing challenges presented by the growth in video traffic, evolving and more sophisticated security threats and adoption of mobile devices.
Our product roadmap contains several growth drivers, including our comprehensive product refresh of all our appliances, which will deliver a very significant price performance advantage to our customers. In addition, performance of our virtual additions for all hypervisor platforms will be tripled. We also are building an 8-slot VIPRION chassis solution which will leverage the Centaur Blades released in Q3 and set a new bar for layer 4 to 7 performance, so ADC functions, including security and optimization.
The next major release of TMOS contains significant software deliverables including, DPI, DPAC [ph] inspection functionality for the service provider market, as well as a market-leading layer 3 to layer 7 firewall solution. This integrated firewall will be a module available across all F5 platforms, allowing customers to consolidate their current firewall infrastructure while provided unprecedented performance and flexibility by allowing security policies to be applied at the network and the application levels.
The DPI functionality will be another strategic offering to the service provider market. We now have a broad portfolio of solutions for the service provider market, including our recently acquired Diameter signaling products to the management of 4G/LTE and IMS networks, our carrier-grade NAT and IPv6 capability and the steering functionality derived from our sophisticated iRules running on TMOS.
We will also introduce significant updates to our virtualizations and management products which will make it easier for customers to adopt hybrid cloud architectures and optimize the delivery of web-based applications. We continue to focus on delivering to our customers as many application layer decisions per second as possible and using that knowledge to drive orchestration applications, both real and virtual within and across data centers.
We believe these capabilities generate significant value and benefits to our customers and clearly differentiate our technology from that of our competitors. Many companies in this market talk about performance just from a throughput perspective or intelligence at the application layer. F5 not only provides the highest bandwidth, but also is the only ADC vendor to deliver application intelligence at network speeds and beyond. 
As traffic and applications continue to become more web centric, I believe the market is rapidly moving towards the F5 sweet spot. Our world-class connection and transaction processing capabilities, combined with high-speed pattern matching, and purpose built hardware enable F5 to deliver advanced solutions for optimization, security and application delivery for many years to come.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see sequential growth this quarter. There is no doubt that we experienced a cautious spending environment last quarter, and we expect that caution to continue into this quarter. Even with these economic headwinds, I remain very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as a strong as it has ever been, and our product roadmap will extend that leadership. We will continue to invest in hiring world-class people to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC market and to enable us to further exploit new expanding market opportunities in cloud-based architectures, the security market and the service provider market.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners, and look forward to their continued support throughout the year. 
We will now hand the call over for Q&A."

And, obviously, on the security, a lot of the development that's been done there has been extending essentially what's been done in the past, but really productizing things and adding capabilities around rules, having the new rules language and other things that can be applied not only at the network layer, but at the application layer as well, and then having these things all tied together cleanly in the management framework.

We're giving our customers versions of our products that they can inject into cloud providers themselves.

So one, with the virtual additions themselves, we are going to be increasing the performance. We think we already have great performance within our virtual additions, but we'll crank that up even more. Another aspect that we're working on, too, is allowing people to string multiple versions of those together and act as one coherent unit, too. So as we think about many of these larger players and thinking about having a totally software-defined data center, if you will, so everything looks the same inside of it and you're changing the personality of the devices solely by software, we think that we've got a very interesting way to help them do that and utilize our software from that perspective. The other piece that I mentioned, too, is different go-to-market models as well. So we think there are other ways to exploit and take -- better get our products into what I've called the serverless generation. So people coming up with new companies who are not likely to build their own data centers or purchase servers or anything like that. They are just going to be renting infrastructure from various players out there. So I want to make sure we've got that covered. And then also we recognize that people have different ways of adopting cloud technology. And whether they're doing it internally in private clouds or as I've said, the serverless generation purely in a public or those in between, with hybrid. So we definitely have technology coming that allows people to use as much or as little of both of those or simultaneously use both as they would like and make it seamless so that the cloud is just another resource that they're able to draw upon."

And then the another thing that's critical is sales execution in this area, sales in SE and service execution, where not just -- we started off with North America being the leader, but we're now seeing areas like Japan, the rest of APAC, Europe, also doing extremely well with the modules and realizing it's a differentiator. And then the fact that we have our VIPRION chassis solutions that are ideal for building more and more modules on the one platform.

One of them is really around what I would call unified access. And around unified access is the whole concept of ensuring that we know who the user is, and we contextually can create an identity of that user, identifying the who, what, when, where and how of what that user is trying to do and then enable him to access those services, whether they be on network or off network. So that's a very strong use case. We've been gaining a lot of market share there. And just recently, it was reported by Infonetics where we moved to the position #2 from a market share perspective. The other use case that we've been working a lot, which is around project Topaz, is really a web firewall defending your applications. And that is a layer 3 to layer 7 firewall technology, high performance, high throughput, high connection count, high, high concurrent connections. And what that basically has is everything from layer 3 DDoS protection, all the way to application vulnerability protection, all wrapped up in one solution set. And that, by all means, is a product that we currently have in the market, widely successful with that market, and we're going to continue to create further integration with project Topaz in the next software release. So if you think about the competitors across those 2 different markets. On one end, we're competing against identity bridges and vendors of that size and in the data center firewall, we'll compete against Juniper, Cisco, Palo Alto. But to be perfectly frank, none of those companies have focused on a web solution set. So although they are competitors, they're not really the right solution in the market at this time."

In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth in what proved to be a challenging macro environment. Revenue of $352.6 million grew 4% from the prior quarter and 21% from the third quarter of last year and was within our guided range of $350 million to $355 million.
GAAP EPS of $0.91 per diluted share was above our guidance of $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.14 per diluted share was at the high end of our $1.12 to $1.14 guided range.  Product revenue of $207.1 million grew 15% year-over-year and represented 59% of total revenue. Service revenue of $145.5 million grew 31% year-over-year and accounted for 41% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was less than 1.
During Q3, our core Application Delivery Networking business accounted for $346.3 million and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $6.3 million. From a geographic perspective, all feeders generated sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. At 57% of total, the Americas grew 22% year-over-year; EMEA accounted for 21% of revenue, an increase of 27% versus Q3 of 2011; APAC represented 15% of the revenue mix, with 17% growth year-over-year; and Japan was 7% of revenue, up 9% over a strong Q3 of 2011.
Looking at our key verticals, telco accounted for 22% of sales. Sales into the finance vertical represented 23% of total; our U.S. Federal business equaled 6% of sales, with total government at 12%; and technology accounted for 16% of total sales.
In Q3, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors: Avnet, which represented 17.3% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 14.8%.
Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.2%. GAAP operating expenses of $182.3 million were within our guided range of $180.5 million to $184.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $161.3 million. GAAP operating margin was 31.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 35.2%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34%.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q3, we continued to strengthen our financial position. Cash flow from operations was $113.4 million, contributing to total cash and investments of $1.1 billion at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $107.7 million.
DSO at the end of Q3 was 49 days. Inventories were $17 million. Deferred revenue increased 5% sequentially to $433.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.7 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $10.1 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,905 employees, an increase of 100 from the prior quarter.
During Q3, we repurchased approximately 425,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $117.59 per share for a total of $50 million. Approximately $231 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program. 
Looking ahead to Q4. We continue to see the key drivers of our business, including mobile traffic growth, data center consolidation, growth in virtual environments and security concerns, trending in our favor. We see solid growth in our software sales, and we see strong momentum with our security products. We also have an exciting product roadmap that positions us to take advantage of an expanding addressable market. As a result, we continued to believe our prospects for long-term growth remains strong.
That said, the context of a weak global economy lead us to be more cautious in our near-term outlook. With this in mind, our guidance for the current quarter is as follows: Our revenue target for Q4 is $360 million to $370 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to remain strong in the 83% range, including approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $188 million to $195 million, including approximately $24 million of stock-based compensation expense and $200,000 in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
Our GAAP EPS target is $0.90 to $0.93 per diluted share, and our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.16 to $1.19 per diluted share. We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter.
We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $17 million to $19 million, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $135 million.
With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I was very pleased with our Q3 performance. In a difficult macro environment, we delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 21% and world-class non-GAAP operating margins above 38%, and continued to strengthen our balance sheet with strong cash generation.
Our major sales regions all -- each major sales region produced double-digit sales bookings growth. Our Services business had another stellar quarter, exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue.
Sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were very strong with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 82% from last year. Software module sales during the quarter were also very strong, and the percentage attach rate for our software sales reached a record high in Q3, driven by rapidly accelerating sales of our security software products. Sales of our data center firewall solution grew sequentially over last quarter, and we expect that momentum to continue into next year.
Our security solution portfolio now includes the most comprehensive application firewall solution in the market, the highest performing data center firewall solution for protecting large-scale web-based applications and industry-leading access and policy management solutions. 
I believe that F5 continues to be well positioned to capitalize on major market trends. Our platforms deliver an array of intelligent services for enterprises, service providers and clouds. Our customers use F5's technology as strategic points of control to consolidate functions on our platforms and to design and deploy our dynamic networks to efficiently deal with the ever-increasing challenges presented by the growth in video traffic, evolving and more sophisticated security threats and adoption of mobile devices.
Our product roadmap contains several growth drivers, including our comprehensive product refresh of all our appliances, which will deliver a very significant price performance advantage to our customers. In addition, performance of our virtual additions for all hypervisor platforms will be tripled. We also are building an 8-slot VIPRION chassis solution which will leverage the Centaur Blades released in Q3 and set a new bar for layer 4 to 7 performance, so ADC functions, including security and optimization.
The next major release of TMOS contains significant software deliverables including, DPI, DPAC [ph] inspection functionality for the service provider market, as well as a market-leading layer 3 to layer 7 firewall solution. This integrated firewall will be a module available across all F5 platforms, allowing customers to consolidate their current firewall infrastructure while provided unprecedented performance and flexibility by allowing security policies to be applied at the network and the application levels.
The DPI functionality will be another strategic offering to the service provider market. We now have a broad portfolio of solutions for the service provider market, including our recently acquired Diameter signaling products to the management of 4G/LTE and IMS networks, our carrier-grade NAT and IPv6 capability and the steering functionality derived from our sophisticated iRules running on TMOS.
We will also introduce significant updates to our virtualizations and management products which will make it easier for customers to adopt hybrid cloud architectures and optimize the delivery of web-based applications. We continue to focus on delivering to our customers as many application layer decisions per second as possible and using that knowledge to drive orchestration applications, both real and virtual within and across data centers.
We believe these capabilities generate significant value and benefits to our customers and clearly differentiate our technology from that of our competitors. Many companies in this market talk about performance just from a throughput perspective or intelligence at the application layer. F5 not only provides the highest bandwidth, but also is the only ADC vendor to deliver application intelligence at network speeds and beyond. 
As traffic and applications continue to become more web centric, I believe the market is rapidly moving towards the F5 sweet spot. Our world-class connection and transaction processing capabilities, combined with high-speed pattern matching, and purpose built hardware enable F5 to deliver advanced solutions for optimization, security and application delivery for many years to come.
As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see sequential growth this quarter. There is no doubt that we experienced a cautious spending environment last quarter, and we expect that caution to continue into this quarter. Even with these economic headwinds, I remain very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as a strong as it has ever been, and our product roadmap will extend that leadership. We will continue to invest in hiring world-class people to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC market and to enable us to further exploit new expanding market opportunities in cloud-based architectures, the security market and the service provider market.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners, and look forward to their continued support throughout the year. 
We will now hand the call over for Q&A."

So we expect that to definitely create, say, some good growth refresh opportunities and market share with it. We're very, very talented at doing that. And then along with that, we're also coming out with the new version of TMOS that's got a software functionality with things like the firewall, our full layer 3 to layer 7 firewall product that we think is going to be very, very competitive, along with functionality for the SP provider like DPI.

We've done some other work there with productizing some of the carrier grade NAT features, and a lot of focus on IPv6 and carrying that forward. So there's a lot of work that's been done there. And, obviously, on the security, a lot of the development that's been done there has been extending essentially what's been done in the past, but really productizing things and adding capabilities around rules, having the new rules language and other things that can be applied not only at the network layer, but at the application layer as well, and then having these things all tied together cleanly in the management framework. So it's a very complete and a very big upgrade to what we had previously."

But absolutely -- one of the things that we've been debating internally and just how we do it is in October and certainly in November, the Analyst Day, we're going to find a way of giving you much more visibility to the security sales that we've got. It's not trivial because it's very subjective in nature, but we're going to put a lot of effort into that. And I think you'll -- most people will be pretty impressed by the rate of growth that we're seeing with security."

We think we already have great performance within our virtual additions, but we'll crank that up even more. Another aspect that we're working on, too, is allowing people to string multiple versions of those together and act as one coherent unit, too. So as we think about many of these larger players and thinking about having a totally software-defined data center, if you will, so everything looks the same inside of it and you're changing the personality of the devices solely by software, we think that we've got a very interesting way to help them do that and utilize our software from that perspective. The other piece that I mentioned, too, is different go-to-market models as well. So we think there are other ways to exploit and take -- better get our products into what I've called the serverless generation. So people coming up with new companies who are not likely to build their own data centers or purchase servers or anything like that. They are just going to be renting infrastructure from various players out there. So I want to make sure we've got that covered. And then also we recognize that people have different ways of adopting cloud technology. And whether they're doing it internally in private clouds or as I've said, the serverless generation purely in a public or those in between, with hybrid. So we definitely have technology coming that allows people to use as much or as little of both of those or simultaneously use both as they would like and make it seamless so that the cloud is just another resource that they're able to draw upon."

So that's a very strong use case. We've been gaining a lot of market share there. And just recently, it was reported by Infonetics where we moved to the position #2 from a market share perspective. The other use case that we've been working a lot, which is around project Topaz, is really a web firewall defending your applications.

So if you think about the competitors across those 2 different markets. On one end, we're competing against identity bridges and vendors of that size and in the data center firewall, we'll compete against Juniper, Cisco, Palo Alto. But to be perfectly frank, none of those companies have focused on a web solution set. So although they are competitors, they're not really the right solution in the market at this time."

F5's fiscal 2012 was a year of solid execution in a difficult macroeconomic environment. We were able to achieve 20% revenue growth, maintain world-class operating margins and delivered record earnings and cash flow, while developing products and services that set the stage for several years of continued revenue growth. Following discussion of results for the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2012, we will provide guidance for Q1 2013 and outline our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year.
As a reminder, all non-GAAP numbers excludes stock-based compensation expense and amortization of purchased intangible assets. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included with our press release.
For the fourth quarter of 2012, revenue of $362.6 million was within our guided range of $360 million to $370 million, up 3% from the prior quarter and 15% from the fourth quarter a year ago. Book-to-bill for the quarter was equal to 1. Before our product revenue of $209.7 million, up 6% from the fourth quarter of last year represented 58% of revenue.
Reversed revenue of $152.8 million increased 30% year-over-year and accounted for 42% of revenue. Before revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $356.8 million and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $5.8 million.
On a regional basis, the Americas grew 8% year-over-year and represented 56% of revenue. EMEA, representing 22% of overall revenue, grew 29%. APAC at 15% of revenue, grew 31% and Japan, 7% of revenue, grew 13% from a year ago.
By vertical, telco represented 19% of sales during the quarter. Technology, 17% and financial, 20%. Total government was 17% of sales, including 10% from U.S. federal.
During Q4, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors, Avnet Technologies, which accounted for 16.8% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which represented 12.8%.
Continuing down the income statement, GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 82.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84%. Operating expenses of $188 million were at the low end of our $188 million to $195 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $164.6 million.
GAAP operating margin was 30.8% non-GAAP operating margin was 38.6%. Other income for the quarter was $900,000.
The company's GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the quarter reflect a higher than expected effective tax rate. This resulted from a higher than expected impact of foreign permanent tax differences and a higher blended effective state tax rate, which increased our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to 39.9%, above our expectation of 35.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 37% above our 34% expectation. This higher than anticipated tax rates had an impact of approximately $0.06 to GAAP EPS and $0.05 to non-GAAP EPS.
Reflecting the higher tax rate for the quarter, GAAP net income for Q4 was $67.7 million or $0.85 per diluted share, below our guided range of $0.90 to $0.93. Non-GAAP net income was $88.7 million or $1.12 per diluted share also below our guided range of $1.16 to $1.19.
Revenue for all fiscal 2012 was $1.38 billion, up 20% from fiscal 2011. GAAP net income for fiscal 2012 was $275.2 million or $3.45 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $348.6 million or $4.37 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $148.6 million in cash flow from operations which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.19 billion at year end. For all of fiscal 2012, cash flow from operations totaled $495 million.
DSO was 46 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $17.4 million. Deferred revenue increased 30% year-over-year to $447.3 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $11.3 million.
During the quarter, we added 125 employees ending then the year with approximately 3,030 full-time employees. For the fiscal year, we added 540 employees an increase of 22%.
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 514,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $97.29 per share for a total of $50 million. Approximately $180 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '13 outlook. We are awaiting a number of factors is we determine guidance for Q1 and assess our growth prospects for fiscal year '13. As you have referenced several times over the year, we do anticipate typical fiscal Q1 seasonality. We also recognize that our short-term visibility continues to be limited by the macro economic uncertainty, which caused many of our customers to slow our reduced spending in the second half of fiscal 2012, particularly in the case of larger million dollar-plus type opportunities.
At the same time, we are anticipating a very positive perceptions of the new products and platforms that we will be introducing in fiscal 2013. Throughout the year, we are rolling out a powerful lineup of new hardware platforms, software products and significant performance increases to our virtual products that will drive new and increased growth for F5. We also see momentum building in customer engagements for our Diameter Signaling products and the traffic's acquisition and believe this will drive material revenue in fiscal year '13.
Lastly, we see a very real market share opportunity with the recent announcement from Cisco to cease development of its a's product line and we're being very aggressive in our efforts to capture this opportunity.
In consideration of these factors for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we are targeting revenue in the range of $363 million to $370 million. We are forecasting GAAP gross margins to remains and 83% range, including approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We estimate GAAP operating expense of $193.5 million to $198.5 million, including approximately $25.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% for the quarter and the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
The Q1 GAAP earnings target is $0.86 to $0.88 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.14 to $1.16 per share. We expect DSO in the mid- to high 40 range. We anticipate inventories in the range of $17 million to $19 million. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 100 employees during the quarter. And we believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $145 million.
For fiscal 2013, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows: We expect to see sequential revenue growth throughout the year with more robust product growth in the back half of the year as demand builds related to our forthcoming product refresh and new security and service providers software modules. We anticipate GAAP gross margins consistent with our Q1 guidance of 83%. We are targeting non-GAAP operating margins for the year to be at or around 38%, with some seasonal fluctuation is margins will be a bit lower in the first half and stronger in the second half.
We expect stock-based compensation expense to approximate Q1 levels until our next annual grant in August. Capital expenditures are expected to be $6 million to $12 million per quarter with some quarter-to-quarter variability related to investments.
Inconsistent with Q1, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 37% on a GAAP basis, 34.5% on the non-GAAP basis throughout the year. These tax assumptions do not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
As John mentioned, we will be holding our analyst investor meeting at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York on November 15. We look forward to seeing you there. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I'll take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2012, talk in more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going at the fiscal 2013.I was",1245,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2012, talk in more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going at the fiscal 2013.
I was very pleased with the F5 team's performance in fiscal 2012. In spite of a difficult macroeconomic environment, especially in the second half of the year, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 20% with world-class non-GAAP operating margins above 38%. We accomplished this while investing significantly in additional headcount increasing our tools and the headcount by 404 employees ending the year with a total of 3,030 employees. We exited fiscal 2012 with the stable of balance sheet with almost $1.2 billion in cash and investments and no debt, and repurchased $185 million of common stock during the year.
Sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were particularly strong with year-over-year growth of 107% driven by strong adoption of the midrange VIPRION 2400 system, as well as sales of the high-end VIPRION systems into the service provider market.
In addition, our overall software sales increased by 58% driven by a significant increase in software module a tax rates and strong growth in sales of the software-only versions of our product portfolio. The growth in our softer tax rates clearly benefits our business model and is also critical to our market expansion strategy. We have made tremendous progress in expanding our opportunities into key markets, including security, service provider and cloud-based architectures.
In security, we now are the most comprehensive integrated solution in the industry that includes our application firewall, ESM, and our remote access solution, APM.
Software revenues from a security module with approximately $55 million last year, up 90% from the previous year. This is software-only revenue and doesn't include the service revenue the associated BIG-IP of VIPRION hardware incremental ADC revenue of any of the revenue from the data center firewall solution.
In the service provider market, our ability to deliver intelligent policy enforcement at world class performance levels, continues to be a key capability for managing the challenge of every expanding increase in mobile data. Our high-end VIPRION platform combined with the application fluency of TMOS and the flexibility of features like high rules, gives service providers a unique opportunity to build value-added services.
We also made good progress with sales, firewall IPv6 and traffic seeing solutions. I'm also very pleased with the progress we are making with the acquisition of Traffix Systems that was completed in mid-2012 the traffic Steve is world-class and the have them as part of our family as we mentioned last quarter we believe the opportunity where the traffic diameter base solutions will prove to be both significant and strategic to our overall service provider business. The traffic pipeline has been growing nicely. Our service providers rollout that LTE architectures and adopt Diameter as a standard signaling protocol. I'll talk more about this when I discuss our fiscal 2013 opportunities.
Our Services business delivered strong performance consistently throughout fiscal 2012, and continued to be a significant profit and revenue growth contributor while maintaining customer satisfaction at world class levels. The attach rate of service to product sales continues to improve and we once again experienced excellent renewal rates. We also continue to grow consulting business which increases customer satisfaction and drive additional product revenue. As far as Q4 is concerned, I'm very pleased with our results. We delivered 15% year-over-year growth in spite of a cautious spending environment. From a geographic perspective, both EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, have solid sales growth. In North America, we saw a reasonable sales growth for orders up to $1 million in size, but a drop-off in sales orders above $1 million as customers postponed last purchases or reduced the size of the purchase order. 
Overall, Q4 financial performance was very strong quarter the cash, free cash flow was over $137 million, a record for the company. And our non-GAAP operating margins remains solid at 38.6%. Our Services business completed the year with another strong quarter and a very healthy deferred revenue balance moving into fiscal 2013.
As far as the outlook is concerned, it is appropriate to be cautious given the very conservative spending environment we saw in the second half of fiscal 2012. Having said that, we believe we have a number of exciting opportunities coming in fiscal 2013 to drive our revenue growth and we plan to continue to invest in our business just to take advantage of those opportunities.
We increased our salesforce in 2012 by approximately 20% and we expect to see the benefits of this investment throughout the year. We have a clear and growing leadership position in the ADC market our goal is the continued expanding an addressable market and further increase our market share by developing a broad array of integrated solutions running on industry-leading platforms.
During the next 2 quarters, we will be delivering our largest appliance refresh in 4 years. Our next release of TMOS includes a number of new security and service provider operations as well as products to enable architectures. For example, we will be releasing the industry's first application delivery firewall, ADF, that integrates level 3 to level 7 security including DDoS prevention and unique application fluency to prevent sophisticated application attacks.
ADS provides performance metrics clearly superior to those offered by our competitors. We will also be delivering the industry's broadest range of hypervisor support at world class performance levels. For the service provider market, we will be delivering additional carrier grade NAT functionality and a new software module, as well as a policy enforcement module with EPI classification technology.
Additionally, we expect to release a new 8-swap of our VIPRION that will leverage the PB 300 blaze released last quarter, and effectively doubled the unmatched performance of VIPRION 4480, our current high-end platform.
As I mentioned earlier, we also expect to benefit from the rollout of LTE infrastructures with our Traffix Systems signaling delivery controller and Diameter solutions. The pipeline for these products is building steadily, and we're seeing a fairly large uptick in RFP and proof of concept requests. F5 has the opportunity to be a leader in this area which will not only provide growth opportunities over the next 3 years but should also significantly enhance our position as a strategic supplier to global service providers. We will review our product roadmap deliverables as well as our market initiatives in more detail at the Analyst Investor Meeting in November.
Andy provided our projected revenue range as well as some of the high-level expectations for fiscal 2013. As I mentioned several times over the last couple of years, we expect to see some seasonality in our business during Q1. The first quarter seasonality which is normal in the technology market and in landed our peers is reflected in our guidance.
Acceleration of product revenue growth is the major financial goal for fiscal 2013. I remain very optimistic about the future side as we enter fiscal 2013. We enjoy a very strong competitive position and I believe our fiscal 2013 product deliverables are the most comprehensive we have seen in several years. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and their partners for their tremendous efforts last year and I look forward to discontinue support in fiscal 2013.
And with that, will now hand the call over for Q&A."

F5's fiscal 2012 was a year of solid execution in a difficult macroeconomic environment. We were able to achieve 20% revenue growth, maintain world-class operating margins and delivered record earnings and cash flow, while developing products and services that set the stage for several years of continued revenue growth. Following discussion of results for the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2012, we will provide guidance for Q1 2013 and outline our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year.
As a reminder, all non-GAAP numbers excludes stock-based compensation expense and amortization of purchased intangible assets. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included with our press release.
For the fourth quarter of 2012, revenue of $362.6 million was within our guided range of $360 million to $370 million, up 3% from the prior quarter and 15% from the fourth quarter a year ago. Book-to-bill for the quarter was equal to 1. Q4 product revenue of $209.7 million, up 6% from the fourth quarter of last year represented 58% of revenue.
Service revenue of $152.8 million increased 30% year-over-year and accounted for 42% of revenue. Q4 revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $356.8 million and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $5.8 million.
On a regional basis, the Americas grew 8% year-over-year and represented 56% of revenue. EMEA, representing 22% of overall revenue, grew 29%; APAC, at 15% of revenue, grew 31%; and Japan, 7% of revenue, grew 13% from a year ago.
By vertical, telco represented 19% of sales during the quarter; technology, 17%; and financial, 20%. Total government was 17% of sales, including 10% from U.S. federal.
During Q4, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors: Avnet Technologies, which accounted for 16.8% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which represented 12.8%.
Continuing down the income statement, GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 82.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84%. Operating expenses of $188 million were at the low end of our $188 million to $195 million guided range. And non-GAAP operating expenses were $164.6 million.
GAAP operating margin was 30.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.6%. Other income for the quarter was $900,000.
The company's GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the quarter reflect a higher than expected effective tax rate. This resulted from a higher than expected impact of foreign permanent tax differences and a higher blended effective state tax rate, which increased our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to 39.9%, above our expectation of 35.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 37% above our 34% expectation. This higher than anticipated tax rates had an impact of approximately $0.06 to GAAP EPS and $0.05 to non-GAAP EPS.
Reflecting the higher tax rate for the quarter, GAAP net income for Q4 was $67.7 million or $0.85 per diluted share, below our guided range of $0.90 to $0.93. Non-GAAP net income was $88.7 million or $1.12 per diluted share also below our guided range of $1.16 to $1.19.
Revenue for all fiscal 2012 was $1.38 billion, up 20% from fiscal 2011. GAAP net income for fiscal 2012 was $275.2 million or $3.45 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $348.6 million or $4.37 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $148.6 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.19 billion at year end. For all of fiscal 2012, cash flow from operations totaled $495 million.
DSO was 46 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $17.4 million. Deferred revenue increased 30% year-over-year to $447.3 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $11.3 million.
During the quarter, we added 125 employees, ending then the year with approximately 3,030 full-time employees. For the fiscal year, we added 540 employees, an increase of 22%.
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 514,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $97.29 per share for a total of $50 million. Approximately, $180 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '13 outlook. We are awaiting a number of factors as we determine guidance for Q1 and assess our growth prospects for fiscal year '13. As we have referenced several times over the year, we do anticipate typical fiscal Q1 seasonality. We also recognize that our short-term visibility continues to be limited by the macro economic uncertainty, which caused many of our customers to slow or reduce spending in the second half of fiscal 2012, particularly in the case of larger million dollar-plus type opportunities.
At the same time, we are anticipating a very positive reception of the new products and platforms that we will be introducing in fiscal 2013. Throughout the year, we are rolling out a powerful lineup of new hardware platforms, software products and significant performance increases to our virtual products that will drive new and increased growth for F5. We also see momentum building in customer engagements for our Diameter Signaling products from the Traffix acquisition and believe this will drive material revenue in fiscal year '13.
Lastly, we see a very real market share opportunity with the recent announcement from Cisco to cease development of its ACE product line and we are being very aggressive in our efforts to capture this opportunity.
In consideration of these factors for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we are targeting revenue in the range of $363 million to $370 million. We are forecasting GAAP gross margins to remain in the 83% range, including approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We estimate GAAP operating expense of $193.5 million to $198.5 million, including approximately $25.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $0.86 to $0.88 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.14 to $1.16 per share. We expect DSO in the mid- to high-40-day range. We anticipate inventories in the range of $17 million to $19 million. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 100 employees during the quarter. And we believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $145 million.
For fiscal 2013, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows: We expect to see sequential revenue growth throughout the year with more robust product growth in the back half of the year as demand builds related to our forthcoming product refresh and new security and service providers software modules. We anticipate GAAP gross margins consistent with our Q1 guidance of 83%. We are targeting non-GAAP operating margins for the year to be at or around 38%, with some seasonal fluctuation is margins will be a bit lower in the first half and stronger in the second half.
We expect stock-based compensation expense to approximate Q1 levels until our next annual grant in August. Capital expenditures are expected to be $6 million to $12 million per quarter with some quarter-to-quarter variability related to investments.
Inconsistent with Q1, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 37% on a GAAP basis and 34.5% on the non-GAAP basis throughout the year. These tax assumptions do not assume a reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
As John mentioned, we will be holding our Analyst Investor Meeting at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York on November 15. We look forward to seeing you there. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I'll take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2012, talk in more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going at the fiscal 2013.I was",1254,"Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2012, talk in more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going at the fiscal 2013.
I was very pleased with the F5 team's performance in fiscal 2012. In spite of a difficult macroeconomic environment, especially in the second half of the year, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 20% with world-class non-GAAP operating margins above 38%. We accomplished this while investing significantly in additional headcount increasing our total net headcount by 540 employees, ending the year with a total of 3,030 employees. We exited fiscal 2012 with a stable balance sheet with almost $1.2 billion in cash and investments and no debt, having purchased $185 million of our common stock during the year.
Sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were particularly strong with year-over-year growth of 107% driven by strong adoption of the midrange VIPRION 2400 system, as well as sales of the high-end VIPRION systems into the service provider market.
In addition, our overall software sales increased by 58% driven by a significant increase in software module attach rates and strong growth in sales of the software-only versions of our product portfolio. The growth in our software attach rate clearly benefits our business model and is also critical to our market expansion strategy. We have made tremendous progress in expanding our opportunities into key markets, including security, service provider and cloud-based architectures.
In security, we now have the most comprehensive integrated solution in the industry that includes our application firewall, ESM; and our remote access solution, APM.
Software revenue from our security modules was approximately $55 million last year, up 90% from the previous year. This is software-only revenue and doesn't include the service revenue, the associated BIG-IP or VIPRION hardware, incremental ADC revenue or any of the revenue from the data center firewall solution.
In the service provider market, our ability to deliver intelligent policy enforcement at world-class performance levels continues to be a key capability for managing the challenge of every expanding increase in mobile data. Our high-end VIPRION platform combined with the application fluency of TMOS and the flexibility of features like iRules gives service providers a unique opportunity to build value-added services.
We also made good progress with sales of Carrier-grade NAT, firewall IPv6 and traffic-seeing solutions. I'm also very pleased with the progress we are making with the acquisition of Traffix Systems that was completed in mid-fiscal 2012 the Traffix team is world-class and we are proud to have them as part of the F5 family. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we believe the opportunity where the Traffix Diameter Base solutions will prove to be both significant and strategic to our overall service provider business. The Traffix pipeline has been growing nicely. Our service providers rollout their LTE architectures and adopt Diameter as a standard signaling protocol. I'll talk more about this when I discuss our fiscal 2013 opportunities.
Our Services business delivered strong performance consistently throughout fiscal 2012, and continued to be a significant profit and revenue growth contributor while maintaining customer satisfaction at world class levels. The attach rate of service to product sales continues to improve and we once again experienced excellent renewal rates. We also continue to grow a consulting business, which increases customer satisfaction and drives additional product revenue. As far as Q4 is concerned, I'm very pleased with our results. We delivered 15% year-over-year growth in spite of a cautious spending environment. From a geographic perspective, both EMEA and our Asia Pacific regions, have solid sales bookings growth. In North America, we saw a reasonable sales growth for orders up to $1 million in size, but a drop-off in sales orders above $1 million, as customers' postponed last purchases have reduced the size of the purchase order. 
Overall, our Q4 financial performance was very strong. Quarterly, cash, free cash flow was over $137 million, a record for the company. And our non-GAAP operating margins remained solid at 38.6%. Our Services business completed the year with another strong quarter and a very healthy deferred revenue balance moving into fiscal 2013.
As far as the outlook is concerned, it is appropriate to be cautious given the very conservative spending environment we saw in the second half of fiscal 2012. Having said that, we believe we have a number of exciting opportunities coming in fiscal 2013 to drive our revenue growth and we plan to continue to invest in our business to take advantage of those opportunities.
We increased our sales force in 2012 by approximately 20% and we expect to see the benefits of this investment throughout the year. We have a clear and growing leadership position in the ADC market. Our goal is the continue expanding our addressable market and further increase our market share by developing a broad array of integrated solutions running on industry-leading platforms.
During the next 2 quarters, we will be delivering our largest appliance refresh in 4 years. Our next release of TMOS includes a number of new security and service provider offerings, as well as products to enable cloud architectures. For example, we will be releasing the industry's first application delivery firewall, ADF, that integrates level 3 to level 7 security including DDoS prevention and unique application fluency to prevent sophisticated application attacks.
ADS provides performance metrics clearly superior to those offered by our competitors. We will also be delivering the industry's broadest range of hypervisor support at world-class performance levels. For the service provider market, we will be delivering additional Carrier-Grade NAT functionality and a new software module, as well as a policy enforcement module with DPI classification technology.
Additionally, we expect to release a new 8-slot version of our VIPRION that will leverage the PB300 blaze [ph] released last quarter, and effectively doubled the unmatched performance of VIPRION 4480, our current high-end platform.
As I mentioned earlier, we also expect to benefit from the rollout of LTE infrastructures with our Traffix System's signaling delivery controller and Diameter solutions. The pipeline for these products is building steadily, and we're seeing a fairly large uptick in RFP and proof of concept requests. 
F5 has the opportunity to be a leader in this area, which will not only provide growth opportunities over the next 3 years but should also significantly enhance our position as a strategic supplier to global service providers. We will review our product roadmap deliverables as well as our market initiatives in more detail at the Analyst Investor Meeting in November.
Andy provided our projected revenue range as well as some of the high-level expectations for fiscal 2013. As I mentioned several times over the last couple of years, we expect to see some seasonality in our business during Q1. The first quarter seasonality, which is normal in the technology market and in line with our peers, is reflected in our guidance.
Acceleration of product revenue growth is the major financial goal for fiscal 2013. I remain very optimistic about the future of F5 as we enter fiscal 2013. We enjoy a very strong competitive position and I believe our fiscal 2013 product deliverables are the most comprehensive we have seen in several years. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their tremendous efforts last year and I look forward to their continued support in fiscal 2013.
And with that, will now hand the call over for Q&A."

We've already seen a number of face-to-face meetings take place. We've had just lots of interest around it. Cisco is doing roughly $200 million in run rate per year in sales, plus they have a pretty significant install base over the year, starting local director and all products that they've had over time. So we've got some great incentives for our customers and partners. So we have our channel involved in this as well. And then, also, I think in the short term, it's important to know that the activities that Cisco have going together are purely of a reference in the nature. So there's always challenges with the sales force alignment, competition and then how incentive will level those people be. So our challenge with Cisco over time has been getting invited to the party. And if we do get invited, we do very, very well and clearly there are people that we're are at the party and are asking us to come and participate. So we're, as John said, very bullish on it."

And I'm trying to get an understanding whether you think there is the possibility that, that creates a pause in demand from your customers number one. And number two, and maybe that's one of the reasons your large deal flow has somewhat slowed or been delayed or not closing as quickly. And second, John, when you talk to customers, how much of a concern is there from the elections and the potential fiscal cliff in February? Could it be that this delay in business could last through actually the March timeframe? why isn't that more of a logical assumption?"

That is significantly different than taking the traditional firewall than trying to apply Layer 7 intelligence to it. So putting a load balancer inside a firewall is a complicated issue. You almost have to have the right platform from the foundation. What we've done is we've built the right platform starting with some availability services, and then put security services in it. So we think we have a leadership position. The data will prove that out when we announce it later in this year.

F5's fiscal 2012 was a year of solid execution in a difficult macroeconomic environment. We were able to achieve 20% revenue growth, maintain world-class operating margins and delivered record earnings and cash flow, while developing products and services that set the stage for several years of continued revenue growth. Following discussion of results for the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2012, we will provide guidance for Q1 2013 and outline our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year.
As a reminder, all non-GAAP numbers exclude stock-based compensation expense and amortization of purchased intangible assets. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included with our press release.
For the fourth quarter of 2012, revenue of $362.6 million was within our guided range of $360 million to $370 million, up 3% from the prior quarter and 15% from the fourth quarter a year ago. Book-to-bill for the quarter was equal to 1. Q4 product revenue of $209.7 million, up 6% from the fourth quarter of last year represented 58% of revenue.
Service revenue of $152.8 million increased 30% year-over-year and accounted for 42% of revenue. Q4 revenue from our core Application Delivery Networking business was $356.8 million and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $5.8 million.
On a regional basis, the Americas grew 8% year-over-year and represented 56% of revenue. EMEA, representing 22% of overall revenue, grew 29%; APAC, at 15% of revenue, grew 31%; and Japan, 7% of revenue, grew 13% from a year ago.
By vertical, telco represented 19% of sales during the quarter; technology, 17%; and financial, 20%. Total government was 17% of sales, including 10% from U.S. federal.
During Q4, we had 2 greater than 10% distributors: Avnet Technologies, which accounted for 16.8% of total revenue; and Ingram Micro, which represented 12.8%.
Continuing down the income statement, GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 82.7%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84%. Operating expenses of $188 million were at the low end of our $188 million to $195 million guided range. And non-GAAP operating expenses were $164.6 million.
GAAP operating margin was 30.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.6%. Other income for the quarter was $900,000.
The company's GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the quarter reflect a higher than expected effective tax rate. This resulted from a higher than expected impact of foreign permanent tax differences and a higher blended effective state tax rate, which increased our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to 39.9%, above our expectation of 35.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 37% above our 34% expectation. These higher than anticipated tax rates had an impact of approximately $0.06 to GAAP EPS and $0.05 to non-GAAP EPS.
Reflecting the higher tax rate for the quarter, GAAP net income for Q4 was $67.7 million or $0.85 per diluted share, below our guided range of $0.90 to $0.93. Non-GAAP net income was $88.7 million or $1.12 per diluted share, also below our guided range of $1.16 to $1.19.
Revenue for all fiscal 2012 was $1.38 billion, up 20% from fiscal 2011. GAAP net income for fiscal 2012 was $275.2 million or $3.45 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $348.6 million or $4.37 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $148.6 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.19 billion at year end. For all of fiscal 2012, cash flow from operations totaled $495 million.
DSO was 46 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $17.4 million. Deferred revenue increased 30% year-over-year to $447.3 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $11.3 million.
During the quarter, we added 125 employees, ending the year with approximately 3,030 full-time employees. For the fiscal year, we added 540 employees, an increase of 22%.
In Q4, we repurchased approximately 514,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $97.29 per share for a total of $50 million. Approximately $180 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.
Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '13 outlook. We are weighing a number of factors as we determine guidance for Q1 and assess our growth prospects for fiscal year '13. As we have referenced several times over the year, we do anticipate typical fiscal Q1 seasonality. We also recognize that our short-term visibility continues to be limited by the macroeconomic uncertainty, which caused many of our customers to slow or reduce spending in the second half of fiscal 2012, particularly in the case of larger million-dollar-plus type opportunities.
At the same time, we are anticipating a very positive reception to the new products and platforms that we will be introducing in fiscal 2013. Throughout the year, we are rolling out a powerful lineup of new hardware platforms, software products and significant performance increases to our virtual products that will drive new and increased growth for F5. We also see momentum building in customer engagements for our Diameter Signaling products from the Traffix acquisition and believe this will drive material revenue in fiscal year '13.
Lastly, we see a very real market share opportunity with the recent announcement from Cisco to cease development of its ACE product line and we are being very aggressive in our efforts to capture this opportunity.
In consideration of these factors for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we are targeting revenue in the range of $363 million to $370 million. We are forecasting GAAP gross margins to remain in the 83% range, including approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.
We estimate GAAP operating expense of $193.5 million to $198.5 million, including approximately $25.5 million of stock-based compensation expense. We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%.
Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $0.86 to $0.88 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.14 to $1.16 per share. We expect DSO in the mid- to high-40-day range. We anticipate inventories in the range of $17 million to $19 million. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 100 employees during the quarter. And we believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $145 million.
For fiscal 2013, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows: We expect to see sequential revenue growth throughout the year with more robust product growth in the back half of the year as demand builds related to our forthcoming product refresh and new security and service provider software modules. We anticipate GAAP gross margins consistent with our Q1 guidance of 83%. We are targeting non-GAAP operating margins for the year to be at or around 38%, with some seasonal fluctuation as margins will be a bit lower in the first half and stronger in the second half.
We expect stock-based compensation expense to approximate Q1 levels until our next annual grant in August. Capital expenditures are expected to be $6 million to $12 million per quarter with some quarter-to-quarter variability related to investments.
And consistent with Q1, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 37% on a GAAP basis and 34.5% on a non-GAAP basis throughout the year. These tax assumptions do not assume a reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
As John mentioned, we will be holding our Analyst Investor Meeting at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York on November 15. We look forward to seeing you there. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam."

I'll take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2012, talk in more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going into fiscal 2013.
I was very pleased with the F5 team's performance in fiscal 2012. In spite of a difficult macroeconomic environment, especially in the second half of the year, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 20% with world-class non-GAAP operating margins above 38%. We accomplished this while investing significantly in additional headcount, increasing our total net headcount by 540 employees, ending the year with a total of 3,030 employees. We exited fiscal 2012 with a stable balance sheet with almost $1.2 billion in cash and investments and no debt, having purchased $185 million of our common stock during the year.
Sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were particularly strong with year-over-year growth of 107% driven by strong adoption of the midrange VIPRION 2400 system, as well as sales of the high-end VIPRION systems into the service provider market.
In addition, our overall software sales increased by 58% driven by a significant increase in software module attach rates and strong growth in sales of the software-only versions of our product portfolio. The growth in our software attach rate clearly benefits our business model and is also critical to our market expansion strategy. We have made tremendous progress in expanding our opportunities into key markets, including security, service provider and cloud-based architectures.
In security, we now have the most comprehensive integrated solution in the industry that includes our application firewall, ASM, and our remote access solution, APM.
Software revenue from our security modules was approximately $55 million last year, up 90% from the previous year. This is software-only revenue and doesn't include the service revenue, the associated BIG-IP or VIPRION hardware, incremental ADC revenue or any of the revenue from the data center firewall solution.
In the service provider market, our ability to deliver intelligent policy enforcement at world-class performance levels continues to be a key capability for managing the challenge of ever-expanding increase in mobile data. Our high-end VIPRION platform combined with the application fluency of TMOS and the flexibility of features like iRules gives service providers a unique opportunity to build value-added services.
We also made good progress with sales of carrier-grade NAT, firewall, IPv6 and traffic-seeing solutions. I'm also very pleased with the progress we are making with the acquisition of Traffix Systems that was completed mid-fiscal 2012. The Traffix team is world-class and we are proud to have them as part of the F5 family. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we believe the opportunity with the Traffix Diameter Base solutions will prove to be both significant and strategic to our overall service provider business. The Traffix pipeline has been growing nicely as service providers roll out their LTE architectures and adopt Diameter as a standard signaling protocol. I'll talk more about this when I discuss our fiscal 2013 opportunities.
Our Services business delivered strong performance consistently throughout fiscal 2012, and continued to be a significant profit and revenue growth contributor while maintaining customer satisfaction at world-class levels. The attach rate of service to product sales continues to improve and we once again experienced excellent renewal rates. We also continue to grow a consulting business, which increases customer satisfaction and drives additional product revenue. As far as Q4 is concerned, I'm very pleased with our results. We delivered 15% year-over-year growth in spite of a cautious spending environment. From a geographic perspective, both EMEA and our Asia Pacific regions have solid sales bookings growth. In North America, we saw reasonable sales growth for orders up to $1 million in size, but a drop-off in sales orders above $1 million, as customers postponed large purchases or reduced the size of the purchase order. 
Overall, our Q4 financial performance was very strong. Quarterly, cash -- free cash flow was over $137 million, a record for the company. And our non-GAAP operating margins remained solid at 38.6%. Our Services business completed the year with another strong quarter and a very healthy deferred revenue balance moving into fiscal 2013.
As far as the outlook is concerned, it is appropriate to be cautious given the very conservative spending environment we saw in the second half of fiscal 2012. Having said that, we believe we have a number of exciting opportunities coming in fiscal 2013 to drive our revenue growth and we plan to continue to invest in our business to take advantage of those opportunities.
We increased our sales force in 2012 by approximately 20% and we expect to see the benefits of this investment throughout the year. We have a clear and growing leadership position in the ADC market. Our goal is to continue expanding our addressable market and further increase our market share by developing a broad array of integrated solutions running on industry-leading platforms.
During the next 2 quarters, we will be delivering our largest appliance refresh in 4 years. Our next release of TMOS includes a number of new security and service provider offerings, as well as products to enable cloud architectures. For example, we will be releasing the industry's first application delivery firewall, ADF, that integrates level 3 to level 7 security including DDoS prevention and unique application fluency to prevent sophisticated application attacks.
ADF provides performance metrics clearly superior to those offered by our competitors. We will also be delivering the industry's broadest range of hypervisor support at world-class performance levels. For the service provider market, we will be delivering additional carrier-grade NAT functionality and a new software module, as well as a policy enforcement module with DPI classification technology.
Additionally, we expect to release a new 8-slot version of our VIPRION that will leverage the PB300 blades released last quarter and effectively double the unmatched performance of VIPRION 4480, our current high-end platform.
As I mentioned earlier, we also expect to benefit from the rollout of LTE infrastructures with our Traffix Systems' signaling delivery controller and Diameter solutions. The pipeline for these products is building steadily, and we're seeing a fairly large uptick in RFP and proof of concept requests. 
F5 has the opportunity to be a leader in this area, which will not only provide growth opportunities over the next 3 years but should also significantly enhance our position as a strategic supplier to global service providers. We will review our product roadmap deliverables as well as our market initiatives in more detail at the Analyst Investor Meeting in November.
Andy provided our projected revenue range as well as some of the high-level expectations for fiscal 2013. As I mentioned several times over the last couple of years, we expect to see some seasonality in our business during Q1. The first quarter seasonality, which is normal in the technology market and in line with our peers, is reflected in our guidance.
Acceleration of product revenue growth is the major financial goal for fiscal 2013. I remain very optimistic about the future of F5 as we enter fiscal 2013. We enjoy a very strong competitive position, and I believe our fiscal 2013 product deliverables are the most comprehensive we have seen in several years. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their tremendous efforts last year and I look forward to their continued support in fiscal 2013.
And with that, will now hand the call over for Q&A."

And frankly -- and this is what load balance can be so generic in meaning. What we have, remember, is a session-based, dual proxy that basically just doesn't do packet load balancing, and so we can do it at incredible speeds and we have the application fluency associated with that. So we don't see that. One of the things I said when I did my introduction was I mentioned our application delivery firewall is going to have performance above the competitors. We are talking about very significant performance and I think that, that and the functionality of our application fluency in areas like that, the performances, in fact, price performance is going to be a major advantage for us."

And John highlighted it. We have this full proxy capability into our device. When we orchestrated our technology, whether it be hardware or software, it has a Layer 7 full proxy, which allows us to move through the protocol stack and then add additional services in one passthrough through the device, at a session layer. That is significantly different than taking a traditional firewall and trying to apply Layer 7 intelligence to it. So putting a load balancer inside a firewall is a complicated issue. You almost have to have the right platform from the foundation. What we've done is we've built the right platform starting with some availability services, and then put security services in it. So we think we have a leadership position. The data will prove that out when we announce it later in this year. And I think you'll see some performance characteristics that are just orders of magnitude greater than anything in the market."

Obviously, appreciate the insight, it helps us look at the core business as well. And then the question is more on SDN. Given there's been a lot of investor debate. There's obviously a potential for an architectural shift here to occur, whereby you could write applications to a controller to serve the same function that some of the physical appliances are playing in the network. Some argue that it could even go as far as load balancers, firewalls as we look out over 5 years. So one, Karl, I'd like to get your insight into if you think that's even remotely possible? And two, if it is, how you guys participate?"

But the one great thing about our platform is our platform has already a separation of data plane and control plane. Consequently, it's very well-suited to play in an SDN environment. And what you'll see as we enhance to support the SDN protocol whether it be VXLAN, NVGRE and/or OpenFlow, we'll stick in those SDN installations, if you will, and be able to provide services. So customers who are used to traditional F5's services will be able to carry those services forward in a hybrid environment, and we'll go through it in a lot of detail."
