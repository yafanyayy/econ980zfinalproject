Welcome to our First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. And thank you for your interest in WPX Energy. Our key takeaways from today's call when we finish is remind everybody we have premier portfolio; we have very strong production growth in oi",3144,"Thank you, David. Welcome to our First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. And thank you for your interest in WPX Energy. Our key takeaways from today's call when we finish is remind everybody we have premier portfolio; we have very strong production growth in oil and natural gas liquids; and when the commodity environment is right, we can also do that in natural gas. We have an existing portfolio of 18.5 tcf of 3P reserves, which give us ability to grow all of our product lines in double-digit production for many years. And obviously, currently we're choosing not to grow our natural gas production. We also have tremendous flexibility in our capital budget and we've responded very quickly to the decade low natural gas prices by cutting our capital budget over $400 million in February this year. 
We continue to be a technical and low-cost leader. Our balance sheet is very strong with over $1.8 billion liquidity before our Barnett assets sales proceeds comes in. This puts us in a very strong position to separately grow our core areas when the time is right. Currently, the time is right for the Bakken and for the Piceance area. We see compelling opportunity. And our choice in design or strategy has been to be in the best oil basin in the Bakken, which we are. The best gas and liquid basin in the nation in the Piceance. And we think the best gas station in the nation via the Marcellus. 
So if you turn to Slide 4, our first 100 days, we became as a standalone company December 31 as you know. We told the WPX strategy there were going to be 3 things. First to discipline management team; secondly, we have a very strong balance sheet; and third, we have a premier diversified asset base. We've exceeded all 3 of these areas in the first 100 days. Looking first in the discipline side. In our first months as a separate company, we faced decade-low natural gas prices which have continued through the first quarter. We merely cut our capital budget by over $400 million and directed over 70% of our capital to the oil and liquids-rich plays, which reaffirm -- and also reaffirmed our commitment to live within our means. 
Second, to further enhance our strong balance sheet. We divested one of our non-core assets in the Barnett Shale in an accretive transaction for over $306 million. 
That strengthened our peer-leading net debt to EBITDAX ratio to 1.1x to 0.9x. So substantially increased our balance sheet. Third, we focused on our highest return in oil and liquids areas and we've increased our oil production by 150%. 
Our liquids production is up 13% and our or oil and liquid revenues were up 45%. Overall this year, we expect 46% of our revenue will come from oil and liquid represented by 20% of our volumes, a substantial increase from 2011. 
Looking at Slide 5. For the remainder of 2012,  we will  adhere to our guiding principles. While growing our domestic oil production by  50% to 60%. Our balance sheet will also become stronger after we close the Barnett sale. So the remaining priorities for 2012 include: we are a very efficient producer and a very low-cost producer already, but we are seeing cost trends lower and we expect this to continue, particularly in our gas-prone basins. In the Bakken, we expected all acreage will be held in production by third quarter. We also added 6 rigs in July and by the third quarter, we will have all fit-for-purpose rigs, which are designed specifically for the Bakken. We should begin pad drilling in the third quarter, which should lower our well cost. We haven't done it yet but are hoping that our well cost will be lower by $500,000 to $1 million. We also will complete our complete gathering system for oil, water and gas in the third quarter. In the Piceance, we will spread our Mancos horizontal test mid-summer to evaluate this potential large gas resource that we already hold by production and we'll also continue to maximize our liquidity recoveries. In the Powder River, we are evaluating numerous oil prospects, where we hold over 140,000 acres of deep rights. We expect to begin participating in some of these prospects this year. 
We also continued to test the Vaca Muerta in Argentina, where we have 250,000 acres exposed to this shale. And we are testing our first well in Columbia. And we will relentless in telling the WPX story of our disciplined management team, superior balance sheet and our premiered diversified asset base to our investors. And we're pleased that we already have 8 cell site analysts coverage, and we expected this number to increase. 
Turning to Slide 6, the Bakken. 
It's a world-class oil play. It's the best in the nation. And we also believe we're located in the best remaining undeveloped reservoir in the Bakken play. We began to releverage our service relationships from the Piceance and we have guarantied completion services now with a dedicated frac crew, pipe delivery, rig moving and we also have fit-for-purpose rigs coming in as I mentioned. Slide 7. At the Middle Bakken activity, we spud 5 wells in the first quarter, 7 wells have been put on sale. You can see those by the color of the green and the blue on the map. All wells -- no, we do not have any wells currently waiting on completion. We also are beginning to delineate our acreage to the south with the wells we drilled in the south piece and they should have mid-June completions. 
Our Three Forks development is also underway. We spud 3 wells and to 3 forks, which you'd see by the orange color on the map. 2 of them are North of the lake and what's called the Van Hook area and 1 is west of the lake in the Mandaree area. 
And to have second quarter completion results. Our production in March was up to 8,700 net barrels a day, an increase of almost 300% over March of 2011, which was about 2,200 barrels a day. We have 51 completed wells now. We currently at 5 rigs. And as I mentioned, the sixth rig will come on in July of 2012. And all of our rigs we will save for purpose by the third quarter. 
We also are converted to multi-well pad drilling in the third quarter -- by third quarter 2012 and the pad able to 3 to 5 laterals an average and possibly more. 
We'd expanded our dedicated frac crew to 1 complete frac crew and again looking at the pad drilling, there's not been a lot of pad drilling on the fields beside partial We do think our pad drilling also might can save us between maybe $500,000 and $1 million. And those drivers are less move days, share pad construction cost, share facilities, reduce the drilling days, obviously, moving days. All of in the pay lower well cost. 
Slide 8. We continue to be a performance leader on the reservation. This is IHS data. So it's an MBOs only. You can see that based on -- compared to our competitors, our 180-day rate is superior to our competitors and also results in a higher EOR comparison. 
On this map, -- on this chart, it does 663 MBOs for us. Again, that's not equivalent if we put that in MBOEs. IHS only does on MBOs it'll be 721, which is right in -- basically in the middle of our type curves 700, 800 MBOEs per well. 
We have 7 wells in this greater than 180 days experience. We continue to outperform our competition. We used the 65%, 35% ceramic sand mix. We also put on here, some of our competitors are using sand only. All these wells are Middle Bakken, long laterals only. And again, we believe in the 180-day rate. It's a much better calculation for EUR. So you can see, our performance continues to be improved and also be better than others on the reservation. 
Slide 9. Part of what we all wanted to do is make sure is that we bring the efficiencies to adding new basin rim. The completion of Van Hook gathering system will bring us that. The construction is under way for $34 million investment. We expect to be done by the third quarter of 2012. We'll be able to capture pipe all of our oil, gas and water and deliver freshwater. Obviously, we won't be flaring gas anymore when this is done. This removes trucking costs and social impacts. It makes us more efficient. We think when the system is down, we'll immediately get a $2 per barrel uptick in savings on our piping -- or trucking cost. And that will be in the -- by the third quarter 2012. And by the first quarter 2013, that will be more like a $4 per barrel savings for all of our oil piped out of the Van Hook area. The Arrow Systems is already up and running. So 100% of our oil, gas, water,  et cetera will be piped by the time we get down with the Van Hook gathering system. 
Slide 10 on the netback analysis. We've averaged for the first quarter, we were about a 16% discount to $103 WTI price. So a little bit higher discount than we had end that last year. April slightly higher than that. And we expect May to December to go down as plant turnarounds have come on and other additional capacity. So May to December, we expect to be more 11% to 12% discount to WTI. You can see our current agreements. We have basin sales and we have what we've expected discount to be on the basin sales for the remainder of the year. We have Manifest Rail, we have Enbridge piping. You see those on there. thing we'll have in the future beginning 2013, we've been pending final successful negotiations which we think will happen. We have almost 20,000 barrels a day of committed unit train rig capacity in that time frame. we'll be able to receive a Gulf Coast price less associated and we think it'll be based on a LSS to WTI spread of $8. We could really be receiving approximately during that future time WTI less $6 to $8. So we feel we've been very productive. First of all, we've done better than many in the industry, I think, with 16% discount in the first quarter. We expect that to be about 11% to 12% in the May to December timeframe. And obviously, when we get our unit train rail  we think that would go down more. So we believe we've taken care of the netback problems that some producers are having in the Bakken. 
Slide 11. Piceance basin. I'll just remind you, it's a world-class gas and NGL play for us. Not other what we have there. Our geologic position is unique. We're the only operator with a skill to be efficient. We drilled over 4,000 wells there and we have 10,000 remaining locations. We have a low-cost structure by technology, operational efficiency and our enhanced liquids processing, which I'll talk about and we also have a superior liquid contract which allows us to get Mont Belvieu pricing when we deliver our barrels to Conway. 
Moving on Slide 12. We spud 70 wells in the first quarter of 2012. We are down to  5 rigs. For the remainder of 2012, we'll remain at that level. 
We've got 3 new saltwater disposal wells we will have at this level. recycle 100% of our water. These new saltwater disposal wells will allow us to continue to do that, keep our costs low. Our cost have always been low in the Piceance, and 20% of 30% lower than our peers. Last year, in fact, when almost the entire nation and all basins prices went up, our costs were essentially flat because of efficiencies. And from that base, we still see service cost starting to trend down, lower sea, perforating, directional drilling type cost. We're also getting -- continue to get better on our frac sizes; our frac-ing; our simops, which is simultaneous operations; the water handling, I just mentioned. So we continue to be more efficient in the Piceance. 
Slide 13. 
We had record liquids volumes in the Piceance. [indiscernible] first time ever, highest we've ever had. The continuing increase in the Valley I remind you yields about 30 barrels per Mcf. And the Ryan Gulch about 58 barrels per MMcf, continued great liquids yield. We have firm crowd capacity about 770 million a day in the basin, but we're actually over 950 million a day to that because of the interruption we have. Again, we based low the facility [indiscernible] in a day. The facility, we have 200 million a firm but we deliver sometimes up to 400 million a day there. Echo Springs, we have 120 million a day a firm and the new prior will be coming on in 2014, which will be our next big uptick in our liquids production. So we continue to get more and more liquids productions out of the Piceance. And you can see here in the first quarter of 2012 was almost 30,000 barrels of net liquids volume. 
Slide 14, Marcellus. It's major basin and I'd remind the audience that 95% of our domestic capital spent between the Bakken, the Piceance and the Marcellus. We are in a dry gas area of the Marcellus but it is, we believe, the most prolific area in the Susquehanna county. Again, we like what we've seen in Marcellus. We continue to be frustrated and we do not have a lot of long-term data to give you. Due to the severe delays we have with Laser and the start-up problems Laser it is getting better but the pressures are very erratic, and it has kept us from getting the kind of flows that we would like to have and the kind of data we'd like to have to share with you. 
We are pleased at our former sister company, Williams/WPC closed on this acquisition on February 2012. 
Slide 15. This is where you can see our Piceance model, it's really starting to get hold in the Marcellus. The same thing I expect to happen in the Bakken. We have a dedicated frac crew here. Fit-for-purpose rigs that are coming in. Our completion cost are 20% lower now due to our efficiencies than they were. We have frac efficiencies improved significantly as you can see on the slide. In the first quarter we were able to pump 224 frac stages with 1 crew. Last year in the fourth quarter, with 2 crews slowly pumped 322 frac stages. So we're getting much, much better. We average about 20 days spud-to-rig release in the first quarter 2012. But our record drilling time is now slightly under 14 drilling days. So we're getting much better and our new rigs are coming on. So we believe we'll continue to trend towards the lower there. We renegotiated our service contracts for the completion costs and that's reduced our well costs there by $400,000 a well. We have many other operational efficiencies coming in. So we hope to eventually be able to lower our well cost by about $1 million per well in the Susquehanna county. And looking at the production side, it has -- even with the disappointment in Laser, it has increased about 96% from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012. We're about $53 million a day in net in the first quarter, which is up from net $27 million a day in the fourth quarter. Our Susquehanna production rates continue to be pressures. 
If you turn to Slide 16. Just a little Laser update. Bottom line is, as you know, Williams Partners closed on that deal January 17. We still have pressures as high as 900 pounds were flowing into. WPZ has indicated it's going to take about 9 months to have field compression operational out there based on what they're putting in. So we're going to be pursuing and have been pursuing temporary wellhead compression until WPZ can get the permanent compression installed. And hopefully, I will continue to get us a little more data exploring our wells and be able to update our type curves in Marcellus. 
Slide 17, Apco. 
Again, we own 69% interest in Apco. I want to stress a couple of things about Apco. First, we represent less than 5% of our production and reserves and Apco is self-funding, no domestic capital spend in Apco. Also with all the noise going on in Argentina, I'd like to stress that to our shareholders. But it does represent up side, particularly with the 250,000 net acres we have exposed to the Vaca Muerta shale and -- basin. Slide 18. Our opinion on the recent Argentine government action that, I think our opinion and the industry's opinion is that this dispute is between the Argentine government and Repsol and it's not with the entire energy industry in Argentina. 
Apco has historically reinvested the majority of its earnings into exploration and development properties in Argentina. But we do not think it's any target towards the Apco or any of the other companies except there is a dispute between the Argentina government and Repsol. And again, just -- I can't stress enough that we don't send any cash to Argentina. Apco is self-funding. Less than 5% of our production and reserves. And we do believe, I think we have attractive upside in the Vaca Muerta and Columbia. 
Speaking of that, if you look at Slide 19, first quarter operational update. We expect to increase our drilling investment in the formation, which is our traditional formation down there. We drill about 33 development wells in Argentina this year. And as you know, we continue to test the Coiron Amargo area for Vaca Muerta and we have 4 tests in the Coiron Amargo this year and 1 refrac-ing on the area. One of the wells is on line, the -- 1 had this press release by our partner. We continue to monitor that well. We intend to have other wells on later this year and the refrac of the -- continue this year. So we'll continue to get more data points as I mentioned and understand what we have in Argentina and in the Vaca Muerta in particular. And our first well in Colombia principal target a Mirador formation and we are testing that well as we speak and we will spud the second well in that area in the second quarter of 2012. With that I'll turn it over to Rod Sailor for our financial results and 2012 guidance."

This morning we released our first quarter financial results and I just want to touch on a couple of items. First, as mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our Barnett, our assets. The numbers re",725,"Thank you, Ralph. I'll turn you to Slide 21. This morning we released our first quarter financial results and I just want to touch on a couple of items. First, as mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our Barnett, our assets. The numbers represented both in our release and here are have been adjusted to reflect the impact of that sale. The company's overall domestic international production climbed 11% 1Q 2012 versus 1Q 2011 with average daily production of 1.4 Bcfe per day for the quarter. That's slightly ahead of our expectations. Domestic gas was driven largely by increases in the Piceance and the Marcellus basins. Even with capital spending reductions, which took effect late in the first quarter, we expect the Piceance production to continue to grow into the second quarter. We expect volumes to continue to rise and Marcellus' gas comes on from wells behind pipe and continued activity in Susquehanna County. Unfortunately, decade-low gas prices have impacted our gas revenues since realized prices are almost $1 lower, first quarter 2012 versus first quarter 2011. Good news, oil -- our total oil production is up 46% first quarter this year over first quarter last year. Our domestic oil production increases are driven by activities in our highest returning basin, the Bakken. Whereas Ralph mentioned, we continue to be pleased with our well results. Oil production in the Bakken is up over 300%. We have seen the basins differentials widen in the first quarter but -- and lower realized prices. But they were somewhat helped by higher oil prices in general and as Ralph mentioned, we're taking steps to minimize basin differentials in the Bakken going forward. NGL productions was up, 1Q 2012 versus 1Q 2011 as we continue to process more volumes primarily in the Piceance basin. Quarter-over-quarter comparisons were helped somewhat by the experience in late first quarter 2011 on the fact that we're utilizing more firming up capacity in first quarter 2012. 
Unfortunately, we continue to see a weakening in the price for composite barrel, which has impacted our realized prices in the first quarter of 2012.
As mentioned in our release, we have been experienced impairments totaling $52 million in the first quarter. Absent these impairments, our adjusted net loss from continuing operations would've been $9 million versus adjusted net income of $5 million in the first quarter 2011. Our adjusted EBITDAX totaled $262 million in the first quarter. Despite the realized gas prices being down approximately 20% lower than first quarter 2011, adjusted EBITDAX was only down approximately 6%, largely due to total production increases specially higher volumes of oil and natural gas and hedges in place. Down at the botton of Slide 21, again, total capital spending was $428 million for the first quarter. We announced our capital cuts in February and they started taking effect later in the first quarter. So on a go forward basis, we do expect to see a continuing decrease with the remaining quarters in 2012. If I might turn you to Slide 22. We are adjusting our production and EBITDAX guidance to reflect the impact of the sale of our assets in the Barnett and our Cumbre basins. This adjustment reduces our gas production to 1.09 bcfe per day. It has no impact on our oil or natural gas liquids. EBITDAX guidance has been reduced by about $25 million to account for loss of cash flow from the sale of our Barnett and properties. And then down in the middle of the page there, you can see no change for projected capital spending of $1.2 billion. We have broken out oil and NGLs on our rule of thumb metric to help in calculating price changes.
Finally, if I might to turn you to Slide 23. Ralph just touched on this, but we have put a liquidity slide in the presentation. Good news is we have over $1.8 million of liquidity. We expect to have no borrowings under our revolver at year-end. And we expect to have the remainder of Arkoma and Barnett asset sale proceeds to approximately $75 million received shortly. So before I turn it back over to Ralph, I'd just like to say strong production, we continue to have a strong balance sheet and a low debt to EBITDA ratio. With that, I'll turn it back Ralph."

One of the areas I've mentioned many times on the road and conferences that makes a lot of sense for us in addition to the current basin of the Bakken if we can add there is the Wet Window and the Utica shale. We think that would be a natural fit for our Marcellus team. We wouldn't have to add a new asset team. We could take our rigs and our dedicated completion crews interchangeably to the Utica from to the Marcellus. In fact, the drilling and where they join in the Utica Shale right now is actually closer to our Canonsburg office than our Susquehanna drilling. So that's a natural fit for us. So we continue to look at that area. We understand it geologically. We think there are a number players there that might have more than that they can say grace over that we might have an opportunity to maybe do some drill to earns with. And also some other producers that have not really -- not built to do large scale efficiency type drilling like we do. So we might be able to get some opportunities that way. So that's an area that continues to have attraction to us. Again it would have to be compelling to do anything in there.

Key takeaways from today's call, when we finish, is to remind everybody we have premier portfolio. We have very strong production growth",3239,"Thank you, David, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings call, and thank you for your interest in WPX Energy. Key takeaways from today's call, when we finish, is to remind everybody we have premier portfolio. We have very strong production growth in oil and natural gas liquids. And when the commodity environment is right, we can also do that in natural gas. We have an existing portfolio of 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves, which gives us the ability to grow all of our product lines in double-digit production for many years. And obviously, currently, we're choosing not to grow our natural gas production. 
We also have tremendous flexibility in our capital budget, and we've responded very quickly to the decade-low natural gas prices by cutting our capital budget over $400 million in February this year. We continue to be a technical and low-cost leader. Our balance sheet is very strong with over $1.8 billion liquidity before our Barnett asset sales proceeds comes in. 
This puts us in a very strong position to separately grow our core areas when the time is right. Currently, the time is right for the Bakken and for the Piceance area, the 2 areas that we see compelling opportunity. And our choice and design, our strategy has been in the best -- to be in the best oil basin in the Bakken, which we are, the best gas and liquid basin in the nation via the Piceance, and we think the best gas station in the nation via the Marcellus. 
So if you turn to Slide 4. Our first 100 days, we became a stand-alone company December 31, as you know. We told the WPX strategy that we're going to be 3 things: first, a disciplined management team; second, that we have a very strong balance sheet; and third, that we have a premier diversified asset base. We've executed on all 3 of these areas in the first 100 days. 
Looking first at the discipline side, in our first months as a separate company, we faced decade-low natural gas prices, which have continued through the first quarter. We merely cut our capital budget by over $400 million and directed over 70% of our capital to oil and liquids-rich plays, which -- and also reaffirmed our commitment to live within our means. 
Second, to further enhance our strong balance sheet, we divested at one of our non-core assets in the Barnett Shale in an accretive transaction for over $306 million. That strengthened our peer leading net debt to EBITDAX ratio from 1.1x to 0.9x, so substantially increased our balance sheet. 
Third, we have focused on our highest return on oil and liquids areas, and we've increased our oil production by 150%. Our liquids production is up 13%, and our oil and liquid revenues are up 45%. Overall this year, we expect 46% of our revenues will come from oil and liquids, represented by 20% of our volumes, a substantial increase from 2011. 
Looking at Slide 5. For the remainder of 2012, we will adhere to our guiding principles while growing our domestic oil production by 50% to 60%. Our balance sheet will also become stronger after we close the Barnett sale. So remaining priorities for 2012 include: we are a very efficient producer and a very low-cost producer already, but we are seeing cost trends go lower and we expect this to continue, particularly in our gas-prone basins. 
In the Bakken, we expected that all acreage will be held by production by third quarter. We also added 6 rigs in July. And by the third quarter, we will have all fit-for-purpose rigs, which are designed specifically for the Bakken. We should begin pad drilling in the third quarter, which should lower our well cost. We haven't done it yet. We're hoping that the well cost will be lower by $500,000 to $1 million. We also will complete our complete final gathering system for oil, water and gas in the third quarter. 
In the Piceance, we will spud our Mancos horizontal test midsummer to evaluate this potential large gas resource that we already hold by production, and we'll also continue to maximize our liquid recoveries. 
In the Powder River, we are evaluating numerous oil prospects, where we hold over 140,000 acres of deep rights. We expect to begin participating in some of these prospects this year. We also continue to test the Vaca Muerta in Argentina, where we have 250,000 acres exposed to this shale, and we are testing our first well in Columbia. 
And we will be relentless in telling the WPX story of our disciplined management team, superior balance sheet and our premiere diversified asset base to our investors. And we're pleased that we already have 8 sell side analysts covering us, and we expected this number to increase. 
Moving to Slide 6, the Bakken. It's a world-class oil play. It's the best in the nation. We also believe we're located in the best remaining undeveloped reservoir in the Bakken play. We've begun to leverage our service relationships from the Piceance, and we have guarantied completion services now with the dedicated frac crew, pipe delivery, rig moving and we also have fit-for-purpose rigs coming in, as I mentioned. 
Slide 7. In the Middle Bakken activity, we spud 5 wells in the first quarter, 7 wells have been put on sale. You can see those by the color of the green and the blue on the map. All wells -- no, we do not have any wells currently waiting on completion. We also are beginning to delineate our acreage to the south with the wells we drilled in the south piece and they should have mid-June completions. 
Our Three Forks development is also underway. We spud 3 wells in Three Forks, which you can see by the orange color on the map, two of them are north of the lake in what's called the Van Hook area, and one is west of the lake in the Mandaree area. And we expect to have second quarter completion results. 
Our production in March is up to -- was up to 8,700 net barrels a day, an increase of almost 300% over March of 2011, which was about 2,200 barrels a day. We have 51 completed wells now. We're currently at 5 rigs. And as I mentioned, the sixth rig will come on in July of 2012. And all of our rigs will be fit-for-purpose by the third quarter. We also are converting to multi-well pad drilling in the third quarter -- by third quarter 2012 and the pad could equal up to 3 to 5 laterals on average and possibly more. 
We'd expanded our dedicated frac crew to one complete frac crew. And again, looking at the pad drilling, there's not been a lot of pad drilling on the fields beside partial and sand-ish, but we do think our pad drilling ultimately can save us between maybe $500,000 and $1 million. And those drivers are -- cost drivers are less move days, shared pad, construction costs, shared facilities, reduce the drilling days, obviously, moving days, all those things would be playing to lower well costs. 
Slide 8. We continue to be a performance leader on the reservation. This is IHS data, so it's an Mbos-only. You can see that based on -- compared to our competitors, our 180-day rate is superior to our competitors and also results in a higher EUR comparison. On this map -- on this chart, it does 663 Mbos for us. Again, that's not equivalent if we put that in Mboes. IHS only does on Mbos. It would be 721, which is right in -- basically in the middle of our type curve, which 700 to 800 Mboes per well. 
We have 7 wells in this greater than 180 days experience. We continue to outperform our competition. We used the 65%, 35% ceramic sand mix, and we also put on here that some of our competitors are using sand-only. All these wells are Middle Bakken, long laterals only. And again, we believe in the 180-day rate. It's a much better calculation for EUR. So you can see, our performance continues to be improved and also be better than others on the reservation. 
Slide 9. Part of what we always wanted to do is make sure we bring the efficiencies to adding new base that we're in. The completion of Van Hook gathering system will bring us that. The construction is underway. It's a $34 million investment. We expect to be done by the third quarter of 2012. We'll be able to capture in pipe all of our oil, gas and water and deliver freshwater. Obviously, it won't be flaring gas anymore when this is done. This removes trucking costs and social impacts. It makes us more efficient. 
We think when the system is done, we'll immediately get about a $2 per barrel uptick in savings on our piping -- or our trucking cost. And that will be in the -- by the third quarter of 2012. And by the first quarter 2013, that will be more like a $4 per barrel savings for our oil that's piped out of the Van Hook area. The Arrow system is already up and running. So we'll have 100% of our oil, gas, water,  et cetera will be piped by the time we get done with the Van Hook Gathering System. 
Slide 10. On the netback analysis, we've averaged for the first quarter, we were about 16% discount to $103 WTI price, so a little bit higher discount than we had at end that last year. April is slightly higher than that, and we expect May to December to go down as plant turnarounds have come on and other additional capacity. So May through December, we expect to be more like 11% to 12% discount to WTI. 
You can see our current agreements. We have basin sales, and we have what we expect the discount to be on the basin sales for the remainder of the year. We have Manifest Rail. We have Enbridge piping. You can see those on there. We do think we'll have in the future, beginning in 2013, we've been -- pending the final successful negotiations, which we think will happen, we'll have almost 20,000 barrels a day of committed unit train rig capacity in that time frame. We'll be able to receive a Gulf Coast price less associated fees. And we think it will be based on a LSS to WTI spread of $8. 
We could really be receiving approximately, during that future time, a WTI less $6 to $8. So we feel we've been very proactive. First of all, we've done better than many in the industry, I think, with about a 16% discount in the first quarter. We expect that to be about 11% to 12% in the May through December time frame. And obviously, when we get our unit train rail options go down, we think that would go down even more. So we believe we're taking care of the netback problems that some producers are having in the Bakken. 
Slide 11, Piceance Basin. I'll just remind you, it's a world-class gas and NGL play for us. Not others what we have there. Our geologic position is unique. We're the only operator with the scale to be efficient. We've drilled over 4,000 wells there, and we have 10,000 remaining locations. We have a low-cost structure. It's driven by technology, operational efficiency and our enhanced liquids processing, which I'll talk about. And we also have a superior liquid contract, which allows us to get Mont Belvieu pricing when we deliver our barrels to Conway. 
Looking at Slide 12. We spud 70 wells in the first quarter of 2012. We are down to  5 rigs. For 2012, we'll remain at that level. We've got 3 new saltwater disposal wells we will have at this reduced drilling level. Traditionally, we recycle 100% of our water. These new saltwater disposal wells will allow us to continue to do that and keep our costs low. 
Our costs have always been low in the Piceance and 20% of 30% lower than our peers. Last year, in fact, when almost the entire nation and all basins prices went up, our costs were essentially flat because of the efficiencies. And from that base, we still see service cost starting to trend down, lower cementing, perforating, directional drilling type cost. We're also getting -- continue to get better on our frac sizes; our frac-ing; our SIMOPS, which is simultaneous operations; the water handling, I just mentioned. So we continue to be more efficient in the Piceance. 
Slide 13. We had record liquids volumes in the Piceance. For the first time ever, highest we've ever had. They continue to increase in the Valley. I remind you, it yields about 30 barrels per Mcf. In the Ryan Gulch, it's about 58 barrels per MMcf, continued great liquids yield. We have firm cryo capacity, about 770 million a day in the basin. But we actually are flowing over 950 million a day on to that because of the interruptible we have. 
Again, we base flow the Willow Creek facility at 450 million a day. The Meeker facility, we have 200 million of firm, but we deliver sometimes up to 400 million a day there. Echo Springs, we have 120 million a day a firm. And the new Parachute cryo will be coming on in 2014, which will be our next big uptick in our liquids production. So we continue to get more and more liquids productions out of the Piceance. And you can see here in the first quarter of 2012, it was almost 30,000 barrels a day of net liquids volume. 
Slide 14, Marcellus. It's our final major basin. I'd remind the audience that about 95% of our domestic capital is spent between the Bakken, the Piceance and the Marcellus. We are in the dry gas area of the Marcellus, but it is, we believe, the most prolific area in the Susquehanna County. Again, we like what we've seen in Marcellus. 
We continue to be frustrated that we do not have a lot of long-term data to give you due to the severe delays we have with Laser and the start-up problems that continue with Laser. It is getting better. But the pressures are very erratic, and it's kept us from getting the kind of flows that we would like to have and the kind of data we'd like to have to share with you. We are pleased that our former sister company, Williams/WPZ, closed on this acquisition on February 2012. 
Slide 15. This is where you can see our Piceance model is really starting to take hold in the Marcellus, the same thing I expect to see happen in the Bakken. We have a dedicated frac crew here, fit-for-purpose rigs that are coming in. Our completion cost are 20% lower now due to our efficiencies than they were. 
We have -- our frac efficiencies improved significantly as you can see on this slide. In the first quarter, we were able to pump 224 frac stages with one crew. Last year, in the fourth quarter, with 2 crews, we only pumped 322 frac stages. So we're getting much, much better. We average about 20 days spud-to-rig release in the first quarter 2012, but our record drilling time is now slightly under 14 drilling days. So we're getting much better and our new rigs are coming on, so we believe we'll continue to trend towards the lower end there. 
We've renegotiated our service contracts for the completion side costs, and that's reduced our well cost there by about $400,000 a well. We have many other operational efficiencies coming in, so we hope to eventually be able to lower our well cost by about $1 million per well in the Susquehanna County. 
And looking at the production side, it has -- even with the disappointment in Laser, it has increased about 96% from the fourth quarter 2011 to the first quarter 2012. We're about $53 million a day net in the first quarter, which is up from net $27 million a day in the fourth quarter. Our Susquehanna production rates continue to be high line pressures. 
If you turn to Slide 16, just a little Laser update. Bottom line is, as you know, Williams Partners closed on that deal February 17. We still have pressures as high as 900 pounds we're flowing into. WPZ has indicated it's going to take about 9 months to have field compression operational up there based on what they're putting in. So we're going to be pursuing and have been pursuing temporary wellhead compression until WPZ can get the permanent compression installed. And hopefully, that will continue to get us a little more data exploring our wells and be able to update our type curves in Marcellus. 
Slide 17, Apco. Again, we own 69% interest in Apco. I want to stress a couple of things about Apco. First, it represents less than 5% of our production and reserves and Apco is self-funding, no domestic capital spend in Apco. Also with all the noise going on in Argentina, I'd like to stress that to our shareholders. But it does represent upside, particularly with the 250,000 net acres we have exposed to the Vaca Muerta Shale and Neuquen Basin. 
Slide 18. Our opinion on the recent Argentine government action that -- I think our opinion and the industry's opinion is that this dispute is between the Argentine government and Repsol, and it's not with the entire energy industry in Argentina. Apco has historically invested the majority of its earnings into exploration and development properties in Argentina, but we do not think it's any target towards Apco or any of the other companies, except there is a dispute between the Argentina government and Repsol. And again, I can't stress enough that we don't send any cash to Argentina. Apco is self-funding, less than 5% of our production and reserves. And we do believe, I think, we have attractive upside in the Vaca Muerta and Columbia. 
Speaking of that, if you look at Slide 19, first quarter operational update. We expect to increase our drilling investments in the Tordillo Formation, which is our traditional formation down there. We'll drill about 33 development wells in Argentina this year. And as you know, we continue to test the Coiron Amargo area for Vaca Muerta and we have 4 tests in the Coiron Amargo this year and one re-frac on the Bajada del Palo area. 
One of the wells is online, the CAS x-1 is -- there's been a press release by our partner. We continue to monitor that well. We intend to have other wells on later this year and the re-frac of the Bajada de Palo will also continue this year. So we'll continue to get more data points, as I mentioned, and understand what we have in Argentina and in the Vaca Muerta, in particular. 
And our first well in Colombia has reached the principal target, the Mirador Formation, and we are testing that well as we speak. And we will spud the second well in that area in the second quarter of 2012. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rod Sailor for our financial results and 2012 guidance."

This morning, we released our first quarter financial results, and I just want to touch on a couple of items. First, as mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our Barnett, Arkoma assets. The numbe",727,"Thank you, Ralph. I'll turn you to Slide 21. This morning, we released our first quarter financial results, and I just want to touch on a couple of items. First, as mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our Barnett, Arkoma assets. The numbers represented both in our release and here have been adjusted to reflect the impact of that sale. 
The company's overall domestic, international production climbed 11% 1Q 2012 versus 1Q 2011, with average daily production of 1.4 Bcfe per day. For the quarter, that's slightly ahead of our expectations. Domestic gas was driven largely by increases in the Piceance and the Marcellus basins. Even with capital spending reductions, which -- that took effect late in the first quarter, we expect the Piceance production to continue to grow into the second quarter. We expect volumes to continue to rise in Marcellus as gas comes on from wells behind pipe and continued activity in Susquehanna County. Unfortunately, decade-low gas prices have impacted our gas revenues since realized prices are almost $1 lower first quarter 2012 versus first quarter 2011. 
Good news, oil -- our total oil production is up 46% first quarter this year over first quarter last year. Our domestic oil production increases are driven by activities in our highest returning basin, the Bakken, whereas Ralph mentioned, we continue to be pleased with our well results. Oil production in the Bakken is up over 300%. We have seen basis differentials widen in the first quarter but -- and lower realized prices, but they were somewhat helped by higher oil prices in general. And as Ralph mentioned, we're taking steps to minimize basin differentials in the Bakken going forward. 
NGL productions was up 1Q 2012 versus 1Q 2011 as we continue to process more volumes, primarily in the Piceance basin. Quarter-over-quarter comparisons were helped somewhat by planned outages experienced in late first quarter 2011 on the fact that we're utilizing more firm interruptible capacity in first quarter 2012. Unfortunately, we continue to see a weakening in the price for composite barrel, which has impacted our realized prices in the first quarter of 2012.
As mentioned in our release, we have been experienced impairments totaling $52 million in the first quarter. Absent these impairments, our adjusted net loss from continuing operations would have been $9 million versus adjusted net income of $5 million in the first quarter 2011. Our adjusted EBITDAX totaled $262 million in the first quarter. Despite the realized gas prices being down approximately 20% lower than first quarter 2011, adjusted EBITDAX was only down approximately 6%, largely due to total production increases, especially higher volumes of oil and natural gas and hedges in place. 
Then at the bottom of Slide 21, again, total capital spending was $428 million for the first quarter. We announced our capital cuts in February. They started taking effect later in the first quarter. So on a go-forward basis, we do expect to see a continuing decrease for the remaining quarters in 2012. 
If I might turn you to Slide 22. We are adjusting our production and EBITDAX guidance to reflect the impact of the sale of our assets in the Barnett and Arkoma basins. This adjustment reduces our gas production to 1.09 Bcfe per day. It has no impact on our oil or natural gas liquids. EBITDAX guidance has been reduced by about $25 million to account for the loss of cash flow from the sale of our Barnett and Arkoma properties. 
And then down the middle of the page there, you can see no change for projected capital spending of $1.2 billion. We have broken out oil and NGLs on our rule of thumb metric to help in calculating price changes.
Finally, if I might turn you to Slide 23. Ralph just touched on this, but we have put a liquidity slide in the presentation. Good news is we have over $1.8 million of liquidity. We expect to have no borrowings under our revolver at year end, and we expect to have the remainder of Arkoma and Barnett asset sale proceeds of approximately $75 million received here shortly. 
So before I turn it back over to Ralph, I'd just like to say, with strong production, we continue to have a strong balance sheet and a low debt-to-EBITDA ratio. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ralph."

Again, to do something, it's going to have to be very compelling. One of the areas I've mentioned many times on the road and conferences that makes a lot of sense for us in addition to the current basin of the Bakken, if we could add there, is the wet window in the Utica shale. We think that would be a natural fit for our Marcellus team. We wouldn't have to add a new asset team. We could take our rigs and our dedicated completion crews interchangeably to the Utica from the Marcellus. In fact, the drilling and where they join in the Utica Shale right now is actually closer to our Canonsburg office than our Susquehanna drilling. So that's a natural fit for us. So we continue to look at that area. We understand it geologically. We think there are a number players there that might have more than that they can say grace over, that we might have an opportunity to maybe do some drill-to-earns with, and also some other producers that have not really -- not built to do large-scale efficiency type drilling like we do.

We will move to pad drilling, and we hope to have those kinds of savings. That's why we're going to pad drilling, but that's late third quarter. So I think that's really more of a look at 2013, maybe late 2012."

I'll take at least the first part of this. We continue to work aggressively on the permitting front. I think we are encouraged that some resources are being added on the regulatory side to better prosecute things in a timely fashion. We reported last quarter that at least the prerequisite work that we're required to accomplish upfront, that is largely done for all of our pads. So what we're required to submit to initiate that permitting process has been completed on our side, very pleased with the effort around that over the past year. The logjam, of course, is over on the regulatory side. I think the good news is whenever we've had been in the pinch a little bit, we've been able to accelerate some things through that process, and so we have not had any idle time to date. We certainly would like to see that sieve open up a little bit. Currently, we've got about 2 -- I think 2 permits in front of each rig and so, perhaps, 60 to 90 days worked of lead time. Those aren't always the permits that you would like to have. But nonetheless, we've been able to stay out in front and avoid any standby time. We are expecting some breakthroughs very shortly just based on dialogues that we've had with the regulators there, the tribal involvement of late and the request, frankly, all the way to Secretary Salazar for additional resources to be plugged in to the process. So the short answer is, it's adequate but it could be better. We're doing okay though."

Key takeaways from today's call, when we finish, is to remind everybody we have premier portfolio. We have very strong production growth",3246,"Thank you, David, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings call, and thank you for your interest in WPX Energy. Key takeaways from today's call, when we finish, is to remind everybody we have premier portfolio. We have very strong production growth in oil and natural gas liquids. And when the commodity environment is right, we can also do that in natural gas. We have an existing portfolio of 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves, which gives us the ability to grow all of our product lines in double-digit production for many years. And obviously, currently, we're choosing not to grow our natural gas production. 
We also have tremendous flexibility in our capital budget, and we've responded very quickly to the decade-low natural gas prices by cutting our capital budget over $400 million in February this year. We continue to be a technical and low-cost leader. Our balance sheet is very strong with over $1.8 billion liquidity before our Barnett asset sales proceeds comes in. 
This puts us in a very strong position to separately grow our core areas when the time is right. Currently, the time is right for the Bakken and for the Piceance area, the 2 areas that we see compelling opportunity. And our choice and design, our strategy has been in the best -- to be in the best oil basin in the Bakken, which we are, the best gas and liquid basin in the nation via the Piceance, and we think the best gas station in the nation via the Marcellus. 
So if you turn to Slide 4. Our first 100 days, we became a stand-alone company December 31, as you know. We told the WPX strategy that we're going to be 3 things: first, a disciplined management team; second, that we have a very strong balance sheet; and third, that we have a premier diversified asset base. We've executed on all 3 of these areas in the first 100 days. 
Looking first at the discipline side, in our first month as a separate company, we faced decade-low natural gas prices, which have continued through the first quarter. We merely cut our capital budget by over $400 million and directed over 70% of our capital to oil and liquids-rich plays, which -- and also reaffirmed our commitment to live within our means. 
Second, to further enhance our strong balance sheet, we divested at one of our non-core assets in the Barnett Shale in an accretive transaction for over $306 million. That strengthened our peer leading net debt to EBITDAX ratio from 1.1x to 0.9x, so substantially increased our balance sheet. 
Third, we have focused on our highest return on oil and liquids areas, and we've increased our oil production by 150%. Our liquids production is up 13%, and our oil and liquid revenues are up 45%. Overall this year, we expect 46% of our revenues will come from oil and liquids in 2012, representing about 20% of our volumes, a substantial increase from 2011. 
Looking at Slide 5. For the remainder of 2012, we will adhere to our guiding principles while growing our domestic oil production by 50% to 60%. Our balance sheet will also become stronger after we close the Barnett sale. So remaining priorities for 2012 include: we are a very efficient producer and a very low-cost producer already, but we are seeing cost trends go lower and we expect those to continue, particularly in our gas-prone basins. 
In the Bakken, we expected that all acreage will be held by production by the third quarter. We will also add a sixth rig in July. And by the third quarter, we will have all fit-for-purpose rigs, which are designed specifically for the Bakken. We should begin pad drilling in the third quarter, which should lower our well costs. We haven't done it yet. We're hoping that the well costs will be lower by $500,000 to $1 million. We also will complete our complete final gathering system for oil, water and gas in the third quarter. 
In the Piceance, we will spud our Mancos horizontal test mid-summer to evaluate this potential large gas resource that we already hold by production, and we'll also continue to maximize our liquid recoveries. 
In the Powder River, we are evaluating numerous oil prospects, where we hold over 140,000 acres of deep rights. We expect to begin participating in some of these prospects this year. We also continue to test the Vaca Muerta in Argentina, where we have 250,000 acres exposed to this shale, and we are testing our first well in Columbia. 
And we will be relentless in telling the WPX story of our disciplined management team, superior balance sheet and our premiere diversified asset base to our investors. And we're pleased that we already have 8 sell side analysts covering us, and we expected this number to increase. 
Moving to Slide 6, the Bakken. It's a world-class oil play. It's the best in the nation. We also believe we're located in the best remaining undeveloped reservoir in the Bakken play. We've begun to leverage our service relationships from the Piceance, and we have guarantied completion services now with the dedicated frack crew, pipe delivery, rig moving and we also have fit-for-purpose rigs coming in, as I mentioned. 
Slide 7. In the Middle Bakken activity, we spud 5 wells in the first quarter, 7 wells have been put on sale. You can see those by the color of the green and the blue on the map. All wells -- no, we do not have any wells currently waiting on completion. We also are beginning to delineate our acreage to the south with the wells we drilled in the south piece and they should have mid-June completions. 
Our Three Forks development is also underway. We spud 3 wells in Three Forks, which you can see by the orange color on the map, two of them are north of the lake in what's called the Van Hook area, and one is west of the lake in the Mandaree area. And we expect to have second quarter completion results. 
Our production in March is up to -- was up to 8,700 net barrels a day, an increase of almost 300% over March of 2011, which was about 2,200 net barrels a day. We have 51 completed wells now. We're currently at 5 rigs. And as I mentioned, the sixth rig will come on in July of 2012. And all of our rigs will be fit-for-purpose by the third quarter. We also are converting to multi-well pad drilling in the third quarter -- by third quarter 2012 and the pad could equal up to 3 to 5 laterals on average and possibly more. 
We'd expanded our dedicated frack crew to one complete frack crew. And again, looking at the pad drilling, there's not been a lot of pad drilling on the fields beside partial and sand-ish, but we do think our pad drilling ultimately can save us between maybe $500,000 and $1 million. And those drivers are -- cost drivers are less move days, shared pad construction costs, shared facilities, reduce of drilling days, obviously, moving days, all those things would be playing into lower well costs. 
Slide 8. We continue to be a performance leader on the reservation. This is IHS data, so it's an Mbos-only. You can see that based on -- compared to our competitors, our 180-day rate is superior to our competitors and also results in a higher EUR comparison. On this map -- on this chart, it does 663 Mbos for us. Again, that's not equivalent if we put that in Mboes. IHS only does on Mbos. It would be 721, which is right in -- basically in the middle of our type curve, which 700 to 800 Mboes per well. 
We have 7 wells in this greater than 180 days experience. We continue to outperform our competition. We use the 65%, 35% ceramic sand mix, and we also put on here that some of our competitors are using sand-only. All these wells are Middle Bakken, long laterals only. And again, we believe in the 180-day rate is a much better calculation for EUR. So you can see, our performance continues to be improved and also be better than others on the reservation. 
Slide 9. Part of what we always wanted to do is make sure we bring the efficiencies to adding new base that we're in. The completion of Van Hook gathering system will bring us that. The construction is underway. It's a $34 million investment. We expect to be done by the third quarter of 2012. We'll be able to capture and pipe all of our oil, gas and water and deliver freshwater. Obviously, it won't be flaring gas anymore when this is done. This removes trucking costs and social impacts. It makes us more efficient. 
We think when the system is done, we'll immediately get about a $2 per barrel uptick in savings on our piping -- or our trucking cost. And that will be in the -- by the third quarter of 2012. And by the first quarter 2013, that will be more like a $4 per barrel savings for our oil that's piped out of the Van Hook area. The Arrow system is already up and running. So we'll have 100% of our oil, gas, water,  et cetera will be piped by the time we get done with the Van Hook Gathering System. 
Slide 10. On the netback analysis, we've averaged for the first quarter, we were about 16% discount to $103 WTI price, so a little bit higher discount than we had at -- end of last year. April is slightly higher than that, and we expect May to December to go down as plant turnarounds have come on and other additional capacity. So May through December, we expect to be more like 11% to 12% discount to WTI. 
You can see our current agreements. We have basin sales, and we have what we expect the discount to be on the basin sales for the remainder of the year. We have Manifest Rail. We have Enbridge piping. You can see those on there. We do think we'll have in the future, beginning in 2013, we've been -- pending the final successful negotiations, which we think will happen, we'll have almost 20,000 barrels a day of committed unit train rig capacity in that time frame. We'll be able to receive a Gulf Coast price less associated fees. And we think if you base it on a LSS to WTI spread of $8, we could really be receiving approximately, during that future time, a WTI less $6 to $8. So we feel we've been very proactive. First of all, we've done better than many in the industry, I think, with about a 16% discount in the first quarter. We expect that to be about 11% to 12% in the May through December time frame. And obviously, when we get our unit train rail options go down, we think that would go down even more. So we believe we're taking care of the netback problems that some producers are having in the Bakken. 
Slide 11, Piceance Basin. I just remind you, it's a world-class gas and NGL play for us. Not others have what we have there. Our geologic position is unique. We're the only operator with the scale to be efficient. We've drilled over 4,000 wells there, and we have 10,000 remaining locations. We have a low-cost structure. It's driven by technology, operational efficiency and our enhanced liquids processing, which I'll talk about. And we also have a superior liquid contract, which allows us to get Mont Belvieu pricing when we deliver our barrels to Conway. 
Looking at Slide 12. We spud 70 wells in the first quarter of 2012. We are down to 5 rigs. For 2012, we'll remain at that level. We've got 3 new saltwater disposal wells we will have at this reduced drilling level. Traditionally, we recycle 100% of our water. These new saltwater disposal wells will allow us to continue to do that and keep our costs low. 
Our costs have always been low in the Piceance and 20% of 30% lower than our peers. Last year, in fact, when almost the entire nation and all basins prices went up, our costs were essentially flat because of the efficiencies. And from that base, we still see service costs starting to trend down, lower cementing, perforating, directional drilling type cost. We're also getting -- continue to get better on our frack sizes; our frack-ing; our SIMOPS, which is simultaneous operations; the water handling, I just mentioned. So we continue to be more efficient in the Piceance. 
Slide 13. We had record liquids volumes in the Piceance. For the first time ever, highest we've ever had. They continue to increase in the Valley. I remind you, it yields about 30 barrels per Mcf. In the Ryan Gulch, it's about 58 barrels per MMcf, continued great liquids yields. We have firm cryo capacity, about 770 million a day in the basin. But we actually are flowing over 950 million a day to that because of the interruptible [ph] we have. 
Again, we base flow the Willow Creek facility at 450 million a day. The Meeker facility, we have 200 million of firm, but we deliver sometimes up to 400 million a day there. Echo Springs, we have 120 million a day of firm. And the new Parachute cryo will be coming on in 2014, which will be our next big uptick in our liquids production. So we continue to get more and more liquids productions out of the Piceance. And you can see here in the first quarter of 2012, almost 30,000 barrels a day of net liquids volume. 
Slide 14, Marcellus. It's our final major basin. I'd remind the audience that about 95% of our domestic capital is spent between the Bakken, the Piceance and the Marcellus. We are in the dry gas area of the Marcellus, but it is, we believe, the most prolific area in the Susquehanna County. Again, we like what we've seen in Marcellus. 
We continue to be frustrated that we do not have a lot of long-term data to give you due to the severe delays we have with Laser and the start-up problems that continue with Laser. It is getting better. But the pressures are very erratic, and it's kept us from getting the kind of flows that we would like to have and the kind of data we'd like to have to share with you. We are pleased that our former sister company, Williams/WPZ, closed on this acquisition on February 2012. 
Slide 15. This is where you can see our Piceance model is really starting to take hold in the Marcellus, the same thing I expect to see happen in the Bakken. We have a dedicated frack crew here, fit-for-purpose rigs that are coming in. Our completion cost are 20% lower now due to our efficiencies than they were. 
We have -- our frack efficiencies improved significantly as you can see on this slide. In the first quarter, we were able to pump 224 frack stages with one crew. Last year, in the fourth quarter, with 2 crews, we only pumped 322 frack stages. So we're getting much, much better. We average about 20 days spud-to-rig release in the first quarter 2012, but our record drilling time is now slightly under 14 drilling days. So we're getting much better and our new rigs are coming on, so we believe we'll continue to trend towards the lower end there. 
We've renegotiated our service contracts for the completion side costs, and that's reduced our well cost there by about $400,000 a well. We have many other operational efficiencies coming in, so we hope to eventually be able to lower our well costs by about $1 million per well in the Susquehanna County. 
And looking at the production side, it has -- even with the disappointment in Laser, it has increased about 96% from the fourth quarter 2011 to the first quarter 2012. We're about $53 million a day net in the first quarter, which is up from net $27 million a day in the fourth quarter. Our Susquehanna production rates continue to be high line pressures. 
If you turn to Slide 16, just a little Laser update. Bottom line is, as you know, Williams Partners closed on that deal February 17. We still have pressures as high as 900 pounds we're flowing into. WPZ has indicated it's going to take about 9 months to have field compression operational up there based on what they're putting in. So we're going to be pursuing and have been pursuing temporary wellhead compression until WPZ can get the permanent compression installed. And hopefully, that will continue to get us a little more data exploring our wells and be able to update our type curves in Marcellus. 
Slide 17, Apco. Again, we own 69% interest in Apco. I want to stress a couple of things about Apco. First, it represents less than 5% of our production and reserves and Apco is self-funding, no domestic capital is spent in Apco. Also with all the noise going on in Argentina, I'd like to stress that to our shareholders. But it does represent upside, particularly with the 250,000 net acres we have exposed to the Vaca Muerta Shale and Neuquen Basin. 
Slide 18. Our opinion on the recent Argentine government action that -- I think our opinion and the industry's opinion is that this dispute is between the Argentine government and Repsol, and it's not with the entire energy industry in Argentina. Apco has historically invested the majority of its earnings into exploration and development properties in Argentina, so we do not think it's any target towards Apco or any of the other companies, except there is a dispute between the Argentina government and Repsol. And again, I can't stress enough that we don't send any cash to Argentina. Apco is self-funding, less than 5% of our production and reserves. And we do believe, I think, we have attractive upside in the Vaca Muerta and Columbia. 
Speaking of that, if you look at Slide 19, first quarter operational update. We expect to increase our drilling investments in the Tordillo Formation, which is our traditional formation down there. We'll drill about 33 development wells in Argentina this year. And as you know, we continue to test the Coiron Amargo area for Vaca Muerta and we have 4 tests in the Coiron Amargo this year and one re-frack on the Bajada del Palo area. 
One of the wells is online, the CAS x-1 is -- there's been a press release by our partner. We continue to monitor that well. We intend to have other wells on later this year and the re-frack of the Bajada de Palo will also continue this year. So we'll continue to get more data points, as I mentioned, and understand what we have in Argentina and in the Vaca Muerta, in particular. 
And our first well in Colombia has reached the principal target, the Mirador Formation, and we are testing that well as we speak. And we will spud the second well in that area in the second quarter of 2012. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rod Sailor for our financial results and 2012 guidance."

This morning, we released our first quarter financial results, and I just want to touch on a couple of items. First, as mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our Barnett, Arkoma assets. The numbe",724,"Thank you, Ralph. I'll turn you to Slide 21. This morning, we released our first quarter financial results, and I just want to touch on a couple of items. First, as mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our Barnett, Arkoma assets. The numbers represented both in our release and here have been adjusted to reflect the impact of that sale. 
The company's overall domestic, international production climbed 11% 1Q 2012 versus 1Q 2011, with average daily production of 1.4 Bcfe per day. For the quarter, that's slightly ahead of our expectations. Domestic gas was driven largely by increases in the Piceance and the Marcellus basins. Even with capital spending reductions, which -- that took effect late in the first quarter, we expect the Piceance production to continue to grow into the second quarter. We expect volumes to continue to rise in Marcellus as gas comes on from wells behind pipe and continued activity in Susquehanna County. Unfortunately, decade-low gas prices have impacted our gas revenues as realized prices are almost $1 lower first quarter 2012 versus first quarter 2011. 
Good news, oil -- total oil production is up 46% first quarter this year over first quarter last year. Our domestic oil production increases are driven by activities in our highest returning basin, the Bakken, whereas Ralph mentioned, we continue to be pleased with our well results. Oil production in the Bakken is up over 300%. We have seen basis differentials widen in the first quarter but -- and lower realized prices, but they were somewhat helped by higher oil prices in general. And as Ralph mentioned, we're taking steps to minimize basin differentials in the Bakken going forward. 
NGL productions was up 1Q 2012 versus 1Q 2011 as we continue to process more volumes, primarily in the Piceance basin. Quarter-over-quarter comparisons were helped somewhat by planned outages experienced in late first quarter 2011 on the fact that we're utilizing more firm interruptible capacity in first quarter 2012. Unfortunately, we continue to see a weakening in the price for composite barrel, which has impacted our realized prices in the first quarter of 2012.
As mentioned in our release, we have been experienced impairments totaling $52 million in the first quarter. Absent these impairments, our adjusted net loss from continuing operations would have been $9 million versus adjusted net income of $5 million in the first quarter 2011. Our adjusted EBITDAX totaled $262 million in the first quarter. Despite the realized gas prices being down approximately 20% lower than first quarter 2011, adjusted EBITDAX was only down approximately 6%, largely due to total production increases, especially higher volumes of oil and natural gas and hedges in place. 
At the bottom of Slide 21, again, total capital spending was $428 million for the first quarter. We announced our capital cuts in February. They started taking effect later in the first quarter. So on a go-forward basis, we do expect to see a continuing decrease for the remaining quarters in 2012. 
If I might turn you to Slide 22. We are adjusting our production and EBITDAX guidance to reflect the impact of the sale of our assets in the Barnett and Arkoma basins. This adjustment reduces our gas production to 1.09 Bcfe per day. It has no impact on our oil or natural gas liquids. EBITDAX guidance has been reduced by about $25 million to account for the loss of cash flow from the sale of our Barnett and Arkoma properties. 
And then down the middle of the page there, you can see no change for projected capital spending of $1.2 billion. We have broken out oil and NGLs on our rule of thumb metric to help in calculating price changes.
Finally, if I might turn you to Slide 23. Ralph just touched on this, but we have put a liquidity slide in the presentation. Good news is we have over $1.8 billion of liquidity. We expect to have no borrowings under our revolver at year end, and we expect to have the remainder of Arkoma and Barnett asset sale proceeds of approximately $75 million received here shortly. 
So before I turn it back over to Ralph, I'd just like to say, with strong production, continue to have a strong balance sheet and a low debt-to-EBITDA ratio. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ralph."

In fact, the drilling and where they join in the Utica Shale right now is actually closer to our Canonsburg office than our Susquehanna drilling. So that's a natural fit for us. So we continue to look at that area. We understand it geologically. We think there are a number players there that might have more than that they can say grace over, that we might have an opportunity to maybe do some drill-to-earns with, and also some other producers that have not really -- not built to do large-scale efficiency type drilling like we do. So we might be able to get some opportunities that way. So that's an area that continues to have attraction to us. Again, it would have to be compelling to do anything there. And we also are -- I would say, the other major oil plays that you see in the nation, our technical team continues to scour, and our A&D and Land look at those. We have a good understanding of that. And if there was something compelling come along, we could also look at another basin."

So what we're required to submit to initiate that permitting process has been completed on our side, very pleased with the effort around that over the past year. The logjam, of course, is over on the regulatory side. I think the good news is whenever we've had been in the pinch a little bit, we've been able to accelerate some things through that process, and so we have not had any idle time to date. We certainly would like to see that sieve open up a little bit. Currently, we've got about 2 -- I think 2 permits in front of each rig and so, perhaps, 60 to 90 days worth of lead time. Those aren't always the permits that you would like to have. But nonetheless, we've been able to stay out in front and avoid any standby time. We are expecting some breakthroughs very shortly just based on dialogues that we've had with the regulators there, the tribal involvement of late and the request, frankly, all the way to Secretary Salazar for additional resources to be plugged in to the process.

Some of those crackers are back online in the second and third quarter. That will help dramatically. Overall, supply, demand for ethane is fairly balanced through the end of '12. We're adding about 95,000 barrels of petchem [petrochemical] demand, and the fractionation increases are about the same. So we see supply, demand on ethane fairly balanced into the first part of '13. So we're optimistic that we could be under a little better price environment for ethane through balance of the year."

Key takeaways from today's call, when we finish, is to remind everybody we have premier portfolio. We have very strong production growth in oil and natural gas liquids. And when the commodity environment is right, we can also do that in natural gas. We have an existing portfolio of 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves, which gives us the ability to grow all of our product lines in double-digit production for many years. And obviously, currently, we're choosing not to grow our natural gas production. 
We also have tremendous flexibility in our capital budget, and we've responded very quickly to the decade-low natural gas prices by cutting our capital budget over $400 million in February this year. We continue to be a technical and low-cost leader. Our balance sheet is very strong with over $1.8 billion liquidity before our Barnett asset sales proceeds comes in. 
This puts us in a very strong position to separately grow our core areas when the time is right. Currently, the time is right for the Bakken and for the Piceance area, the 2 areas that we see compelling opportunity. And our choice and design, our strategy has been in the best -- to be in the best oil basin in the Bakken, which we are, the best gas and liquid basin in the nation via the Piceance, and we think the best gas station in the nation via the Marcellus. 
So if you turn to Slide 4. Our first 100 days, we became a stand-alone company December 31, as you know. We told the WPX strategy that we're going to be 3 things: first, a disciplined management team; second, that we have a very strong balance sheet; and third, that we have a premier diversified asset base. We've executed on all 3 of these areas in the first 100 days. 
Looking first at the discipline side, in our first month as a separate company, we faced decade-low natural gas prices, which have continued through the first quarter. We merely cut our capital budget by over $400 million and directed over 70% of our capital to oil and liquids-rich plays, which -- and also reaffirmed our commitment to live within our means. 
Second, to further enhance our strong balance sheet, we divested at one of our non-core assets in the Barnett Shale in an accretive transaction for over $306 million. That strengthened our peer leading net debt to EBITDAX ratio from 1.1x to 0.9x, so substantially increased our balance sheet. 
Third, we have focused on our highest return on oil and liquids areas, and we've increased our oil production by 150%. Our liquids production is up 13%, and our oil and liquid revenues are up 45%. Overall this year, we expect 46% of our revenues will come from oil and liquids in 2012, representing about 20% of our volumes, a substantial increase from 2011. 
Looking at Slide 5. For the remainder of 2012, we will adhere to our guiding principles while growing our domestic oil production by 50% to 60%. Our balance sheet will also become stronger after we close the Barnett sale. So remaining priorities for 2012 include: we are a very efficient producer and a very low-cost producer already, but we are seeing cost trends go lower and we expect those to continue, particularly in our gas-prone basins. 
In the Bakken, we expected that all acreage will be held by production by the third quarter. We will also add a sixth rig in July. And by the third quarter, we will have all fit-for-purpose rigs, which are designed specifically for the Bakken. We should begin pad drilling in the third quarter, which should lower our well costs. We haven't done it yet. We're hoping that the well costs will be lower by $500,000 to $1 million. We also will complete our complete final gathering system for oil, water and gas in the third quarter. 
In the Piceance, we will spud our Mancos horizontal test mid-summer to evaluate this potential large gas resource that we already hold by production, and we'll also continue to maximize our liquid recoveries. 
In the Powder River, we are evaluating numerous oil prospects, where we hold over 140,000 acres of deep rights. We expect to begin participating in some of these prospects this year. We also continue to test the Vaca Muerta in Argentina, where we have 250,000 acres exposed to this shale, and we are testing our first well in Columbia. 
And we will be relentless in telling the WPX story of our disciplined management team, superior balance sheet and our premiere diversified asset base to our investors. And we're pleased that we already have 8 sell side analysts covering us, and we expected this number to increase. 
Moving to Slide 6, the Bakken. It's a world-class oil play. It's the best in the nation. We also believe we're located in the best remaining undeveloped reservoir in the Bakken play. We've begun to leverage our service relationships from the Piceance, and we have guaranteed completion services now with the dedicated frac crew, pipe delivery, rig moving and we also have fit-for-purpose rigs coming in, as I mentioned. 
Slide 7. In the Middle Bakken activity, we spud 5 wells in the first quarter, 7 wells have been put on sale. You can see those by the color of the green and the blue on the map. All wells -- no, we do not have any wells currently waiting on completion. We also are beginning to delineate our acreage to the south with the wells we drilled in the south piece and they should have mid-June completions. 
Our Three Forks development is also underway. We spud 3 wells in Three Forks, which you can see by the orange color on the map, two of them are north of the lake in what's called the Van Hook area, and one is west of the lake in the Mandaree area. And we expect to have second quarter completion results. 
Our production in March is up to -- was up to 8,700 net barrels a day, an increase of almost 300% over March of 2011, which was about 2,200 net barrels a day. We have 51 completed wells now. We're currently at 5 rigs. And as I mentioned, the sixth rig will come on in July of 2012. And all of our rigs will be fit-for-purpose by the third quarter. We also are converting to multi-well pad drilling in the third quarter -- by third quarter 2012 and the pad could equal up to 3 to 5 laterals on average and possibly more. 
We'd expanded our dedicated frac crew to one complete frac crew. And again, looking at the pad drilling, there's not been a lot of pad drilling on the fields beside partial and sand-ish, but we do think our pad drilling ultimately can save us between maybe $500,000 and $1 million. And those drivers are -- cost drivers are less move days, shared pad construction costs, shared facilities, reduce of drilling days, obviously, moving days, all those things would be playing into lower well costs. 
Slide 8. We continue to be a performance leader on the reservation. This is IHS data, so it's an Mbos-only. You can see that based on -- compared to our competitors, our 180-day rate is superior to our competitors and also results in a higher EUR comparison. On this map -- on this chart, it does 663 Mbos for us. Again, that's not equivalent if we put that in Mboes. IHS only does on Mbos. It would be 721, which is right in -- basically in the middle of our type curve, which 700 to 800 Mboes per well. 
We have 7 wells in this greater than 180 days experience. We continue to outperform our competition. We use the 65%, 35% ceramic sand mix, and we also put on here that some of our competitors are using sand-only. All these wells are Middle Bakken, long laterals only. And again, we believe in the 180-day rate is a much better calculation for EUR. So you can see, our performance continues to be improved and also be better than others on the reservation. 
Slide 9. Part of what we always wanted to do is make sure we bring the efficiencies to adding new base that we're in. The completion of Van Hook gathering system will bring us that. The construction is underway. It's a $34 million investment. We expect to be done by the third quarter of 2012. We'll be able to capture and pipe all of our oil, gas and water and deliver freshwater. Obviously, it won't be flaring gas anymore when this is done. This removes trucking costs and social impacts. It makes us more efficient. 
We think when the system is done, we'll immediately get about a $2 per barrel uptick in savings on our piping -- or our trucking cost. And that will be in the -- by the third quarter of 2012. And by the first quarter 2013, that will be more like a $4 per barrel savings for our oil that's piped out of the Van Hook area. The Arrow system is already up and running. So we'll have 100% of our oil, gas, water,  et cetera will be piped by the time we get done with the Van Hook Gathering System. 
Slide 10. On the netback analysis, we've averaged for the first quarter, we were about 16% discount to $103 WTI price, so a little bit higher discount than we had at -- end of last year. April is slightly higher than that, and we expect May to December to go down as plant turnarounds have come on and other additional capacity. So May through December, we expect to be more like 11% to 12% discount to WTI. 
You can see our current agreements. We have basin sales, and we have what we expect the discount to be on the basin sales for the remainder of the year. We have Manifest Rail. We have Enbridge piping. You can see those on there. We do think we'll have in the future, beginning in 2013, we've been -- pending the final successful negotiations, which we think will happen, we'll have almost 20,000 barrels a day of committed unit train rig capacity in that time frame. We'll be able to receive a Gulf Coast price less associated fees. And we think if you base it on a LSS to WTI spread of $8, we could really be receiving approximately, during that future time, a WTI less $6 to $8. So we feel we've been very proactive. First of all, we've done better than many in the industry, I think, with about a 16% discount in the first quarter. We expect that to be about 11% to 12% in the May through December time frame. And obviously, when we get our unit train rail options go down, we think that would go down even more. So we believe we're taking care of the netback problems that some producers are having in the Bakken. 
Slide 11, Piceance Basin. I just remind you, it's a world-class gas and NGL play for us. Not others have what we have there. Our geologic position is unique. We're the only operator with the scale to be efficient. We've drilled over 4,000 wells there, and we have 10,000 remaining locations. We have a low-cost structure. It's driven by technology, operational efficiency and our enhanced liquids processing, which I'll talk about. And we also have a superior liquid contract, which allows us to get Mont Belvieu pricing when we deliver our barrels to Conway. 
Looking at Slide 12. We spud 70 wells in the first quarter of 2012. We are down to 5 rigs. For 2012, we'll remain at that level. We've got 3 new saltwater disposal wells we will have at this reduced drilling level. Traditionally, we recycle 100% of our water. These new saltwater disposal wells will allow us to continue to do that and keep our costs low. 
Our costs have always been low in the Piceance and 20% of 30% lower than our peers. Last year, in fact, when almost the entire nation and all basins prices went up, our costs were essentially flat because of the efficiencies. And from that base, we still see service costs starting to trend down, lower cementing, perforating, directional drilling type cost. We're also getting -- continue to get better on our frac sizes; our frac-ing; our SIMOPS, which is simultaneous operations; the water handling, I just mentioned. So we continue to be more efficient in the Piceance. 
Slide 13. We had record liquids volumes in the Piceance. For the first time ever, highest we've ever had. They continue to increase in the Valley. I remind you, it yields about 30 barrels per Mcf. In the Ryan Gulch, it's about 58 barrels per MMcf, continued great liquids yields. We have firm cryo capacity, about 770 million a day in the basin. But we actually are flowing over 950 million a day to that because of the interruptible [ph] we have. 
Again, we base flow the Willow Creek facility at 450 million a day. The Meeker facility, we have 200 million of firm, but we deliver sometimes up to 400 million a day there. Echo Springs, we have 120 million a day of firm. And the new Parachute cryo will be coming on in 2014, which will be our next big uptick in our liquids production. So we continue to get more and more liquids productions out of the Piceance. And you can see here in the first quarter of 2012, almost 30,000 barrels a day of net liquids volume. 
Slide 14, Marcellus. It's our final major basin. I'd remind the audience that about 95% of our domestic capital is spent between the Bakken, the Piceance and the Marcellus. We are in the dry gas area of the Marcellus, but it is, we believe, the most prolific area in the Susquehanna County. Again, we like what we've seen in Marcellus. 
We continue to be frustrated that we do not have a lot of long-term data to give you due to the severe delays we have with Laser and the start-up problems that continue with Laser. It is getting better. But the pressures are very erratic, and it's kept us from getting the kind of flows that we would like to have and the kind of data we'd like to have to share with you. We are pleased that our former sister company, Williams/WPZ, closed on this acquisition on February 2012. 
Slide 15. This is where you can see our Piceance model is really starting to take hold in the Marcellus, the same thing I expect to see happen in the Bakken. We have a dedicated frac crew here, fit-for-purpose rigs that are coming in. Our completion cost are 20% lower now due to our efficiencies than they were. 
We have -- our frac efficiencies improved significantly as you can see on this slide. In the first quarter, we were able to pump 224 frac stages with one crew. Last year, in the fourth quarter, with 2 crews, we only pumped 322 frac stages. So we're getting much, much better. We average about 20 days spud-to-rig release in the first quarter 2012, but our record drilling time is now slightly under 14 drilling days. So we're getting much better and our new rigs are coming on, so we believe we'll continue to trend towards the lower end there. 
We've renegotiated our service contracts for the completion side costs, and that's reduced our well cost there by about $400,000 a well. We have many other operational efficiencies coming in, so we hope to eventually be able to lower our well costs by about $1 million per well in the Susquehanna County. 
And looking at the production side, it has -- even with the disappointment in Laser, it has increased about 96% from the fourth quarter 2011 to the first quarter 2012. We're about $53 million a day net in the first quarter, which is up from net $27 million a day in the fourth quarter. Our Susquehanna production rates continue to be high line pressures. 
If you turn to Slide 16, just a little Laser update. Bottom line is, as you know, Williams Partners closed on that deal February 17. We still have pressures as high as 900 pounds we're flowing into. WPZ has indicated it's going to take about 9 months to have field compression operational up there based on what they're putting in. So we're going to be pursuing and have been pursuing temporary wellhead compression until WPZ can get the permanent compression installed. And hopefully, that will continue to get us a little more data exploring our wells and be able to update our type curves in Marcellus. 
Slide 17, Apco. Again, we own 69% interest in Apco. I want to stress a couple of things about Apco. First, it represents less than 5% of our production and reserves and Apco is self-funding, no domestic capital is spent in Apco. Also with all the noise going on in Argentina, I'd like to stress that to our shareholders. But it does represent upside, particularly with the 250,000 net acres we have exposed to the Vaca Muerta Shale and Neuquen Basin. 
Slide 18. Our opinion on the recent Argentine government action that -- I think our opinion and the industry's opinion is that this dispute is between the Argentine government and Repsol, and it's not with the entire energy industry in Argentina. Apco has historically invested the majority of its earnings into exploration and development properties in Argentina, so we do not think it's any target towards Apco or any of the other companies, except there is a dispute between the Argentina government and Repsol. And again, I can't stress enough that we don't send any cash to Argentina. Apco is self-funding, less than 5% of our production and reserves. And we do believe, I think, we have attractive upside in the Vaca Muerta and Columbia. 
Speaking of that, if you look at Slide 19, first quarter operational update. We expect to increase our drilling investments in the Tordillo Formation, which is our traditional formation down there. We'll drill about 33 development wells in Argentina this year. And as you know, we continue to test the Coiron Amargo area for Vaca Muerta and we have 4 tests in the Coiron Amargo this year and one re-frac on the Bajada del Palo area. 
One of the wells is online, the CAS x-1 is -- there's been a press release by our partner. We continue to monitor that well. We intend to have other wells on later this year and the re-frac of the Bajada de Palo will also continue this year. So we'll continue to get more data points, as I mentioned, and understand what we have in Argentina and in the Vaca Muerta, in particular. 
And our first well in Colombia has reached the principal target, the Mirador Formation, and we are testing that well as we speak. And we will spud the second well in that area in the second quarter of 2012. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rod Sailor for our financial results and 2012 guidance."

This morning, we released our first quarter financial results, and I just want to touch on a couple of items. First, as mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our Barnett, Arkoma assets. The numbe",724,"Thank you, Ralph. I'll turn you to Slide 21. This morning, we released our first quarter financial results, and I just want to touch on a couple of items. First, as mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our Barnett, Arkoma assets. The numbers represented both in our release and here have been adjusted to reflect the impact of that sale. 
The company's overall domestic, international production climbed 11% 1Q 2012 versus 1Q 2011, with average daily production of 1.4 Bcfe per day. For the quarter, that's slightly ahead of our expectations. Domestic gas was driven largely by increases in the Piceance and the Marcellus basins. Even with capital spending reductions, which -- that took effect late in the first quarter, we expect the Piceance production to continue to grow into the second quarter. We expect volumes to continue to rise in Marcellus as gas comes on from wells behind pipe and continued activity in Susquehanna County. Unfortunately, decade-low gas prices have impacted our gas revenues as realized prices are almost $1 lower first quarter 2012 versus first quarter 2011. 
Good news, oil -- total oil production is up 46% first quarter this year over first quarter last year. Our domestic oil production increases are driven by activities in our highest returning basin, the Bakken, whereas Ralph mentioned, we continue to be pleased with our well results. Oil production in the Bakken is up over 300%. We have seen basis differentials widen in the first quarter but -- and lower realized prices, but they were somewhat helped by higher oil prices in general. And as Ralph mentioned, we're taking steps to minimize basin differentials in the Bakken going forward. 
NGL productions was up 1Q 2012 versus 1Q 2011 as we continue to process more volumes, primarily in the Piceance basin. Quarter-over-quarter comparisons were helped somewhat by planned outages experienced in late first quarter 2011 on the fact that we're utilizing more firm interruptible capacity in first quarter 2012. Unfortunately, we continue to see a weakening in the price for composite barrel, which has impacted our realized prices in the first quarter of 2012.
As mentioned in our release, we have been experienced impairments totaling $52 million in the first quarter. Absent these impairments, our adjusted net loss from continuing operations would have been $9 million versus adjusted net income of $5 million in the first quarter 2011. Our adjusted EBITDAX totaled $262 million in the first quarter. Despite the realized gas prices being down approximately 20% lower than first quarter 2011, adjusted EBITDAX was only down approximately 6%, largely due to total production increases, especially higher volumes of oil and natural gas and hedges in place. 
At the bottom of Slide 21, again, total capital spending was $428 million for the first quarter. We announced our capital cuts in February. They started taking effect later in the first quarter. So on a go-forward basis, we do expect to see a continuing decrease for the remaining quarters in 2012. 
If I might turn you to Slide 22. We are adjusting our production and EBITDAX guidance to reflect the impact of the sale of our assets in the Barnett and Arkoma basins. This adjustment reduces our gas production to 1.09 Bcfe per day. It has no impact on our oil or natural gas liquids. EBITDAX guidance has been reduced by about $25 million to account for the loss of cash flow from the sale of our Barnett and Arkoma properties. 
And then down the middle of the page there, you can see no change for projected capital spending of $1.2 billion. We have broken out oil and NGLs on our rule of thumb metric to help in calculating price changes.
Finally, if I might turn you to Slide 23. Ralph just touched on this, but we have put a liquidity slide in the presentation. Good news is we have over $1.8 billion of liquidity. We expect to have no borrowings under our revolver at year end, and we expect to have the remainder of Arkoma and Barnett asset sale proceeds of approximately $75 million received here shortly. 
So before I turn it back over to Ralph, I'd just like to say, with strong production, continue to have a strong balance sheet and a low debt-to-EBITDA ratio. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ralph."

We think those are the 3 best basis in the country. We like our financial strength. We're set up to survive very easily in this environment and to thrive as environment turns around. In the meantime, we'll continue to grow oil and liquids productions. 
So we feel very good about what we are. It's been a great -- I want to complement our employees on their first 100 days, how well they did and how everything has just come together very smoothly, and we're proud to have the opportunity to represent our WPX employees. 
With that, that's the end of prepared remarks. Dave?"

Again, to do something, it's going to have to be very compelling. One of the areas I've mentioned many times on the road and in conferences that makes a lot of sense for us in addition to the current basin of the Bakken, if we could add there, is the wet window in the Utica shale. We think that would be a natural fit for our Marcellus team. We wouldn't have to add a new asset team. We could take our rigs and our dedicated completion crews interchangeably to the Utica from the Marcellus. In fact, the drilling and where they join in the Utica Shale right now is actually closer to our Canonsburg office than our Susquehanna drilling. So that's a natural fit for us. So we continue to look at that area. We understand it geologically. We think there are a number players there that might have more than that they can say grace over, that we might have an opportunity to maybe do some drill-to-earns with, and also some other producers that have not really -- not built to do large-scale efficiency type drilling like we do. So we might be able to get some opportunities that way. So that's an area that continues to have attraction to us. Again, it would have to be compelling to do anything there.

So what we're required to submit to initiate that permitting process has been completed on our side, very pleased with the effort around that over the past year. The logjam, of course, is over on the regulatory side. I think the good news is whenever we've had been in the pinch a little bit, we've been able to accelerate some things through that process, and so we have not had any idle time to date. We certainly would like to see that sieve open up a little bit. Currently, we've got about 2 -- I think 2 permits in front of each rig and so, perhaps, 60 to 90 days worth of lead time. Those aren't always the permits that you would like to have. But nonetheless, we've been able to stay out in front and avoid any standby time. We are expecting some breakthroughs very shortly just based on dialogues that we've had with the regulators there, the tribal involvement of late and the request, frankly, all the way to Secretary Salazar for additional resources to be plugged in to the process.

First, welcome to our second quarter 2012 earnings call, and thank you for your interest in WPX. A few reminders about WPX. We do have a premier portfolio and we've had some very strong production growth in all 3 product lines, with our oil production up 57% versus last year, our liquids production up 10% and our gas production also grew up 8 -- grew 8%. And when the commodity environments we can increase our gas volume production growth quite a bit and go back in the double-digit gas production growth. 
Our existing portfolio 18.5 3 TCF [sic] reserves disability to go all 3 product lines without any new investments for many years in the future. We're choosing not to go gas as much as we could right now due to low commodity environment. We continue to have tremendous flexibility in our capital spending up or down without losing our leases. As you've seen earlier this year, we significantly decreased our capital budget. We are a technical and low-cost leader. Our balance sheet remains very strong, particularly compared to our peers with about $1.9 billion liquidity. This gives us a position of strength to grow in our core areas and also new areas as we see compelling opportunity and we're very excited to say that we've entered some new areas. We don't have a lot of detail we can give you on that, but we increased our capital primarily because of our opportunities we see through our exploration team to grow in horizontal oil plays, new plays. 
It's part of our natural progression as ANP company, a stand-alone company to enter new oil plays much earlier and we're excited about that. 
By choice and design, we think we are in the best oil basin ini the nation in the Bakken, the best gas and liquid basin in Piceance and really exclusively to WPX, but we are exclusively the best in the Piceance, and we are the best gas basin in the nation in Marcellus. 
Let's flip to Slide 3 or 4 please. Same quarter highlights. Our employees are focused on what they control, and so are we, which is our production growth and our cost. And so we can't control such as the commodity prices currently are weak, international domestic economies. Thus, we'er focusing in our plan, which is our production side and our cost side. And I'm very pleased to report, we're executing on that plan with our combined year-to-date oil and gas -- oil and liquids production up 24%. 
As I mentioned, domestic gas is up 8%, and the Piceance is still receiving in what is a weak NGL margin of 66% per Mcf uplifts. So even a very weak NGL market, we're getting quite a bit of uplift in the Piceance. 
Looking solely at the Bakken, our production in oil was up 83%, quite an achievement, and our cost returning lower, our LOEs down 6% and our combined basis on gathering, processing and transportation costs are down 10%.  
Our EBITDAX is over $500 million for 6 months. And as mentioned as Ronald talked about, we continue to have superior liquidity compared to our peers with over $1.9 billion in liquidity side. And we're now deploying additional capital in new oil-focused plays, which we are very excited to do as a team.
Slide 5. Just very quickly. Reminder, the Bakken we think is a world-class oil basin and our results continue to show as we expected through our exploration team, which is also the team that's leading us to these new plays that were located in the best remaining undeveloped reservoir in the Bakken play. 
Slide 6. We're pleased with this reservoir and our performance so far, with early time well results well above our acquisition thesis and confirming again that we're in the best part of the play. 
For July -- for June 12, our net barrels production a day was $11,300 barrels a day approximately, which is a 74% increase over June of 2011. Our performance is improving.
4 of our 6 drilling rigs have been converted to new efficency rigs and 2 more are in the transit. We have our dedicated frac crews in place and are reducing time and cost. But as you've heard from other operators, and you've seen in our capital increase today, there's substantial upward pressure on cost to the first quarter of this year, which continued in the second quarter, but we feel they have peaked in the second quarter. 
Based on our experience today, part of our capital increase 75 million is for additional drilling completion of facility cost in the Bakken. 
There's unique issues driving our performance and strategy that we feel will go away, but there's a new operator, just taken over operations slightly over a year ago. It takes a while to become an established operator in this basin. 
So for the first 3 quarters, what we've been facing is basically saving mode. Since we've ceased operations a year ago, we've been transitioning to much -- we will transition to much more efficient pad drilling. But initially, we've been bouncing around from lease to lease to make sure we hold our leases. 
The good news is we only have 10 wells to drill and have all leases held by production and all those wells -- or majority of those wells will be clean completely by the end of third quarter and definitely this year. 
For the 2013, thus the majority of our drilling will be from pads and we'll be done with the long rig moves, we'll be done with doing initial roads, infrastructure pads, production facilities, et cetera, all that will go away. And we build our of preferred vendors, contracts and equipment to where we like for Piceance-type efficiency model. 
We believe we're now at the front of the Q or near the front of the Q from services from our vendors. We can optimize our service equipment. I've mentioned
4 of our 6 rigs are now fit for purpose rigs, but 2 of those just recently came on. So we have not experienced of those yet. We've high-graded our directional drilling services. We've got our completions and operation efficiencies underway, and we've optimized our completion design. 
We also put in field infrastructure, the one I talked about last time, the Van Hook Fields construction will be done in the fourth quarter, and that will eliminate flaring, trucking of our oil and, water and among other things, and thus same more money. 
So we expect as we get done with the one-and-gone lease saving development phase later this year, that we'll be able to lower our well cost by about $2 million. 
Also you should see that we do by operating on the reservation, just generally person, associated fees and other items. There's about a $500,000 per well additional cost by operating the reservation. The good news is the reservoirs are superior. And we use and believe in 65% ceramic and 35% profit mix. That adds about $1 million to our wells. But the slide, I'll show you in a few minutes. We believe that results in superior wells and superior production and superior reserves and eliminates any problems down the road when the sand could get crushed to be using 100% sand.
Slide 7. 4 of the 6 planned rigs have been converted to new fit for purpose. And as I mentioned, just a couple of those have been delivered. So we really have not began that efficiency-type drilling. As I mentioned, that will happen later in the third quarter, beginning the fourth quarter. But our reserves in production continued grabs in our expectations. 
Despite the busy slide, but let me walk you through a couple of things. 11 wells -- we spent 11 wells in the second quarter. And you can see the light green and the orage, the colors there, we put 6 wells on first sales. We're drilling from a first multi-well pad and project has begun, but we're doing for the lock in Three Forks and that's in the red hash marks on the map. 
Our best well result from -- during pad drilling has gone down to 25 days. Averaging 30 days right now, but we already start to achieve 25 days, gives me confidence will drive our well cost. 
We delineated our field or we continue to delineate our field and we proofed up some assets in the south. Our first completion was much higher than we expected. Our peak months was 1,039 barrels of oil a day versus our plan of 700 barrels or less, so we're very encouraged about the 7 part. 
Currently, we're stepping out to the West to lineate  the acreage there, and we have -- we should have results on those in the third quarter report. And we're improving up our Three Forks formation. 4 wells are waiting on completion, but we do have 2 that are on and flying better than we thought with higher EURs and we expected. So we continue to see good opportunities or good results from our drilling here. And really, we've been drilling with older equipment, with not the frac crews we wanted and many other services. So as we move to what we call the Piceance, we'll think we'll do much better. 
Slide 8. We believe that our Anchorage and our use of 65% ceramic and 35% sand as our profit provide superior results and peers, only that some of our peers use. 
This does add about $1 million cost, as I mentioned. But if you look at the performance here, our performance for the wells easily offsets the additional cost. You can see on a 180-day rate, the WPX is superior to all the other operators out there. And this is a substantial about 85% of activity on the reservation. 
You can also see that our EUR comparison is higher and that is on NBO basis to 640 and if you create that to an NBOE basis, it's 706, which is not curve do you see previous-type curves. That also is includes in our piece some delineation wells to the south, some Three Forks wells and delineation we're beginning to the West and the East. So as we stay more in a sweet spot, really that will trend up. These are all wells that are completed on the Indian reservation. We're all Middle Bakken long laterals and we believe 180-day rate and this is calculated by third party, IHS data public, it's public data. So this is all public that you can go out there and see that are wells are doing better than our peers. 
Also, we believe the 180-day rate is a much superior rate to look at versus just the 24-hour IP. Slide 8 -- Slide 9. In the first quarter, our WTI discount was about 16%, WTI. Second quarter that's decrease to about 12% to 14%. 
And also on absolute basis, artificially improve by $4 per barrel. We expect this will improve as the year goes on by $2 for the balanced year for basin of 10% to $11. 
As we see our Van Hook Gathering System completed, we think on the Van Hook barrels, that will save us additional $4 and that should be completed by the  fourth quarter. We also continue to make progress in our rails agreement as we talked about last time. it's still on fly where we think for the 2013 to 2015 period, we'll be up to 20,000 barrels of oil,  we can move on the rail. 
Turning to Piceance Slide 10. It is a world-class gas and oil. An NGO plya and it is for us. Some others don't have the position we had. But our geologic position is unique, relative to other operators and we're the only operator scale to be efficient. We drilled over 4,000 wells, we have 10,000 remaining locations, we have the lowest structure. I'ts by our technology and our operational, coupled with our enhanced liquids processing. 
And superior liquid contract sales, as you'll see in our barrels. Net realized barrels and we'er unique and I do believe as the prices turn the WPX is in a unique position to which our gas production, particularly in the Piceance. 
Slide 11. Update on the second quarter. We did spent 53 wells, 123 wells to the second quarter per year-to-date. We've had a record gross operating production of almost $950 million a day. Higher volumes and a stronger NGL uplift of with.66 per Mcf, in that second quarter and that was despite the vary weak price that you these out there. 
We continue to gain efficiencies, with your slide will show you. Show even in the Highlands, and we're not really drilling much in the Highlands, but area, we've developed simultaneous operations, which as you know, we've been in a valley where we drill complete, produced stimulate on the same path at the same time. We've glenn the Highlands for the first time, leverage the value efficiencies that we have. And we actually have done a Iran Goltzwell in a record day, driling up 8.5 days and the average Ryan Gulch wells are now taking revenue 11 to 12 base, that was about 25 days 3 years ago. So it's a signifcant there in the improvement there in the wrangeled area. And a good opportunity for us is when you begin to deliver in a much larger scale. We also have new valley recognition projects in the mangoes in Niobrara. Third party results are very encouraging. I have another slide on this, in our opportunities later. But there've about 27 horizontal wells drilled by other operators. So far, our first horizontal wells will spread this month or next month and have hopefully completion by the end of the year. So we're excited about that as we move forward and I'll talk about this again in a few minutes. 
Slide 12. The efficiencies continue year after year after year. In the Piceance, we continue to set drilling records. It's a relentless drive this team has for efficiency and our value well cost have actually been flat the last couple of years. 
When as you know, there's inconsiderable upside pressure in all basins we have been managed to efficiencies to keep our costs flat or slightly down. It's done by our performance in optimization and from active vendor negotiations, and also great vendors that we have. 
We're forecasting our Ryan Gulch wells are not going to move less than $3 million. And I mentioned how much the drilling time has come down, so it should be substantially below that. 
We have a continuous reduction in spud-to-spud times and every time you save a day up in the Piceance, you're saving $40,000 to $60,000. Our low-end rig count actually had a side benefit of allowing us to lower our average day rate for our fleet and prepare us for efficient ramp up, and we've done many other things to optimize as the team always does. 
Slide 13. If you look at our weighted average barrel, it was $36.27 in the second quarter. Even with historically low ethane and propane prices in the same quarter, I mentioned the $0.66 per Mcf uplift. If the new Willow Creek deal or if the Willow Creek new contract, which kicks in automatically in 2013, was in place in the second quarter, that uplift who have been 70 -- $0.72. So even in one of the worst environments have been out there for ethane in quite awhile, if you annualize that on a fourth quarter basis, that would have been about $16 million improvement to EBITDAX for the year. And we believe, going forward, as we mentioned before, that we think that's going to be more like $25 million to $35 million improvement in the future. 
We feel we're in good position to continue to realize significant valuable from our NGLs based on our advantage long-term T&F rates, and all of our products, more importantly, offprice and not subject to Conway. 
Slide 14. Since our last call on May 3, gas prices have come up somewhat, about 7%. On calendar '13, it's $3.73, and I believe and our team believes that we are one of the best positioned companies to respond to the coming opportunity to rapidly deploy rigs, an increased production when gas prices recover. 
We believe that the Piceance size rigs will be available versus rigs that are going to be needed for the longer drilling horizontal gas shale plays. You can see on this graph, we've done it before. We have about 30% -- 31% CAGR growth rate in the Piceance for 2004 and 2008, and as you can see, we increased our BCF production by about 157 BCF from '04 to '08. 
We're at so much more efficient now. We can drill, do the same kind of growth with only 17 rigs versus 26 rigs the last time we did it, and we're given example here if we start off with a 8 rigs and you want to move up, 17 rigs. That would be up 12% CAGR for the Piceance we can do and the total production growth of about 155 BCF. Really, same amount of production growth. We believe that we have that in place and can take advantage of that. We believe we can get the rigs. We have well over 200 permits in hand and ready to drill. 
Our infrastructure, as you know, is in place. The capacity to move the gas north, south, west is in plays. Our staff has done up to 27 rigs before, so they can easily handle 17 rigs. The support structure is there. We have the lowest drilling completion and operating cost from the basin and we can wrap up sooner. We think that anybody else can in other basin. We can utilize available rigs. As I mentioned, I believe the Piceance size rigs would be available and we can build off to smart knowledge from our prior ramp up. 
So due to our people, our knowledge, our experience our low cost of operations, our low development costs and our infrastructure already built out. We are one of the best gas storage just waiting to explode when the prices are right. 
Our final basin is the Marcellus is Slide 15. As I mentioned before, our technical team which is leading us to the new areas. We increased our capital 4. Also purposely got in this primarily for Susquehanna County part of Marcellus. We like what we've seen in Marcellus. We continue to have great results. We also believe the team has cracked the code on lower drilling completion costs and the Piceance model inefficiency is starting to kick in, and it's actually kicking in there. We do remain frustrated with the operations of the laser pipeline in terms of reliability and pressure. But we believe our former sister company, WPZ, which acquired the system in February will bring the system at the par and hopefully by the end of this year, early next year. 
Slide 16. As I mentioned, the Piceance model is taking hold in Marcellus. We have transition to new rigs both specifically for Pennsylvania on track to average 3 rigs this year. Our first Ryan, Rick came in as planned at the end of May.  2 hours are scheduled to come in later this year, the end of this month and the 1st of November. We've reduced our completion cost. It has been a major focus for us and they're down 30% from last year, a significant progress made, Our net production increased 19% from the first quarter to the second quarter, actual at June. 
We believe that production continues to be impacted by very highlighting pressures and erratic operational performance by laser, which the pressures have been running between 600 pounds to 800 pounds. We do estimate our current net production of $70 million a day, could have been about $30 million a day higher, absent any infrastructure constraints. If we can see the problems we continue to have there. And we are poised to ramp up quickly when the gas price rebound.  Not as quickly as of the us, but Marcellus would be in pretty good shape. 
Slide 17. I'm looking at the efficiency model, how you see this. This was almost a mirror of what we saw starting with the Piceance and the Piceance continues to do a spread of rig release time has continued drop and average an all-time low about 16 days in the second quarter. Early in the play this was a closure to 30 days, so great improvement by the team. The 60% improvement from where we started just 2 years ago. 
As I mentioned, completion costs have been reduced to operational changes, better frac designs and working with our vendors and getting more partnerships them. We're down about 20% on average since the beginning of the year. And Marcellus just looks like an absolute great example WPX transporting to P&L model to the Marcellus and we believe this will start to occur and begin to occur in the Bakken as they crack the code also. 
Slide 18, let's look internationally briefly. As you know, we owned 600 interest in Altco.
I do want to stress and continue to stress that APCO represents less than 5% of our total production reserves and. No domestic capital spin on 
APCO. Also on the upside, we do have about 250,000 exposed to the Bakken Shale. there was a government distress this week.
Now the car require an annual approval oil and gas company's investment plan. Here's our thoughts on than, early thoughts, we've invested consistently and significantly develop our holdings over the year. We basically redeploy our cash down there into reinvestment. We need to see the detailed requirements from process yet to be published by government. It appears the degree is to formalize rules that the government is already posing on the industries, which some of those are like flash controls. It seems this is move by the government for tigther controls, and involvement with the country's energy resources. But I mentioned we've always, we've always redeployed our capital down there, internally, not the domestic capital.
We have investment programs built into our concession agreements already. So we have that already set up. and few of these are still being approved as the concessions remain extended. So we hope that we -- that what we have in place already is very satisfactory to the new government rules, and time will tell on that.
Looking at our operational update, for all of 2012, we're going to do 33 development wells and 5 exploration wells and these are in the traditional targets at Tordillo and formations. Production-site from results in this area have been in line with expectations. As you know, we have 2 wells on production, the Bakken more and the vertical side. Current plans already call for a multistage fracs of the CAS x-4 before the end of the year. So we continue to prosecute and understand what we have in the Bakken between what we're doing and what the industry is doing. 
In Colombia, we annouced our first discovery and it allows 32 blocks, where we currently had a 20% working unit. Interest 1 well. That is on production, as average about 2,400 barrels of oil a day since July. Our second well has found prospect paid in 3 formations and the casing has been set. Completion rig is in location and it will commence testing of these formations. And 440, we've also completed our seismic specs and drilling there in 2013. So we continue to do good in the operational side on the Atco. 
Slide 20. We are excited to discuss a couple of existing future opportunities in our early entry in our promising new play. As I mentioned, as pure coming we are diversifying our strategy to use exploration and land earlier and get into plays earlier. For more economically, we think this will be a nice balance to the traditional A&D work we have done. opportunities that ultimately come through this year, we'll represent about 60% to 65% of the $200 million capital increase.
Slide 21. First, let me remind you that an existing resource we control in the Piceance base and we made it significant side and what's called the gas formation. We own 250,000 drills, about 150,000 net acres. If you look at the opposite operators and the number of things going on out there, that could represent 20 to 32 TCF of unplug resource potential based on results of other operators of 67 bcf a well. Our current activity is we had an initial vertical test on last year and we frac one zone and uploaded $1 million per day. We have 5 to 7 additional in the remaining to be tested and that and as I mentioned, our first quarter horizontal well is planned for the third quarter of this year and it's going to be offset to that vertical stage. Too that vertical well. Other operators have drilled or spread 27 wells in this area, all horizontal typos, with additional 65 locations per minute. And again, the wells are being reported 67 Bcf range. None of this business is in our resource potential, our currently resource potential 18.5 Tcf of 3 TCF of 3 P reserve. Or and what I mention is that what we currently have in the Piceance of 10,000 remaining locations. So this represents significant gas upside to us when the time would be right and we hold it by production, we can develop when we want to. 
Slide 22. We also made a Mancos gas discovery inthe San Juan basin, were we lead the charges and made the discovery. We did number of vertical cast in the Mancos, extends it reservoir and geological assessments. Basically, the bottom line is we drilled 2 gas horizontal Mancos wells, the first one looks like it's going to be between 4.5 to 5.5 BCF, the second one between 5 to 6 BCF. We control a substantial amount of Mancos rights held by production of 61,000 acres. Have a number of 700 locations. On a gross basis, it looks like we have a 3 Tcf of gross exposure, which should be about 1.8 Tcf to us. Again, none of these numbers are in our resource potential. We look to prosecute this at the time and the San Juan basin team has been drilling there from a number years. So that's a right time, at the good upside for us. 
Finally, we did enter -- we are entering or have entered new oil plays, 3 or 4 primary areas of interest to us. All of these are oil focus towards horizontal plays. We're very, very good of our positions, we like what we've done. Our capital budget by a $100 million, and that could go up even a little bit more, but not much, it wouldn't change guidance. 
We will begin testing this year, most of those wells will be vertical test. Initial well results are expected no later than mid 2013. Obviously, we have increased capital today and we did not increase production guidance, but it's not prudenterprise to increase production guidance on exploration time, but we're very excited where we are and where we ahead with these prospects and I think it's to going to see. Part of WPX you haven't seen before is our exploration and land team have got this in the right place in a more mature, these earlier entries in the places that aren't mature, but we think they're going to do pretty well. With that I'll turn it over to Rod."

And even with the impact from our hedge position, we realized approximately $3 per Mcf. As well we continue to see weakening in the price of our composite NGL barrel. Further impacting results worldwide basin differentials in the Bakken in the month of April. And while the differential somewhat normalized by June, the price accrued also retreated as so your net not much changed in the realized price over the quarter. We are still on plan to be meet our volume projections and currently looking very favorable in our outlook for oil and NGLs. Results were also impacted by non-cash impairments probables in the Powder River basin total approximately $65 million for the quarter, until impairments year-to-date of $117 million. 
Adjusting out these and unrealized mark-to-market gains tripled to our hedging program, we experienced an adjusted net loss from operations for the quarter of $30 million and $37 million year-to-date. 
Even in this challenging commodity environment, we had just over $0.25 billion in adjusted EBITDAX and $514 million year-to-date adjusted EBITDAX. 
Ralph previously mentioned, and while it is mentioned capital increases and while it is running ahead of previous estimates, we believe we are touring the corner on our cost in the Bakken and have may and will continue to make additional land purchases. 
Turning to Slide 26. That now brings us to our outlook for the year. While we did see significant pressure on prices in the second quarter, we are seeing gas strengthening, ethane propane prices are stronger, are looking stronger and should benefit us in the third quarter. 
As I indicated, we continue to feel good about our full-year production estimates. EBITDAX estimates are within our sensitivities and based on 7 31 script prices with what we realized to date, we would anticipate that our adjusted EBITDAX would probably be $85 million to $100 million lower than the original $1,175,000,000. 
As previously mentioned, we re increasing our capital expenditures estimate by approximately $200 million and this is related to the costs in the Bakken and some target anchorage acquisition that Ralph had mentioned. 
Turning to Slide 27. Second quarter liquidity remained strong. While we are seeing a higher spending and some pressure on cash flow for the low commodity prices, these were more than offset by the $300 million we received from the sale of our Barnett and Arkoma properties in the second quarter. Liquidity at the end of the quarter stood at approximately $1.9 billion. And again, as Ralph mentioned, we think we're positioned very well from a liquidity and a balance sheet standpoint as we ended the second quarter. 
And with that, I will turn it back over to Ralph to wrap up."

We've already continue to do this, we continue to grow our domestic oil production, 50% to 60%. As I mentioned first 6 months is up 57%. We are uniquely situated to ramp up gas production at the right price. We already one of the most efficient producers and we are seeing our gas cost basins trend lower. 
The Piceance deficiency is continuing to be best-in-class and the Marcellus team has cracked the efficiency growth. And I'd discussed, I really can't stress it out, when the time is right I believe and we believe, particularly in the Piceance, we can significantly grow our gas production as that one slide showed you how much we can do with less equivalent than we did in the past. 
We are going to maintain our top-tier balance sheet in this depressed environment, but the environment is getting a little bit better. As we continue to execute financial discipline in the Bakken, we expect several things happen. All of our acreage will be held by production. That is a great thing. We will have all fit-for-purpose rigs designed for the Bakken operation. 4 in now, 2 that recently came on, 2 more coming, they're all 6 will be there. We should begin pad drilling in the third quarter which should lower well cost ultimately by $2 million as efficiencies kick in. 
We'll complete our final gathering system for all of our oil and water and gas and none of that will have to be trucked. And in the future, we could probably and I believe we will be able to drill the same number of wells with one less rig. In other way was these rigs could be drilled -- the same amount of wells drill 5 rigs in the future sees efficiencies began to kick out, and that will make us.  When we do have rigs, we'll go to dig that there are more wells. And our new opportunities there in the Piceance, we're going to spread our Mancos horitizontal to just for gas to continue to evaluate this potential large gas. We're also continuing to maximize the liquids recovery. I did dimension the Powder River, but we are evaluating numerous oil prospects where we 140,000 acres of the price. We'll begin to participate in some of these prospects, continue to test our Argentina where we have 250,000 acres as I mentioned. And we'll begin testing the new exploration oil areas where we've investment approximately $100 million. We believe those things will -- as we do some vertical test and have some results early next year, hopefully, you'll be pleased with those results. And finally we'll continue to tell the WPX story that we have of our disciplined management team, our great balance sheet, our tremendous opportunities that the hold in-house today and our new oral -- horizontal expiration properties.

So we believe we can get down to $10.5 million, that's with the pad drilling and better completions and I'll let brian take over there for the. Why won't you answer the last part of that. But we should be able to drive it down to $10.5. Certainly, we're not happy where costs are at this point in time. Either I think you've seen some color around this perhaps from the other companies that have already released. 
We have drilled since we bought into the project about 45 wells, we have what we would consider to be I guess near final cost on about 30. Looking at the drivers of those actual cost versus what we've been targeting. As Ralph said, $10.5 million. I guess there's one area that we haven't really talk about that I would add a little color to. We feel like there's Ralph has mentioned the $2 million savings when we transitioned the pad drilling. Frankly, we feel like there's a couple of million dollars worth of savings associated with improving our contractor and vendor service quality of the wells that we drilled. Thus bar, there's still a lot of problems associated with executing on those wells, and I think it's generally driven by the demand for services in the Bakken. The services and the experience of those folks just have been running hard to catch up to the operator demand that exist in the basin. We seen pretty significant improvement on all fronts with respect to our rigs, our dedicated frac crew. And so again, we still believe that over time, as we get the pad drilling, as we take the problem wells out, which are fairly common early and aggressive growth basin like this, that we can take $2 to $2.5 million off of our current run rate. Ralph mentioned we're looking at $12.5 million as our estimate for well cost over the balance of this year, and we hope to drive that considerably lower as we get into pad drilling, which will be the prevailing mode of operation for us in 2013."

We've like to see things move at a much faster cliff. But at least up to this point, it's been managaela. We haven't had any rig idle time as a result of waiting on permits. Last, I think it was early in the year and into the maybe even the second quarter, the BLM form, a kind of permitting task force that was assisted and I think even partially funded by industry. And so they cleared the pretty significant backlog. As a part of that process, we got some 25 or 30 in essentially a very short timeframe, which gave us a nice inventory to stay in front of the rigs. But I think you've probably heard from some of the other operators since the task force went away, things to have slowed down again. On our side, we created about office that packed this issue with the first bought into the basin and so the good news for us is very vast majority of our prerequisite work is on has already been completed and so our permits are actually sitting in the pipeline either at the BLM or at the FDIC and so the short answer is it remains continuous review is manageable we've done our part our work is largely completed and up least up to this point in time, when things get tight we've been able to push things through the systems are currently we've got a couple of permits out in front of each of our rigs.

Thank you for your interest in WPX. A few reminders about WPX. We do have a premiere portfolio and have -- and we've had very strong production growth in all 3 product lines, with our oil production up 57% versus last year, our liquids production up 10% and our gas production also grew up 8 -- grew 8%. And when the commodity environment's right, we can increase that gas volume production growth quite a bit and go back in the double-digit gas production growth. 
Our existing portfolio of 18.5 3 Tcf (sic) [18.5 Tcfe 3P] of reserves disability to grow all 3 product lines without any new investments for many years in the future. We're choosing not to go gas as much as we could right now due to low commodity environment. 
We continue to have tremendous flexibility in our capital spending up or down without losing our leases. As you've seen earlier this year, we significantly decreased our capital budget. 
We are a technical and low-cost leader. Our balance sheet remains very strong, particularly compared to our peers with about $1.9 billion in liquidity. This gives us a position of strength to grow and -- in our core areas and also new areas as we see some compelling opportunity. And we're very excited to say we've entered some new areas. We don't have a lot of detail we can give you on that, but we increased our capital, primarily because of all opportunities we see through our exploration team to grow in horizontal oil plays, new plays. It's part of our natural progression as an E&P company, a stand-alone company to enter new oil plays much earlier, and we're excited about that. 
By choice and design, we think we are in the best oil basin in the nation in the Bakken; the best gas and liquid basin in the Piceance, it's really exclusively to WPX, but we are exclusively the best in the Piceance; and we're in the best gas basin in the nation in the Marcellus. 
Let's flip to Slide 3 -- or 4, please. Second quarter highlights. Our employees are focused on what they control, and so are we, which is our production growth and our cost. [indiscernible] we can't control such as the commodity prices currently or weak international and domestic economies. Thus, we're focusing on executing our plan, which is our production side and our cost side. And I'm very pleased to report, we're executing on that plan with our combined year-to-date oil and gas -- oil and liquids production up 24%. As I mentioned, domestic gas is up 8%. And the Piceance is still receiving in what is a weak NGL margin of $0.66 per Mcf NGL uplift. So even in a very weak NGL market, we're getting quite a bit of uplift in the Piceance. 
Looking solely at the Bakken, our production in oil was up 83%, quite an achievement, and our costs were trending lower. Our LOE is down 6%. And on a combined basis, our gathering, processing and transportation costs were down 10%.  
Our EBITDAX was over $500 million for the 6 months -- first 6 months. And as mentioned, as Rod will talk about, we continue to have superior liquidity compared to our peers with over $1.9 billion in liquidity side. And we're now deploying additional capital in new oil-focused plays, which we are very excited to do as a team.
Slide 5. Just very quickly. Reminder, the Bakken, we think, is a world-class oil basin, and our results continued to show, as we expected through our exploration team, which is also the team that's leading us into these new plays, that we're located in the best remaining undeveloped reservoir in the Bakken play. 
Slide 6. We're pleased with this reservoir and our performance so far, with early time well results well above our acquisition thesis and confirming again that we're in the best part of the play. 
For July -- for June 12, our net barrels of oil production a day was 11,300 barrels a day approximately, which is a 74% increase over June of 2011. Our performance is improving. 4 of our 6 drilling rigs have been converted to new efficiency rigs and 2 more are in the transit. We have our dedicated frac crews in place and are reducing time and costs. But as you've heard from other operators, and you've seen in our capital increase today, there's a substantial upward pressure on costs to the first quarter of this year, which continued in the second quarter, but we feel they have peaked in the second quarter. But based on our experience today, part of our capital increase, $75 million is for additional drilling completion and facility costs in the Bakken. 
There's some unique issues driving our performance and strategy that we feel will go away, but as a new operator, just taken over operations slightly over a year ago, it takes a while to become an established operator in this basin. So for the first 3 quarters, what we've been phasing is basically a lease saving mode. Since we've assumed operations a year ago, we've been transitioning to a much -- we will transition to a much more efficient pad drilling, but initially, we've been bouncing around from lease to lease to make sure we hold our leases. The good news is, we only have 10 more wells to drill and have all the leases held by production, and all those wells -- or majority of those wells will be completed by the end of third quarter and definitely this year. 
For 2013, thus the majority of our drilling will be from pads and we'll be done with the long rig moves, we'll be done with building the initial roads, infrastructures, pads, broken ax, production facilities, et cetera. All that will go away. And we've build our suite of preferred vendors, contracts and equipment to where we like for a Piceance-type efficiency model. 
We believe we're now at the front of the Q or near the front of the Q for services from our vendors. We can optimize our service equipment, and I've mentioned 4 of our 6 rigs are now the fit-for-purpose rigs, but 2 of those just recently came on. So we have not experienced the benefit of those yet. We've high-graded our directional drilling services. We've got our completions and operation efficiencies underway, and we've optimized our completion design. 
We also have put in field infrastructure, the one I talked about last time, the Van Hook Fields construction will be done in the fourth quarter, and that will eliminate flaring, trucking of our oil, water among other things, and thus, save more money. So we expect as we get done with the one-and-gone lease saving development phase later this year, we will be able to lower our well cost by about $2 million. 
Also, you should see that we do operate on the reservation, just generally for some associated fees and other items, there's about a $500,000 per well additional cost by operating the reservation. The good news is, the reservoirs are far superior. And we use and believe in 65% ceramic and 35% profit mix. That adds about $1 million to our wells, but as the slide I'll show you in a few minutes, we believe that results in superior wells and superior production, superior reserves and eliminates any problems down the road when the sand could get crushed if using 100% sand.
Slide 7. 4 of the 6 planned rigs have been converted to new fit-for-purpose. And as I mentioned, just a couple of those have been delivered. [indiscernible] have not began the efficiency-type drilling. As I mentioned, that will happen later in the third quarter, beginning in the fourth quarter. But our reserves in production continued to outperform our expectations. 
This slide's a busy slide, but let me walk you through a couple of things. 11 wells -- we spud 11 wells in the second quarter, and you can see in the light green and the orange, the colors there, we put 6 wells on first sales. We're drilling from a first multi-well pad infill density project has begun, but we're doing 4 Middle Bakken and Three Forks eventually, and that's in the red hash marks on the map. 
Our best well result from -- during pad drilling has gone down to 25 days, averaging 30 days right now, but we already started to achieve 25 days, gives me confidence will drive our well cost. 
We delineated our field -- or we continue to delineate our field, and we proved up some assets in the south. Our first completion was much higher than we expected. Our peak month was 1,039 barrels of oil a day versus our plan of 700 barrels or less, so we're very encouraged about the 7 part. 
Currently, we're stepping out to the West and East to delineate the acreage there, and we'll have good -- we should have results on those in the third quarter report. And we're proving up our Three Forks formation. 4 wells are waiting on completion, but we do have 2 that are on and are performing better than we thought with higher EURs than we expected. So we continue to see good opportunities or good results from our drilling here. And really, we've been drilling with older equipment, with not the frac crews we wanted and many other services. So as we move to what we call the Piceance efficiency model, we think we'll do much better. 
Slide 8. We believe that our acreage and our use of 65% ceramic and 35% sand as our profit provide superior results, and peers -- only to some of our peers use. This does add about $1 million to our cost, as I mentioned. But if you look at the performance here, our performance for the wells easily offsets the additional cost. You can see on a 180-day rate that WPX is superior to all the other operators out there. And this is a substantial mix, about 85% of the activity on the reservation. 
You can also see that our EUR comparison is higher, and that is on a NBO basis to 640, and if you equate that to an NBOE basis, it's 706, which is the -- in our type curve you see in previous-type curves. That also is -- includes in our piece some delineation wells to the South, some Three Forks wells and some delineation we're beginning to the West and the East. So as we stay more in the sweet spot, that -- really, that will trend up. These are all wells that are completed on the Indian reservation. They're all Middle Bakken and long laterals, and we believe in 180-day rate and this is calculated by a third-party IHS data, it's public data. So this is all public that you can go out there and see that our wells are doing better than our peers. Also, we believe the 180-day rate is a much superior rate to look at versus just the 24-hour IP. 
Slide 8 -- Slide 9. In the first quarter, our WTI discount was about 16%, [indiscernible] WTI. Second quarter, that's decreased to about 12% to 14%. And also on absolute basis, our differential improve by $4 per barrel. We expect this will improve as the year goes on by $2 for the balance of the year for a basis of 10% to $11. 
As we see Van Hook Gathering System completed, we think on the Van Hook barrels, that will save us additional $4, and that should be completed by the fourth quarter. 
And we also continue to make progress on our future rail sales agreements. As we talked about last time, it's still on the slide where we think for the 2013 to 2015 period, we'll be up to 20,000 barrels of oil we can move on the rail. 
Turning to the Piceance, Slide 10. It is a world-class gas and oil, an NGL play, and it is for us. Some others don't have the position we have. Our geologic position is unique relative to the other operators, and we're the only operator scaled to be efficient. We drill over 4,000 wells. We have 10,000 remaining locations. We have the lowest cost structure, it's driven by our technology and our operational efficiencies, coupled with our enhanced liquids processing. 
We have superior liquid contract sales, as you'll see in our barrels -- our net realized barrels, and we're just in unique -- and I do believe as the gas prices churn that WPX is in a unique position to reach our gas production, particularly in the Piceance. 
Slide 11. Update on the second quarter. We did spud 53 wells, 123 wells to the second quarter for year-to-date. We've had a record gross operating production of almost 950 million a day. Our higher volumes and strong NGL uplift was $0.66 per Mcf, in the second quarter, and that was despite the very weak price that we saw out there. 
We continue to gain efficiencies, which the next slide will show you, even in the Highlands, and we're not drilling much in the Highlands, but the Ryan Gulch area, we've developed simultaneous operations, which as you know, we've done in the Valley where we drill, complete, produce, stimulate on the same path at the same time. We've gone in the Highlands for the first time, leveraged the value efficiencies that we have. And we actually have done a Ryan Gulch well in a record day, drilling of 8.5 days, and the average Ryan Gulch wells are now taking 11 to 12 days, that was about 25 days 3 years ago. So it's a significant improvement there in the Ryan Gulch area, and a good opportunity for us as we -- when we begin to deliver there in a much larger scale. 
We also have new value recognition projects in the Mancos and Niobrara. Third-party results are very encouraging. I have another slide on this and our new opportunities later. But there've been about 27 horizontal wells drilled by other operators so far. Our first horizontal wells will spud this month or next month and have hopefully a completion by the end of the year. So we're excited about that as we move forward, and I'll talk about this again in a few minutes. 
Slide 12. The efficiencies continue year after year after year. In the Piceance, we continue to set drilling records. It's a relentless drive this team has for efficiency. And our Valley well costs have actually been flat the last couple of years, when, as you know, there's been considerable upside pressure in all basins. We've been -- managed through efficiencies to keep our costs flat or slightly down. It's done by a performance in optimization and from active vendor negotiations, and also the great vendors that we have. 
We're forecasting our Ryan Gulch wells are now going to move less than $3 million. And I mentioned how the -- how much the drilling time has come down there, so it should be substantially below that. 
We have a continuous reduction in spud-to-spud times and every time you save a day up in the Piceance, you're saving $40,000 to $60,000. 
Our lowering rig count has actually had a side benefit of allowing us to lower our average day rate for our fleet and prepare us for efficient ramp-up, and we've done many other things to optimize as the team always does. 
Slide 13. If you look at our weighted average barrel, it was $36.27 in the second quarter. Even with historically low ethane and propane prices in the same quarter, I mentioned the $0.66 per Mcf uplift. If the new Willow Creek deal -- or if the Willow Creek new contract, which kicks in automatically in 2013, was in place in the second quarter, that uplift would have been $0.72. So even in one of the worst environments that's been out there for ethane in quite a while, if you annualize that on a 4 quarter basis, that would have been about $16 million improvement to EBITDAX for the year. And we believe, going forward, as we mentioned before, that we think that's going to be more like $25 million to $35 million improvement in the future. 
We feel we're in a good position to continue to realize significant value from our NGLs based on our advantage long-term T&F rates and all of our products, more importantly, our price off Mount Belvieu and not subject to Conway. 
Slide 14. Since our last call on May 3, gas prices have come up somewhat, about 7%. On calendar '13, it's $3.73. And I believe and our team believes that we are one of the best positioned companies to respond to the coming opportunity to rapidly deploy rigs, an increased production when gas prices recover. We believe that the Piceance size rigs will be available versus rigs that are going to be needed for the longer drilling horizontal gas shale plays. 
You can see on this graph, we've done it before, we had about a 30% -- 31% CAGR growth rate in the Piceance from 2004 to 2008. And you can see we increased our Bcf production by about 157 Bcf from '04 to '08. 
With us so much more efficient now, we can drill -- do the same kind of growth with only 17 rigs versus 26 rigs the last time we did it, and we give an example here, if we start off with 8 rigs in year 1 and to move out to ultimately 17 rigs. That would be a 12% CAGR for the Piceance we could do, and the total production growth about 155 Bcf, grow the same amount of production growth. We believe that we have that in place and can take advantage of that. We believe we can get the rigs. We have well over 200 permits in hand and ready to drill. Our infrastructure, as you know, is in place. The capacity to move the gas North, South, West and East is in place. Our staff has done up to 27 rigs before, so they can easily handle 17 rigs. The support structure is there. We have the lowest drilling completion and operating costs in the basin, and we can ramp up sooner we think than anybody else can in any other basin. We can utilize available rigs. As I mentioned, I believe, the Piceance size rigs would be available, and we can build up to smart knowledge from a prior ramp up. So due to our people, our knowledge, our experience, our low cost of operations, our low final and development costs and our infrastructure already built out, we are one of the best gas stories just waiting to explode when the prices are right. 
Our final basin is the Marcellus, it's Slide 15. As I mentioned before, our technical team, which is leading us to the new areas that we increased our capital for, also purposely got this in the primarily Susquehanna County part of the Marcellus. We like what we've seen in the Marcellus. We continue to have great results. We also believe the team has cracked the code on lower drilling completion costs and the Piceance model efficiencies, it's starting to kick in, it's actually kicking in there. 
We do remain frustrated with the operations at the Laser pipeline in terms of reliability and pressure. We believe our former sister company, WPZ, which acquired the system in February, will bring the system at the par and hopefully, by the end of this year, early next year. 
Slide 16. As I mentioned, the Piceance model is currently taking hold in Marcellus. We have transitioned to new rigs built specifically for Pennsylvania, they're on track to average 3 rigs this year. Our first Orion [ph] rig came in as planned at the end of May. 2 others are scheduled to come in later this year, the end of this month and the 1st of November. 
We've reduced our completion cost. It's been a major focus for us, and they're down 30% from last year, a significant progress made. Our net production increased 19% from the first quarter to the second quarter, actually right ending at June. 
We believe that production continues to be impacted by the very highlighting pressures and erratic operational performance by Laser, which under pressures have been running between 600 pounds to 800 pounds. But we do estimate our current net production of $70 million a day could have been about $30 million a day higher and absent any infrastructure constraints. We can see the problems we continue to have there. And we are poised to ramp up quickly when the gas price rebound. Not as quickly as the Piceance, but the Marcellus would be in pretty good shape also.
Slide 17. Looking at the efficiency model, how you see this, this is almost a mirror of what we saw starting out with the Piceance and the Piceance continues to do. Spread of rig release time has continued to drop, on average an all-time low about 16 days in the second quarter. Early in the play, this was closer to 30 days, so great improvement by the team. The 60% improvement from where we started just 2 years ago. 
As I mentioned, the completion costs have been reduced through operational changes, better frac designs and working with our vendors and getting more partnerships them. We're down about 20% on average since the beginning of the year. And the Marcellus just looks like an absolute great example of WPX transporting the Piceance model to the Marcellus, and we believe this will start to occur and begin to occur in the Bakken as they crack the code also. 
Slide 18, let's look internationally briefly. As you know, we own 600% interest in Apco. I do want to stress and continue to stress that Apco represents less than 5% of our total production reserves and for self funding. No domestic capital spend on Apco. Also on the upside, we do have about 250,000 [indiscernible] exposed to the Vaca Muerta Shale. 
There was a government decree issued this week. Now requiring an annual approval of oil and gas companies' investment plans. Here's our thoughts on that, early thoughts, we've invested consistently and significantly developed our holdings over the years. We've basically redeployed our cash down there into reinvestment. We need to see the detailed requirements from process yet to be published by the government. It appears the decree is to formalize rules that the government's already imposing on the industries, which some of those are like price controls. It seems this is a move by the government for tighter controls and involvement in development of the country's energy resources, but as I've mentioned, we've always redeployed our capital down there, internally, not the domestic capital. We have investment programs built into our concession agreements already, so we have that already set up. Some of them which have been earned, and few of these are still being approved as the concessions remain extended. So we hope that we -- that what we have in place already is very satisfactory to the new government rules, and well, just time will tell on that.
Looking at our operational update, in the Neuquen Basin for all of 2012, we're going to do 33 development wells and 5 exploration wells, and these are in the traditional targets at Tordillo and [indiscernible] Formations. Productions from results in this area have been in line with expectations. As you know, we have 2 wells on production, the Vaca Muerta and the vertical side. Current plans are to call for a multistage fracs of the CAS x-4 before the end of the year. So we continue to prosecute and understand what we have in the Vaca Muerta between what we're doing and what the industry is doing. 
In Colombia, we announced our first discovery in Llanos 32 block, where we currently have a 20% working in it, interest on the Maniceno #1 well. That is on production, it's average about 2,400 barrels of oil a day since July. Our second well has been -- has found prospective pay in 3 formations, and the casing has been set. Completion rig is in location, and it will commence testing of these formations. And Llanos 40, we've also completed our seismic inspection and drilling there in 2013. So we continue to do good in the operational side on the Apco.
Slide 20. We are excited to discuss a couple of existing future opportunities in our early entry into promising new plays. As we mentioned, as pure play and peak coming, we are diversifying our strategy to use exploration in land earlier and get into plays earlier. And for more economically, we think this will be a nice balance to the traditional A&D work we have done. If all renew opportunities that ultimately come through this year, it will represent about 60% to 65% of the $200 million capital increase.
Slide 21. But first, let me remind you of an existing resource we control in the Piceance base and we made it -- we have significant upside in what's called the Mancos/Niobrara gas formation. We own 250,000 gross, about 150,000 net acres. If you look at the opposite operators and the number of things going on out there, that could represent 20 to 30 Tcf of unbooked resource potential based on results of other operators of 67 Bcf a well. Our current activity is we had an initial vertical test on last year and we fraced 1 zone and half-loaded 1.5 million per day. We have 5 to 7 additional intervals remaining to be tested in there. And as I mentioned, our first horizontal well is planned for the third quarter of this year, and it's going to be the offset to that vertical study -- to that vertical well. 
Other operators have drilled or spud 27 wells in this area, all horizontal type wells, with additional 65 locations permitted. And again, the wells are being reported in the 6 to 7 Bcf range. None of this is in our resource potential, our current resource potential, 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves or and what I mentioned is that what we currently have in the Piceance of 10,000 remaining locations. So this represents significant gas upside to us when the time would be right, and we hold it by production, we can develop when we want to. 
Slide 22. We also made a Mancos gas discovery in the San Juan Basin, where we led the charge and made the discovery. We did a number of vertical tests in the Mancos, extensive reservoir and geological assessments. Basically, the bottom line is, we drilled 2 grassroot horizontal Mancos wells, the first one looks like it's going to be between 4.5 to 5.5 Bcf; the second one, between 5 to 6 Bcf. We control a substantial amount of Mancos rights held by production of 61,000 acres, have a number of -- 700 gross 3P locations. On a gross basis, it looks like we have about 3 Tcf of gross exposure, which should be about 1.8 Tcf to us. Again, none of these numbers are in our resource potential. We look to prosecute this at the right time, and the San Juan Basin team has been drilling there for a number years. So at the right time, it's going to be a good upside for us. 
Finally, we did enter -- we are entering or have entered new oil plays, 3 to 4 primary areas of interest to us. All of these are oil focused horizontal plays. We're feeling very good about our positions, we like what we've done. We increased our capital budget by a $100 million, and that could go up even a little bit more, but not much, it wouldn't change guidance. We will begin testing this year, most of those will be vertical test. Initial well results are expected no later than mid-2013. Obviously, we have increased capital today, and we did not increase production guidance, but it's not prudent to increase production guidance on exploration time, but we're very excited where we are and where we're headed with these prospects, and I think it's to going to see part of WPX you haven't seen before as our exploration and land team have done this in the right plays that are more mature, these are earlier entries in the plays that aren't mature, but we think they're going to do pretty well. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rod."

And even with the impact from our hedge position, we realized approximately $3 per Mcf. As well, we continue to see weakening in the price of our composite NGL barrel, further impacting results worldwide basin differentials in the Bakken in the month of April. And while the differential somewhat normalized by June, the price accrued also retreated, so your net not much changed in the realized price over the quarter. We are still on plan to meet our volume projections and currently looking very favorable in our outlook for oil and NGLs. Results were also impacted by noncash impairments to probables in the Powder River Basin, totaling approximately $65 million for the quarter, and total impairments year-to-date of $117 million. Adjusting out these and unrealized mark-to-market gains that tripled to our hedging program, we experienced an adjusted net loss from operations for the quarter of $30 million and $37 million year-to-date. 
Even in this challenging commodity environment, we had just over $0.25 billion in adjusted EBITDAX and $514 million year-to-date adjusted EBITDAX. 
Ralph previously mentioned, and while it is -- mentioned capital increases, and while it is running ahead of previous estimates, we believe we are turning the corner on our cost in the Bakken and have may and will continue to make additional land purchases. 
Turning to Slide 26. That now brings us to our outlook for the year. While we did see significant pressure on prices in the second quarter, we are seeing gas strengthening, ethane and propane prices are stronger -- are looking stronger and should benefit us in the third quarter. 
As I indicated, we continue to feel good about our full-year production estimates. EBITDAX estimates are within our rule of thumb sensitivities and based on kind of 7/31 script prices, with what we realized to date, we would anticipate that our adjusted EBITDAX would probably be $85 million to $100 million lower than the original $1,175,000,000. 
As previously mentioned, we are increasing our capital expenditures estimate by approximately $200 million, and this is related to the costs in the Bakken and some target acreage acquisition that Ralph had mentioned. 
Turning to Slide 27. Second quarter liquidity remained strong. While we are seeing higher spending and some pressure on cash flow for the low commodity prices, these were more than offset by the $300 million we received from the sale of our Barnett and Arkoma properties in the second quarter. Liquidity at the end of the quarter stood at approximately $1.9 billion. And again, as Ralph mentioned, we think we're positioned very well from a liquidity and a balance sheet standpoint as we ended the second quarter. 
And with that, I will turn it back over to Ralph to wrap up."

We are -- continue to do this but continue to grow our domestic oil production, 50% to 60%. As I mentioned, first 6 months is up 57%. We are uniquely situated to ramp up gas production at the right price. We're already one of the most efficient producers, and we're seeing our gas cost basins trend lower. 
The Piceance efficiency is continuing to be best-in-class and the Marcellus team has cracked the efficiency code. And as I discussed, I really can't stress enough, when the time is right I believe and we believe that, particularly in the Piceance, we can significantly grow our gas production as that one slide showed you how much we can do with less equipment than we did in the past. 
We are going to maintain our top-tier balance sheet in this depressed environment, but the environment is getting a little bit better. As we continue to execute financial discipline in the Bakken, we expect several things to happen. All of our acreage will be held by production. That is a great thing. We will have all fit-for-purpose rigs designed for the Bakken operation. 4 in now, 2 that just recently came on, 2 more coming, there are all 6 will be there. We should begin pad drilling in the third quarter, which should lower well cost ultimately by $2 million as efficiencies kick in. 
We will complete our final gathering system for all of our oil, water and gas, and none of that will have to be trucked. And in the future, we could probably, and I believe, we will be able to drill the same number of wells with one less rig. In other way with 6 rigs could be drilled -- the same amount of wells could be drilled with 5 rigs in the future as these efficiencies begin to kick in, and that will make us -- when we do have rigs be able to drill that many more wells. 
And our new opportunities there is in the Piceance, we're going to spread our Mancos horizontal just for the gas to continue evaluate this potential large gas resource. We're also continuing to maximize the liquids recovery. I did mention the Powder River, but we are evaluating numerous oil prospects where we own 140,000 acres of deep rights. We'll begin to participate in some of these prospects, continue to test the Vaca Muerta in Argentina where we have 250,000 acres as I mentioned. And we'll begin testing the new exploration oil areas where we've invested approximately $100 million in. We believe those things will -- as we do some vertical tests and have some results early next year, hopefully, you'll be pleased with those results. And finally, we'll continue to tell the WPX story that we have, of our disciplined management team, our great balance sheet, our tremendous opportunities that we hold in-house today and our new oil horizontal exploration opportunities.

Looking at the drivers of those actual costs versus what we've been targeting, as Ralph said, $10.5 million. I guess there's one area that we haven't really talked about that I would add a little color to. We feel like there's -- Ralph has mentioned $2 million savings when we transitioned to pad drilling. Frankly, we feel like there's a couple of million dollars worth of savings associated with improving our contractor and vendor service quality. Of the wells that we drilled thus far, there's still a lot of problems associated with executing on those wells, and I think it's generally driven by the demand for services in the Bakken. The services and the experience of those folks just have been running hard to catch up to the operator demand that exist in the basin. We've seen pretty significant improvement on all fronts with respect to our rigs, our dedicated frac crew. And so again, we still believe that over time, as we get to pad drilling, as we take the problem wells out, which are fairly common early in an aggressive growth basin like this, that we can take $2 million to $2.5 million off of our current run rate. Ralph mentioned we're looking at $12.5 million as our estimate for well cost over the balance of this year, and we hope to drive that considerably lower as we get into pad drilling, which will be the prevailing mode of operation for us in 2013."

We'd like to see things move at a much faster clap. But at least, up to this point, it's been manageable. We haven't had any rig idle time as a result of waiting on permits. Last -- I think it was early in the year and into maybe even the second quarter, the BLM formed a kind of a permitting task force that was assisted, and I think even partially funded, by industry. And so, they cleared a pretty significant backlog. As a part of that process, we got some 25 or 30 in essentially a very short timeframe, which gave us a nice inventory to stay in front of the rigs. But I think you've probably heard from some of the other operators since the task force went away, things seemed to have slowed down again. On our side, we created a back office to attack this issue when we first bought into the basin. And so, the good news for us is very vast majority of our prerequisite work has already been completed, and so, our permits are truly sitting in the pipeline, either at the BLM or at the NDIC. And so, the short answer is it remains tenuous. We feel it's manageable. We've done our part. Our work is largely completed. And at least up to this point in time, when things get tight, we've been able to push things through the system there. And currently, we've got a couple of permits out in front of each of our rigs.

Thank you for your interest in WPX. A few reminders about WPX. We do have a premiere portfolio and have strong -- and we've had very strong production growth in all 3 product lines, with our oil production up 57% versus last year, our liquids production up 10% and our gas production also grew up 8 -- grew 8%. And when the commodity environment's right, we can increase that gas volume production growth quite a bit and go back in the double-digit gas production growth. 
Our existing portfolio of 18.5 3 Tcf (sic) [18.5 Tcfe 3P] of reserves disability to grow all 3 product lines without any new investments for many years in the future. We're choosing not to go gas as much as we could right now due to low commodity environment. 
We continue to have tremendous flexibility in our capital spending up or down without losing our leases. As you've seen earlier this year, we significantly decreased our capital budget. 
We are a technical and low-cost leader. Our balance sheet remains very strong, particularly compared to our peers with about $1.9 billion in liquidity. This gives us a position of strength to grow and -- in our core areas and also new areas as we see some compelling opportunity. And we're very excited to say we've entered some new areas. We don't have a lot of detail we can give you on that, but we increased our capital, primarily because of our opportunities we see through our exploration team to grow in horizontal oil plays, new plays. It's part of our natural progression as an E&P company, a stand-alone company, to enter new oil plays much earlier, and we're excited about that. 
By choice and design, we think we are in the best oil basin in the nation in the Bakken; the best gas and liquid basin in the Piceance, it's really exclusively to WPX, but we are exclusively the best in the Piceance; and we're in the best gas basin in the nation in the Marcellus. 
Let's flip to Slide 3 -- or 4, please. Second quarter highlights. Our employees are focused on what they control, and so are we, which is our production growth and our cost. And on our items that we can't control, such as the commodity prices currently or weak international and domestic economies. Thus, we're focusing on executing our plan, which is our production side and our cost side. And I'm very pleased to report, we're executing on that plan with our combined year-to-date oil and gas -- oil and liquids production up 24%. As I mentioned, domestic gas is up 8%. And the Piceance is still receiving in what is a weak NGL margin of $0.66 per Mcf NGL uplift. So even in a very weak NGL market, we're getting quite a bit of uplift in the Piceance. 
Looking solely at the Bakken, our production in oil was up 83%, quite an achievement, and our costs were trending lower. Our LOE is down 6%. And on a combined basis, our gathering, processing and transportation costs were down 10%.  
Our EBITDAX was over $500 million for the 6 months -- first 6 months. And as mentioned, as Rod will talk about, we continue to have superior liquidity compared to our peers with over $1.9 billion in liquidity side. And we're now deploying additional capital in new oil-focused plays, which we are very excited to do as a team.
Slide 5. Just very quickly. Reminder, the Bakken, we think, is a world-class oil basin, and our results continued to show, as we expected through our exploration team, which is also the team that's leading us into these new plays, that we're located in the best remaining undeveloped reservoir in the Bakken play. 
Slide 6. We're pleased with this reservoir and our performance so far, with early time well results well above our acquisition thesis and confirming again that we're in the best part of the play. 
For July -- for June 12, our net barrels of oil production a day was 11,300 barrels a day approximately, which is a 74% increase over June of 2011. Our performance is improving. 4 of our 6 drilling rigs have been converted to new efficiency rigs and 2 more are in the transit. We have our dedicated frac crews in place and are reducing time and costs. But as you've heard from other operators, and you've seen in our capital increase today, there's a substantial upward pressure on costs to the first quarter of this year, which continued in the second quarter, but we feel they have peaked in the second quarter. But based on our experience today, part of our capital increase, $75 million, is for additional drilling completion and facility costs in the Bakken. 
There's some unique issues driving our performance and strategy that we feel will go away, but as a new operator, just taken over operations slightly over a year ago, it takes a while to become an established operator in this basin. So for the first 3 quarters, what we've been facing is basically a lease saving mode. Since we've assumed operations a year ago, we've been transitioning to a much -- we will transition to a much more efficient pad drilling, but initially, we've been bouncing around from lease to lease to make sure we hold our leases. The good news is, we only have 10 more wells to drill to have all the leases held by production, and all those wells -- or majority of those wells will be completed by the end of third quarter and definitely this year. 
For 2013, thus the majority of our drilling will be from pads and we'll be done with the long rig moves, we'll be done with building the initial roads, infrastructures, pads, well connects, production facilities, et cetera. All that will go away. And we've built our suite of preferred vendors, contracts and equipment to where we like for a Piceance-type efficiency model. 
We believe we're now at the front of the queue or near the front of the queue for services from our vendors. We can optimize our service equipment, and I've mentioned 4 of our 6 rigs are now the fit-for-purpose rigs, but 2 of those just recently came on. So we have not experienced the benefit of those yet. We've high-graded our directional drilling services. We've got our completions and operation efficiencies underway, and we've optimized our completion design. 
We also have put in field infrastructure, the one I talked about last time, the Van Hook Fields construction, will be done in the fourth quarter, and that will eliminate flaring, trucking of our oil, water among other things, and thus, save more money. So we expect as we get done with the one-and-gone lease saving development phase later this year, we will be able to lower our well cost by about $2 million. 
Also, you should see that we do via operate on the reservation, just generally for some associated fees and other items; there's about a $500,000 per well additional cost by operating the reservation. The good news is, the reservoirs are far superior. And we use and believe in 65% ceramic and 35% profit mix. That adds about $1 million to our wells, but as the slide I'll show you in a few minutes, we believe that results in superior wells and superior production, superior reserves and eliminates any problems down the road when the sand could get crushed if using 100% sand.
Slide 7. 4 of the 6 planned rigs have been converted to new fit-for-purpose. And as I mentioned, just a couple of those have been delivered. So we really have not began the efficiency-type drilling. As I mentioned, that will happen later in the third quarter, beginning in the fourth quarter. But our reserves in production continued to outperform our expectations. 
This slide's a busy slide, but let me walk you through a couple of things. 11 wells -- we spud 11 wells in the second quarter, and you can see in the light green and the orange, the colors there, we put 6 wells on first sales. We're drilling from our first multi-well pad infill density project has begun, but we're doing 4 Middle Bakken and Three Forks eventually, and that's in the red hash marks on the map. 
Our best well result from -- during pad drilling has gone down to 25 days, averaging 30 days right now, but we already started to achieve 25 days, gives me confidence we will drive our well cost. 
We delineated our field -- or we continue to delineate our field, and we proved up some assets in the south. Our first completion was much higher than we expected. Our peak month was 1,039 barrels of oil a day versus our plan of 700 barrels or less [ph] so we're very encouraged about the 7 part. 
Currently, we're stepping out to the West and East to delineate the acreage there, and we'll have good -- we should have results on those in the third quarter report. And we're proving up our Three Forks formation. 4 wells are waiting on completion, but we do have 2 that are on and are flowing better than we thought with higher EURs than we expected. So we continue to see good opportunities or good results from our drilling here. And really, we've been drilling with older equipment, with not the frac crews we wanted and many other services. So as we move to what we call the Piceance efficiency model, we think we'll do much better. 
Slide 8. We believe that our acreage and our use of 65% ceramic and 35% sand as our profit provide superior results, and peers -- only to some of our peers use. This does add about $1 million to our cost, as I mentioned. But if you look at the performance here, our performance for the wells easily offsets the additional cost. You can see on a 180-day rate that WPX is superior to all the other operators out there. And this is a substantial mix, about 85% of the activity on the reservation. 
You can also see that our EUR comparison is higher, and that is on a NBO basis to 640, and if you equate that to an NBOE basis, it's 706, which is the -- in our type curve, you see in previous-type curves. That also is -- includes in our piece some delineation wells to the South, some Three Forks wells and some delineation we're beginning to the West and the East. So as we stay more in the sweet spot, that we believe really that will trend up. These are all wells that are completed on the Indian reservation. They're all Middle Bakken and long laterals, and we believe in 180-day rate and this is calculated by a third-party IHS data, it's public data. So this is all public that you can go out there and see that our wells are doing better than our peers. Also, we believe the 180-day rate is a much superior rate to look at versus just the 24-hour IP. 
Slide 8 -- Slide 9. In the first quarter, our WTI discount was about 16%, off the WTI. Second quarter, that's decreased to about 12% to 14%. And also on absolute basis, our differential improved by $4 per barrel. We expect this will improve as the year goes on by $2 for the balance of the year for a basis of 10% to $11. 
As we see our Van Hook Gathering System completed, we think on the Van Hook barrels, that will save us additional $4, and that should be completed by the fourth quarter. 
And we also continue to make progress on our future rail sales agreements. As we talked about last time, it's still on the slide where we think for the 2013 to 2015 period, we'll be up to 20,000 barrels of oil, we can move on the rail. 
Turning to the Piceance, Slide 10. It is a world-class gas and oil, an NGL play, and it is for us. Some others don't have the position we have. Our geologic position is unique relative to the other operators, and we're the only operator scaled to be efficient. We drill over 4,000 wells. We have 10,000 remaining locations. We have the lowest cost structure, it's driven by our technology and our operational efficiencies, coupled with our enhanced liquids processing. 
We have superior liquid contract sales, as you'll see in our barrels -- our net realized barrels, and we're just in unique -- and I do believe as the gas prices turn that WPX is in a unique position to reach our gas production, particularly in the Piceance. 
Slide 11. Update on the second quarter. We did spud 53 wells, 123 wells to the second quarter for year-to-date. We've had a record gross operating production of almost 950 million a day. Our higher volumes and strong NGL uplift was $0.66 per Mcf in the second quarter, and that was despite the very weak price that we saw out there. 
We continue to gain efficiencies, which the next slide will show you, even in the Highlands, and we're not drilling much in the Highlands, but the Ryan Gulch area was developed simultaneous operations, which you know we've done in the Valley where we drill, complete, produce, stimulate on the same pad at the same time. We've gone in the Highlands for the first time, leveraged the valley efficiencies that we have. And we actually have done a Ryan Gulch well in a record day, drilling of 8.5 days, and the average Ryan Gulch wells are now taking 11 to 12 days, that was about 25 days 3 years ago. So it's a significant improvement there in the Ryan Gulch area, and a good opportunity for us as we -- when we begin to drill there in a much larger scale. 
We also have new value recognition projects in the Mancos and Niobrara. Third-party results are very encouraging. I have another slide on this and our new opportunities later. But there've been about 27 horizontal wells drilled by other operators so far. Our first horizontal wells will spud this month or next month and have hopefully a completion by the end of the year. So we're excited about that as we move forward, and I'll talk about this again in a few minutes. 
Slide 12. The efficiencies continue year after year after year. In the Piceance, we continue to set drilling records. It's a relentless drive this team has for efficiency. And our Valley well costs have actually been flat the last couple of years, when, as you know, there's been considerable upside pressure in all basins. We've been -- managed through efficiencies to keep our costs flat or slightly down. It's done by our performance in optimization and from active vendor negotiations, and also the great vendors that we have. 
We're forecasting our Ryan Gulch wells are now going to move less than $3 million. And I mentioned how the -- how much the drilling time has come down there, so it should be substantially below that. 
We have a continuous reduction in spud-to-spud times and every time you save a day up in the Piceance, you're saving $40,000 to $60,000. 
Our lowering rig count has actually had a side benefit of allowing us to lower our average day rate for our fleet and prepare us for efficient ramp-up, and we've done many other things to optimize as the team always does. 
Slide 13. If you look at our weighted average barrel, it's $36.27 in the second quarter. Even with historically low ethane and propane prices in the same quarter, I mentioned the $0.66 per Mcf uplift. If the new Willow Creek deal -- or if the Willow Creek new contract, which kicks in automatically in 2013, was in place in the second quarter, that uplift would have been $0.72. So even in one of the worst environments that's been out there for ethane in quite a while, if you annualize that on a 4 quarter basis, that would have been about $16 million improvement to EBITDAX for the year. And we believe, going forward, as we mentioned before, that we think that's going to be more like $25 million to $35 million improvement in the future. 
We feel we're in a good position to continue to realize significant value from our NGLs based on our advantage long-term T&F rates and all of our products, more importantly, our price off Mount Belvieu and not subject to Conway. 
Slide 14. Since our last call on May 3, gas prices have come up somewhat, about 7%. On calendar '13, it's $3.73. And I believe and our team believes that we are one of the best positioned companies to respond to the coming opportunity to rapidly deploy rigs, and increase production when gas prices recover. We believe that the Piceance size rigs will be available versus rigs that are going to be needed for the longer drilling horizontal gas shale plays. 
You can see on this graph, we've done it before, we had about a 30% -- 31% CAGR growth rate in the Piceance from 2004 to 2008. And you can see we increased our Bcf production by about 157 Bcf from '04 to '08. 
With us so much more efficient now, we can drill -- do the same kind of growth with only 17 rigs versus 26 rigs the last time we did it, and we give an example here, if we start off with 8 rigs in year 1 and to move up to ultimately 17 rigs. That would be a 12% CAGR for the Piceance we could do, and the total production growth about 155 Bcf, grow the same amount of production growth. We believe that we have that in place and can take advantage of that. We believe we can get the rigs. We have well over 200 permits in hand and ready to drill. Our infrastructure, as you know, is in place. The capacity to move the gas North, South, West and East is in place. Our staff has done up to 27 rigs before, so they can easily handle 17 rigs. The support structure is there. We have the lowest drilling completion and operating costs in the basin, and we can ramp up sooner we think than anybody else can in any other basin. We can utilize available rigs. As I mentioned, I believe, the Piceance size rigs would be available, and we can build up to smart knowledge from a prior ramp up. So due to our people, our knowledge, our experience, our low cost of operations, our low final and development costs and our infrastructure already built out, we are one of the best gas stories just waiting to explode when the prices are right. 
Our final basin is the Marcellus, it's Slide 15. As I mentioned before, our technical team, which is leading us to the new areas that we increased our capital for, also purposely got this in the primarily Susquehanna County part of the Marcellus. We like what we've seen in the Marcellus. We continue to have great results. We also believe the team has cracked the code on lower drilling completion costs and the Piceance model efficiencies, is starting to kick in, it's actually kicking in there. 
We do remain frustrated with the operations at the Laser pipeline in terms of reliability and pressure. We believe our former sister company, WPZ, which acquired the system in February, will bring the system up to par hopefully, by the end of this year, early next year. 
Slide 16. As I mentioned, the Piceance model is taking hold in Marcellus. We have transitioned to new rigs built specifically for Pennsylvania, on track to average 3 rigs this year. Our first Orion rig came in as planned at the end of May. 2 others are scheduled to come in later this year, the end of this month and the 1st of November. 
We've reduced our completion cost. It's been a major focus for us, and they're down 30% from last year, a significant progress made. Our net production increased 19% from the first quarter to the second quarter, actually right ending at June. 
We believe that production continues to be impacted by the very high lying pressures and erratic operational performance by Laser, which under pressures have been running between 600 pounds to 800 pounds. But we do estimate our current net production of $70 million a day could have been about $30 million a day higher and absent any infrastructure constraints. We can see the problems we continue to have there. And we are poised to ramp up quickly when the gas price rebound. Not as quickly as the Piceance, but the Marcellus would be in pretty good shape also.
Slide 17. Looking at the efficiency model, how you see this, this is almost a mirror of what we saw starting out with the Piceance and the Piceance continues to do. Our spud to rig release time has continued to drop, on average an all-time low about 16 days in the second quarter. Early in the play, this was closer to 30 days, so great improvement by the team. The 60% improvement from where we started just 2 years ago. 
As I mentioned, the completion costs have been reduced through operational changes, better frac designs and working with our vendors and getting more partnerships them. We're down about 20% on average since the beginning of the year. And the Marcellus just looks like an absolute great example of WPX transporting the Piceance model to the Marcellus, and we believe this will start to occur and begin to occur in the Bakken as they crack the code also. 
Slide 18, let's look internationally briefly. As you know, we own 600% interest in Apco. I do want to stress and continue to stress that Apco represents less than 5% of our total production reserves and we're self-funding. No domestic capital spend on Apco. Also on the upside, we do have about 250,000 net acres exposed to the Vaca Muerta Shale. 
There was a government decree issued this week now requiring an annual approval of oil and gas companies' investment plans. Here's our thoughts on that, early thoughts: we've invested consistently and significantly developed our holdings over the years. We've basically redeployed our cash down there into reinvestment. We need to see the detailed requirements from process yet to be published by the government. It appears the decree is to formalize rules that the government's already imposing on the industries, which some of those are like price controls. It seems this is a move by the government for tighter controls and involvement in development of the country's energy resources, but as I've mentioned, we've always redeployed our capital down there, internally, not the domestic capital. We have investment programs built into our concession agreements already, so we have that already set up. Some of them which have been earned [ph] and few of these are still being approved as the concessions remain extended. So we hope that we -- that what we have in place already is very satisfactory to the new government rules, and we'll just -- time will tell on that.
Looking at our operational update, in the Neuquen Basin for all of 2012, we're going to drill 33 development wells and 5 exploration wells, and these are in the traditional targets at Tordillo and Contuco [ph] Formations. Productions from results in this area have been in line with expectations. As you know, we have 2 wells on production, the Vaca Muerta and the vertical side. Current plans are to call for a multistage fracs of the CAS x-4 before the end of the year. So we continue to prosecute and understand what we have in the Vaca Muerta between what we're doing and what the industry is doing. 
In Colombia, we announced our first discovery in Llanos 32 block, where we currently have a 20% working in it, interest on the Maniceno #1 well. That is on production, it's average about 2,400 barrels of oil a day since July. Our second well has been -- has found prospective pay in 3 formations, and the casing has been set. Completion rig is in location, and it will commence testing of these formations. And Llanos 40, we've also completed our seismic inspection and drilling there in 2013. So we continue to do good in the operational side on the Apco.
Slide 20. We are excited to discuss a couple of existing future opportunities in our early entry into promising new plays. As we mentioned, as pure play and peak are coming, we are diversifying our strategy to use exploration in land earlier and get into plays earlier. And for more economically, we think this will be a nice balance to the traditional A&D work we have done. If all our new opportunities that ultimately come through this year, it will represent about 60% to 65% of the $200 million capital increase.
Slide 21. But first, let me remind you of an existing resource we control in the Piceance basin and we made it -- we have significant upside in what's called the Mancos/Niobrara gas formation. We own 250,000 gross, about 150,000 net acres. If you look at the opposite operators and the number of things going on out there, that could represent 20 to 30 Tcf of unbooked resource potential based on results of other operators of 67 Bcf a well. Our current activity is we had an initial vertical test done last year and we fraced 1 zone and half-loaded 1.5 million per day. We have 5 to 7 additional intervals remaining to be tested in that. And as I mentioned, our first horizontal well is planned for the third quarter of this year, and it's going to be the offset to that vertical study -- to that vertical well. 
Other operators have drilled or spud 27 wells in this area, all horizontal type wells, with additional 65 locations permitted. And again, the wells are being reported in the 6 to 7 Bcf range. None of this is in our resource potential, our current resource potential, 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves or of what I mentioned is that what we currently have in the Piceance of 10,000 remaining locations. So this represents significant gas upside to us when the time would be right, and we hold it by production, we can develop when we want to. 
Slide 22. We also made a Mancos gas discovery in the San Juan Basin, where we led the charge and made the discovery. We did a number of vertical tests in the Mancos, extensive reservoir and geological assessments. Basically, the bottom line is, we drilled 2 grassroot horizontal Mancos wells, the first one looks like it's going to be between 4.5 to 5.5 Bcf; the second one, between 5 to 6 Bcf. We control a substantial amount of Mancos rights held by production of 61,000 acres, have a number of -- 700 gross 3P locations. On a gross basis, it looks like we have about 3 Tcf of gross exposure, which should be about 1.8 Tcf to us. Again, none of these numbers are in our resource potential. We look to prosecute this at the right time, and the San Juan Basin team has been drilling there for a number of years. So at the right time, it's going to be a good upside for us. 
Finally, we did enter -- we are entering or have entered new oil plays. There are 3 to 4 primary areas of interest to us. All of these are oil focused horizontal plays. We're feeling very good about our positions; we like what we've done. We increased our capital budget by a $100 million, and that could go up even a little bit more, but not much, it wouldn't change guidance. We will begin testing this year.  Most of those will be vertical test. Initial well results are expected no later than mid-2013. Obviously, we have increased capital today, and we did not increase production guidance, but it's not prudent to increase production guidance on exploration time, but we're very excited where we are and where we're headed with these prospects, and I think it's to going to see part of WPX you haven't seen before as our exploration and land team have done this in the right plays that are more mature, these are earlier entries in the plays that aren't mature, but we think they're going to do pretty well. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rod."

And even with the impact from our hedge position, we realized approximately $3 per Mcf. As well, we continue to see weakening in the price of our composite NGL barrel, further impacting results worldwide basin differentials in the Bakken in the month of April. And while the differential somewhat normalized by June, the price accrued also retreated, so net, not much changed in the realized price over the quarter. We are still on plan to meet our volume projections and currently looking very favorable in our outlook for oil and NGLs. Results were also impacted by noncash impairments to probables in the Powder River Basin, totaling approximately $65 million for the quarter, and total impairments year-to-date of $117 million. Adjusting out these and unrealized mark-to-market gains that tripled to our hedging program, we experienced an adjusted net loss from operations for the quarter of $30 million and $37 million year-to-date. 
Even in this challenging commodity environment, we had just over $0.25 billion in adjusted EBITDAX and $514 million year-to-date adjusted EBITDAX. 
Ralph previously mentioned, and while it is -- mentioned capital increases, and while it is running ahead of previous estimates, we believe we are turning the corner on our cost in the Bakken and have made and will continue to make additional land purchases. 
Turning to Slide 26. That kind of brings us to our outlook for the year. While we did see significant pressure on prices in the second quarter, we are seeing gas strengthening, ethane and propane prices are stronger -- are looking stronger and should benefit us in the third quarter. 
As I indicated, we continue to feel good about our full-year production estimates. Our EBITDAX estimates are within our rule of thumb sensitivities and based on kind of 7/31 script prices, with what we realized to date, we would anticipate that our adjusted EBITDAX would probably be $85 million to $100 million lower than the original $1,175,000,000. 
As previously mentioned, we are increasing our capital expenditures estimate by approximately $200 million, and this is related to the costs in the Bakken and some target acreage acquisition that Ralph had mentioned. 
Turning to Slide 27. Second quarter liquidity remained strong. While we are seeing higher spending and some pressure on cash flow for the low commodity prices, these were more than offset by the $300 million we received from the sale of our Barnett and Arkoma properties in the second quarter. Liquidity at the end of the quarter stood at approximately $1.9 billion. And again, as Ralph mentioned, we think we're positioned very well from a liquidity and a balance sheet standpoint as we ended the second quarter. 
And with that, I will turn it back over to Ralph to wrap up."

We've already continued to do this but continue to grow our domestic oil production, 50% to 60%. As I mentioned, first 6 months is up 57%. We are uniquely situated to ramp up gas production at the right price. We're already one of the most efficient producers, and we're seeing our gas cost basins trend lower. 
The Piceance efficiency is continuing to be best-in-class and the Marcellus team has cracked the efficiency code. And as I discussed, I really can't stress enough, when the time is right, I believe and we believe that, particularly in the Piceance, we can significantly grow our gas production as that one slide showed you how much we can do with less equipment than we did in the past. 
We are going to maintain our top-tier balance sheet in this depressed environment, but the environment is getting a little bit better. As we continue to execute financial discipline in the Bakken, we expect several things to happen. All of our acreage will be held by production. That is a great thing. We will have all fit-for-purpose rigs designed for the Bakken in operation. 4 in now, 2 that just recently came on, 2 more coming, there are all 6 will be there. We should begin pad drilling in the third quarter, which should lower well cost ultimately by $2 million as efficiencies kick in. 
We will complete our final gathering system for all of our oil, water and gas, and none of that will have to be trucked. And in the future, we could probably, and I believe, we will be able to drill the same number of wells with one less rig. In other words with 6 rigs could be drilled -- the same amount of wells could be drilled with 5 rigs in the future as these efficiencies begin to kick in, and that will make us -- when we do have rigs, be able to drill that many more wells. 
And our new opportunities there is in the Piceance, we're going to spud our Mancos horizontal just for the gas to continue evaluate this potential large gas resource. We're also continuing to maximize the liquids recovery. I did mention the Powder River, but we are evaluating numerous oil prospects where we own 140,000 acres of deep rights. We'll begin to participate in some of these prospects, continue to test the Vaca Muerta in Argentina where we have 250,000 acres as I mentioned. And we'll begin testing the new exploration oil areas where we've invested approximately $100 million in. We believe those things will -- as we do some vertical tests and have some results early next year, hopefully, you'll be pleased with those results. And finally, we'll continue to tell the WPX story that we have, of our disciplined management team, our great balance sheet, our tremendous opportunities that we hold in-house today and our new oil horizontal exploration opportunities.

Looking at the drivers of those actual costs versus what we've been targeting, as Ralph said, $10.5 million. I guess there's one area that we haven't really talked about that I would add a little color to. We feel like there's -- Ralph has mentioned $2 million savings when we transitioned to pad drilling. Frankly, we feel like there's a couple of million dollars worth of savings associated with improving our contractor and vendor service quality. Of the wells that we've drilled thus far, there's still a lot of problems associated with executing on those wells, and I think it's generally driven by the demand for services in the Bakken. The services and the experience of those folks just have been running hard to catch up to the operator demand that exists in the basin. We've seen pretty significant improvement on all fronts with respect to our rigs, our dedicated frac crew. And so again, we still believe that over time, as we get to pad drilling, as we take the problem wells out, which are fairly common early in an aggressive growth basin like this, that we can take $2 million to $2.5 million off of our current run rate. Ralph mentioned we're looking at $12.5 million as our estimate for well cost over the balance of this year, and we hope to drive that considerably lower as we get into pad drilling, which will be the prevailing mode of operation for us in 2013."

As mentioned, we have 10 wells left to do. That will happen in third quarter. Those will be completed. We'll get more -- we'll get our system completed and gathering system and some other things happening, so we believe we're doing better on the completion crews and we really are impressed with our new rigs that are coming on, we've got to get those other 2 on, I understand that. So that would be a goal, but that number could easily be more like $11 million next year. So we just -- we'll have to give you more guidance on that as we move towards -- and remember, for apples-to-apples comparison, we do use ceramic, some other operators don't. We firmly believe in it. We've tracked over, I think it's 4,000 wells, and there are some areas I understand why sand was used, one, ceramic wasn't available when they first developed. But they -- well, we are -- we've strongly believed in that ceramic and that adds $1 million to costs to our well, but we believe it gets superior performance. So I would say next year, you'd see us in a target range between around $11 million, hopefully, lower. I'll push the team lower, the team will push me higher. We'll see where we end up."

We'd like to see things move at a much faster clip. But at least, up to this point, it's been manageable. We haven't had any rig idle time as a result of waiting on permits. Last -- I think it was early in the year and into maybe even the second quarter, the BLM formed a kind of a permitting task force that was assisted, and I think even partially funded, by industry. And so, they cleared a pretty significant backlog. As a part of that process, we got some 25 or 30 in essentially a very short timeframe, which gave us a nice inventory to stay in front of the rigs. But I think you've probably heard from some of the other operators since the task force went away, things seemed to have slowed down again. On our side, we created a back office to attack this issue when we first bought into the basin. And so, the good news for us is the very vast majority of our prerequisite work has already been completed, and so our permits are truly sitting in the pipeline, either at the BLM or at the NDIC. And so, the short answer is it remains tenuous. We feel it's manageable. We've done our part. Our work is largely completed. And at least up to this point in time, when things get tight, we've been able to push things through the system there. And currently, we've got a couple of permits out in front of each of our rigs.

Thank you for your interest in WPX. A few reminders about WPX. We do have a premiere portfolio and have strong -- and we've had very strong production growth in all 3 product lines, with our oil production up 57% versus last year, our liquids production up 10% and our gas production also grew up 8 -- grew 8%. And when the commodity environment's right, we can increase that gas volume production growth quite a bit and go back in the double-digit gas production growth. 
Our existing portfolio of 18.5 3 Tcf (sic) [18.5 Tcfe 3P] of reserves disability to grow all 3 product lines without any new investments for many years in the future. We're choosing not to go gas as much as we could right now due to low commodity environment. 
We continue to have tremendous flexibility in our capital spending up or down without losing our leases. As you've seen earlier this year, we significantly decreased our capital budget. 
We are a technical and low-cost leader. Our balance sheet remains very strong, particularly compared to our peers with about $1.9 billion in liquidity. This gives us a position of strength to grow and -- in our core areas and also new areas as we see some compelling opportunity. And we're very excited to say we've entered some new areas. We don't have a lot of detail we can give you on that, but we increased our capital, primarily because of our opportunities we see through our exploration team to grow in horizontal oil plays, new plays. It's part of our natural progression as an E&P company, a stand-alone company, to enter new oil plays much earlier, and we're excited about that. 
By choice and design, we think we are in the best oil basin in the nation in the Bakken; the best gas and liquid basin in the Piceance, it's really exclusively to WPX, but we are exclusively the best in the Piceance; and we're in the best gas basin in the nation in the Marcellus. 
Let's flip to Slide 3 -- or 4, please. Second quarter highlights. Our employees are focused on what they control, and so are we, which is our production growth and our cost. And on our items that we can't control, such as the commodity prices currently or weak international and domestic economies. Thus, we're focusing on executing our plan, which is our production side and our cost side. And I'm very pleased to report, we're executing on that plan with our combined year-to-date oil and gas -- oil and liquids production up 24%. As I mentioned, domestic gas is up 8%. And the Piceance is still receiving in what is a weak NGL margin of $0.66 per Mcf NGL uplift. So even in a very weak NGL market, we're getting quite a bit of uplift in the Piceance. 
Looking solely at the Bakken, our production in oil was up 83%, quite an achievement, and our costs were trending lower. Our LOE is down 6%. And on a combined basis, our gathering, processing and transportation costs were down 10%.  
Our EBITDAX was over $500 million for the 6 months -- first 6 months. And as mentioned, as Rod will talk about, we continue to have superior liquidity compared to our peers with over $1.9 billion in liquidity side. And we're now deploying additional capital in new oil-focused plays, which we are very excited to do as a team.
Slide 5. Just very quickly. Reminder, the Bakken, we think, is a world-class oil basin, and our results continued to show, as we expected through our exploration team, which is also the team that's leading us into these new plays, that we're located in the best remaining undeveloped reservoir in the Bakken play. 
Slide 6. We're pleased with this reservoir and our performance so far, with early time well results well above our acquisition thesis and confirming again that we're in the best part of the play. 
For July -- for June 12, our net barrels of oil production a day was 11,300 barrels a day approximately, which is a 74% increase over June of 2011. Our performance is improving. 4 of our 6 drilling rigs have been converted to new efficiency rigs and 2 more are in the transit. We have our dedicated frac crews in place and are reducing time and costs. But as you've heard from other operators, and you've seen in our capital increase today, there's a substantial upward pressure on costs to the first quarter of this year, which continued in the second quarter, but we feel they have peaked in the second quarter. But based on our experience today, part of our capital increase, $75 million, is for additional drilling completion and facility costs in the Bakken. 
There's some unique issues driving our performance and strategy that we feel will go away, but as a new operator, just taken over operations slightly over a year ago, it takes a while to become an established operator in this basin. So for the first 3 quarters, what we've been facing is basically a lease saving mode. Since we've assumed operations a year ago, we've been transitioning to a much -- we will transition to a much more efficient pad drilling, but initially, we've been bouncing around from lease to lease to make sure we hold our leases. The good news is, we only have 10 more wells to drill to have all the leases held by production, and all those wells -- or majority of those wells will be completed by the end of third quarter and definitely this year. 
For 2013, thus the majority of our drilling will be from pads and we'll be done with the long rig moves, we'll be done with building the initial roads, infrastructures, pads, well connects, production facilities, et cetera. All that will go away. And we've built our suite of preferred vendors, contracts and equipment to where we like for a Piceance-type efficiency model. 
We believe we're now at the front of the queue or near the front of the queue for services from our vendors. We can optimize our service equipment, and I've mentioned 4 of our 6 rigs are now the fit-for-purpose rigs, but 2 of those just recently came on. So we have not experienced the benefit of those yet. We've high-graded our directional drilling services. We've got our completions and operation efficiencies underway, and we've optimized our completion design. 
We also have put in field infrastructure, the one I talked about last time, the Van Hook Fields construction, will be done in the fourth quarter, and that will eliminate flaring, trucking of our oil, water among other things, and thus, save more money. So we expect as we get done with the one-and-gone lease saving development phase later this year, we will be able to lower our well cost by about $2 million. 
Also, you should see that we do via operate on the reservation, just generally for some associated fees and other items; there's about a $500,000 per well additional cost by operating the reservation. The good news is, the reservoirs are far superior. And we use and believe in 65% ceramic and 35% profit mix. That adds about $1 million to our wells, but as the slide I'll show you in a few minutes, we believe that results in superior wells and superior production, superior reserves and eliminates any problems down the road when the sand could get crushed if using 100% sand.
Slide 7. 4 of the 6 planned rigs have been converted to new fit-for-purpose. And as I mentioned, just a couple of those have been delivered. So we really have not began the efficiency-type drilling. As I mentioned, that will happen later in the third quarter, beginning in the fourth quarter. But our reserves in production continued to outperform our expectations. 
This slide's a busy slide, but let me walk you through a couple of things. 11 wells -- we spud 11 wells in the second quarter, and you can see in the light green and the orange, the colors there, we put 6 wells on first sales. We're drilling from our first multi-well pad infill density project has begun, but we're doing 4 Middle Bakken and Three Forks eventually, and that's in the red hash marks on the map. 
Our best well result from -- during pad drilling has gone down to 25 days, averaging 30 days right now, but we already started to achieve 25 days, gives me confidence we will drive our well cost. 
We delineated our field -- or we continue to delineate our field, and we proved up some assets in the south. Our first completion was much higher than we expected. Our peak month was 1,039 barrels of oil a day versus our plan of 700 barrels or less [ph] so we're very encouraged about the 7 part. 
Currently, we're stepping out to the West and East to delineate the acreage there, and we'll have good -- we should have results on those in the third quarter report. And we're proving up our Three Forks formation. 4 wells are waiting on completion, but we do have 2 that are on and are flowing better than we thought with higher EURs than we expected. So we continue to see good opportunities or good results from our drilling here. And really, we've been drilling with older equipment, with not the frac crews we wanted and many other services. So as we move to what we call the Piceance efficiency model, we think we'll do much better. 
Slide 8. We believe that our acreage and our use of 65% ceramic and 35% sand as our profit provide superior results, and peers -- only to some of our peers use. This does add about $1 million to our cost, as I mentioned. But if you look at the performance here, our performance for the wells easily offsets the additional cost. You can see on a 180-day rate that WPX is superior to all the other operators out there. And this is a substantial mix, about 85% of the activity on the reservation. 
You can also see that our EUR comparison is higher, and that is on a NBO basis to 640, and if you equate that to an NBOE basis, it's 706, which is the -- in our type curve, you see in previous-type curves. That also is -- includes in our piece some delineation wells to the South, some Three Forks wells and some delineation we're beginning to the West and the East. So as we stay more in the sweet spot, that we believe really that will trend up. These are all wells that are completed on the Indian reservation. They're all Middle Bakken and long laterals, and we believe in 180-day rate and this is calculated by a third-party IHS data, it's public data. So this is all public that you can go out there and see that our wells are doing better than our peers. Also, we believe the 180-day rate is a much superior rate to look at versus just the 24-hour IP. 
Slide 8 -- Slide 9. In the first quarter, our WTI discount was about 16%, off the WTI. Second quarter, that's decreased to about 12% to 14%. And also on absolute basis, our differential improved by $4 per barrel. We expect this will improve as the year goes on by $2 for the balance of the year for a basis of 10% to $11. 
As we see our Van Hook Gathering System completed, we think on the Van Hook barrels, that will save us additional $4, and that should be completed by the fourth quarter. 
And we also continue to make progress on our future rail sales agreements. As we talked about last time, it's still on the slide where we think for the 2013 to 2015 period, we'll be up to 20,000 barrels of oil, we can move on the rail. 
Turning to the Piceance, Slide 10. It is a world-class gas and oil, an NGL play, and it is for us. Some others don't have the position we have. Our geologic position is unique relative to the other operators, and we're the only operator scaled to be efficient. We drill over 4,000 wells. We have 10,000 remaining locations. We have the lowest cost structure, it's driven by our technology and our operational efficiencies, coupled with our enhanced liquids processing. 
We have superior liquid contract sales, as you'll see in our barrels -- our net realized barrels, and we're just in unique -- and I do believe as the gas prices turn that WPX is in a unique position to reach our gas production, particularly in the Piceance. 
Slide 11. Update on the second quarter. We did spud 53 wells, 123 wells to the second quarter for year-to-date. We've had a record gross operating production of almost 950 million a day. Our higher volumes and strong NGL uplift was $0.66 per Mcf in the second quarter, and that was despite the very weak price that we saw out there. 
We continue to gain efficiencies, which the next slide will show you, even in the Highlands, and we're not drilling much in the Highlands, but the Ryan Gulch area was developed simultaneous operations, which you know we've done in the Valley where we drill, complete, produce, stimulate on the same pad at the same time. We've gone in the Highlands for the first time, leveraged the valley efficiencies that we have. And we actually have done a Ryan Gulch well in a record day, drilling of 8.5 days, and the average Ryan Gulch wells are now taking 11 to 12 days, that was about 25 days 3 years ago. So it's a significant improvement there in the Ryan Gulch area, and a good opportunity for us as we -- when we begin to drill there in a much larger scale. 
We also have new value recognition projects in the Mancos and Niobrara. Third-party results are very encouraging. I have another slide on this and our new opportunities later. But there've been about 27 horizontal wells drilled by other operators so far. Our first horizontal wells will spud this month or next month and have hopefully a completion by the end of the year. So we're excited about that as we move forward, and I'll talk about this again in a few minutes. 
Slide 12. The efficiencies continue year after year after year. In the Piceance, we continue to set drilling records. It's a relentless drive this team has for efficiency. And our Valley well costs have actually been flat the last couple of years, when, as you know, there's been considerable upside pressure in all basins. We've been -- managed through efficiencies to keep our costs flat or slightly down. It's done by our performance in optimization and from active vendor negotiations, and also the great vendors that we have. 
We're forecasting our Ryan Gulch wells are now going to move less than $3 million. And I mentioned how the -- how much the drilling time has come down there, so it should be substantially below that. 
We have a continuous reduction in spud-to-spud times and every time you save a day up in the Piceance, you're saving $40,000 to $60,000. 
Our lowering rig count has actually had a side benefit of allowing us to lower our average day rate for our fleet and prepare us for efficient ramp-up, and we've done many other things to optimize as the team always does. 
Slide 13. If you look at our weighted average barrel, it's $36.27 in the second quarter. Even with historically low ethane and propane prices in the same quarter, I mentioned the $0.66 per Mcf uplift. If the new Willow Creek deal -- or if the Willow Creek new contract, which kicks in automatically in 2013, was in place in the second quarter, that uplift would have been $0.72. So even in one of the worst environments that's been out there for ethane in quite a while, if you annualize that on a 4 quarter basis, that would have been about $16 million improvement to EBITDAX for the year. And we believe, going forward, as we mentioned before, that we think that's going to be more like $25 million to $35 million improvement in the future. 
We feel we're in a good position to continue to realize significant value from our NGLs based on our advantage long-term T&F rates and all of our products, more importantly, our price off Mount Belvieu and not subject to Conway. 
Slide 14. Since our last call on May 3, gas prices have come up somewhat, about 7%. On calendar '13, it's $3.73. And I believe and our team believes that we are one of the best positioned companies to respond to the coming opportunity to rapidly deploy rigs, and increase production when gas prices recover. We believe that the Piceance size rigs will be available versus rigs that are going to be needed for the longer drilling horizontal gas shale plays. 
You can see on this graph, we've done it before, we had about a 30% -- 31% CAGR growth rate in the Piceance from 2004 to 2008. And you can see we increased our Bcf production by about 157 Bcf from '04 to '08. 
With us so much more efficient now, we can drill -- do the same kind of growth with only 17 rigs versus 26 rigs the last time we did it, and we give an example here, if we start off with 8 rigs in year 1 and to move up to ultimately 17 rigs. That would be a 12% CAGR for the Piceance we could do, and the total production growth about 155 Bcf, grow the same amount of production growth. We believe that we have that in place and can take advantage of that. We believe we can get the rigs. We have well over 200 permits in hand and ready to drill. Our infrastructure, as you know, is in place. The capacity to move the gas North, South, West and East is in place. Our staff has done up to 27 rigs before, so they can easily handle 17 rigs. The support structure is there. We have the lowest drilling completion and operating costs in the basin, and we can ramp up sooner we think than anybody else can in any other basin. We can utilize available rigs. As I mentioned, I believe, the Piceance size rigs would be available, and we can build up to smart knowledge from a prior ramp up. So due to our people, our knowledge, our experience, our low cost of operations, our low final and development costs and our infrastructure already built out, we are one of the best gas stories just waiting to explode when the prices are right. 
Our final basin is the Marcellus, it's Slide 15. As I mentioned before, our technical team, which is leading us to the new areas that we increased our capital for, also purposely got this in the primarily Susquehanna County part of the Marcellus. We like what we've seen in the Marcellus. We continue to have great results. We also believe the team has cracked the code on lower drilling completion costs and the Piceance model efficiencies, is starting to kick in, it's actually kicking in there. 
We do remain frustrated with the operations at the Laser pipeline in terms of reliability and pressure. We believe our former sister company, WPZ, which acquired the system in February, will bring the system up to par hopefully, by the end of this year, early next year. 
Slide 16. As I mentioned, the Piceance model is taking hold in Marcellus. We have transitioned to new rigs built specifically for Pennsylvania, on track to average 3 rigs this year. Our first Orion rig came in as planned at the end of May. 2 others are scheduled to come in later this year, the end of this month and the 1st of November. 
We've reduced our completion cost. It's been a major focus for us, and they're down 30% from last year, a significant progress made. Our net production increased 19% from the first quarter to the second quarter, actually right ending at June. 
We believe that production continues to be impacted by the very high lying pressures and erratic operational performance by Laser, which under pressures have been running between 600 pounds to 800 pounds. But we do estimate our current net production of $70 million a day could have been about $30 million a day higher and absent any infrastructure constraints. We can see the problems we continue to have there. And we are poised to ramp up quickly when the gas price rebound. Not as quickly as the Piceance, but the Marcellus would be in pretty good shape also.
Slide 17. Looking at the efficiency model, how you see this, this is almost a mirror of what we saw starting out with the Piceance and the Piceance continues to do. Our spud to rig release time has continued to drop, on average an all-time low about 16 days in the second quarter. Early in the play, this was closer to 30 days, so great improvement by the team. The 60% improvement from where we started just 2 years ago. 
As I mentioned, the completion costs have been reduced through operational changes, better frac designs and working with our vendors and getting more partnerships them. We're down about 20% on average since the beginning of the year. And the Marcellus just looks like an absolute great example of WPX transporting the Piceance model to the Marcellus, and we believe this will start to occur and begin to occur in the Bakken as they crack the code also. 
Slide 18, let's look internationally briefly. As you know, we own 600% interest in Apco. I do want to stress and continue to stress that Apco represents less than 5% of our total production reserves and we're self-funding. No domestic capital spend on Apco. Also on the upside, we do have about 250,000 net acres exposed to the Vaca Muerta Shale. 
There was a government decree issued this week now requiring an annual approval of oil and gas companies' investment plans. Here's our thoughts on that, early thoughts: we've invested consistently and significantly developed our holdings over the years. We've basically redeployed our cash down there into reinvestment. We need to see the detailed requirements from process yet to be published by the government. It appears the decree is to formalize rules that the government's already imposing on the industries, which some of those are like price controls. It seems this is a move by the government for tighter controls and involvement in development of the country's energy resources, but as I've mentioned, we've always redeployed our capital down there, internally, not the domestic capital. We have investment programs built into our concession agreements already, so we have that already set up. Some of them which have been earned [ph] and few of these are still being approved as the concessions remain extended. So we hope that we -- that what we have in place already is very satisfactory to the new government rules, and we'll just -- time will tell on that.
Looking at our operational update, in the Neuquen Basin for all of 2012, we're going to drill 33 development wells and 5 exploration wells, and these are in the traditional targets at Tordillo and Contuco [ph] Formations. Productions from results in this area have been in line with expectations. As you know, we have 2 wells on production, the Vaca Muerta and the vertical side. Current plans are to call for a multistage fracs of the CAS x-4 before the end of the year. So we continue to prosecute and understand what we have in the Vaca Muerta between what we're doing and what the industry is doing. 
In Colombia, we announced our first discovery in Llanos 32 block, where we currently have a 20% working in it, interest on the Maniceno #1 well. That is on production, it's average about 2,400 barrels of oil a day since July. Our second well has been -- has found prospective pay in 3 formations, and the casing has been set. Completion rig is in location, and it will commence testing of these formations. And Llanos 40, we've also completed our seismic inspection and drilling there in 2013. So we continue to do good in the operational side on the Apco.
Slide 20. We are excited to discuss a couple of existing future opportunities in our early entry into promising new plays. As we mentioned, as pure play and peak are coming, we are diversifying our strategy to use exploration in land earlier and get into plays earlier. And for more economically, we think this will be a nice balance to the traditional A&D work we have done. If all our new opportunities that ultimately come through this year, it will represent about 60% to 65% of the $200 million capital increase.
Slide 21. But first, let me remind you of an existing resource we control in the Piceance basin and we made it -- we have significant upside in what's called the Mancos/Niobrara gas formation. We own 250,000 gross, about 150,000 net acres. If you look at the opposite operators and the number of things going on out there, that could represent 20 to 30 Tcf of unbooked resource potential based on results of other operators of 67 Bcf a well. Our current activity is we had an initial vertical test done last year and we frac-ed 1 zone and half-loaded 1.5 million per day. We have 5 to 7 additional intervals remaining to be tested in that. And as I mentioned, our first horizontal well is planned for the third quarter of this year, and it's going to be the offset to that vertical study -- to that vertical well. 
Other operators have drilled or spud 27 wells in this area, all horizontal type wells, with additional 65 locations permitted. And again, the wells are being reported in the 6 to 7 Bcf range. None of this is in our resource potential, our current resource potential, 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves or of what I mentioned is that what we currently have in the Piceance of 10,000 remaining locations. So this represents significant gas upside to us when the time would be right, and we hold it by production, we can develop when we want to. 
Slide 22. We also made a Mancos gas discovery in the San Juan Basin, where we led the charge and made the discovery. We did a number of vertical tests in the Mancos, extensive reservoir and geological assessments. Basically, the bottom line is, we drilled 2 grassroot horizontal Mancos wells, the first one looks like it's going to be between 4.5 to 5.5 Bcf; the second one, between 5 to 6 Bcf. We control a substantial amount of Mancos rights held by production of 61,000 acres, have a number of -- 700 gross 3P locations. On a gross basis, it looks like we have about 3 Tcf of gross exposure, which should be about 1.8 Tcf to us. Again, none of these numbers are in our resource potential. We look to prosecute this at the right time, and the San Juan Basin team has been drilling there for a number of years. So at the right time, it's going to be a good upside for us. 
Finally, we did enter -- we are entering or have entered new oil plays. There are 3 to 4 primary areas of interest to us. All of these are oil focused horizontal plays. We're feeling very good about our positions; we like what we've done. We increased our capital budget by a $100 million, and that could go up even a little bit more, but not much, it wouldn't change guidance. We will begin testing this year.  Most of those will be vertical test. Initial well results are expected no later than mid-2013. Obviously, we have increased capital today, and we did not increase production guidance, but it's not prudent to increase production guidance on exploration time, but we're very excited where we are and where we're headed with these prospects, and I think it's to going to see part of WPX you haven't seen before as our exploration and land team have done this in the right plays that are more mature, these are earlier entries in the plays that aren't mature, but we think they're going to do pretty well. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rod."

And even with the impact from our hedge position, we realized approximately $3 per Mcf. As well, we continue to see weakening in the price of our composite NGL barrel, further impacting results worldwide basin differentials in the Bakken in the month of April. And while the differential somewhat normalized by June, the price accrued also retreated, so net, not much changed in the realized price over the quarter. We are still on plan to meet our volume projections and currently looking very favorable in our outlook for oil and NGLs. Results were also impacted by noncash impairments to probables in the Powder River Basin, totaling approximately $65 million for the quarter, and total impairments year-to-date of $117 million. Adjusting out these and unrealized mark-to-market gains that tripled to our hedging program, we experienced an adjusted net loss from operations for the quarter of $30 million and $37 million year-to-date. 
Even in this challenging commodity environment, we had just over $0.25 billion in adjusted EBITDAX and $514 million year-to-date adjusted EBITDAX. 
Ralph previously mentioned, and while it is -- mentioned capital increases, and while it is running ahead of previous estimates, we believe we are turning the corner on our cost in the Bakken and have made and will continue to make additional land purchases. 
Turning to Slide 26. That kind of brings us to our outlook for the year. While we did see significant pressure on prices in the second quarter, we are seeing gas strengthening, ethane and propane prices are stronger -- are looking stronger and should benefit us in the third quarter. 
As I indicated, we continue to feel good about our full-year production estimates. Our EBITDAX estimates are within our rule of thumb sensitivities and based on kind of 7/31 script prices, with what we realized to date, we would anticipate that our adjusted EBITDAX would probably be $85 million to $100 million lower than the original $1,175,000,000. 
As previously mentioned, we are increasing our capital expenditures estimate by approximately $200 million, and this is related to the costs in the Bakken and some target acreage acquisition that Ralph had mentioned. 
Turning to Slide 27. Second quarter liquidity remained strong. While we are seeing higher spending and some pressure on cash flow for the low commodity prices, these were more than offset by the $300 million we received from the sale of our Barnett and Arkoma properties in the second quarter. Liquidity at the end of the quarter stood at approximately $1.9 billion. And again, as Ralph mentioned, we think we're positioned very well from a liquidity and a balance sheet standpoint as we ended the second quarter. 
And with that, I will turn it back over to Ralph to wrap up."

We've already continued to do this but continue to grow our domestic oil production, 50% to 60%. As I mentioned, first 6 months is up 57%. We are uniquely situated to ramp up gas production at the right price. We're already one of the most efficient producers, and we're seeing our gas cost basins trend lower. 
The Piceance efficiency is continuing to be best-in-class and the Marcellus team has cracked the efficiency code. And as I discussed, I really can't stress enough, when the time is right, I believe and we believe that, particularly in the Piceance, we can significantly grow our gas production as that one slide showed you how much we can do with less equipment than we did in the past. 
We are going to maintain our top-tier balance sheet in this depressed environment, but the environment is getting a little bit better. As we continue to execute financial discipline in the Bakken, we expect several things to happen. All of our acreage will be held by production. That is a great thing. We will have all fit-for-purpose rigs designed for the Bakken in operation. 4 in now, 2 that just recently came on, 2 more coming, there are all 6 will be there. We should begin pad drilling in the third quarter, which should lower well cost ultimately by $2 million as efficiencies kick in. 
We will complete our final gathering system for all of our oil, water and gas, and none of that will have to be trucked. And in the future, we could probably, and I believe, we will be able to drill the same number of wells with one less rig. In other words with 6 rigs could be drilled -- the same amount of wells could be drilled with 5 rigs in the future as these efficiencies begin to kick in, and that will make us -- when we do have rigs, be able to drill that many more wells. 
And our new opportunities there is in the Piceance, we're going to spud our Mancos horizontal just for the gas to continue evaluate this potential large gas resource. We're also continuing to maximize the liquids recovery. I did mention the Powder River, but we are evaluating numerous oil prospects where we own 140,000 acres of deep rights. We'll begin to participate in some of these prospects, continue to test the Vaca Muerta in Argentina where we have 250,000 acres as I mentioned. And we'll begin testing the new exploration oil areas where we've invested approximately $100 million in. We believe those things will -- as we do some vertical tests and have some results early next year, hopefully, you'll be pleased with those results. And finally, we'll continue to tell the WPX story that we have, of our disciplined management team, our great balance sheet, our tremendous opportunities that we hold in-house today and our new oil horizontal exploration opportunities.

We have drilled since we bought into the project about 45 wells. We have what we would consider to be, I guess, near final cost on about 30. Looking at the drivers of those actual costs versus what we've been targeting, as Ralph said, $10.5 million. I guess there's one area that we haven't really talked about that I would add a little color to. We feel like there's -- Ralph has mentioned $2 million savings when we transitioned to pad drilling. Frankly, we feel like there's a couple of million dollars worth of savings associated with improving our contractor and vendor service quality. Of the wells that we've drilled thus far, there's still a lot of problems associated with executing on those wells, and I think it's generally driven by the demand for services in the Bakken. The services and the experience of those folks just have been running hard to catch up to the operator demand that exists in the basin. We've seen pretty significant improvement on all fronts with respect to our rigs, our dedicated frac crew. And so again, we still believe that over time, as we get to pad drilling, as we take the problem wells out, which are fairly common early in an aggressive growth basin like this, that we can take $2 million to $2.5 million off of our current run rate. Ralph mentioned we're looking at $12.5 million as our estimate for well cost over the balance of this year, and we hope to drive that considerably lower as we get into pad drilling, which will be the prevailing mode of operation for us in 2013."

We'd like to see things move at a much faster clip. But at least, up to this point, it's been manageable. We haven't had any rig idle time as a result of waiting on permits. Last -- I think it was early in the year and into maybe even the second quarter, the BLM formed a kind of a permitting task force that was assisted, and I think even partially funded, by industry. And so, they cleared a pretty significant backlog. As a part of that process, we got some 25 or 30 in essentially a very short timeframe, which gave us a nice inventory to stay in front of the rigs. But I think you've probably heard from some of the other operators since the task force went away, things seemed to have slowed down again. On our side, we created a back office to attack this issue when we first bought into the basin. And so, the good news for us is the very vast majority of our prerequisite work has already been completed, and so our permits are truly sitting in the pipeline, either at the BLM or at the NDIC. And so, the short answer is it remains tenuous. We feel it's manageable. We've done our part. Our work is largely completed. And at least up to this point in time, when things get tight, we've been able to push things through the system there. And currently, we've got a couple of permits out in front of each of our rigs.

And appropriate commodity environment, we can grow all",3026,"Thank you, David. Welcome to WPX's third quarter 2012 earnings call and thank you for your interest in WPX. A few reminders about WPX. We have strengthened our portfolio with 18.5 Tcfe of 3P reserves. And appropriate commodity environment, we can grow all 3 of our products, oil, liquids and natural gas and a double digit production growth rate for many years. In other words, we can doubled the size of our company within 5 years in the right environment, and so have room to grow. Few companies with that kind of existing portfolio can accomplish this like we can. We have tremendous flexibility in the strength of our assets to ramp our capital up or down, depending without losing leases in value depending on commodity prices. Our technical and low-cost leadership provides us strength in our operations, our strong balance sheet of $1.7 billion liquidity, put us in a position of strength to grow at appropriate time. And by choice and by design, this portfolio was set up to be in the best oil base in the nation Bakken, the best gas and liquid base in the Piceance, and the best gas station in Marcellus. 
And now on Slide 4, which looks like we're already on Slide 4. Third quarter highlights. We continue to perform well in the phase of 10-year low natural gas prices and the falloff in NGL prices. We've generated year-to-date adjusted EBITDAX of $744 million and on target for the fully adjusted EBITDAX, an excess of $1 billion. Very importantly, we're reaffirming our full year production guidance of the 1.38 Bcf a day for 2012 on equivalent basis. This is the guidance we gave in February, where we're in the process of severely cutting our capital budget by $425 million in response to the decade low gas prices. 
For the year, we expect our natural gas production to be up 3%, our oil production is on target of 40%, and liquid production up 5% from 2011. Each of these -- if you look at them specifically, we are on target for oil production growth for the year. We were slightly behind in the third quarter in the Bakken, but I'll talk about that in a few minutes. We're ahead on natural gas production. We original thought we'd be down slightly in natural gas production, we'll be ahead on natural gas production and we're slightly behind on liquids, a lot of that was in the third quarter due to some flat turnarounds in maintenance, which we can also talk about in a few minutes. But on equivalent basis, we're right on target. 
Our CapEx range is slightly to $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion, which is inclusive of the new oil projects, the exploration projects and our quarterly growth in the Bakken was affected by completion that were delayed from the second quarter to late in the third quarter, very late in the third quarter. 
Our third quarter average production of 9,600 barrels oil per day has already increased approximately 9% to October of 10,500 barrels oil per day, and we do expect to reach our planned December exit rate. 
For 2013, we're deep into the process of our capital allocation process, which is based on rate of return. Our 3 core areas, the Piceance, the Bakken and the Marcellus are competing for 2013 capital. They're based on returns and we plan to publicly discuss our 2013 budget early next year. 
We were pleased to see the recent recover in natural gas prices, which enhances our low-cost Piceance value position and Marcellus position. We're one of the most operational lever company to recover natural gas prices. The Piceance can be the first and fastest to grow volumes given our low-cost advantage, large drilling inventory over 10,000 gross locations and there are no infrastructure constraints in the Piceance. And Piceance has significant excess takeaway of 2.5 Bcf of excess transportation takeaways. 
Slide 5. Looking at the Piceance, we spread 43 wells in the third quarter. We've seen a 50% increase in a number of wells we can drill per rigs since 2007, so we continue to be much more efficient there. Couple of record wells have been drilled recently and Ryan Gulch record wells was drilled in 8.5 days, with an average Ryan Gulch wells now 11 to 12 days. 
Just 3 years ago, we took 25 days to drill our Ryan Gulch well. Consistently drilling of our value wells now for about 9 days or less and we have a record value day of 3.8 days, so we've drill the well in. 
We continue to add additional water handling disposal capacity, with of this continues to the Piceance, which is lower in cost and we're clearing depth on our first horizontal Mancos Niobrara wells, which I have more this in the next slide. 
We do have a prolific resource based in the Piceance Mancos of 12.2 Tcf and that does not include the Mancos and Niobrara, but again, I'll talk about that in the next slide. 
And I'm very proud of our team for winning 2 awards for environmental protection recently throughput reduction, which we call design and our waste optimization. 
Slide 6, WPX is positioned we believe to grow rapidly when natural gas prices recover. As I mentioned, prices are up $0.34 or 9.5% to $3.90 from when our last call was. We believe we're positioned to grow rapidly and Piceance side rigs will be available versus rigs report for the horizontal gas play. 
As you can see of this graph, we have rapidly growing we grew 137 Bcfe on the left hand part of this graph and the Piceance from 2004 to 2008. And we can now -- we believe we can grow again with less rigs, we're so much more efficient. this time, we'd 17 rigs to this versus 26 rigs. We're not at 17 rigs, we're at 5 rigs, but we could do when gas prices recover and again, we could grow almost exactly the same we did last time 155 Bcfe. 
In the Piceance, we have advantage of a very large permit inventory in hand and ready to drill and those permits are 2-year type permits. Infrastructure and capacity is in place. The team is highly experienced, very talented drilling staff, has done it before. Lowest drilling completion operating cost for the basin and we have available rigs. So we believe with our people and our knowledge and when the time is right, the Piceance will recover fast as the gas basin. 
Slide 7, let me remind you that we already control this resource and in the Piceance we have significant upside in what's called the Mancos Niobrara Formation, it is a gas formation in this particular part of the basin, with 168,000 neckdeep acres. There have been 35 wells drilled by other operators, is one of the few times in the Piceance we've let other people go first and we joined when they're done de-risking the play for us. The wells are being reported in 6 Bcf range. We believe we have 20 to 30 Tcf of unbooked resource potential and none of that is included in our 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves andn/or none of that is also included in our 10,000 remaining Piceance traditional locations. So we have a lot of opportunity here. 
We did a vertical well in 2011 and tested 2 zones and we have other zones we can test, and both of those zones have very strong results with eyepiece of 1 million plus today. 
We just start our first horizontal well in August of 2012. We've obtained 535 feet of core, specially will greatly help us in the future. We expect to go this well in mid-November, begin completion the first week in December and we'll have results to discuss in the first quarter of 2013. 
Slide 8. Turning to the Bakken. We currently have 5 rigs running the Bakken. As you know, we've dropped a rig during the quarter, for efficiency purposes. We are gaining -- and speaking of efficiency, we're gaining efficiency and we expect to complete 14 wells in the fourth quarter and that's a significant improvement of what we've done for the year. In the year, we've only completed 22 wells in the first 9 months, so we have a lot of activity in the Bakken in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to delay in our anchorage and now only have 5 wells left to drill and hold our anchorage for production. That will allow us to move next year and later this year to much more efficient pad drilling. 
In the third quarter, we had some delineation in our areas in the southern part, which is depicted by the grain. We've got the comment above expectation, so it looks like it's going to be about 740,000 barrel reserves well versus expectations, we're in the lower 600s. In the eastern part, light red, we've drilled wells there and waiting on completion. In the Western delineation, has been light blue, that is also awaiting on completion. 
So in addition to having all of our wells drilled, our overall acreage fell by production by the end of the year or early next year, we're also delineated a major part of our acreage. 
I'll also point at the Bakken West Texas differentials have improved from what was $17 in the first quarter to approximately $10 in the third quarter, and it's about $13 in the second quarter. October basis currently around $2 and we expect the balance of the year to trade about $4 or so. This dramatic improvement is due to the improved takeaway the basin, primarily takeaway capacity to from 275,000 barrels a day to approximately 730,000 barrels a day, and most of this growth has occurred in late second quarter and early third quarter. We also NSW spread has widened from $12 in the first quarter to $20, so it makes very competitive alternative to rail and what we try to do most. 
Our outlook in 2013 supports a differential in the $5 to $10 range, so we continue to see improvement in the basis differentials there. And we also have a size projects underway, which I'll talk about in the next slide, Slide 9. 
Well, about a successful in density project, which is validating our resource. The purpose of this slide and the purpose of this project is. And someone in the Bakken and delayed some things, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. 
We want to understand the potential to increase a number of drilling locations and reserves. I want to optimize infill density. We've only drilled 10% of our locations. We have 9% plus of our locations remaining to drill. And what we know about today, that could go up, if obviously we do have the ability to do any additional infill drilling and additional drilling in other areas. 
We want to optimize our completion and designs. we want to understand our geological success factors, and we're in the process for initiating our multi-well pad operations. 
Status of the project is, all these 4 Middle Bakken and 3 wells have been drilled and will be on production in October. There's on production this month. We drilled 4 Middle Bakken and 3 on a 1,280-acre units. This is our best well drilled, which is why we're optimistic about going forward. It was 19 drilling days and we average on the pad of 26 drilling days and one day moves. 
We had successful date acquisition with 272 feet of core recovered. We called the entire Bakken Formation, the upper, the middle, the lower and the front-line. We core the entire Three Forks Formation, all benches, all 4 benches. We also core the portion of the large pole on the Birdbear formation. So we have a ton of data that we have that will be coming in. And we had seismic especially log shot, obviously, during this time. So production recently online and we have should have some initial study results in the first quarter of 2013. But keep in mind, this will be a long-term project that allow us to do quite a bit with the vast amount of locations we have left. 
Slide 10. As I mentioned, our production on October has already increased 9% from the third quarter average, and our efficiencies are beginning to kick in with 14 completion scheduled in the fourth quarter versus 22 in the first 9 months of this year. 
If you look at this slide, on a BOE per day basis, our production should increase about 19% in the fourth quarter from the third. So we expect quite a bit production increase in the fourth quarter based on this completion. You can see the rapid growth we've had. Keep in mind we didn't take over operations of this asset until the late in the second quarter of 2011. So we have tremendous growth since that time. 
Slide 11. Looking at the Bakken cost. We've generally been drilling one well per pad, as you know, and this initial wells have been very different infrastructure cost, which includes the pads, the roads to all facilities. 
Looking at this slide, we detailed our expected cost savings from transition and multi-well padding, pad drilling, improved service delivery and reduced service costs. We've also successfully negotiated lower service cost here in the Bakken during the third quarter, and these benefits will start to show off in the fourth quarter. 
We're staying with our previous targeted well cost of $10.5 million. And keep in mind, we do use ceramic, as our operation mature and the transition to pad drilling takes place which will be the cost of our next other operation next year in the Bakken. 
We did reduce our well count to 5 to narrow our focus and resources and make sure we get folks unexpected improvements. And other thing we have that will be completed in the fourth quarter is our Van Hook Gathering System will provide us initial savings of $2 to $4 per barrel and ultimately, savings from that's a pipeline from our central delivery point of affected to stay has completed, which will be the first quarter of 2013 will be more like $4 to $5 per barrel savings. 
So things will continue to get better in the Bakken. Looking at the Marcellus in Slide 12. Our PS model efficiency model is taking hold in Marcellus. Transitioning to 3 fit-for-purpose rigs, we have one rigging up, one that's on and one coming still. Our move times have been cut by as much as 30%. We've a had a 35% drop in completion cost from the fourth quarter of 2011 to third quarter 2012. 
Our net production did increase, only 3% from the second quarter to third quarter, despite even higher Laser line pressures than we had in the second quarter. We estimate at least $30 million a day of net production is constrained by infrastructure sales. I'm very happy to say at least some of our compression projects have kicked in. And our first WPX pad compression project doubled our volumes on that particular pad in Susquehanna late in the third quarter, and the next slide and talk a little bit more about that. 
This compress started on September 26, and as you can see, the average production for the wells of this pad doubled from 5 million a day to 10 million, and they've stayed flat. We believe that we have additional one -- we have one more pad that we can do this, we're just starting and we expect similar results. Unfortunately, we're not going to do this on all of our pads because we expect and believe that Williams will be able to put a bigger volumes grow the field compression and schedule for start up hopefully by the of year end. As you know Williams bought the laser system. And that compression should be in bed end of the year we hope or early next year. 
You can see just one example of how the production response to lower pressure, and we believe we can actually lower the pressure further. It could have lowered up during the quarter, but there was about with some again, is one of the was this compressor stations. 
Looking at Slide 16. More that on the Marcellus. Our spread funds actually went up slightly in the third quarter from second quarter, with the start Ryan rig that went from 16 days to 17 days, but we're already backed down to under 15 days. Typically with the new rig, and the new rigs, it takes a well or 2 to get back to where you want to start moving and we're under 15 days. 
We did start our drilling record time of 14 days in the third quarter, with a new a record of 11 days on a 4,300-foot lateral. I've mentioned the collision costs were down significantly in the Marcellus with the efficiency starting to kick in as a great example, our PS model now it's did in a new area and we expect this to occur in the Bakken also. 
After over quickly, traditional drilling is meeting expectation. We did establish some activities in the Bakken shale with 2 frac vertically drilled well. To these resources, we'll take horizontal drilling. Environment as you know, in Argentina is challenging currently and we have one more concession to get done, which we expect to be accomplished in the first half of 2013 in the Rio Negro province. 
Columbia, we've had 2 consecutive discoveries in the basin. The first well is producing about 3,500 barrels of oil a day. We have a 20% in that. The second well is in the process of being tested and we'll have additional prospects drilled in 2013. And our goal on the production and earnings standpoint through the second quarter was tracking towards a record year in production and record year in earnings, and things continue to go well from that standpoint. 
Now, I'll turn this over to Rod for the financial update."

Comparing third quarter 2012 to third quarter 2011, results were impacted by lower realized prices across all of our commodities. When we continue to face challenging liquids environment, further impacted by constraints on the maple system, which is resulted in reduced fractionation of methane of the Meeker processing facility. We've also seen volumes impacted in the third quarter due to some plant turnarounds at Willow Creek in July, and then we also we'll continue to have some higher processing cost related to Willow Creek until those charges step down in 2013. 
Third quarter revenues were also impacted by net $21 million net loss associated with derivatives not designated under hedge accounting. These are largely oil. If you'll recall, we recorded significant gain in the second quarter for the 9 months, first 9 months in 2012, we have approximately $63 million in net derivative gains. 
Also, our year-to-date results were impacted by 117 million in impairments-related to decline in forward natural gas prices. These were recorded in first and second quarter, so we have no impairments in the third quarter. 
For the third quarter, WPX's overall production on equivalent basis averaged 1,359 cubic feet per day, which was down 2% from a year ago. As Ralph mentioned, this decrease was the planned response as the lower gas prices that we anticipated for this year. We generate $230 million in EBITDAX for the third quarter. I expect to generate over $1 billion for the year. 
Our adjusted net loss for the quarter was $47 million versus $14 million of adjusted net income for the same period in 2011. Adjusted net loss for the 9 months was $84 million versus net income of $55 million for the same period last year. 
I would point that even though we had lower production on a per-unit basis, we did manage to keep a number of key cost flat or experienced a decrease. 
Capital spending in the third quarter was $337 million, and with 2 months left in the year, we expect 2012 spending to be approximately $1.5 billion. I think we said on the second quarter call that we were targeting $1.4 billion, and that will be a challenging number. I think we really feel strongly that we're going to get under $1.5 billion. 
Slide 18 liquidity at the end of quarter was approximately $1.7 billion. This was comprised of our available cash in our undrawn $1.5 billion corporate credit facility. 
Turning to Slide 19, just looking at quickly at some of our hedges. As we've said repeatably, we like to target about 50% annually, hedging about 50% annually of our production. For the balance of 2012, we've got about 59% of our gas production hedged, with fixed price swaps and a weighted average price of $5.06. We've got about 72% of our crude oil production hedged, through a combination of fixed price swaps and cost. The average on the fixed price swaps is $98.20 and the range on the cost collars ranges from $85 to $106. About 15% of our liquids are hedged, with fixed price swaps at $50.74 a barrel, remind you that we hedged the components individually. We're also on the slide showing you a snapshot of where we stand for 2013. We had indicated that we are looking for a $4 price target on natural gas. 
When the prices jumped up early October, we did start layering up some hedges. And you can see, we've got some and then on the oil side, we've got some attractive hedges on our crude oil production. Our gas production is hedged with fixed price swaps on average price of $4.23. We have some additional volumes kept at $4.05. Greater than 50% of crude production is hedge with fixed price swaps at a little over $100. We've got some additional volumes kept at $108. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back to Ralph to close out the call."

Looking again, at WPX and by investment WPX, we are the top 10 investment gas producer. We're actually about 80% of our production is gas. We have -- we are in the process of transitioning to some oil and more or liquids, but we are gas producing. We believe we're exposed well to gas as gas prices recover. We believe the low-cost liquid in Piceance grow first and fastest when gas prices do recover. And we have additional exposure not in any of our numbers in the Mancos, both in the Piceance and the San Juan Basin, which adds our resource potential by 22 to 33 Tcf. We do have increase in oil exposure and ability to grow NGLs, our domestic oil production we expect to continue to grow at a compounded average growth rate through 2015 of 25% to 30% significant growth rate on a compounded annual growth rate. 
Our domestic NGL production is more than 29,000 barrels a day and we have ability to grow that by 50% in 2014, with a planned expansion that will happen in the Piceance, so we have ability to grow our liquids significantly. And we did recently announced $100 million capital increase for our oil exploration activities. We should have some results to talk with you about by midyear 2013. Thus, we expect to be able to tell you what we have at that time. 
We do have an improving cost structure I think is very important, so I'm not going to read every bullet here to you. But on an annual basis, if you look at our annual basis by the fourth quarter of 2013, our cost structure improves by $117 million. And when you look at that on an annual basis, by the end of 2014, it improves by $205 million total. So significant cost improvements coming to WPX. These are already contractually done or being built or automatic improvements, so those happening for us $117 million by the end of '13, $205 million by the end of 2014. 
So our balance sheet remains very strong, with superior credit metrics. We have demonstrated the aggressive non-core assets. We did the our sales in April this year estimate assets and are not, if you will winning the fight for capital, so we continue to look at those assets where their best places and that's our CapEx is about highest return core areas, emerging oil play, so Bakken is oil focused, Piceance is low-cost and liquids-rich and Marcellus is the highest dry gas EUR. So we have 3 great basins to deploy our capital win. 
With that, I appreciate your interest in the company today. I thank you for your interest and we'll turn it over to David and to the operator."

So we expect our volumes to ramp-up significantly. And we are just now beginning on the cost improvements we have seen some cost improvements recently on the completion side. Those are kicking in. We're not our pad drilling with the exception of a science pad and that pad had 7 wells but we spent a lot of time on the develop of pouring so that wasn't a well improvement if you will on cost. So we really think the drive to get to the 10.5 or lower well costs will kick in more beginning of the year, end of the year. So at this point, we're still -- the wells we had where drilling are completed already some of the problems, so those wells didn't come down. We expect to do a little better in the fourth quarter, and then when we get to full pad drilling and our service costs are lower, those happen or over rigs focused, we expect to see the stride to close with you more towards the next year."

But assuming they can do better, and I do well, then we look a lot like this year."

We have strengthened our portfolio with 18.5 Tcfe of 3P reserves. And in appropriate commodity environment, we can grow all 3 of our products, oil, liquids and natural gas at a double-digit production growth rate for many years. In other words, we can double the size of our company within 5 years in the right environment and still have room to grow. A few companies with that kind of existing portfolio could accomplish this like we can. We have tremendous flexibility in the strength of our assets to ramp our capital up or down, depending -- without losing leases in value depending on commodity prices.
Our technical and low-cost leadership provide us strength in our operations. Our strong balance sheet of $1.7 billion liquidity puts us in a position of strength to grow at the appropriate time. And by choice and by design, this portfolio was set up to be in the best oil basin nation in the Bakken, the best gas and liquids base in the Piceance, and the best gas station in Marcellus.
I'm now on Slide 4, which looks like we're already on Slide 4. Third quarter highlights. We continued to perform well in the phase of 10-year low natural gas prices and the falloff in NGL prices. We've generated year-to-date adjusted EBITDAX of $744 million and on target; for the full adjusted EBITDAX, an excess of $1 billion.
Very importantly, we're reaffirming our full year production guidance of the 1.38 Bcf a day for 2012 on equivalent basis. This is the guidance we gave in February when we were in the process of severely cutting our capital budget by $425 million in response to the decade-low gas prices.
For the year, we expect our natural gas production to be up 3%; our oil production on target at 40%; and liquid production, up 5% from 2011. Each of these -- if you look at them specifically, we are on target for oil production growth for the year. We are slightly behind in the third quarter on the Bakken, but I'll talk about that in a few minutes. We are ahead on natural gas production. We original thought we'd be down slightly in natural gas production. We'll be ahead on natural gas production. And we're slightly behind on liquids. A lot of that was in the third quarter due to some flat turnarounds in maintenance, which we can also talk about in a few minutes. But on equivalent basis, we're right on target. 
Our CapEx range is in stuffed slightly to $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion, which is inclusive of the new oil projects, the exploration projects. And our quarterly growth in the Bakken was affected by completion that were delayed from the second quarter to late in the third quarter, very late in the third quarter.
Our third quarter average production of 9,600 barrels oil per day has already increased approximately 9% to October of 10,500 barrels oil per day, and we do expect to reach our planned December exit rate.
For 2013, we're deep into the process of our capital allocation process, which is based on rate of return. Our 3 core areas: The Piceance, the Bakken and Marcellus are competing for 2013 capital. They're based on returns, and we plan to publicly discuss our 2013 budget early next year.
We were pleased to see the recent recovery in natural gas prices, which enhances our low-cost Piceance value position and Marcellus position. We're one of the most operationally levered companies to recover in natural gas prices. The Piceance can be the first and fastest to grow volumes given our low-cost advantage, large drilling inventory, over 10,000 gross locations, and there are no infrastructure constraints in the Piceance. And Piceance has significant excess takeaway of 2.5 Bcf of excess transportation takeaways.
Slide 5. Looking at the Piceance, we spud 43 wells in the third quarter. We've seen a 50% increase in a number of wells we can drill per rigs since 2007, so we continued to be much more efficient there. A couple of record wells have been drilled recently. In Ryan Gulch, a record well was drilled in 8.5 days, with an average Ryan Gulch wells are now 11 to 12 days. Just 3 years ago, it took 25 days to drill a Ryan Gulch well. Consistently drilling our Valley wells now at about 9 days or less, and we have a record Valley day of 3.8 days that we've drilled the well in.
We continue to add additional water handling disposal capacity, which does -- continues to what the Piceance does best, which is lowering costs. And we're clearing total depth on our first horizontal Mancos/Niobrara well, which I have more of this in the next slide.
We have -- we do have a prolific resource base in the Piceance without the Mancos of 12.2 Tcf, and that does not include the Mancos/Niobrara, but we -- again, I'll talk about that in the next slide.
And I'm very proud of our team for winning 2 awards for environmental protection recently through appropriate reduction in what we call our split-rig design and our waste minimization.
Slide 6. WPX is positioned, we believe, to grow rapidly when natural gas prices recover. As I mentioned, prices are up $0.34 or 9.5% to $3.90 from when our last call was. We believe we're positioned to grow rapidly, and Piceance side rigs -- size rigs will be available versus rigs required for the horizontal gas play.
As you can see of this graph, we have rapidly grown before. We grew 137 Bcfe on the left-hand part of this graph in the Piceance from 2004 to 2008. And we can now -- we believe we can grow again. With less rigs, we're so much more efficient. This time, we'll have 17 rigs to this versus 26 rigs. We're not at 17 rigs, we're at 5 rigs, but it just shows what we could do when gas prices recover. And again, we could grow almost exactly the same we did last time at 155 Bcfe.
In the Piceance, we have advantage of a very large permit inventory in hand and ready to drill, and those permits are 2-year-type permits. Infrastructure and capacity is in place. The team is highly experienced, very talented drilling staff, has done it before, lowest drilling completion operating cost for the basin and we have available rigs. So we believe, with our people and our knowledge and when the time is right, the Piceance will recover fast as during the gas basins.
Slide 7, let me remind you that we already control this resource and that we -- in the Piceance, we have significant upside in what's called the Mancos/Niobrara formation. It is a gas formation in this particular part of the basin, with 168,000 net deep acres. There have been 35 wells drilled by other operators. It's one of the few times in the Piceance we've let other people go first, and we're enjoying what they've done. They're de-risking the play for us. The wells are being reported in 6 Bcf range. We believe we have 20 to 30 Tcf of unbooked resource potential, and none of that is included in our 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves and/or none of that is also included in our 10,000 remaining Piceance traditional locations. So we have a lot of opportunity here.
We did a vertical well in 2011 and tested 2 zones, and we have other zones we can test. And both of those zones have very strong results with IPs of 1 million plus a day.
We just spud our first horizontal well in August of 2012. We've obtained 535 feet of core and specialty logs, which we think will really help us in the future. We expect to TD this well in mid-November, begin completion the first week in December and we'll have results to discuss in the first quarter of 2013.
Slide 8. Turning to the Bakken, we currently have 5 rigs running the Bakken. As you know, we've dropped a rig during the quarter for efficiency purposes. We are gaining -- and speaking of efficiency, we're gaining efficiency and we expect to complete 14 wells in the fourth quarter, and that's a significant improvement of what we've done for the year. Of the year, we've only completed 22 wells in the first 9 months, so we have a lot of activity in the Bakken in the fourth quarter.
We continue to delineate our acreage and now have only 5 wells left to drill to hold all of our acreage by production. That will allow us to move next year and later this year to much more efficient pad drilling.
In the third quarter, we had some delineation in our areas in the southern part, which is depicted by the light green. We've got a well come in above expectations. It looks like it's going to be about 740,000 barrel reserve well versus expectations, we're in the lower 600s.
On the eastern part, the light red, we have drilled some wells there and waiting on completion. And the Western delineation is in light blue, that is also awaiting on completion.
So in addition to having all of our wells drilled, our overall acreage held by production by the end of the year or early next year, we are -- also delineated a major part of our acreage.
I'll also point that the Bakken West Texas differentials have improved from what was $17 in the first quarter to approximately $10 in the third quarter, and it's about $13 in the second quarter. October basis currently is well around $2, and we expect the balance of the year to trade about $4 or so. This dramatic improvement is due to the improved takeaway [indiscernible] basin, primarily rail tech Takeaway capacity has grown from 275,000 barrels a day to approximately 730,000 barrels a day, and most of this growth has occurred in late second quarter and early third quarter.
We also [indiscernible] and WTI spread has widened, from $12 in the first quarter to $20. So it makes it very competitive alternative to rail and what we try to do mostly with.
Our outlook in 2013 supports a differential in the $5 to $10 range, so we continue to see improvement in the basis differentials there. And we also have a science project under way, which I'll talk about in the next slide, Slide 9.
Well, we've had a successful infill density project, which is validating our resource. The purpose of this slide and purpose of this project has been -- and it has slowed us down somewhat in the Bakken and delayed some things, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. We want to understand the potential to increase the number of drilling locations and reserves. I want to optimize our infill density. We've only drilled 10% of our locations. We have 9% plus of our locations remaining to drill. And what we know about today, that could go up if obviously we do have the ability to do any additional infill drilling and additional drilling in other areas.
We want to optimize our completion and designs. We want to understand our geological success factors, and we are in the process for initiating our multi-well pad operations.
Status of the project is, all these 4 Middle Bakken and 3 wells have been drilled and will be on production in October. There's -- are on production this month. We drilled 4 Middle Bakken and 3 Three Forks wells on a 1,280-acre unit. It's our best well drilled, which is why we're optimistic about going forward. It was 19 drilling days, and we average on the pad of 26 drilling days and 1-day-type moves.
We had successful data acquisition with 372 feet of core recovered. We cored the entire Bakken Formation, the upper, the middle, the lower and the pronghorn. We cored the entire Three Forks Formation, all benches, all 4 benches. We also cored a portion of the Lodgepole and the Birdbear Formations. So we have a ton of data that we have that will be coming in. And we had seismic and specialty logs shot obviously during this time. So production is recently online, and we should have initial -- some of our initial study results in the first quarter of 2013. But keep in mind, this will be a long-term project that will allow us to do quite a bit with the vast amount of locations we have left.
Slide 10. As I mentioned, our production in October has already increased 9% from the third quarter average, and our efficiencies are beginning to kick in with 14 completions scheduled in the fourth quarter versus 22 in the first 9 months of this year.
And if you look at this slide, on a BOE per day basis, our production should increase about 19% in the fourth quarter from the third. So we expect quite a bit of production increase in the fourth quarter based on these completions. You can see the rapid growth we've had. Keep in mind, we didn't take over operations of this asset until late in the second quarter of 2011. So we had tremendous growth since that time.
Slide 11. Looking at the Bakken costs, we've generally been drilling one well per pad, as you know, and these initial wells have been there in the upfront infrastructure cost, which includes the pads, the roads, all facilities.
Looking at this slide, we've detailed our expected cost savings from transitioning in multi-well padding, pad drilling, improved service delivery and reduced service costs. We've also successfully negotiated lower service cost here in the Bakken during the third quarter, and these benefits will start to showing up in the fourth quarter.
We're staying with our previously communicated targeted well cost of $10.5 million. And keep in mind, we do use ceramic. As our operations mature and the transition to pad drilling takes place, which will be -- prevail across of our next -- all of our operations next year in the Bakken.
We did reduce our well count to 5 to narrow our focus and resources and make sure we give folks some expected improvements. And another thing we have that will be completed in the fourth quarter is our Van Hook gathering system will provide us initial savings of $2 to $4 per barrel and ultimately, savings from most of the pipeline from our central delivery point at Van Hook. This tunnel is completed, which will be in the first quarter of 2013, will be more like a $4 to $5 per barrel savings. So things will continue to get better in the Bakken.
Looking at the Marcellus in Slide 12. Our WPX model efficiency model -- efficient model is really taking hold in the Marcellus. Transitioning to 3 fit-for-purpose rigs, we have one rigging up, one that's on and one coming still. Our move times have been cut by as much as 30%. We've had a 35% drop in completion costs from the fourth quarter of 2011 to third quarter of 2012.
Our net production did increase, only 3% from the second quarter to third quarter, despite even higher Laser line pressures than we had in the second quarter. We estimate at least $30 million a day of net production, is constrained by infrastructure still. I'm very happy to say at least some of our compression projects have kicked in. And our first WPX pad compression project doubled our volumes on that particular pad in Susquehanna late in the third quarter.
Now let's turn to the next slide and talk a little bit more about that. This compressor started up on September 26. And as you can see, the average production from the wells on this pad doubled from 5 million a day to 10 million a day, and they've stayed flat. We believe that we have additional one -- we have one more pad that we can do this with, and we're just now starting up and we expect similar results. Unfortunately, we're not going to do this on all of our pads because we expect and believe that Williams will be able to put the bigger volumes growth. We'll start a field compression that's scheduled for startup hopefully by the end of the year. And as you know, Williams bought the Laser system. And that compression should be in by the end of the year we hope or early next year.
You can see just one example of how the production responds to lower pressure, and we believe we can actually lower the pressure further. We could have lowered it further during the quarter, but there was a one-in outage and there also was some maintenance in one of Williams' compressor statement -- stations.
Looking at Slide 16 sic) [Slide 14]. One more thing on the Marcellus. Our spud to rig release times actually went up slightly in the third quarter from second quarter with the start of the Orion rig that went from 16 days to 17 days, but we're already back down to under 15 days. Typically, with a new rig, and the new rigs, it takes a well or 2 to get back -- get to where you want to start moving, and we're under 15 days. We did shatter our drilling record time of 14 days in the third quarter, with a new a record of 11 days on a 4,300-foot lateral. I've mentioned the collision costs were down significantly. And the Marcellus, to me, with the deficiency starting to kick in, is a great example. Our transport in our Piceance model now reaching to a new area, and we expect this to occur in the Bakken also.
Apco, very quickly. Traditional drilling is meeting expectations. We did establish some productivity from the Vaca Muerta shale with 2 frac-ed vertically drilled well. To really prove up this resource, it will take horizontal drilling. And environment, as you know, in Argentina is challenging currently. And we have one more concession to get done, which we expect to be accomplished in the first half of 2013 in the Rio Negro province.
Columbia, we've had 2 consecutive discovers -- discoveries in the Llanos basin. The first well is producing about 3,500 barrels of oil a day. We have a 20% interest in that. The second well is in the process of being tested, and we'll have additional prospects drilled in 2013.
And on Apco, from a production and earnings standpoint, through the second quarter, Apco was tracking towards a record year in production and record year in earnings. And things continue to go well from that standpoint.
Now I'll turn this over to Rod for the financial update."

If you'll recall, we recorded significant gain in the second quarter for the 9 months -- first 9 months in 2012, we have approximately $63 million in net derivative gains.
Also, our year-to-date results were impacted by $117 million in impairments related to decline in forward natural gas prices. These were recorded in the first and second quarters, and we had no impairments in the third quarter.
For the third quarter, WPX's overall production on equivalent basis averaged 1,359 million cubic feet per day, which was down 2% from a year ago. As Ralph mentioned, this decrease was a planned response to lower gas prices that we anticipated for this year. We generated $230 million in EBITDAX for the third quarter. I'd expect to generate over $1 billion for the year.
Our adjusted net loss for the quarter was $47 million versus $14 million of adjusted net income for the same period in 2011. Adjusted net loss for the 9 months was $84 million versus net income of $55 million for the same period last year.
I would point out even though we had lower production on a per-unit basis, we did manage to keep a number of our key costs flat or experienced a decrease.
Capital spending in the third quarter was $337 million. And with 2 months left in the year, we expect 2012 spending to be approximately $1.5 billion. I think we said on the second quarter call that we were targeting $1.4 billion, and that would be a challenging number. I think we really feel strongly that we're going to get in at under $1.5 billion.
Slide 18. Liquidity at the end of quarter was approximately $1.7 billion. This was comprised of available cash in our undrawn $1.5 billion corporate credit facility.
Turning to Slide 19, just looking quickly at the summary of our hedges. As we've said repeatedly, we like to target about 50% annually, hedging about 50% annually of our production. For the balance of 2012, we've got about 59% of our gas production hedged, with the fixed price swaps at a weighted average price of $5.06. We've got about 72% of our crude oil production hedged through a combination of fixed price swaps and costless collars. The average on the fixed price swaps is $98.20, and the range on the costless collars ranges from $85 to $106. About 15% of our liquids are hedged, with fixed price swaps at $50.74 a barrel, remind you that we hedged the individual -- we hedged the components individually.
We're also on the slide showing you a snapshot of where we stand for 2013. We had indicated that we are looking for a $4 price target on natural gas.  When the prices jumped up early October, we did start layering out some hedges. And you can see, we've got some -- and then for -- on the oil side, we've got some very attractive hedges on our crude oil production. Our gas production is hedged with fixed price swaps at an average price of $4.23. We have some additional volumes capped at $4.05. Greater than 50% of our crude production is hedged with fixed price swaps at a little over $100. And we've got some additional volumes capped at $108.
With that, I'd like to turn it back to Ralph to close out the call."

Looking again, WPX and why invest in WPX, we are a top 10 domestic gas producer. We're actually -- about 80% of our production is gas. We have -- we are in the process of transitioning to some oil and more on liquids, but we are a gas producer, and we believe we're exposed well to gas as gas prices recover. We believe the low-cost, liquids-rich Piceance basin will grow first and fastest when gas prices do recover. And we have additional exposure, not in any of our numbers, in the Mancos, both in the Piceance and the San Juan Basin, which adds our resource potential by 22 to 33 Tcf.
We do have increasing oil exposure and ability to grow NGLs. Our domestic oil production, we expect will continue to grow at a compounded average growth rate through 2015 at 25% to 30%, a significant growth rate on a compounded annual growth rate.
Our domestic NGL production is more than 29,000 barrels a day, and we have ability to grow that by 50% in 2014 with the planned expansion of what happened in the Piceance. So we have ability to grow our liquids significantly. And we did recently announce $100 million capital increase for oil-focused exploration activities. We should have some results to talk with you about by midyear 2013. Thus, we expect to be able to tell you what we have at that time.
We do have an improving cost structure. I think this is very important, so I'm not going to read every bullet here to you. But on an annual basis, if you look at our annual basis, by the fourth quarter of 2013, our cost structure improves by $117 million. And when you look at that on an annual basis, by the end of 2014, it improves by $205 million total. So significant cost improvements coming to WPX. These are already contractually done or being built or automatic improvements, so those be happening for us; $117 million by the end of '13, $205 million by the end of 2014.
Our balance sheet remains very strong with superior credit metrics. We have demonstrated willingness to divest in non-core assets. We did the Barnett/Arkoma sale in April of this year, and we have some other assets that are not, if you will, winning the fight for capital. So we'll be continuing to look at those assets where their best place is. And thus, our CapEx is focused on a highest return core areas and emerging oil plays. So Bakken is oil-focused, Piceance is low-cost and liquids-rich and Marcellus is our highest dry gas EURs. So we have 3 great basins to deploy our capital in.
With that, I appreciate your interest in the company today, and thank you for your interest. And we'll turn it over to David and to the operator."

So we expect our volumes to ramp up significantly. And we are just now beginning -- on the cost improvements, we have seen some cost improvements recently on the completion side. Those are kicking in. We're not a pad drilling with the exception of our science pad, and that pad had 7 wells drilled on. But we've spent a lot of time on that. We did a lot of coring, so that wasn't a well improvement, if you will, on cost. So we really think the drive to get to the $10.5 million or lower well cost will kick in more at the beginning of the year, end of the year. So at this point, we're still -- the wells we had drilling were completed. There were already some of the problem wells, so those wells' costs didn't come down. We expect to do a little better in the fourth quarter. And then when we get to full-pad drilling and our service costs are lower and then those things happen or all of the rigs are fit for purpose, we expect to see the drive to cost really kick in more towards the next year."

Welcome to WPX's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call and thank you for your interest in WPX. A few reminders about WPX. We have strengthened our portfolio with 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves and in an appropriate commodity environment, we can grow all 3 of our products -- oil, liquids and natural gas -- at a double-digit production growth rate for many years. In other words, we could double the size of our company within 5 years in the right environment and still have room to grow. Few companies with that kind of existing portfolio could accomplish this like we can. We have tremendous flexibility in the strength of our assets to ramp our capital up or down, depending -- without losing leases in value depending on commodity prices.
Our technical and low-cost leadership provide us strength in our operations. Our strong balance sheet of $1.7 billion liquidity puts us in a position of strength to grow at the appropriate time. And by choice and by design, this portfolio was set up to be in the best oil basin in the nation in the Bakken, the best gas and liquids basin in the Piceance, and the best gas basin in Marcellus.
I'm now on Slide 4, which it looks like it's already on Slide 4. Third quarter highlights. We continued to perform well in the face of 10-year low natural gas prices and a fall off in NGL prices. We've generated year-to-date adjusted EBITDAX of $744 million and on target for the full year adjusted EBITDAX in excess of $1 billion.
Very importantly, we're reaffirming our full year production guidance of the 1.38 Bcf a day for 2012 on equivalent basis. This is the guidance we gave in February when we were in the process of severely cutting our capital budget by $425 million in response to the decade-low gas prices.
For the year, we expect our natural gas production to be up 3%; our oil production on target at 40%; and liquid production up 5% from 2011. Each of these -- if you look at them specifically, we are on target for our oil production growth for the year. We were slightly behind in the third quarter on the Bakken, but I'll talk about that in a few minutes. We are ahead on natural gas production. We originally thought we'd be down slightly in natural gas production. We'll be ahead on natural gas production. And we're slightly behind on liquids. A lot of that was in the third quarter due to some flat turnarounds in maintenance, which we can also talk about in a few minutes. But on equivalent basis, we're right on target. 
Our CapEx range is in step slightly to $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion, which is inclusive of the new oil projects, the exploration projects. And our quarterly growth in the Bakken was affected by completions that were delayed from the second quarter to late in the third quarter, very late in the third quarter.
Our third quarter average production of 9,600 barrels oil per day has already increased approximately 9% to October of 10,500 barrels oil per day, and we do expect to reach our planned December exit rate.
For 2013, we're deep into the process of our capital allocation process, which is based on rate of return. Our 3 core areas: The Piceance, the Bakken and Marcellus are competing for 2013 capital. They're based on returns, and we plan to publicly discuss our 2013 budget early next year.
We are pleased to see the recent recovery in natural gas prices, which enhances our low-cost Piceance value position and Marcellus position. We're one of the most operationally levered companies to recover in natural gas prices. The Piceance can be the first and fastest to grow volumes given our low-cost advantage, large drilling inventory, over 10,000 gross locations, and there are no infrastructure constraints in the Piceance. And Piceance has significant excess takeaway of 2.5 Bcf of excess transportation takeaways.
Slide 5. Looking at the Piceance, we spud 43 wells in the third quarter. We've seen a 50% increase in the number of wells we can drill per rig since 2007, so we continue to be much more efficient there. A couple of record wells have been drilled recently. In the Ryan Gulch, a record well was drilled in 8.5 days. With an average Ryan Gulch, wells are now 11 to 12 days. Just 3 years ago, we took 25 days to drill a Ryan Gulch well. Consistently drilling our Valley wells now at about 9 days or less, and we have a record Valley day of 3.8 days that we've drilled a well in.
We continue to add additional water handling disposal capacity, which does -- continues to what the Piceance does best, which is lowering costs. And we're clearing total depth on our first horizontal Mancos/Niobrara well, which I have more of this in the next slide.
We have -- we do have a prolific resource base in the Piceance without the Mancos of 12.2 Tcf, and that does not include the Mancos/Niobrara, but we -- again, I'll talk about that in the next slide.
And I'm very proud of our team for winning 2 awards for environmental protection recently through appropriate reduction in what we call our split-rig design and our waste minimization.
Slide 6. WPX is positioned, we believe, to grow rapidly when natural gas prices recover. As I mentioned, prices are up $0.34 or 9.5% to $3.90 from when our last call was. We believe we're positioned to grow rapidly, and Piceance side rigs -- size rigs will be available versus rigs required for the horizontal gas plays.
As you can see of this graph, we have rapidly grown before. We grew 157 Bcfe on the left-hand part of this graph in the Piceance from 2004 to 2008. And we can now -- we believe we can grow again. With less rigs, we're so much more efficient. This time, we'd have 17 rigs to do this versus 26 rigs. We're not at 17 rigs, we're at 5 rigs, but it just shows what we could do when gas prices recover. And again, we could grow almost exactly the same we did last time at 155 Bcfe.
In the Piceance, we have advantage of a very large permit inventory in hand and ready to drill, and those permits are 2-year-type permits. Infrastructure and capacity is in place. The team is highly experienced, very talented drilling staff, has done it before, lowest drilling completion operating costs in the basin and we have available rigs. So we believe, with our people and our knowledge and when the time is right, the Piceance will recover fast as many of the gas basins.
Slide 7, let me remind you that we already control this resource and that we -- in the Piceance, we have significant upside in what's called the Mancos/Niobrara formation. It is a gas formation in this particular part of the basin, with 168,000 net deep acres. There have been 35 wells drilled by other operators. It's one of the few times in the Piceance we've let other people go first, and we're enjoying what they've done. They're de-risking the play for us. The wells are being reported in 6 Bcf range. We believe we have 20 to 30 Tcf of unbooked resource potential, and none of that is included in our 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves and/or none of that is also included in our 10,000 remaining Piceance traditional locations. So we have a lot of opportunity here.
We did a vertical well in 2011 and tested 2 zones, and we have other zones we can test. And both of those zones have very strong results with IPs of 1 million plus a day.
We did spud our first horizontal well in August of 2012. We've obtained 535 feet of core and specialty logs, which we think will really help us in the future. We expect to TD this well in mid-November, begin completion the first week in December and we'll have results to discuss in the first quarter of 2013.
Slide 8. Turning to the Bakken, we currently have 5 rigs running the Bakken. As you know, we dropped a rig during the quarter for efficiency purposes. We are gaining -- and speaking of efficiency, we're gaining efficiency and we expect to complete 14 wells in the fourth quarter, and that's a significant improvement of what we've done for the year. Of the year, we've only completed 22 wells in the first 9 months, so we'll have a lot of activity in the Bakken in the fourth quarter.
We continue to delineate our acreage and now have only 5 wells left to drill, to hold all of our acreage by production. That will allow us to move next year and later this year to much more efficient pad drilling.
In the third quarter, we had some delineation in our areas in the southern part, which is depicted by the light green. We've had a well come in above expectations. It looks like it's going to be about a 740,000 barrel reserve well versus expectations that  were in the lower 600s.
On the eastern part, the light red, we have drilled some wells there and are waiting on completion. And the Western delineation is in light blue, that is also awaiting on completion.
So in addition to having all of our wells drilled, or all of our acreage held by production by the end of the year or early next year, we are -- also delineated a major part of our acreage.
I want to also point that the Bakken West Texas differentials have improved from what was $17 in the first quarter to approximately $10 in the third quarter, and it's about $13 in the second quarter. October basis currently is only around $2, and we expect the balance of the year to trade about $4 or so. This dramatic improvement is due to the improved takeaway capacity at the basin. Primarily rail tech takeaway capacity has grown from 275,000 barrels a day to approximately 730,000 barrels a day, and most of this growth has occurred in late second quarter and early third quarter.
We also [indiscernible] that LLS and WTI spread has widened, from $12 in the first quarter to $20. So it makes a very competitive alternative to rail and what we try to do mostly with.
Our outlook in 2013 supports a differential in the $5 to $10 range, so we continue to see improvement in the basis differentials there. And we also have a science project under way, which I'll talk about in the next slide, Slide 9.
Well, we've had a successful infill density project, which is validating our resource. The purpose of this slide and purpose of this project has been -- and it has slowed us down somewhat in the Bakken and delayed some things, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. We want to understand the potential to increase the number of drilling locations and reserves. I want to optimize our infill density. We've only drilled 10% of our locations so we have 9% plus of our locations remaining to be drilled. And what we know about today, that could go up if -- obviously if we do have the ability to do any additional infill drilling and additional drilling in other areas.
We want to optimize our completion and designs. We want to understand our geological success factors, and we are in the processes for initiating our multi-well pad operations.
Status of the project is, all these 4 Middle Bakken and 3 wells have been drilled and will be on production in October. There's -- are on production this month. We drilled 4 Middle Bakken and 3 Three Forks wells on a 1,280-acre unit. It's our best well drilled, which is why we're optimistic about going forward. It was 19 drilling days, and we averaged on the pad 26 drilling days and 1-day-type moves.
We had successful data acquisition with 372 feet of core recovered. We cored the entire Bakken Formation: the Upper, the Middle, the Lower and the Pronghorn. We cored the entire Three Forks Formation, all benches, all 4 benches. We also cored a portion of the Lodgepole and the Birdbear Formations. So we have a ton of data that we have that will be coming in. And we had seismic and specialty logs shot obviously during this time. So production is recently online, and we should have initial -- some of our initial study results in the first quarter of 2013. But keep in mind, this will be a long-term project that will allow us to do quite a bit with the vast amount of locations we have left.
Slide 10. As I mentioned, our production in October has already increased 9% from the third quarter average, and our efficiencies are beginning to kick in with 14 completions scheduled in the fourth quarter versus 22 in the first 9 months of this year.
And if you look at this slide, on a BOE per day basis, our production should increase about 19% in the fourth quarter from the third. So we expect quite a bit of production increase in the fourth quarter based on these completions. You can see the rapid growth we've had. Keep in mind, we didn't take over operations of this asset until late in the second quarter of 2011. So we had tremendous growth since that time.
Slide 11. Looking at the Bakken costs, we've generally been drilling one well per pad, as you know, and these initial wells have been bearing the upfront infrastructure costs, which includes the pads, the roads, all facilities.
Looking at this slide, we've detailed our expected cost savings from transitioning in multi-well padding, pad drilling, improved service delivery and reduced service costs. We've also successfully negotiated lower service costs here in the Bakken during the third quarter, and these benefits will start to showing up in the fourth quarter.
We're staying with our previously communicated targeted well cost of $10.5 million. And keep in mind, we do use ceramic. As our operations mature and the transition to pad drilling takes place, which will be -- prevail across of our next -- all of our operations next year in the Bakken.
We did reduce our well count to 5 to narrow our focus and resources and make sure we give folks some expected improvements. And another thing we have that will be completed in the fourth quarter is our Van Hook gathering system will provide us initial savings of $2 to $4 per barrel and ultimately, savings from -- once the pipeline from our central delivery point at Van Hook install is completed, which will be in the first quarter of 2013, will be more like a $4 to $5 per barrel savings. So things will continue to get better in the Bakken.
Looking at the Marcellus in Slide 12. Our WPX model efficiency -- efficiency model is really taking hold in the Marcellus, transitioning to 3 fit-for-purpose rigs. We have 1 rigging up, 1 that's on and 1 coming still. Our move times have been cut by as much as 30%. We've had a 35% drop in completion costs from the fourth quarter of 2011 to third quarter of 2012.
Our net production did increase, only 3% from the second quarter to third quarter, despite even higher Laser line pressures than we had in the second quarter. We estimate at least $30 million a day of net production, is constrained by infrastructure still. I'm very happy to say at least some of our compression projects have kicked in and our first WPX pad compression project doubled our volumes on that particular pad in Susquehanna late in the third quarter.
Now let's turn to the next slide and talk a little bit more about that. This compressor started up on September 26 and as you can see, the average production from the wells on this pad doubled from 5 million a day to 10 million a day, and they've stayed flat. We believe that we have additional one -- we have one more pad that we can do this with, and we're just now starting it up and we expect similar results. Unfortunately, we're not going to do this on all of our pads because we expect and believe that Williams will be able to -- for the bigger volumes growth, we'll install a field compression that's scheduled for startup hopefully by the end of the year end. And as you know, Williams bought the Laser system. And that compression should be in by the end of the year, we hope, or early next year.
You can see just one example of how the production responds to lower pressure, and we believe we can actually lower the pressure further. We could have lowered it further during the quarter, but there was a one-in outage and there also was some maintenance in one of Williams' compressor statement -- stations.
Looking at Slide 16 (sic) [Slide 14]. One more thing on the Marcellus. Our spud to rig release times actually went up slightly in the third quarter from second quarter with the start of the Orion rig that went from 16 days to 17 days, but we're already back down to under 15 days. Typically, with a new rig, and the new rigs, it takes a well or 2 to get back -- get to where you want to start moving, and we're under 15 days. We did shatter our drilling record time of 14 days in the third quarter, with a new a record of 11 days on a 4,300-foot lateral. I've mentioned the collision costs were down significantly. And the Marcellus, to me, with the deficiency starting to kick in, is a great example. Our transport, our Piceance model, our knowledge into a new area, and we expect this to occur in the Bakken also.
Apco, very quickly. Traditional drilling is meeting expectations. We did establish some productivity from the Vaca Muerta shale with 2 frac-ed vertically drilled wells. To truly prove up this resource, it will take horizontal drilling. The environment, as you know, in Argentina is challenging currently. And we have one more concession to get done, which we expect to be accomplished in the first half of 2013 in the Rio Negro province.
Columbia, we've had 2 consecutive discovers -- discoveries in the Llanos basin. The first well is producing about 3,500 barrels of oil a day. We have a 20% interest in that. The second well is in the process of being tested, and we'll have additional prospects drilled in 2013.
And on Apco, from a production and earnings standpoint, through the second quarter, Apco was tracking towards a record year in production and record year in earnings. And things continue to go well from that standpoint.
Now I'll turn this over to Rod for the financial update."

Comparing third quarter 2012 to third quarter 2011, results were impacted by lower realized prices across all of our commodities. We continue to face a challenging liquids environment, further impacted by constraints",683,"Thank you, Ralph. Turning to Slide 17. Comparing third quarter 2012 to third quarter 2011, results were impacted by lower realized prices across all of our commodities. We continue to face a challenging liquids environment, further impacted by constraints on the mapple  [ph] system, which has resulted in reduced fractionation of ethane at the Meeker processing facility. We've also seen volumes impacted in the third quarter due to some plant turnarounds at Willow Creek in July. And then we also will continue to have some higher processing costs related to Willow Creek until those charges step down in 2013.
Third quarter revenues were also impacted by net -- $21 million net loss associated with derivatives not designated under hedge accounting. These are largely oil. If you'll recall, we recorded significant gain in the second quarter for the 9 months -- first 9 months in 2012, we have approximately $63 million in net derivative gains.
Also, our year-to-date results were impacted by $117 million in impairments related to decline in forward natural gas prices. These were recorded in the first and second quarters, and we had no impairments in the third quarter.
For the third quarter, WPX's overall production on equivalent basis averaged 1,359 million cubic feet per day, which was down 2% from a year ago. As Ralph mentioned, this decrease was a planned response to lower gas prices that we anticipated for this year. We generated $230 million in EBITDAX for the third quarter. I'd expect to generate over $1 billion for the year.
Our adjusted net loss for the quarter was $47 million versus $14 million of adjusted net income for the same period in 2011. Adjusted net loss for the 9 months was $84 million versus net income of $55 million for the same period last year.
I would point out even though we had lower production on a per-unit basis, we did manage to keep a number of our key costs flat or experience a decrease.
Capital spending in the third quarter was $337 million. And with 2 months left in the year, we expect 2012 spending to be approximately $1.5 billion. I think we said on the second quarter call that we were targeting $1.4 billion, and that would be a challenging number. I think we really feel strongly that we're going to get in at under $1.5 billion.
Slide 18. Liquidity at the end of quarter was approximately $1.7 billion. This was comprised of available cash in our undrawn $1.5 billion corporate credit facility.
Turning to Slide 19, just looking quickly at a summary of our hedges. As we've said repeatedly, we like to target about 50% annually, hedging about 50% annually of our production. For the balance of 2012, we've got about 59% of our gas production hedged, with fixed price swaps at a weighted average price of $5.06. We've got about 72% of our crude oil production hedged through a combination of fixed price swaps and costless collars. The average on the fixed price swaps is $98.20, and the range on the costless collars ranges from $85 to $106. About 15% of our liquids are hedged, with fixed price swaps at $50.74 a barrel, remind you that we hedged the individual -- we hedged the components individually.
We're also on this slide showing you a snapshot of where we stand for 2013. We had indicated that we were kind of looking for a $4 price target on natural gas.  When the prices jumped up early October, we did start layering on some hedges. And you can see, we've got some -- and then for -- on the oil side, we've got some very attractive hedges on our crude oil production. Our gas production is hedged with fixed price swaps at an average price of $4.23. We have some additional volumes capped at $4.05. Greater than 50% of our crude production is hedged with fixed price swaps at a little over $100 and we've got some additional volumes capped at $108.
With that, I'd like to turn it back to Ralph to close out the call."

Looking again at WPX and why invest in WPX, we are a top 10 domestic gas producer. We're actually -- about 80% of our production is gas. We have -- we are in the process of transitioning to some oil and more oil and more liquids, but we are a gas producer and we believe we're exposed well to gas as gas prices recover. We believe the low-cost, liquids-rich Piceance basin will grow first and fastest when gas prices do recover. And we have additional exposure, not in any of our numbers, in the Mancos, both in the Piceance and the San Juan Basin, which adds resource potential about 22 to 33 Tcf.
We do have increasing oil exposure and ability to grow NGLs. Our domestic oil production, we expect will continue to grow at a compounded average growth rate through 2015 at 25% to 30%, a significant growth rate on a compounded annual growth rate.
Our domestic NGL production is more than 29,000 barrels a day, and we have ability to grow that by 50% in 2014 with the planned expansion of what happened in the Piceance. So we have ability to grow our liquids significantly. And we did recently announce $100 million capital increase for oil-focused exploration activities. We should have some results to talk with you about by mid-year 2013. Thus, we expect to be able to tell you what we have at that time.
We do have an improving cost structure. I think this is very important, so I'm not going to read every bullet here to you. But on an annual basis -- if you look at our annual basis, by the fourth quarter of 2013, our cost structure improves by $117 million. And when you look at that on an annual basis, by the end of 2014, it improves by $205 million total. So significant cost improvements coming to WPX. These are already contractually done or being built or automatic improvements, so those will be happening for us: $117 million by the end of '13, $205 million by the end of 2014.
Our balance sheet remains very strong with superior credit metrics. We have demonstrated willingness to divest in non-core assets. We did the Barnett/Arkoma sale in April of this year, and we have some other assets that are not, if you will, winning the fight for capital. So we'll be continuing to look at those assets where their best place is. And thus, our CapEx is focused on the highest return core areas and emerging oil plays: so Bakken is oil-focused, Piceance is low-cost and liquids-rich, and Marcellus is our highest dry gas EURs. So we have 3 great basins to deploy our capital in.
With that, I appreciate your interest in the company today, and thank you for your interest. And we'll turn it over to David and to the operator."

So we expect our volumes to ramp up significantly. And we are just now beginning on the cost improvements -- we have seen some cost improvements recently on the completion side. Those are kicking in. We're not at pad drilling with the exception of our science pad, and that pad had 7 wells drilled on. But we spent a lot of time on that. We did a lot of coring, so that wasn't a well improvement, if you will, on cost. So we really think the drive to get to the $10.5 million or lower our well costs will kick in more at the beginning of the year, end of the year. So at this point, we're still -- the wells we had drilling were completed. There were already some of the problem wells, so those wells' costs didn't come down. We expect to do a little better in the fourth quarter. And then when we get to full-pad drilling and our service costs are lower and then those things happen or all of the rigs are fit for purpose, we expect to see the drive to cost really kick in more towards the next year."

We had a plant turnaround in July 7 to July 12, the entire plant was shutdown. And then as well, we had some maintenance that we experienced on Overland Pass Pipeline. Those 2 events reduced our NGL barrels by about a little over 100,000 barrels in the month of July. And then in addition to that, we continue to suffer from some reduced ethane extraction at Meeker. Currently, we're recovering about 50% of our ethane in the third quarter. Compare that to the first quarter, we recovered about 75% of our ethane through the Meeker plant. So that was about 60,000 to 70,000 barrels a day at Meeker. So you combine those 2 issues and we're looking at about 170,000 barrels total that was -- that we were impacted in the quarter."

Welcome to WPX's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call and thank you for your interest in WPX. A few reminders about WPX. We have strengthened our portfolio with 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves and in an appropriate commodity environment, we can grow all 3 of our products, oil, liquids and natural gas, at a double-digit production growth rate for many years. In other words, we could double the size of our company within 5 years in the right environment and still have room to grow. Few companies with that kind of existing portfolio could accomplish this like we can. We have tremendous flexibility in the strength of our assets to ramp our capital up or down, depending -- without losing leases in value depending on commodity prices.
Our technical and low-cost leadership provide us strength in our operations. Our strong balance sheet of $1.7 billion liquidity puts us in a position of strength to grow at the appropriate time. And by choice and by design, this portfolio was set up to be in the best oil basin in the nation in the Bakken, the best gas and liquids basin in the Piceance, and the best gas basin in Marcellus.
I'm now on Slide 4, which it looks like it's already on Slide 4. Third quarter highlights. We continued to perform well in the face of 10-year low natural gas prices and a fall off in NGL prices. We've generated year-to-date adjusted EBITDAX of $744 million and on target for the full year adjusted EBITDAX in excess of $1 billion.
Very importantly, we're reaffirming our full year production guidance of the 1.38 Bcf a day for 2012 on equivalent basis. This is the guidance we gave in February when we were in the process of severely cutting our capital budget by $425 million in response to the decade-low gas prices.
For the year, we expect our natural gas production to be up 3%; our oil production on target at 40%; and liquid production up 5% from 2011. Each of these -- if you look at them specifically, we are on target for our oil production growth for the year. We were slightly behind in the third quarter on the Bakken, but I'll talk about that in a few minutes. We are ahead on natural gas production. We originally thought we'd be down slightly in natural gas production. We'll be ahead on natural gas production. And we're slightly behind on liquids. A lot of that was in the third quarter due to some flat turnarounds in maintenance, which we can also talk about in a few minutes. But on equivalent basis, we're right on target. 
Our CapEx range is in step slightly to $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion, which is inclusive of the new oil projects, the exploration projects. And our quarterly growth in the Bakken was affected by completions that were delayed from the second quarter to late in the third quarter, very late in the third quarter.
Our third quarter average production of 9,600 barrels oil per day has already increased approximately 9% to October of 10,500 barrels oil per day, and we do expect to reach our planned December exit rate.
For 2013, we're deep into the process of our capital allocation process, which is based on rate of return. Our 3 core areas: The Piceance, the Bakken and Marcellus are competing for 2013 capital. They're based on returns, and we plan to publicly discuss our 2013 budget early next year.
We are pleased to see the recent recovery in natural gas prices, which enhances our low-cost Piceance value position and Marcellus position. We're one of the most operationally levered companies to recover in natural gas prices. The Piceance can be the first and fastest to grow volumes given our low-cost advantage, large drilling inventory, over 10,000 gross locations, and there are no infrastructure constraints in the Piceance. And Piceance has significant excess takeaway of 2.5 Bcf of excess transportation takeaways.
Slide 5. Looking at the Piceance, we spud 43 wells in the third quarter. We've seen a 50% increase in the number of wells we can drill per rig since 2007, so we continue to be much more efficient there. A couple of record wells have been drilled recently. In the Ryan Gulch, a record well was drilled in 8.5 days. With an average Ryan Gulch, wells are now 11 to 12 days. Just 3 years ago, we took 25 days to drill a Ryan Gulch well. Consistently drilling our Valley wells now at about 9 days or less, and we have a record Valley day of 3.8 days that we've drilled a well in.
We continue to add additional water handling disposal capacity, which does -- continues to what the Piceance does best, which is lowering costs. And we're clearing total depth on our first horizontal Mancos/Niobrara well, which I have more of this in the next slide.
We have -- we do have a prolific resource base in the Piceance without the Mancos of 12.2 Tcf, and that does not include the Mancos/Niobrara, but we -- again, I'll talk about that in the next slide.
And I'm very proud of our team for winning 2 awards for environmental protection recently through appropriate reduction in what we call our split-rig design and our waste minimization.
Slide 6. WPX is positioned, we believe, to grow rapidly when natural gas prices recover. As I mentioned, prices are up $0.34 or 9.5% to $3.90 from when our last call was. We believe we're positioned to grow rapidly, and Piceance side rigs -- size rigs will be available versus rigs required for the horizontal gas plays.
As you can see of this graph, we have rapidly grown before. We grew 157 Bcfe on the left-hand part of this graph in the Piceance from 2004 to 2008. And we can now -- we believe we can grow again. With less rigs, we're so much more efficient. This time, we'd have 17 rigs to do this versus 26 rigs. We're not at 17 rigs, we're at 5 rigs, but it just shows what we could do when gas prices recover. And again, we could grow almost exactly the same we did last time at 155 Bcfe.
In the Piceance, we have advantage of a very large permit inventory in hand and ready to drill, and those permits are 2-year-type permits. Infrastructure and capacity is in place. The team is highly experienced, very talented drilling staff, has done it before, lowest drilling completion operating costs in the basin and we have available rigs. So we believe, with our people and our knowledge and when the time is right, the Piceance will recover fast as many of the gas basins.
Slide 7, let me remind you that we already control this resource and that we -- in the Piceance, we have significant upside in what's called the Mancos/Niobrara formation. It is a gas formation in this particular part of the basin, with 168,000 net deep acres. There have been 35 wells drilled by other operators. It's one of the few times in the Piceance we've let other people go first, and we're enjoying what they've done. They're de-risking the play for us. The wells are being reported in 6 Bcf range. We believe we have 20 to 30 Tcf of unbooked resource potential, and none of that is included in our 18.5 Tcf of 3P reserves and/or none of that is also included in our 10,000 remaining Piceance traditional locations. So we have a lot of opportunity here.
We did a vertical well in 2011 and tested 2 zones, and we have other zones we can test. And both of those zones have very strong results with IPs of 1 million plus a day.
We did spud our first horizontal well in August of 2012. We've obtained 535 feet of core and specialty logs, which we think will really help us in the future. We expect to TD this well in mid-November, begin completion the first week in December and we'll have results to discuss in the first quarter of 2013.
Slide 8. Turning to the Bakken, we currently have 5 rigs running the Bakken. As you know, we dropped a rig during the quarter for efficiency purposes. We are gaining -- and speaking of efficiency, we're gaining efficiency and we expect to complete 14 wells in the fourth quarter, and that's a significant improvement of what we've done for the year. Of the year, we've only completed 22 wells in the first 9 months, so we'll have a lot of activity in the Bakken in the fourth quarter.
We continue to delineate our acreage and now have only 5 wells left to drill, to hold all of our acreage by production. That will allow us to move next year and later this year to much more efficient pad drilling.
In the third quarter, we had some delineation in our areas in the southern part, which is depicted by the light green. We've had a well come in above expectations. It looks like it's going to be about a 740,000 barrel reserve well versus expectations that  were in the lower 600s.
On the eastern part, the light red, we have drilled some wells there and are waiting on completion. And the Western delineation is in light blue, that is also awaiting on completion.
So in addition to having all of our wells drilled, or all of our acreage held by production by the end of the year or early next year, we are -- also delineated a major part of our acreage.
I want to also point that the Bakken West Texas differentials have improved from what was $17 in the first quarter to approximately $10 in the third quarter, and it's about $13 in the second quarter. October basis currently is only around $2, and we expect the balance of the year to trade about $4 or so. This dramatic improvement is due to the improved takeaway capacity at the basin. Primarily rail tech takeaway capacity has grown from 275,000 barrels a day to approximately 730,000 barrels a day, and most of this growth has occurred in late second quarter and early third quarter.
We also [indiscernible] that LLS and WTI spread has widened, from $12 in the first quarter to $20. So it makes a very competitive alternative to rail and what we try to do mostly with.
Our outlook in 2013 supports a differential in the $5 to $10 range, so we continue to see improvement in the basis differentials there. And we also have a science project under way, which I'll talk about in the next slide, Slide 9.
Well, we've had a successful infill density project, which is validating our resource. The purpose of this slide and purpose of this project has been -- and it has slowed us down somewhat in the Bakken and delayed some things, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. We want to understand the potential to increase the number of drilling locations and reserves. I want to optimize our infill density. We've only drilled 10% of our locations so we have 9% plus of our locations remaining to be drilled. And what we know about today, that could go up if -- obviously if we do have the ability to do any additional infill drilling and additional drilling in other areas.
We want to optimize our completion and designs. We want to understand our geological success factors, and we are in the processes for initiating our multi-well pad operations.
Status of the project is, all these 4 Middle Bakken and 3 wells have been drilled and will be on production in October. There's -- are on production this month. We drilled 4 Middle Bakken and 3 Three Forks wells on a 1,280-acre unit. It's our best well drilled, which is why we're optimistic about going forward. It was 19 drilling days, and we averaged on the pad 26 drilling days and 1-day-type moves.
We had successful data acquisition with 372 feet of core recovered. We cored the entire Bakken Formation: the Upper, the Middle, the Lower and the Pronghorn. We cored the entire Three Forks Formation, all benches, all 4 benches. We also cored a portion of the Lodgepole and the Birdbear Formations. So we have a ton of data that we have that will be coming in. And we had seismic and specialty logs shot obviously during this time. So production is recently online, and we should have initial -- some of our initial study results in the first quarter of 2013. But keep in mind, this will be a long-term project that will allow us to do quite a bit with the vast amount of locations we have left.
Slide 10. As I mentioned, our production in October has already increased 9% from the third quarter average, and our efficiencies are beginning to kick in with 14 completions scheduled in the fourth quarter versus 22 in the first 9 months of this year.
And if you look at this slide, on a BOE per day basis, our production should increase about 19% in the fourth quarter from the third. So we expect quite a bit of production increase in the fourth quarter based on these completions. You can see the rapid growth we've had. Keep in mind, we didn't take over operations of this asset until late in the second quarter of 2011. So we had tremendous growth since that time.
Slide 11. Looking at the Bakken costs, we've generally been drilling one well per pad, as you know, and these initial wells have been bearing the upfront infrastructure costs, which includes the pads, the roads, all facilities.
Looking at this slide, we've detailed our expected cost savings from transitioning in multi-well padding, pad drilling, improved service delivery and reduced service costs. We've also successfully negotiated lower service costs here in the Bakken during the third quarter, and these benefits will start to showing up in the fourth quarter.
We're staying with our previously communicated targeted well cost of $10.5 million. And keep in mind, we do use ceramic. As our operations mature and the transition to pad drilling takes place, which will be -- prevail across of our next -- all of our operations next year in the Bakken.
We did reduce our well count to 5 to narrow our focus and resources and make sure we give folks some expected improvements. And another thing we have that will be completed in the fourth quarter is our Van Hook gathering system will provide us initial savings of $2 to $4 per barrel and ultimately, savings from -- once the pipeline from our central delivery point at Van Hook install is completed, which will be in the first quarter of 2013, will be more like a $4 to $5 per barrel savings. So things will continue to get better in the Bakken.
Looking at the Marcellus in Slide 12. Our WPX model efficiency -- efficiency model is really taking hold in the Marcellus, transitioning to 3 fit-for-purpose rigs. We have 1 rigging up, 1 that's on and 1 coming still. Our move times have been cut by as much as 30%. We've had a 35% drop in completion costs from the fourth quarter of 2011 to third quarter of 2012.
Our net production did increase, only 3% from the second quarter to third quarter, despite even higher Laser line pressures than we had in the second quarter. We estimate at least $30 million a day of net production, is constrained by infrastructure still. I'm very happy to say at least some of our compression projects have kicked in and our first WPX pad compression project doubled our volumes on that particular pad in Susquehanna late in the third quarter.
Now let's turn to the next slide and talk a little bit more about that. This compressor started up on September 26 and as you can see, the average production from the wells on this pad doubled from 5 million a day to 10 million a day, and they've stayed flat. We believe that we have additional one -- we have one more pad that we can do this with, and we're just now starting it up and we expect similar results. Unfortunately, we're not going to do this on all of our pads because we expect and believe that Williams will be able to -- for the bigger volumes growth, we'll install a field compression that's scheduled for startup hopefully by the end of the year end. And as you know, Williams bought the Laser system. And that compression should be in by the end of the year, we hope, or early next year.
You can see just one example of how the production responds to lower pressure, and we believe we can actually lower the pressure further. We could have lowered it further during the quarter, but there was a one-in outage and there also was some maintenance in one of Williams' compressor statement -- stations.
Looking at Slide 16 (sic) [Slide 14]. One more thing on the Marcellus. Our spud to rig release times actually went up slightly in the third quarter from second quarter with the start of the Orion rig that went from 16 days to 17 days, but we're already back down to under 15 days. Typically, with a new rig, and the new rigs, it takes a well or 2 to get back -- get to where you want to start moving, and we're under 15 days. We did shatter our drilling record time of 14 days in the third quarter, with a new a record of 11 days on a 4,300-foot lateral. I've mentioned the collision costs were down significantly. And the Marcellus, to me, with the deficiency starting to kick in, is a great example. Our transport, our Piceance model, our knowledge into a new area, and we expect this to occur in the Bakken also.
Apco, very quickly. Traditional drilling is meeting expectations. We did establish some productivity from the Vaca Muerta shale with 2 frac-ed vertically drilled wells. To truly prove up this resource, it will take horizontal drilling. The environment, as you know, in Argentina is challenging currently. And we have one more concession to get done, which we expect to be accomplished in the first half of 2013 in the Rio Negro province.
Columbia, we've had 2 consecutive discovers -- discoveries in the Llanos basin. The first well is producing about 3,500 barrels of oil a day. We have a 20% interest in that. The second well is in the process of being tested, and we'll have additional prospects drilled in 2013.
And on Apco, from a production and earnings standpoint, through the second quarter, Apco was tracking towards a record year in production and record year in earnings. And things continue to go well from that standpoint.
Now I'll turn this over to Rod for the financial update."

Comparing third quarter 2012 to third quarter 2011, results were impacted by lower realized prices across all of our commodities. We continue to face a challenging liquids environment, further impacted by constraints on the mapple  [ph] system, which has resulted in reduced fractionation of ethane at the Meeker processing facility. We've also seen volumes impacted in the third quarter due to some plant turnarounds at Willow Creek in July. And then we also will continue to have some higher processing costs related to Willow Creek until those charges step down in 2013.
Third quarter revenues were also impacted by net -- $21 million net loss associated with derivatives not designated under hedge accounting. These are largely oil. If you'll recall, we recorded significant gain in the second quarter for the 9 months -- first 9 months in 2012, we have approximately $63 million in net derivative gains.
Also, our year-to-date results were impacted by $117 million in impairments related to decline in forward natural gas prices. These were recorded in the first and second quarters, and we had no impairments in the third quarter.
For the third quarter, WPX's overall production on equivalent basis averaged 1,359 million cubic feet per day, which was down 2% from a year ago. As Ralph mentioned, this decrease was a planned response to lower gas prices that we anticipated for this year. We generated $230 million in EBITDAX for the third quarter. I'd expect to generate over $1 billion for the year.
Our adjusted net loss for the quarter was $47 million versus $14 million of adjusted net income for the same period in 2011. Adjusted net loss for the 9 months was $84 million versus net income of $55 million for the same period last year.
I would point out even though we had lower production on a per-unit basis, we did manage to keep a number of our key costs flat or experience a decrease.
Capital spending in the third quarter was $337 million. And with 2 months left in the year, we expect 2012 spending to be approximately $1.5 billion. I think we said on the second quarter call that we were targeting $1.4 billion, and that would be a challenging number. I think we really feel strongly that we're going to get in at under $1.5 billion.
Slide 18. Liquidity at the end of quarter was approximately $1.7 billion. This was comprised of available cash in our undrawn $1.5 billion corporate credit facility.
Turning to Slide 19, just looking quickly at a summary of our hedges. As we've said repeatedly, we like to target about 50% annually, hedging about 50% annually of our production. For the balance of 2012, we've got about 59% of our gas production hedged, with fixed price swaps at a weighted average price of $5.06. We've got about 72% of our crude oil production hedged through a combination of fixed price swaps and costless collars. The average on the fixed price swaps is $98.20, and the range on the costless collars ranges from $85 to $106. About 15% of our liquids are hedged, with fixed price swaps at $50.74 a barrel, remind you that we hedged the individual -- we hedged the components individually.
We're also on this slide showing you a snapshot of where we stand for 2013. We had indicated that we were kind of looking for a $4 price target on natural gas.  When the prices jumped up early October, we did start layering on some hedges. And you can see, we've got some -- and then for -- on the oil side, we've got some very attractive hedges on our crude oil production. Our gas production is hedged with fixed price swaps at an average price of $4.23. We have some additional volumes capped at $4.05. Greater than 50% of our crude production is hedged with fixed price swaps at a little over $100 and we've got some additional volumes capped at $108.
With that, I'd like to turn it back to Ralph to close out the call."

And we have additional exposure, not in any of our numbers, in the Mancos, both in the Piceance and the San Juan Basin, which adds resource potential about 22 to 33 Tcf.
We do have increasing oil exposure and ability to grow NGLs. Our domestic oil production, we expect will continue to grow at a compounded average growth rate through 2015 at 25% to 30%, a significant growth rate on a compounded annual growth rate.
Our domestic NGL production is more than 29,000 barrels a day, and we have ability to grow that by 50% in 2014 with the planned expansion of what happened in the Piceance. So we have ability to grow our liquids significantly. And we did recently announce $100 million capital increase for oil-focused exploration activities. We should have some results to talk with you about by mid-year 2013. Thus, we expect to be able to tell you what we have at that time.
We do have an improving cost structure. I think this is very important, so I'm not going to read every bullet here to you. But on an annual basis -- if you look at our annual basis, by the fourth quarter of 2013, our cost structure improves by $117 million. And when you look at that on an annual basis, by the end of 2014, it improves by $205 million total. So significant cost improvements coming to WPX. These are already contractually done or being built or automatic improvements, so those will be happening for us: $117 million by the end of '13, $205 million by the end of 2014.
Our balance sheet remains very strong with superior credit metrics. We have demonstrated willingness to divest in non-core assets. We did the Barnett/Arkoma sale in April of this year, and we have some other assets that are not, if you will, winning the fight for capital. So we'll be continuing to look at those assets where their best place is. And thus, our CapEx is focused on the highest return core areas and emerging oil plays: so Bakken is oil-focused, Piceance is low-cost and liquids-rich, and Marcellus is our highest dry gas EURs. So we have 3 great basins to deploy our capital in.
With that, I appreciate your interest in the company today, and thank you for your interest. And we'll turn it over to David and to the operator."

And that was just a function of really some of the drilling problems we had in the second quarter. So we had -- we really didn't have the completions that were done and were done very late in the quarter, and that caused the volumes to basically flat. And as you saw or hopefully heard, we're going to have 14 completions in the fourth quarter, and that's very close to how we've done for the full year, which is 22. So we expect our volumes to ramp up significantly. And we are just now beginning on the cost improvements -- we have seen some cost improvements recently on the completion side. Those are kicking in. We're not at pad drilling with the exception of our science pad, and that pad had 7 wells drilled on. But we spent a lot of time on that. We did a lot of coring, so that wasn't a well improvement, if you will, on cost. So we really think the drive to get to the $10.5 million or lower our well costs will kick in more at the beginning of the year, end of the year. So at this point, we're still -- the wells we had drilling were completed. There were already some of the problem wells, so those wells' costs didn't come down. We expect to do a little better in the fourth quarter. And then when we get to full-pad drilling and our service costs are lower and then those things happen or all of the rigs are fit for purpose, we expect to see the drive to cost really kick in more towards the next year."
