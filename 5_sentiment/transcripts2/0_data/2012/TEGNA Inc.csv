Given our recent update at the UBS conference and as you may know with our Investor Day just 3 weeks away, we're going to keep our comments brief this morning as we will be providing a comprehensive look at our businesse",2411,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Given our recent update at the UBS conference and as you may know with our Investor Day just 3 weeks away, we're going to keep our comments brief this morning as we will be providing a comprehensive look at our businesses, opportunities and related financial policies that day. 
This morning, I'm going to provide an update on a few of our strategic opportunities and review our results for the quarter. Our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Saleh, will then provide a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and some balance sheet items, and then of course, we'll open it for questions. 
Each of our business segments, as always, was solidly profitable in the quarter and for the full year during a period in which the economy showed modest but uneven growth. Our confidence in the ability of our businesses to continue to consistently deliver substantially free cash flow, several hundred million dollars this year despite the economic and secular headwinds, enables us to continue to fund a range of projects important to our future, return capital to shareholders and pay down debt. 
Now that we are finished with 2011 and are looking towards 2012, we are well on our way to becoming a leading global media and marketing solutions company. Our powerful 100-plus local markets, combined with our iconic national brands, puts us in a great position to provide the most engaging and high-quality content for our audiences and impactful solutions for advertisers and marketers. Our goal at Gannett is to position our company for future growth and continued to expand our revenue opportunities in the face of modest economic growth and secular change. 
We also are reshaping our local news organizations by enhancing our content to meet increasing and changing media consumption habits across all platforms: online, tablet, mobile, broadcast and print and adapting our subscription model to the new media landscape. And we are building businesses that will maximize those strategies extending the reach and enhancing the strength of our rich and recognizable brands. In addition, we are making smart investments to the future as well as increasing the efficiency of our operations. 
Already underway are several key actions that will help us achieve our vision, which is to be the place consumers turn for trusted news and information and the partner advertisers choose to reach and engage consumers, particularly in the local markets we serve. 
Let me start by telling you how we are reshaping local news. To achieve this, our content is always is key. We are focused on providing trusted, relevant, uniquely tailored content that is high value in the communities we serve, and we are expanding and maximizing our ability to offer that content via our multiplatform distribution channels, meaning we are meeting our consumers wherever and whenever they want. 
To that end, we have relaunched 100 mobile websites across our local publishing and broadcasting markets that generate 40 million mobile page views per month. In the fourth quarter, we launched iPhone news apps in 15 TV markets that have been downloaded by 260,000 users and generate 1.5 million page views per month in those markets. 
Currently, we are piloting a new subscription model in 6 markets that builds on the tests we did in 3 markets we've previously mentioned and builds on a better understanding of consumer's needs and preferences. All subscriptions in these markets will include full web, mobile, e-additions and tablet access, as well as the reader's choice of frequency of print edition home delivery. Digital access for nonsubscribers will be limited to a small number of free articles per month. This new subscription model appropriately values the unique, local engaging content being produced by our journalists and noted experts in every community we serve. 
The ability to engage consumers across multiple platforms provides greater value to our business customers, enhancing the ways they reach and connect with local consumers and prospects. And we are also investing in the technology that will ensure an excellent user experience across each platform. This effort is not about the delivery of our content solely. It is about immediacy and a shift to digital first publishing and deeper coverage on the topics that matter most to our customers. We believe that investing in news gathering on the most important topics for our audiences in each market is critical. 
In addition to enhancing our content, we are also developing applications for the platforms that consumers are accessing in growing numbers. And because the potential growth on most devices is significant, we are aggressively developing the next generation of mobile, tablet, desktop and browser products at our local media properties and at USA TODAY. Our products will interface with all operating systems: Apple, Android, Kindle Fire and Windows 8. A great example is the level of downloads of the USA TODAY app we've experienced. At this point, there have been 11.4 million downloads across multiple devices and platforms. We are the #1 free news app on the Windows Phone and the Kindle Fire. 
And it is not just the user-facing applications. A huge challenge in the digital environment is designing content that works effectively for each platform and then monetizing those digital products. As part of that effort, we are integrating all the systems to complete the chain, which include editorial, publishing and ad platforms. We want to be able to manage, report, monitor and sell our digital media through as streamlined process as possible. We have the expertise to get that done, and that will greatly enhance our ability to deliver digital content and solutions for advertisers. 
As I noted earlier, we are building businesses that extend our strong and recognizable brands. I think a great example of this is the USA TODAY Sports Media Group, which leverages the combined strength of our unparalleled local content with USA TODAY's powerful national reach. Building on a great sports portfolio, they are on the right trajectory to become a sports powerhouse. 
Through our local and national assets, the USA TODAY Sports Media Group currently has a total digital reach of nearly 16 million unique monthly viewers and is consistently a top 10 sports digital property according to Comscore, which we expect to increase significantly with our just completed acquisition of Fantasy Sports Ventures Big League Sports, the leading independent sports digital site. When all Fantasy Sports Ventures' assets are ultimately combined with the other properties within the USA TODAY Sports Group, we will be catapulted into one of the top 5 sports sites on the web. With the added scale, we will greatly increase our ability to deliver our engaging content to a wider array of sports fans in a much more meaningful way, which is a huge draw for sports marketers and advertisers in some great scale for a very modest investment. 
One of the primary goals of the USA TODAY sports group is to take the traditional sports page experience and recreate it into a multidimensional experience for consumers through marketing partnerships with marquee sports organizations. In addition to our acquisitions of U.S. Press Wire, mmajunkie.com and Fantasy Sports over the past few months, we have also entered into a important sports marketing agreement with the PGA Tour and have been designated as an official directed media partner of NASCAR. 
We will continue to build out our sports content across all platforms with a particularly strong focus on digital and mobile. This will be one of the most vital parts of our efforts to grow the sports groups business and brand going forward. 
Now let me tell you about our efforts to maximize efficiency. Leveraging our skills to seek new revenue streams was a critical factor in the consolidation of all of our domestic printing and productions operations into a single entity, Gannett Publishing Services. GPS, as we call it, is responsible for all facets of printing domestically and also our production operations: imaging, ad design, printing and packaging, distribution, customer acquisition, retention and direct marketing. We now have the opportunity to even more effectively market our expertise and our scale to third parties. There are a number of revenue opportunities we are currently discussing with potential partners across both printing and distribution. We also expect to create efficiencies as we standardize business practices and eliminate redundancies. The impact of this to the bottom line is expected to be in the $40 million range in 2012 and growing thereafter. 
In fact, an important first step for GPS was the completion of the agreement to outsource the printing and packaging of the Cincinnati Inquirer and the Kentucky Inquirer to a Columbus, Ohio printing facility that we announced in December. Now as you saw this morning, we took some special charges associated with that move this quarter, which Paul will cover in more detail in a few moments. But most importantly, excluding the accrual for multiemployer pension liability, which we will have no matter whether we continue printing in Cincinnati or not, the expected payback is less than 2 years. 
Now let me quickly turn to a review of the quarter. Our results this quarter reflect the uneven and tepid economic recovery and consumer confidence, as well as particularly uneven consumer spending during the holiday season. The positive impact of our strategic effort, both on the digital front and our efficiency efforts, contributed to our results in the quarter. As expected, our success in achieving over $52 million in political advertising in the fourth quarter of 2010 made comparisons extremely difficult this quarter. 
But even with those headwinds, earnings per share in the quarter, when adjusted for special items, totaled $0.72. Total revenue across the company was approximately 5% lower, and total expenses excluding special items were down roughly 2%, resulting in operating income of $291 million and operating cash flow of $339 million. 
Digital segment revenue growth of over 9% was driven primarily by strong revenue results at CareerBuilder. Total revenue at CareerBuilder was up about 15% in the quarter as they continue to increase their market leadership position in North America and their international expansion overseas. And the prospects for continued market share gains in 2012 at CareerBuilder look very promising. In fact, CareerBuilder's December global invoicing was its highest December ever, up a double-digit percentage from December of last year. 
As noted, our digital and cross-platform sales efforts drove increases in digital revenue at our publishing and television operations. As well, overall digital revenues company-wide were up almost 7% and totaled over $290 million for the fourth quarter and $1.1 billion for the year, approximately 21% of our revenue. 
Now to give you a little more detail on our total digital revenues, about $290 million companywide in the quarter, about $181 million as you saw this morning comes from the digital businesses in our Digital segment, with CareerBuilder accounting for about 82% of the Digital segment revenues. 
Our domestic publishing operations, and here, I'm going to exclude operations like Clipper Magazine and Gannett Healthcare and Gannett Military, which are primarily print-centric operations and more specifically, our U.S. Community Publishing sites plus USA TODAY and its digital brands, those operations accounted for approximately 26% or $74 million of total digital advertising revenues in the quarter. 
In our U.S. Community Publishing operations, digital revenues were about 15% or so of their ad revenues, and at USA TODAY, about a quarter of their ad revenues across their brands were digital. 
Turning to broadcasting. As expected in an odd year, revenues were down about 14% due primarily to the challenge of overcoming last year's successful effort in political advertising. Although we had almost $5 million of political spending in the fourth quarter, and as I just said, we achieved $52 million in political spending in the same quarter last year, so television revenues, net of that incremental impact of political spending, were up about 11% as ad sales, retransmission revenue and online revenue were all up solidly in the quarter. 
Based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total television revenues in the first quarter this year to be up in the high single-digits compared to the first quarter last year. 
Turning to publishing, revenues there were approximately 5% lower while digital revenues in the segment were up almost 7%. Advertising comparisons quarter-to-quarter improved relative to the third quarter as national and classified advertising comparisons were better and retail was in line. The monthly retail advertising trends in the quarter in some ways mirrored retail performance in holiday season spending. We saw some apprehension among retailers regarding the 2011 holiday season, and that resulted in a significant increase in discounting. This caused a surge in buying around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, making those some of the best in recent history. However, December spending softened, and retailers reported the largest post-Thanksgiving, pre-Christmas decrease in spending in some time. The soft close in retailing to December was exacerbated by Christmas Day falling on Sunday, which was also the last day of our fiscal year, and we believe that negatively impacted advertising sale across some retail categories, particularly preprint revenue  
Driven by the retail and national categories, November was the best month in the quarter in terms of total advertising in the Publishing segment, followed by December. Although Newsquest results continue to be impacted by the soft U.S. -- U.K. economy, comparisons in the quarter were the best of the year due in large part to classified advertising. 
So again in summary, each of our business segments remained very profitable for the quarter, and as a result, we continue to consistently generate substantial free cash flow. In 2012, we'll continue to leverage our strong local media franchises and iconic national brands and deliver our valued content to customers across multiple platforms while providing innovative solutions for our advertisers. 
Through new subscription models being introduced this year and a comprehensive suite of delivery platforms, investment in adjacent businesses and a continued focus on our operational efficiencies, we are positioning Gannett for continued success as the media landscape evolves. 
As I mentioned, we intend to discuss key initiatives as well as our capital allocation plans at Gannett's Investor Day on Wednesday, February 22 at our offices at New York. Invitations will be sent out in a few days, and Jeff Heinz has reminded me to tell you to please RSVP as seating will be limited. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul."

I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments and then I'll comment on some balance sheet items. As Gracia noted, we generated approximately $1.4 billion in revenues in the quarter.",1329,"Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments and then I'll comment on some balance sheet items. 
As Gracia noted, we generated approximately $1.4 billion in revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding special items, were $1.1 billion, a decline of 2% year-over-year. Operating cash flow totaled $339 million, as shown on Table 7 of our earnings release. As importantly, we generated free cash flow of $203 million and that's shown on Table 10.  
For the full year, total revenues were $5.2 billion, and operating cash flow, excluding special items, totaled $1.1 billion, in line with the guidance we provided to you in December. We again generated substantial free cash flow of $775 million in 2011 despite the soft economic environment in the U.S. and the U.K. and the relative absence of incremental even-year political and Olympic advertising that benefited our results in 2010. 
Turning back to the quarter. Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.49. Earnings per share -- per diluted share excluding special items were $0.72. In the fourth quarter, we recorded several special items that totaled about $107 million pretax or $0.23 per share, and those are detailed on Table 5 of our earnings release. 
Let me review these items in more detail. First, we had a pretax charge of approximately $64 million for workforce restructuring and facility consolidations. This includes a charge associated with the transfer of production activities for the Cincinnati Inquirer to a third-party printer at Columbus, Ohio, as previously disclosed. The majority of the charge from the move to Columbus relates to the recognition of withdrawal liabilities for multiemployer union pension plans, and the balance relates to severance and benefit costs. 
Second, during the quarter, we reported special charges of $14.7 million for the disability-related retirement of our former Chairman and CEO. 
Third, we recognized special non-cash charges affecting nonoperating income, which totaled $28 million pretax or $0.07 per share related to minority investments. And finally, our results included a special tax benefit of $11 million or $0.04 per share relating to an impairment that was taken previously but not recognized until now for tax purposes. 
Turning to our segment results. Total Publishing segment's revenues were 5% lower in the quarter. Advertising revenue was 7% lower. However, year-over-year advertising revenue comparisons improved sequentially. Gracia has already discussed retail trends in the quarter so I'll comment on the other advertising categories. 
National advertising was down approximately 9% in the quarter but up more than 6 percentage points from third quarter comparisons. At USA TODAY, we experienced strength in several categories, particularly telecommunications, credit cards and automotive, which helped to partially offset declines in travel, entertainment and technology categories. 
At Newsquest, national advertising was up 7% in local currency, consistent with the trend we saw in the third quarter. Classified advertising for the Publishing segment was down 8.4% but up slightly sequentially. In the U.S., classified advertising was down but we saw sequential improvement in all categories excluding employment which was relatively flat. But in December, employment advertising was up year-over-year. 
Real estate classified advertising declined in the quarter, reflecting continued weakness in the housing market. However, year-over-year comparisons improved about 5 percentage points relative to third quarter. And the trends in the real estate category improved over the course of the fourth quarter. 
In California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada, which where the states most impacted by the real estate crisis, real estate advertising trends were in line with other regions of the country. On the other hand, employment advertising and auto advertising trends were still better at our properties outside of the states. 
Classified category comparisons at Newsquest in pounds were better this quarter relative to the third quarter as all category comparison improved excluding auto. Employment advertising comparison improved 7 percentage points from third quarter comparisons. 
Gracia gave you the major components of digital advertising for the Publishing segment. Successful cross-platform and marketing solution efforts contributed to a 7% increase in digital publishing revenue for the quarter. The increase was due to a 6% gain in digital revenue in U.S. Community Publishing, auto, employment and local digital revenue, the largest categories, all contributed to the gain. 
Digital revenue was a bright spot at Newsquest as well, up about 11% in local currency. Expenses excluding special items in the Publishing segment were down 3% year-over-year as we continue to extract cost efficiencies. Newsprint expense was down 8% in the quarter as an increase of almost 2% in Newsprint usage prices was more than offset by a consumption decline of approximately 10%. 
Focusing on newsprint prices for just a moment, North America newsprint prices were relatively unchanged throughout 2011. Market conditions supported a stable environment. Capacity rationalization is taking place in the market but offshore demand is softening. As a result, we anticipate that prices will remain stable and possibly decline if offshore trends continue to weaken. 
Operating income in the Publishing segment excluding special items was $176 million, while operating cash flow totaled $205 million, and those figures are found in Table 7 of our earnings results. 
Turning to Broadcasting segment. Excluding incremental political revenues generated last year, total television revenues were up 11% in the quarter, which was at the high end of the range we provided in December. We saw 9% growth in time sales excluding political, as spending in several of the most important TV ad categories was up solidly in the quarter. The auto category was particularly strong as both foreign and domestic manufacturers increased their spending in the quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year. 
Digital advertising solutions at our TV stations continue to draw customers, resulting in a 19% increase in digital revenues. Higher retransmission revenues, which grew 30% to $21 million, also contributed to the revenue results. Excluding special items, Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 6% this quarter. Operating income totaled approximately $90 million in the quarter, and operating cash flow was $97 million, just $27 million lower compared with the prior year despite the net decline of $47 million in political spending.  Now all these figures can be found on Table 7 of our earnings release. 
As detailed earlier, we had strong performance in our Digital segment revenues. Digital segment expenses were up 11%, reflecting significantly higher sales incentive and bonus costs associated with higher revenue levels at CareerBuilder and incremental investments in product development at PointRoll and ShopLocal. 
As Gracia noted, CareerBuilder had record level of invoicing in December and very good revenue growth. As a result, a significant number of sales representatives exceeded their sales quota very late in the quarter, and as a result, we recorded incremental commissions and bonuses in the quarter. In total, incremental costs at CareerBuilder, PointRoll and ShopLocal were roughly $9 million in the fourth quarter. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $203 million this quarter and $775 million for the full year. At the end of the year, we have approximately $1.76 billion of debt outstanding, a reduction of $158 million during the quarter and $592 million for the full year. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities, was slightly below 1.7x at the end of the quarter. 
Interest expense in the quarter was 12% lower than the fourth quarter last year, reflecting lower average debt balances, and at this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 7.25%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a cost of $25 million. And since we reactivated our share repurchase program, in late July through at year end, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at a cost of $53 million. Cash at quarter end was $167 million. And lastly, capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled about $26 million and were $72 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll open it up for questions."

I think the second part of your question related to the fact that we generate an enormous amount of free cash flow on a very consistent basis. And as we've talked about in the past, we obviously want to make sure that we have the flexibility to invest in those products and investments that make sense to the future growth of our company. As well, we have focused certainly in the past year on returning additional capital to shareholders. For those of you who don't follow us as closely as other folks, in July, we doubled our dividend and we reinstituted our share buyback program and said we'd buy back about $100 million of shares over the next 12 months. When we -- However, when we announced those actions, we did remind people that, that was just merely a first step and frankly a good first step, given the very difficult economic backdrop we saw during the course of the summer. We also reminded everyone that the board will continually reassess these actions depending on economic and market conditions.

We've also enjoyed some political spending from the primaries that have already taken place in South Carolina and that is going to take place in Florida, I guess tomorrow, and so we're nicely on track from that perspective. With regard to specifics on the quarter, I think as I mentioned, November was the best month of the quarter as we shared, and as we said at UBS, a month does not a trend make. We've seen some volatility in our -- as I addressed in my remarks. December, on a retail basis, was I think impacted by the fact that consumer spending around the holidays seemed to slow after the initial excitement around the Black Friday, Cyber Monday activities. We also, as I mentioned, were impacted by the fact that Christmas fell on that last Sunday, and that obviously had an impact on preprint. So I'd say that December was stronger than certainly third quarter and earlier in the fourth quarter but not quite as strong as the November comparisons."

So I think pacings are up very nicely, I think, double-digits in February and certainly stronger even in March so we're very pleased at the fall-through there. Auto has been a very strong category as it was in the fourth quarter, and it continues to have good traction in the first quarter as we go into the first quarter so we're very pleased with that. I think it would be tough for us to kind of break out all of those components on CareerBuilder, but what we can tell you is that in North America, I think revenues were up in the again the low teens, that 12%, 13% range. Internationally, I think we said revenues were up 40%-plus. I'd say that obviously, excluding acquisitions, we had the Singapore acquisition.

They have the benefit of very strong national revenues in the fourth quarter, in part as a result of some digital transition for TV, and so they were the beneficiary of that, as well as just a lot of initiatives that they have going on throughout the business there. So we were extremely pleased with their results in the quarter. And as always, they have a wonderful local franchise. We are very focused on local. They have a wonderful local footprint just as we do here in the States. So it's a terrific business.

Dave Lougee, who runs our broadcast stations, always does a terrific job, and there are just natural factors on the expense side. When you have $47 million of incremental political spending and you have a lot of coverage, you have sales commissions and other pieces associated with that. You also have additional coverage that you clearly are doing at times and additional expenses when you're covering political and you're covering Olympics, particularly when it's overseas and the like. And so in an even year, you expect to see expenses rise. I don't think we have any particular formula other than that we obviously look as we're budgeting for the next year at commissions and travel and those pieces that relate on a variable basis to those kinds of events. And then clearly in a year like 2011 when those events are missing and those special events are missing, then we would expect expenses to reflect that. I think we have a terrific opportunity vis-à-vis the Olympics. With USA TODAY, with our 13 NBC affiliates and the fact that our Newsquest properties are on the ground there in the U.K., sharing of content resources, sharing of video resources and a variety of those kinds of factors, we believe, are going to be very helpful to us as we provide some very, very strong coverage of what I think is going to be a very interesting Olympics in London."

On the political front, as I mentioned, we will get more than our fair share of the political dollars that are spent -- that were spent in South Carolina, as well as are being spent in Florida. We are right on track. But the first quarter, even in a strong political year like 2008 or even 2010, they tend to be in the single millions of dollars. And in fact, if you look at our political spending in 2008 and 2010, what you'd see is that in the second half of the year, that's primarily when we generate the vast majority of our spending, something like 80%-plus of all of the political we receive, we received in 2010 and 2008 is in the back half of the year. And September, October, November being the particularly large, large months. But during the course of the year, obviously, we'll benefit from whatever happens. We have a -- from a footprint perspective, we've got 13 U.S. senators and 3 governors races in our markets, which is about the same number as 2008 although we're going to have to see how competitive each one of those races ultimately is. In 2010, obviously not a presidential year but there were like, I think, 16 Senate and 18 governors races in our market.

Given our recent update at the UBS conference and as you may know with our Investor Day just 3 weeks away, we're going to keep our comments brief this morning as we will be providing a comprehensive look at our businesses, opportunities and related financial policies that day. 
This morning, I'm going to provide an update on a few of our strategic opportunities and review our results for the quarter. Our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Saleh, will then provide a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and some balance sheet items and then, of course, we'll open it for questions. 
Each of our business segments, as always, was solidly profitable in the quarter and for the full year during a period in which the economy showed modest but uneven growth. Our confidence in the ability of our businesses to continue to consistently deliver substantially free cash flow, several hundred million dollars this year despite the economic and secular headwinds, enables us to continue to fund a range of projects important to our future, return capital to shareholders and pay down debt. 
Now that we are finished with 2011 and are looking towards 2012, we are well on our way to becoming a leading global media and marketing solutions company. Our powerful 100-plus local markets, combined with our iconic national brands, puts us in a great position to provide the most engaging and high-quality content for our audiences and impactful solutions for advertisers and marketers. Our goal at Gannett is to position our company for future growth and continue to expand our revenue opportunities in the face of modest economic growth and secular change. 
We also are reshaping our local news organizations by enhancing our content to meet increasing and changing media consumption habits across all platforms: online, tablet, mobile, broadcast and print, and adapting our subscription model to the new media landscape. And we are building businesses that will maximize those strategies extending the reach and enhancing the strength of our rich and recognizable brands. In addition, we are making smart investments to the future as well as increasing the efficiency of our operations. 
Already underway are several key actions that will help us achieve our vision, which is to be the place consumers turn for trusted news and information, and the partner advertisers choose to reach and engage consumers, particularly in the local markets we serve. 
Let me start by telling you how we are reshaping local news. To achieve this, our content as always is key. We are focused on providing trusted, relevant, uniquely tailored content that is a high value in the communities we serve, and we are expanding and maximizing our ability to offer that content via our multi-platform distribution channels, meaning we are meeting our consumers wherever and whenever they want. 
To that end, we have relaunched 100 mobile websites across our local publishing and broadcasting markets that generate 40 million mobile page views per month. In the fourth quarter, we launched iPhone news apps in 15 TV markets that have been downloaded by 260,000 users and generate 1.5 million page views per month in those markets. 
Currently, we are piloting a new subscription model in 6 markets that builds on the tests we did in 3 markets we've previously mentioned and builds on a better understanding of consumer's needs and preferences. All subscriptions in these markets will include full Web, mobile, e-Editions and tablet access, as well as the reader's choice of frequency of print edition home delivery. Digital access for nonsubscribers will be limited to a small number of free articles per month. This new subscription model appropriately values the unique, local engaging content being produced by our journalists and noted experts in every community we serve. 
The ability to engage consumers across multiple platforms provides greater value to our business customers, enhancing the ways they reach and connect with local consumers and prospects. And we are also investing in the technology that will ensure an excellent user experience across each platform. This effort is not about the delivery of our content solely. It is about immediacy and a shift to digital first publishing and deeper coverage on the topics that matter most to our customers. We believe that investing in news gathering on the most important topics for our audiences in each market is critical. 
In addition to enhancing our content, we are also developing applications for the platforms that consumers are accessing in growing numbers. And because the potential growth on most devices is significant, we are aggressively developing the next generation of mobile, tablet, desktop and browser products at our local media properties and at USA TODAY. Our products will interface with all operating systems: Apple, Android, Kindle Fire and Windows 8. A great example is the level of downloads of the USA TODAY app we've experienced. At this point, there have been 11.4 million downloads across multiple devices and platforms. We are the #1 free news app on the Windows Phone and the Kindle Fire. 
And it is not just the user-facing applications. A huge challenge in the digital environment is designing content that works effectively for each platform and then monetizing those digital products. As part of that effort, we are integrating all the systems to complete the chain, which include editorial, publishing and ad platforms. We want to be able to manage, report, monitor and sell our digital media through as streamlined a process as possible. We have the expertise to get that done, and that will greatly enhance our ability to deliver digital content and solutions for advertisers. 
As I noted earlier, we are building businesses that extend our strong and recognizable brands. I think a great example of this is the USA TODAY Sports Media Group, which leverages the combined strength of our unparalleled local content with USA TODAY's powerful national reach. Building on a great sports portfolio, they are on the right trajectory to become a sports powerhouse. 
Through our local and national assets, the USA TODAY Sports Media Group currently has a total digital reach of nearly 16 million unique monthly viewers and is consistently a top 10 sports digital property according to comScore, which we expect to increase significantly with our just completed acquisition of Fantasy Sports Ventures' Big Lead Sports, the leading independent sports digital site. When all Fantasy Sports Ventures' assets are ultimately combined with the other properties within the USA TODAY sports group, we will be catapulted into 1 of the top 5 sports sites on the Web. With the added scale, we will greatly increase our ability to deliver our engaging content to a wider array of sports fans in a much more meaningful way, which is a huge draw for sports marketers and advertisers in some great scale for a very modest investment. 
One of the primary goals of the USA TODAY sports group is to take the traditional sports page experience and recreate it into a multidimensional experience for consumers through marketing partnerships with marquee sports organizations. In addition to our acquisitions of U.S. PRESSWIRE, mmajunkie.com and Fantasy Sports over the past few months, we have also entered into an important sports marketing agreement with the PGA Tour and have been designated as an official directed media partner of NASCAR. 
We will continue to build out our sports content across all platforms with a particularly strong focus on digital and mobile. This will be one of the most vital parts of our efforts to grow the sports groups business and brand going forward. 
Now let me tell you about our efforts to maximize efficiency. Leveraging our skills to seek new revenue streams was a critical factor in the consolidation of all of our domestic printing and productions operations into a single entity, Gannett Publishing Services. GPS, as we call it, is responsible for all facets of printing domestically and also our production operations: imaging, ad design, printing and packaging, distribution, customer acquisition, and retention and direct marketing. We now have the opportunity to even more effectively market our expertise and our scale to third parties. There are a number of revenue opportunities we are currently discussing with potential partners across both printing and distribution. We also expect to create efficiencies as we standardize business practices and eliminate redundancies. The impact of this to the bottom line is expected to be in the $40 million range in 2012 and growing thereafter. 
In fact, an important first step for GPS was the completion of the agreement to outsource the printing and packaging of the Cincinnati Enquirer and the Kentucky Enquirer to a Columbus, Ohio printing facility that we announced in December. Now as you saw this morning, we took some special charges associated with that move this quarter, which Paul will cover in more detail in a few moments. But most importantly, excluding the accrual for multi-employer pension liability, which we will have no matter whether we continue printing in Cincinnati or not, the expected payback is less than 2 years. 
Now let me quickly turn to a review of the quarter. Our results this quarter reflect the uneven and tepid economic recovery and consumer confidence, as well as particularly uneven consumer spending during the holiday season. The positive impact of our strategic effort, both on the digital front and our efficiency efforts, contributed to our results in the quarter. As expected, our success in achieving over $52 million in political advertising in the fourth quarter of 2010 made comparisons extremely difficult this quarter. 
But even with those headwinds, earnings per share in the quarter, when adjusted for special items, totaled $0.72. Total revenue across the company was approximately 5% lower and total expenses, excluding special items, were down roughly 2%, resulting in operating income of $291 million and operating cash flow of $339 million. 
Digital segment revenue growth of over 9% was driven primarily by strong revenue results at CareerBuilder. Total revenue at CareerBuilder was up about 15% in the quarter as they continue to increase their market leadership position in North America and their international expansion overseas. And the prospects for continued market share gains in 2012 at CareerBuilder look very promising. In fact, CareerBuilder's December global invoicing was its highest December ever, up a double-digit percentage from December of last year. 
As noted, our digital and cross-platform sales efforts drove increases in digital revenue at our publishing and television operations. As well, overall digital revenues, company-wide, were up almost 7% and totaled over $290 million for the fourth quarter and $1.1 billion for the year, approximately 21% of our revenue. 
Now to give you a little more detail on our total digital revenues, of that $290 million company-wide in the quarter, about $181 million, as you saw this morning, comes from the digital businesses in our Digital segment, with CareerBuilder accounting for about 82% of the Digital segment revenues. 
Our domestic publishing operations, and here, I'm going to exclude operations like Clipper Magazine and Gannett Healthcare and Gannett military, which are primarily print-centric operations and more specifically, our U.S. Community Publishing sites plus USA TODAY and its digital brands, those operations accounted for approximately 26% or $74 million of total digital advertising revenues in the quarter. 
In our U.S. Community Publishing operations, digital revenues were about 15% or so of their ad revenues; and at USA TODAY, about a quarter of their ad revenues across their brands were digital. 
Turning to broadcasting. As expected in an odd year, revenues were down about 14% due primarily to the challenge of overcoming last year's successful effort in political advertising. Although we had almost $5 million of political spending in the fourth quarter, and as I just said, we achieved $52 million in political spending in the same quarter last year, so television revenues, net of that incremental impact of political spending, were up about 11% as ad sales, retransmission revenue and online revenue were all up solidly in the quarter. 
Based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total television revenues in the first quarter this year to be up in the high single-digits compared to the first quarter last year. 
Turning to publishing, revenues there were approximately 5% lower while digital revenues in the segment were up almost 7%. Advertising comparisons quarter-to-quarter improved relative to the third quarter as national and classified advertising comparisons were better and retail was in line. The monthly retail advertising trends in the quarter in some ways mirrored retailer performance and holiday season spending. We saw some apprehension among retailers regarding the 2011 holiday season, and that resulted in a significant increase in discounting. This caused a surge in buying around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, making those some of the best in recent history. However, December spending softened, and retailers reported the largest post-Thanksgiving, pre-Christmas decrease in spending in some time. The soft close in retailing to December was exacerbated by Christmas Day falling on Sunday, which was also the last day of our fiscal year, and we believe that negatively impacted advertising sale across some retail categories, particularly preprint revenue  
Driven by the retail and national categories, November was the best month in the quarter in terms of total advertising in the Publishing segment, followed by December. Although Newsquest results continued to be impacted by the soft U.S. -- U.K. economy, comparisons in the quarter were the best of the year due in large part to classified advertising. 
So again in summary, each of our business segments remained very profitable for the quarter, and as a result, we continue to consistently generate substantial free cash flow. In 2012, we'll continue to leverage our strong local media franchises and iconic national brands and deliver our valued content to customers across multiple platforms while providing innovative solutions for our advertisers. 
Through new subscription models being introduced this year and a comprehensive suite of delivery platforms, investment in adjacent businesses and a continued focus on our operational efficiencies, we are positioning Gannett for continued success as the media landscape evolves. 
As I mentioned, we intend to discuss key initiatives as well as our capital allocation plans at Gannett's Investor Day on Wednesday, February 22 at our offices in New York. Invitations will be sent out in a few days, and Jeff Heinz has reminded me to tell you to please RSVP as seating will be limited. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul."

I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments and then I'll comment on some balance sheet items. As Gracia noted, we generated approximately $1.4 billion in revenues in the quarter.",1330,"Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments and then I'll comment on some balance sheet items. 
As Gracia noted, we generated approximately $1.4 billion in revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding special items, were $1.1 billion, a decline of 2% year-over-year. Operating cash flow totaled $339 million, as shown on Table 7 of our earnings release. As importantly, we generated free cash flow of $203 million, and that's shown on Table 10.  
For the full year, total revenues were $5.2 billion and operating cash flow, excluding special items, totaled $1.1 billion in line with the guidance we provided to you in December. We again generated substantial free cash flow of $775 million in 2011 despite the soft economic environment in the U.S. and the U.K. and the relative absence of incremental even-year political and Olympic advertising that benefited our results in 2010. 
Turning back to the quarter. Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.49. Earnings per share -- per diluted share, excluding special items, were $0.72. In the fourth quarter, we recorded several special items that totaled about $107 million pretax or $0.23 per share, and those are detailed on Table 5 of our earnings release. 
Let me review these items in more detail. First, we had a pretax charge of approximately $64 million for workforce restructuring and facility consolidations. This includes a charge associated with the transfer of production activities for the Cincinnati Enquirer to a third-party printer in Columbus, Ohio, as previously disclosed. The majority of the charge from the move to Columbus relates to the recognition of withdrawal liabilities for multi-employer union pension plans and the balance relates to severance and benefit costs. Second, during the quarter, we reported special charges of $14.7 million for the disability related retirement of our former Chairman and CEO.  Third, we recognized special noncash charges affecting nonoperating income which totaled $28 million pretax or $0.07 per share related to minority investments. And finally, our results included a special tax benefit of $11 million or $0.04 per share relating to an impairment that was taken previously but not recognized until now for tax purposes. 
Turning to our segment results. Total Publishing segment's revenues were 5% lower in the quarter. Advertising revenue was 7% lower. However, year-over-year advertising revenue comparisons improved sequentially. Gracia has already discussed retail trends in the quarter, so I'll comment on the other advertising categories. 
National advertising was down approximately 9% in the quarter, but up more than 6 percentage points from third quarter comparisons. At USA TODAY, we experienced strength in several categories, particularly telecommunications, credit cards and automotive, which helped to partially offset declines in travel, entertainment and technology categories. 
At Newsquest, national advertising was up 7% in local currency, consistent with the trend we saw in the third quarter. Classified advertising for the Publishing segment was down 8.4% but up slightly sequentially. In the U.S., classified advertising was down, but we saw sequential improvement in all categories excluding employment which was relatively flat. But in December, employment advertising was up year-over-year. 
Real estate classified advertising declined in the quarter, reflecting continued weakness in the housing market. However, year-over-year comparisons improved about 5 percentage points relative to third quarter. And the trends in the real estate category improved over the course of the fourth quarter. 
In California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada, which were the states most impacted by the real estate crisis, real estate advertising trends were in line with other regions of the country. On the other hand, employment advertising and auto advertising trends were still better at our properties outside of these states. 
Classified category comparisons at Newsquest in pounds were better this quarter relative to the third quarter as all category comparison improved excluding auto. Employment advertising comparison improved 7 percentage points from third quarter comparisons. 
Gracia gave you the major components of digital advertising for the Publishing segment. Successful cross-platform and marketing solution efforts contributed to a 7% increase in digital publishing revenue for the quarter. The increase was due to a 6% gain in digital revenue in U.S. Community Publishing, auto, employment and local digital revenue, the largest categories, all contributed to the gain. 
Digital revenue was a bright spot at Newsquest as well, up about 11% in local currency. Expenses, excluding special items in the Publishing segment, were down 3% year-over-year as we continue to extract cost efficiencies. Newsprint expense was down 8% in the quarter as an increase of almost 2% in newsprint usage prices was more than offset by a consumption decline of approximately 10%. 
Focusing on newsprint prices for just a moment. North America newsprint prices were relatively unchanged throughout 2011. Market conditions supported a stable environment. Capacity rationalization is taking place in the market but offshore demand is softening. As a result, we anticipate that prices will remain stable and possibly decline if offshore trends continue to weaken. 
Operating income in the Publishing segment, excluding special items, was $176 million while operating cash flow totaled $205 million, and those figures are found in Table 7 of our earnings results. 
Turning to Broadcasting segment. Excluding incremental political revenues generated last year, total television revenues were up 11% in the quarter, which was at the high end of the range we provided in December. We saw 9% growth in time sales excluding political, as spending in several of the most important TV ad categories was up solidly in the quarter. The auto category was particularly strong as both foreign and domestic manufacturers increased their spending in the quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year. 
Digital advertising solutions at our TV stations continue to draw customers, resulting in a 19% increase in digital revenues. Higher retransmission revenues, which grew 30% to $21 million, also contributed to the revenue results. Excluding special items, Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 6% this quarter. Operating income totaled approximately $90 million in the quarter and operating cash flow was $97 million, just $27 million lower compared with the prior year despite the net decline of $47 million in political spending.  Now all these figures can be found on Table 7 of our earnings release. 
As detailed earlier, we had strong performance in our Digital segment revenues. Digital segment expenses were up 11%, reflecting significantly higher sales incentive and bonus costs associated with higher revenue levels at CareerBuilder and incremental investments in product development at PointRoll and ShopLocal. 
As Gracia noted, CareerBuilder had record level of invoicing in December and very good revenue growth. As a result, a significant number of sales representatives exceeded their sales quota very late in the quarter, and as a result, we recorded incremental commissions and bonuses in the quarter. In total, incremental costs at CareerBuilder, PointRoll and ShopLocal were roughly $9 million in the fourth quarter. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $203 million this quarter and $775 million for the full year. At the end of the year, we had approximately $1.76 billion of debt outstanding, a reduction of $158 million during the quarter and $592 million for the full year. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities, was slightly below 1.7x at the end of the quarter. 
Interest expense in the quarter was 12% lower than the fourth quarter last year, reflecting lower average debt balances. And at this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 7.25%. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a cost of $25 million. And since we reactivated our share repurchase program in late July through at year end, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at a cost of $53 million. Cash at quarter end was $167 million. And lastly, capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled about $26 million and were $72 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll open it up for questions."

As I said, we are getting off to a very solid start in the first quarter. We are anticipating some good feedback in the broadcast side of the business where we obviously have the Super Bowl on our NBC affiliates. We've also enjoyed some political spending from the primaries that have already taken place in South Carolina, and that is going to take place in Florida, I guess, tomorrow. And so we're nicely on track from that perspective. With regard to specifics on the quarter, I think as I mentioned, November was the best month of the quarter as we shared, and as we said at UBS, a month does not a trend make. We've seen some volatility in our -- as I addressed in my remarks. December, on a retail basis, was I think impacted by the fact that consumer spending around the holidays seemed to slow after the initial excitement around the Black Friday, Cyber Monday activities. We also, as I mentioned, were impacted by the fact that Christmas fell on that last Sunday, and that obviously had an impact on preprint. So I'd say that December was stronger than certainly third quarter and earlier in the fourth quarter, but not quite as strong as the November comparisons."

We think the pie is going to continue to grow, and we're going to be the beneficiary of that in a meaningful way. As to Captivate, I think you're right on track. Captivate did not have the kind of quarter in the fourth quarter that we had hoped they would. They had some personnel changes.

Dave Lougee, who runs our broadcast stations, always does a terrific job, and there are just natural factors on the expense side. When you have $47 million of incremental political spending and you have a lot of coverage, you have sales commissions and other pieces associated with that. You also have additional coverage that you clearly are doing at times and additional expenses when you're covering political and you're covering Olympics, particularly when it's overseas and the like. And so in an even year, you expect to see expenses rise. I don't think we have any particular formula other than that we obviously look as we're budgeting for the next year at commissions and travel and those pieces that relate on a variable basis to those kinds of events. And then clearly in a year like 2011 when those events are missing and -- those special events are missing, then we would expect expenses to reflect that. I think we have a terrific opportunity vis-à-vis the Olympics. With USA TODAY, with our 13 NBC affiliates and the fact that our Newsquest properties are on the ground there in the U.K., sharing of content resources, sharing of video resources and a variety of those kinds of factors, we believe, are going to be very helpful to us as we provide some very, very strong coverage of what we think is going to be a very interesting Olympics in London."

We are right on track. But the first quarter, even in a strong political year like 2008 or even 2010, they tend to be in the single millions of dollars. And in fact, if you look at our political spending in 2008 and 2010, what you'd see is that in the second half of the year, that's primarily when we generate the vast majority of our spending, something like 80%-plus of all of the political we received, we received in 2010 and 2008 is in the back half of the year. And September, October, November being the particularly large, large months. But during the course of the year, obviously, we'll benefit from whatever happens. We have a -- from a footprint perspective, we've got 13 U.S Senate and 3 governors races in our markets, which is about the same number as 2008, although we're going to have to see how competitive each 1 of those races ultimately is. In 2010, obviously not a presidential year but there were like, I think, 16 Senate and 18 governors races in our market.

So far, and literally I'm talking about in the last few days, literally, we've had some very encouraging feedback so far. But I think that's a place where we're going to have to give you additional insights in late February and then report to you each quarter on how we are progressing as we roll the markets out. But we are in agreement with Warren Buffett's comments that our content, which is, we believe, engaging and relevant and differentiated in those local communities has value and shouldn't be given away free.

Given our recent update at the UBS conference and as you may know with our Investor Day just 3 weeks away, we're going to keep our comments brief this morning as we will be providing a comprehensive look at our businesses, opportunities and related financial policies that day. This morning, I'm going to provide an update on a few of our strategic opportunities and review our results for the quarter. Our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Saleh, will then provide a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and some balance sheet items and then, of course, we'll open it for questions. Each of our business segments, as always, was solidly profitable in the quarter and for the full year during a period in which the economy showed modest but uneven growth. Our confidence in the ability of our businesses to continue to consistently deliver substantially free cash flow, several hundred million dollars this year despite the economic and secular headwinds, enables us to continue to fund a range of projects important to our future, return capital to shareholders and pay down debt. 
Now that we are finished with 2011 and are looking towards 2012, we are well on our way to becoming a leading global media and marketing solutions company. Our powerful 100-plus local markets, combined with our iconic national brands, puts us in a great position to provide the most engaging and high-quality content for our audiences and impactful solutions for advertisers and marketers. Our goal at Gannett is to position our company for future growth and continue to expand our revenue opportunities in the face of modest economic growth and secular change. We also are reshaping our local news organizations by enhancing our content to meet increasing and changing media consumption habits across all platforms: online, tablet, mobile, broadcast and print, and adapting our subscription model to the new media landscape. And we are building businesses that will maximize those strategies extending the reach and enhancing the strength of our rich and recognizable brands. In addition, we are making smart investments for the future as well as increasing the efficiency of our operations. Already underway are several key actions that will help us achieve our vision, which is to be the place consumers turn for trusted news and information, and the partner advertisers choose to reach and engage consumers, particularly in the local markets we serve. 
Let me start by telling you how we are reshaping local news. To achieve this, our content as always is key. We are focused on providing trusted, relevant, uniquely tailored content that is a high value in the communities we serve, and we are expanding and maximizing our ability to offer that content via multi-platform distribution channels, meaning we are meeting our consumers wherever and whenever they want. To that end, we have relaunched 100 mobile websites across our local publishing and broadcasting markets that generate 40 million mobile page views per month. In the fourth quarter, we launched iPhone news apps in 15 TV markets that have been downloaded by 260,000 users and generate 1.5 million page views per month in those markets. Currently, we are piloting a new subscription model in 6 markets that builds on the tests we did in 3 markets we've previously mentioned and builds on a better understanding of consumers' needs and preferences. All subscriptions in these markets will include full Web, mobile, e-Editions and tablet access, as well as the reader's choice of frequency of print edition home delivery. Digital access for nonsubscribers will be limited to a small number of free articles per month. This new subscription model appropriately values the unique, local engaging content being produced by our journalists and noted experts in every community we serve. The ability to engage consumers across multiple platforms provides greater value to our business customers, enhancing the ways they reach and connect with local consumers and prospects. 
And we are also investing in the technology that will ensure an excellent user experience across each platform. This effort is not about the delivery of our content solely. It is about immediacy and a shift to digital first publishing and deeper coverage on the topics that matter most to our customers. We believe that investing in news gathering on the most important topics for our audiences in each market is critical. 
In addition to enhancing our content, we are also developing applications for the platforms that consumers are accessing in growing numbers. And because the potential growth on those devices is significant, we are aggressively developing the next generation of mobile, tablet, desktop and browser products at our local media properties and at USA TODAY. Our products will interface with all operating systems: Apple, Android, Kindle Fire and Windows 8. A great example is the level of downloads of the USA TODAY app we've experienced. At this point, there have been 11.4 million downloads across multiple devices and platforms. We are the #1 free news app on the Windows Phone and the Kindle Fire. 
And it is not just the user-facing applications. A huge challenge in the digital environment is designing content that works effectively for each platform and then monetizing those digital products. As part of that effort, we are integrating all the systems that complete the chain, which include editorial, publishing and ad platforms. We want to be able to manage, report, monitor and sell our digital media through as streamlined a process as possible. We have the expertise to get that done, and that will greatly enhance our ability to deliver digital content and solutions for advertisers. 
As I noted earlier, we are building businesses that extend our strong and recognizable brands. I think a great example of this is the USA TODAY Sports Media Group, which leverages the combined strength of our unparalleled local content with USA TODAY's powerful national reach. Building on a great sports portfolio, they are on the right trajectory to become a sports powerhouse. Through our local and national assets, the USA TODAY Sports Media Group currently has a total digital reach of nearly 16 million unique monthly viewers and is consistently a top 10 sports digital property according to comScore, which we expect to increase significantly with our just completed acquisition of Fantasy Sports Ventures' Big Lead Sports, the leading independent sports digital site. When all Fantasy Sports Ventures' assets are ultimately combined with the other properties within the USA TODAY sports group, we will be catapulted into 1 of the top 5 sports sites on the Web. With the added scale, we will greatly increase our ability to deliver our engaging content to a wider array of sports fans in a much more meaningful way, which is a huge draw for sports marketers and advertisers. In sum, great scale for a very modest investment. 
One of the primary goals of the USA TODAY sports group is to take the traditional sports page experience and recreate it into a multidimensional experience for consumers through marketing partnerships with marquee sports organizations. In addition to our acquisitions of U.S. PRESSWIRE, mmajunkie.com and Fantasy Sports over the past few months, we have also entered into an important sports marketing agreement with the PGA Tour and have been designated as an official directed media partner of NASCAR. We will continue to build out our sports content across all platforms with a particularly strong focus on digital and mobile. This will be one of the most vital parts of our efforts to grow the sports groups business and brand going forward. 
Now let me tell you about our efforts to maximize efficiency. Leveraging our skills to seek new revenue streams was a critical factor in the consolidation of all of our domestic printing and productions operations into a single entity, Gannett Publishing Services. GPS, as we call it, is responsible for all facets of printing domestically and also our production operations: imaging, ad design, printing and packaging, distribution, customer acquisition and retention and direct marketing. We now have the opportunity to even more effectively market our expertise and our scale to third parties. There are a number of revenue opportunities we are currently discussing with potential partners across both printing and distribution. We also expect to create efficiencies as we standardize business practices and eliminate redundancies. The impact of this to the bottom line is expected to be in the $40 million range in 2012 and growing thereafter. 
In fact, an important first step for GPS was the completion of the agreement to outsource the printing and packaging of the Cincinnati Enquirer and the Kentucky Enquirer to a Columbus, Ohio printing facility that we announced in December. Now as you saw this morning, we took some special charges associated with that move this quarter, which Paul will cover in more detail in a few moments. But most importantly, excluding the accrual for multi-employer pension liability, which we will have no matter whether we continue printing in Cincinnati or not, the expected payback is less than 2 years. 
Now let me quickly turn to a review of the quarter. Our results this quarter reflect the uneven and tepid economic recovery and consumer confidence, as well as particularly uneven consumer spending during the holiday season. The positive impact of our strategic effort, both on the digital front and our efficiency efforts, contributed to our results in the quarter. As expected, our success in achieving over $52 million in political advertising in the fourth quarter of 2010 made comparisons extremely difficult this quarter. But even with those headwinds, earnings per share in the quarter, when adjusted for special items, totaled $0.72. Total revenue across the company was approximately 5% lower and total expenses, excluding special items, were down roughly 2%, resulting in operating income of $291 million and operating cash flow of $339 million. 
Digital segment revenue growth of over 9% was driven primarily by strong revenue results at CareerBuilder. Total revenue at CareerBuilder was up about 15% in the quarter as they continue to increase their market leadership position in North America and their international expansion overseas. And the prospects for continued market share gains in 2012 at CareerBuilder look very promising. In fact, CareerBuilder's December global invoicing was its highest December ever, up a double-digit percentage from December of last year. 
As noted, our digital and cross-platform sales efforts drove increases in digital revenue at our publishing and television operations. As well, overall digital revenues, company-wide, were up almost 7% and totaled over $290 million for the fourth quarter and $1.1 billion for the year, approximately 21% of our revenue. 
Now to give you a little more detail on our total digital revenues, of that $290 million company-wide in the quarter, about $181 million, as you saw this morning, comes from the digital businesses in our Digital segment, with CareerBuilder accounting for about 82% of the Digital segment revenues. Our domestic publishing operations, and here I'm going to exclude operations like Clipper Magazine and Gannett Healthcare and Gannett Military, which are primarily print-centric operations and more specifically, our U.S. Community Publishing sites plus USA TODAY and its digital brands, those operations accounted for approximately 26% or $74 million of total digital advertising revenues in the quarter. In our U.S. Community Publishing operations, digital revenues were about 15% or so of their ad revenues; and at USA TODAY, about a quarter of their ad revenues across their brands were digital. 
Turning to broadcasting. As expected in an odd year, revenues were down about 14% due primarily to the challenge of overcoming last year's successful effort in political advertising. Although we had almost $5 million of political spending in the fourth quarter, and as I just said, we achieved $52 million in political spending in the same quarter last year, so television revenues, net of that incremental impact of political spending, were up about 11% as ad sales, retransmission revenue and online revenue were all up solidly in the quarter. Based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total television revenues in the first quarter this year to be up in the high-single digits compared to the first quarter last year. 
Turning to publishing, revenues there were approximately 5% lower while digital revenues in the segment were up almost 7%. Advertising comparisons quarter-to-quarter improved relative to the third quarter as national and classified advertising comparisons were better and retail was in line. The monthly retail advertising trends in the quarter in some ways mirrored retailer performance and holiday season spending. We saw some apprehension among retailers regarding the 2011 holiday season, and that resulted in a significant increase in discounting. This caused a surge in buying around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, making those some of the best in recent history. However, December spending softened, and retailers reported the largest post-Thanksgiving, pre-Christmas decrease in spending in some time. The soft close in retailing to December was exacerbated by Christmas Day falling on Sunday, which was also the last day of our fiscal year, and we believe that negatively impacted advertising sale across some retail categories, particularly preprint revenue. 
Driven by the retail and national categories, November was the best month in the quarter in terms of total advertising in the Publishing segment, followed by December. Although Newsquest results continued to be impacted by the soft U.S. -- U.K. economy, comparisons in the quarter were the best of the year due in large part to classified advertising. So again in summary, each of our business segments remained very profitable for the quarter, and as a result, we continue to consistently generate substantial free cash flow. 
In 2012, we'll continue to leverage our strong local media franchises and iconic national brands and deliver our valued content to customers across multiple platforms while providing innovative solutions for our advertisers. Through new subscription models being introduced this year and a comprehensive suite of delivery platforms, investment in adjacent businesses and a continued focus on our operational efficiencies, we are positioning Gannett for continued success as the media landscape evolves. 
As I mentioned, we intend to discuss key initiatives as well as our capital allocation plans at Gannett's Investor Day on Wednesday, February 22 at our offices in New York. Invitations will be sent out in a few days, and Jeff Heinz has reminded me to tell you to please RSVP as seating will be limited. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul."

I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and then I'll comment on some balance sheet items. As Gracia noted, we generated approximately $1.4 billion in revenues in the quarter.",1330,"Well, thank you, Gracia. I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and then I'll comment on some balance sheet items. 
As Gracia noted, we generated approximately $1.4 billion in revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding special items, were $1.1 billion, a decline of 2% year-over-year. Operating cash flow totaled $339 million, as shown on Table 7 of our earnings release. As importantly, we generated free cash flow of $203 million, and that's shown on Table 10. For the full year, total revenues were $5.2 billion and operating cash flow, excluding special items, totaled $1.1 billion in line with the guidance we provided to you in December. We again generated substantial free cash flow of $775 million in 2011 despite the soft economic environment in the U.S. and the U.K. and the relative absence of incremental even-year political and Olympic advertising that benefited our results in 2010. 
Turning back to the quarter. Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.49. Earnings per share -- per diluted share, excluding special items, were $0.72. In the fourth quarter, we recorded several special items that totaled about $107 million pretax or $0.23 per share, and those are detailed on Table 5 of our earnings release. Let me review these items in more detail. 
First, we had a pretax charge of approximately $64 million for workforce restructuring and facility consolidations. This includes a charge associated with the transfer of production activities for the Cincinnati Enquirer to a third-party printer in Columbus, Ohio, as previously disclosed. The majority of the charge from the move to Columbus relates to the recognition of withdrawal liabilities for multi-employer union pension plans and the balance relates to severance and benefit costs. Second, during the quarter, we reported special charges of $14.7 million for the disability-related retirement of our former Chairman and CEO. Third, we recognized special noncash charges affecting nonoperating income which totaled $28 million pretax or $0.07 per share related to minority investments. And finally, our results included a special tax benefit of $11 million or $0.04 per share relating to an impairment that was taken previously but not recognized until now for tax purposes. 
Turning to our segment results. Total Publishing segment's revenues were 5% lower in the quarter. Advertising revenue was 7% lower. However, year-over-year advertising revenue comparisons improved sequentially. Gracia has already discussed retail trends in the quarter, so I'll comment on the other advertising categories. National advertising was down approximately 9% in the quarter, but up more than 6 percentage points from third quarter comparisons. At USA TODAY, we experienced strength in several categories, particularly telecommunications, credit cards and automotive, which helped to partially offset declines in travel, entertainment and technology categories. At Newsquest, national advertising was up 7% in local currency, consistent with the trend we saw in the third quarter. Classified advertising for the Publishing segment was down 8.4% but up slightly sequentially. In the U.S., classified advertising was down, but we saw sequential improvement in all categories excluding employment which was relatively flat. But in December, employment advertising was up year-over-year. Real estate classified advertising declined in the quarter, reflecting continued weakness in the housing market. However, year-over-year comparisons improved about 5 percentage points relative to third quarter. And the trends in the real estate category improved over the course of the fourth quarter. In California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada, which were the states most impacted by the real estate crisis, real estate advertising trends were in line with other regions of the country. On the other hand, employment advertising and auto advertising trends were still better at our properties outside of these states. 
Classified category comparisons at Newsquest in pounds were better this quarter relative to the third quarter as all category comparison improved excluding auto. Employment advertising comparison improved 7 percentage points from third quarter comparisons. Gracia gave you the major components of digital advertising for the Publishing segment. Successful cross-platform and marketing solution efforts contributed to a 7% increase in digital publishing revenue for the quarter. The increase was due to a 6% gain in digital revenue in U.S. Community Publishing, auto, employment and local digital revenue, the largest categories, all contributed to the gain. Digital revenue was a bright spot at Newsquest as well, up about 11% in local currency. 
Expenses, excluding special items in the Publishing segment, were down 3% year-over-year as we continue to extract cost efficiencies. Newsprint expense was down 8% in the quarter as an increase of almost 2% in newsprint usage prices was more than offset by a consumption decline of approximately 10%. Focusing on newsprint prices for just a moment. North America newsprint prices were relatively unchanged throughout 2011. Market conditions supported a stable environment. Capacity rationalization is taking place in the market but offshore demand is softening. As a result, we anticipate that prices will remain stable and possibly decline if offshore trends continue to weaken. 
Operating income in the Publishing segment, excluding special items, was $176 million while operating cash flow totaled $205 million, and those figures are found in Table 7 of our earnings results. 
Turning to Broadcasting segment. Excluding incremental political revenues generated last year, total television revenues were up 11% in the quarter, which was at the high end of the range we provided in December. We saw 9% growth in time sales excluding political, as spending in several of the most important TV ad categories was up solidly in the quarter. The auto category was particularly strong as both foreign and domestic manufacturers increased their spending in the quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Digital advertising solutions at our TV stations continue to draw customers, resulting in a 19% increase in digital revenues. Higher retransmission revenues, which grew 30% to $21 million, also contributed to the revenue results. Excluding special items, Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 6% this quarter. 
Operating income totaled approximately $90 million in the quarter and operating cash flow was $97 million, just $27 million lower compared with the prior year despite the net decline of $47 million in political spending. Now all these figures can be found on Table 7 of our earnings release. 
As detailed earlier, we had strong performance in our Digital segment revenues. Digital segment expenses were up 11%, reflecting significantly higher sales incentive and bonus costs associated with higher revenue levels at CareerBuilder and incremental investments in product development at PointRoll and ShopLocal. 
As Gracia noted, CareerBuilder had record level of invoicing in December and very good revenue growth. As a result, a significant number of sales representatives exceeded their sales quota very late in the quarter, and as a result, we recorded incremental commissions and bonuses in the quarter. In total, the incremental costs at CareerBuilder, PointRoll and ShopLocal were roughly $9 million in the fourth quarter. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $203 million this quarter and $775 million for the full year. At the end of the year, we had approximately $1.76 billion of debt outstanding, a reduction of $158 million during the quarter and $592 million for the full year. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities, was slightly below 1.7x at the end of the quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was 12% lower than the fourth quarter last year, reflecting lower average debt balances. And at this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 7.25%. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a cost of $25 million. And since we reactivated our share repurchase program in late July through at year end, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at a cost of $53 million. Cash at quarter end was $167 million. And lastly, capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled about $26 million and were $72 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll open it up for questions."

We'll provide some additional color since we'll be a little further along in the quarter at our Investor Day on February 22. I think the second part of your question related to the fact that we generate an enormous amount of free cash flow on a very consistent basis. And as we've talked about in the past, we obviously want to make sure that we have the flexibility to invest in those products and investments that make sense to the future growth of our company. As well, we have focused certainly in the past year on returning additional capital to shareholders. For those of you who don't follow us as closely as other folks, in July we doubled our dividend and we reinstituted our share buyback program and said we'd buy back about $100 million of shares over the next 12 months. However, when we announced those actions, we did remind people that, that was just merely a first step and frankly, a good first step, given the very difficult economic backdrop we saw during the course of the summer. We also reminded everyone that the board will continually reassess these actions depending on economic and market conditions. So we're going to evaluate -- we're going to continue to evaluate our capital allocation in that context of delivering increasing value to shareholders while preserving our financial flexibility, and we'll look forward to providing greater detail on our capital allocation plans on the 22nd."

We've also enjoyed some political spending from the primaries that have already taken place in South Carolina, and that is going to take place in Florida, I guess, tomorrow. And so we're nicely on track from that perspective. With regard to specifics on the quarter, I think as I mentioned, November was the best month of the quarter as we shared, and as we said at UBS, a month does not a trend make. We've seen some volatility in our -- as I addressed in my remarks. December, on a retail basis, was I think impacted by the fact that consumer spending around the holidays seemed to slow after the initial excitement around the Black Friday, Cyber Monday activities. We also, as I mentioned, were impacted by the fact that Christmas fell on that last Sunday, and that obviously had an impact on preprint. So I'd say that December was stronger than certainly third quarter and earlier in the fourth quarter, but not quite as strong as the November comparisons."

We think the pie is going to continue to grow, and we're going to be the beneficiary of that in a meaningful way. As to Captivate, I think you're right on track. Captivate did not have the kind of quarter in the fourth quarter that we had hoped they would. They had some personnel changes.

Dave Lougee, who runs our broadcast stations, always does a terrific job, and there are just natural factors on the expense side. When you have $47 million of incremental political spending and you have a lot of coverage, you have sales commissions and other pieces associated with that. You also have additional coverage that you clearly are doing at times and additional expenses when you're covering political and you're covering Olympics, particularly when it's overseas and the like. And so in an even year, you expect to see expenses rise. I don't think we have any particular formula other than that we obviously look, as we're budgeting for the next year, at commissions and travel and those pieces that relate on a variable basis to those kinds of events. And then clearly in a year like 2011 when those events are missing and -- those special events are missing, then we would expect expenses to reflect that. I think we have a terrific opportunity vis-à-vis the Olympics. With USA TODAY, with our 13 NBC affiliates and the fact that our Newsquest properties are on the ground there in the U.K., sharing of content resources, sharing of video resources and a variety of those kinds of factors, we believe, are going to be very helpful to us as we provide some very, very strong coverage of what we think is going to be a very interesting Olympics in London."

And in fact, if you look at our political spending in 2008 and 2010, what you'd see is that in the second half of the year, that's primarily when we generate the vast majority of our spending, something like 80%-plus of all of the political we receive, we received in 2010 and 2008 is in the back half of the year. And September, October, November being the particularly large, large months. But during the course of the year, obviously, we'll benefit from whatever happens. We have a -- from a footprint perspective, we've got 13 U.S Senate and 3 governors races in our markets, which is about the same number as 2008, although we're going to have to see how competitive each one of those races ultimately is.

Last week, we announced the acquisition as I mentioned of Fantasy Sports, and Big Lead Sports paid a small price to provide us with a substantial increase in our footprint. So always looking at opportunities, but we'll continue to be quite financially disciplined. Paul, do you want to talk a little bit about newsprint and the 3-around?"

Given our recent update at the UBS conference and as you may know with our Investor Day just 3 weeks away, we're going to keep our comments brief this morning as we will be providing a comprehensive look at our businesses, opportunities and related financial policies that day. This morning, I'm going to provide an update on a few of our strategic opportunities and review our results for the quarter. Our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Saleh, will then provide a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and some balance sheet items and then, of course, we'll open it for questions. Each of our business segments, as always, was solidly profitable in the quarter and for the full year during a period in which the economy showed modest but uneven growth. Our confidence in the ability of our businesses to continue to consistently deliver substantially free cash flow, several hundred million dollars this year despite the economic and secular headwinds, enables us to continue to fund a range of projects important to our future, return capital to shareholders and pay down debt. 
Now that we are finished with 2011 and are looking towards 2012, we are well on our way to becoming a leading global media and marketing solutions company. Our powerful 100-plus local markets, combined with our iconic national brands, puts us in a great position to provide the most engaging and high-quality content for our audiences and impactful solutions for advertisers and marketers. Our goal at Gannett is to position our company for future growth and continue to expand our revenue opportunities in the face of modest economic growth and secular change. We also are reshaping our local news organizations by enhancing our content to meet increasing and changing media consumption habits across all platforms: online, tablet, mobile, broadcast and print, and adapting our subscription model to the new media landscape. And we are building businesses that will maximize those strategies extending the reach and enhancing the strength of our rich and recognizable brands. In addition, we are making smart investments for the future as well as increasing the efficiency of our operations. Already underway are several key actions that will help us achieve our vision, which is to be the place consumers turn for trusted news and information, and the partner advertisers choose to reach and engage consumers, particularly in the local markets we serve. 
Let me start by telling you how we are reshaping local news. To achieve this, our content as always is key. We are focused on providing trusted, relevant, uniquely tailored content that is a high value in the communities we serve, and we are expanding and maximizing our ability to offer that content via multi-platform distribution channels, meaning we are meeting our consumers wherever and whenever they want. To that end, we have relaunched 100 mobile websites across our local publishing and broadcasting markets that generate 40 million mobile page views per month. In the fourth quarter, we launched iPhone news apps in 15 TV markets that have been downloaded by 260,000 users and generate 1.5 million page views per month in those markets. Currently, we are piloting a new subscription model in 6 markets that builds on the tests we did in 3 markets we've previously mentioned and builds on a better understanding of consumers' needs and preferences. All subscriptions in these markets will include full Web, mobile, e-Editions and tablet access, as well as the reader's choice of frequency of print edition home delivery. Digital access for nonsubscribers will be limited to a small number of free articles per month. This new subscription model appropriately values the unique, local engaging content being produced by our journalists and noted experts in every community we serve. The ability to engage consumers across multiple platforms provides greater value to our business customers, enhancing the ways they reach and connect with local consumers and prospects. 
And we are also investing in the technology that will ensure an excellent user experience across each platform. This effort is not about the delivery of our content solely. It is about immediacy and a shift to digital first publishing and deeper coverage on the topics that matter most to our customers. We believe that investing in news gathering on the most important topics for our audiences in each market is critical. 
In addition to enhancing our content, we are also developing applications for the platforms that consumers are accessing in growing numbers. And because the potential growth on those devices is significant, we are aggressively developing the next generation of mobile, tablet, desktop and browser products at our local media properties and at USA TODAY. Our products will interface with all operating systems: Apple, Android, Kindle Fire and Windows 8. A great example is the level of downloads of the USA TODAY app we've experienced. At this point, there have been 11.4 million downloads across multiple devices and platforms. We are the #1 free news app on the Windows Phone and the Kindle Fire. 
And it is not just the user-facing applications. A huge challenge in the digital environment is designing content that works effectively for each platform and then monetizing those digital products. As part of that effort, we are integrating all the systems that complete the chain, which include editorial, publishing and ad platforms. We want to be able to manage, report, monitor and sell our digital media through as streamlined a process as possible. We have the expertise to get that done, and that will greatly enhance our ability to deliver digital content and solutions for advertisers. 
As I noted earlier, we are building businesses that extend our strong and recognizable brands. I think a great example of this is the USA TODAY Sports Media Group, which leverages the combined strength of our unparalleled local content with USA TODAY's powerful national reach. Building on a great sports portfolio, they are on the right trajectory to become a sports powerhouse. Through our local and national assets, the USA TODAY Sports Media Group currently has a total digital reach of nearly 16 million unique monthly viewers and is consistently a top 10 sports digital property according to comScore, which we expect to increase significantly with our just completed acquisition of Fantasy Sports Ventures' Big Lead Sports, the leading independent sports digital site. When all Fantasy Sports Ventures' assets are ultimately combined with the other properties within the USA TODAY sports group, we will be catapulted into 1 of the top 5 sports sites on the Web. With the added scale, we will greatly increase our ability to deliver our engaging content to a wider array of sports fans in a much more meaningful way, which is a huge draw for sports marketers and advertisers. In sum, great scale for a very modest investment. 
One of the primary goals of the USA TODAY sports group is to take the traditional sports page experience and recreate it into a multidimensional experience for consumers through marketing partnerships with marquee sports organizations. In addition to our acquisitions of U.S. PRESSWIRE, mmajunkie.com and Fantasy Sports over the past few months, we have also entered into an important sports marketing agreement with the PGA Tour and have been designated as an official directed media partner of NASCAR. We will continue to build out our sports content across all platforms with a particularly strong focus on digital and mobile. This will be one of the most vital parts of our efforts to grow the sports groups business and brand going forward. 
Now let me tell you about our efforts to maximize efficiency. Leveraging our skills to seek new revenue streams was a critical factor in the consolidation of all of our domestic printing and productions operations into a single entity, Gannett Publishing Services. GPS, as we call it, is responsible for all facets of printing domestically and also our production operations: imaging, ad design, printing and packaging, distribution, customer acquisition and retention and direct marketing. We now have the opportunity to even more effectively market our expertise and our scale to third parties. There are a number of revenue opportunities we are currently discussing with potential partners across both printing and distribution. We also expect to create efficiencies as we standardize business practices and eliminate redundancies. The impact of this to the bottom line is expected to be in the $40 million range in 2012 and growing thereafter. 
In fact, an important first step for GPS was the completion of the agreement to outsource the printing and packaging of the Cincinnati Enquirer and the Kentucky Enquirer to a Columbus, Ohio printing facility that we announced in December. Now as you saw this morning, we took some special charges associated with that move this quarter, which Paul will cover in more detail in a few moments. But most importantly, excluding the accrual for multi-employer pension liability, which we will have no matter whether we continue printing in Cincinnati or not, the expected payback is less than 2 years. 
Now let me quickly turn to a review of the quarter. Our results this quarter reflect the uneven and tepid economic recovery and consumer confidence, as well as particularly uneven consumer spending during the holiday season. The positive impact of our strategic effort, both on the digital front and our efficiency efforts, contributed to our results in the quarter. As expected, our success in achieving over $52 million in political advertising in the fourth quarter of 2010 made comparisons extremely difficult this quarter. But even with those headwinds, earnings per share in the quarter, when adjusted for special items, totaled $0.72. Total revenue across the company was approximately 5% lower and total expenses, excluding special items, were down roughly 2%, resulting in operating income of $291 million and operating cash flow of $339 million. 
Digital segment revenue growth of over 9% was driven primarily by strong revenue results at CareerBuilder. Total revenue at CareerBuilder was up about 15% in the quarter as they continue to increase their market leadership position in North America and their international expansion overseas. And the prospects for continued market share gains in 2012 at CareerBuilder look very promising. In fact, CareerBuilder's December global invoicing was its highest December ever, up a double-digit percentage from December of last year. 
As noted, our digital and cross-platform sales efforts drove increases in digital revenue at our publishing and television operations. As well, overall digital revenues, company-wide, were up almost 7% and totaled over $290 million for the fourth quarter and $1.1 billion for the year, approximately 21% of our revenue. 
Now to give you a little more detail on our total digital revenues, of that $290 million company-wide in the quarter, about $181 million, as you saw this morning, comes from the digital businesses in our Digital segment, with CareerBuilder accounting for about 82% of the Digital segment revenues. Our domestic publishing operations, and here I'm going to exclude operations like Clipper Magazine and Gannett Healthcare and Gannett Military, which are primarily print-centric operations and more specifically, our U.S. Community Publishing sites plus USA TODAY and its digital brands, those operations accounted for approximately 26% or $74 million of total digital advertising revenues in the quarter. In our U.S. Community Publishing operations, digital revenues were about 15% or so of their ad revenues; and at USA TODAY, about a quarter of their ad revenues across their brands were digital. 
Turning to broadcasting. As expected in an odd year, revenues were down about 14% due primarily to the challenge of overcoming last year's successful effort in political advertising. Although we had almost $5 million of political spending in the fourth quarter, and as I just said, we achieved $52 million in political spending in the same quarter last year, so television revenues, net of that incremental impact of political spending, were up about 11% as ad sales, retransmission revenue and online revenue were all up solidly in the quarter. Based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total television revenues in the first quarter this year to be up in the high-single digits compared to the first quarter last year. 
Turning to publishing, revenues there were approximately 5% lower while digital revenues in the segment were up almost 7%. Advertising comparisons quarter-to-quarter improved relative to the third quarter as national and classified advertising comparisons were better and retail was in line. The monthly retail advertising trends in the quarter in some ways mirrored retailer performance and holiday season spending. We saw some apprehension among retailers regarding the 2011 holiday season, and that resulted in a significant increase in discounting. This caused a surge in buying around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, making those some of the best in recent history. However, December spending softened, and retailers reported the largest post-Thanksgiving, pre-Christmas decrease in spending in some time. The soft close in retailing to December was exacerbated by Christmas Day falling on Sunday, which was also the last day of our fiscal year, and we believe that negatively impacted advertising sale across some retail categories, particularly preprint revenue. 
Driven by the retail and national categories, November was the best month in the quarter in terms of total advertising in the Publishing segment, followed by December. Although Newsquest results continued to be impacted by the soft U.S. -- U.K. economy, comparisons in the quarter were the best of the year due in large part to classified advertising. So again in summary, each of our business segments remained very profitable for the quarter, and as a result, we continue to consistently generate substantial free cash flow. 
In 2012, we'll continue to leverage our strong local media franchises and iconic national brands and deliver our valued content to customers across multiple platforms while providing innovative solutions for our advertisers. Through new subscription models being introduced this year and a comprehensive suite of delivery platforms, investment in adjacent businesses and a continued focus on our operational efficiencies, we are positioning Gannett for continued success as the media landscape evolves. 
As I mentioned, we intend to discuss key initiatives as well as our capital allocation plans at Gannett's Investor Day on Wednesday, February 22 at our offices in New York. Invitations will be sent out in a few days, and Jeff Heinz has reminded me to tell you to please RSVP as seating will be limited. 
And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul."

I'll cover our quarterly results in more detail, particularly each of our business segments, and then I'll comment on some balance sheet items. 
As Gracia noted, we generated approximately $1.4 billion in revenues in the quarter. Total expenses, excluding special items, were $1.1 billion, a decline of 2% year-over-year. Operating cash flow totaled $339 million, as shown on Table 7 of our earnings release. As importantly, we generated free cash flow of $203 million, and that's shown on Table 10. For the full year, total revenues were $5.2 billion and operating cash flow, excluding special items, totaled $1.1 billion in line with the guidance we provided to you in December. We again generated substantial free cash flow of $775 million in 2011 despite the soft economic environment in the U.S. and the U.K. and the relative absence of incremental even-year political and Olympic advertising that benefited our results in 2010. 
Turning back to the quarter. Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.49. Earnings per share -- per diluted share, excluding special items, were $0.72. In the fourth quarter, we recorded several special items that totaled about $107 million pretax or $0.23 per share, and those are detailed on Table 5 of our earnings release. Let me review these items in more detail. 
First, we had a pretax charge of approximately $64 million for workforce restructuring and facility consolidations. This includes a charge associated with the transfer of production activities for the Cincinnati Enquirer to a third-party printer in Columbus, Ohio, as previously disclosed. The majority of the charge from the move to Columbus relates to the recognition of withdrawal liabilities for multi-employer union pension plans and the balance relates to severance and benefit costs. Second, during the quarter, we reported special charges of $14.7 million for the disability-related retirement of our former Chairman and CEO. Third, we recognized special noncash charges affecting nonoperating income which totaled $28 million pretax or $0.07 per share related to minority investments. And finally, our results included a special tax benefit of $11 million or $0.04 per share relating to an impairment that was taken previously but not recognized until now for tax purposes. 
Turning to our segment results. Total Publishing segment's revenues were 5% lower in the quarter. Advertising revenue was 7% lower. However, year-over-year advertising revenue comparisons improved sequentially. Gracia has already discussed retail trends in the quarter, so I'll comment on the other advertising categories. National advertising was down approximately 9% in the quarter, but up more than 6 percentage points from third quarter comparisons. At USA TODAY, we experienced strength in several categories, particularly telecommunications, credit cards and automotive, which helped to partially offset declines in travel, entertainment and technology categories. At Newsquest, national advertising was up 7% in local currency, consistent with the trend we saw in the third quarter. Classified advertising for the Publishing segment was down 8.4% but up slightly sequentially. In the U.S., classified advertising was down, but we saw sequential improvement in all categories excluding employment which was relatively flat. But in December, employment advertising was up year-over-year. Real estate classified advertising declined in the quarter, reflecting continued weakness in the housing market. However, year-over-year comparisons improved about 5 percentage points relative to third quarter. And the trends in the real estate category improved over the course of the fourth quarter. In California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada, which were the states most impacted by the real estate crisis, real estate advertising trends were in line with other regions of the country. On the other hand, employment advertising and auto advertising trends were still better at our properties outside of these states. 
Classified category comparisons at Newsquest in pounds were better this quarter relative to the third quarter as all category comparison improved excluding auto. Employment advertising comparison improved 7 percentage points from third quarter comparisons. Gracia gave you the major components of digital advertising for the Publishing segment. Successful cross-platform and marketing solution efforts contributed to a 7% increase in digital publishing revenue for the quarter. The increase was due to a 6% gain in digital revenue in U.S. Community Publishing, auto, employment and local digital revenue, the largest categories, all contributed to the gain. Digital revenue was a bright spot at Newsquest as well, up about 11% in local currency. 
Expenses, excluding special items in the Publishing segment, were down 3% year-over-year as we continue to extract cost efficiencies. Newsprint expense was down 8% in the quarter as an increase of almost 2% in newsprint usage prices was more than offset by a consumption decline of approximately 10%. Focusing on newsprint prices for just a moment. North America newsprint prices were relatively unchanged throughout 2011. Market conditions supported a stable environment. Capacity rationalization is taking place in the market but offshore demand is softening. As a result, we anticipate that prices will remain stable and possibly decline if offshore trends continue to weaken. 
Operating income in the Publishing segment, excluding special items, was $176 million while operating cash flow totaled $205 million, and those figures are found in Table 7 of our earnings results. 
Turning to Broadcasting segment. Excluding incremental political revenues generated last year, total television revenues were up 11% in the quarter, which was at the high end of the range we provided in December. We saw 9% growth in time sales excluding political, as spending in several of the most important TV ad categories was up solidly in the quarter. The auto category was particularly strong as both foreign and domestic manufacturers increased their spending in the quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Digital advertising solutions at our TV stations continue to draw customers, resulting in a 19% increase in digital revenues. Higher retransmission revenues, which grew 30% to $21 million, also contributed to the revenue results. Excluding special items, Broadcasting segment expenses were down about 6% this quarter. 
Operating income totaled approximately $90 million in the quarter and operating cash flow was $97 million, just $27 million lower compared with the prior year despite the net decline of $47 million in political spending. Now all these figures can be found on Table 7 of our earnings release. 
As detailed earlier, we had strong performance in our Digital segment revenues. Digital segment expenses were up 11%, reflecting significantly higher sales incentive and bonus costs associated with higher revenue levels at CareerBuilder and incremental investments in product development at PointRoll and ShopLocal. 
As Gracia noted, CareerBuilder had record level of invoicing in December and very good revenue growth. As a result, a significant number of sales representatives exceeded their sales quota very late in the quarter, and as a result, we recorded incremental commissions and bonuses in the quarter. In total, the incremental costs at CareerBuilder, PointRoll and ShopLocal were roughly $9 million in the fourth quarter. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of $203 million this quarter and $775 million for the full year. At the end of the year, we had approximately $1.76 billion of debt outstanding, a reduction of $158 million during the quarter and $592 million for the full year. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities, was slightly below 1.7x at the end of the quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was 12% lower than the fourth quarter last year, reflecting lower average debt balances. And at this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 7.25%. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a cost of $25 million. And since we reactivated our share repurchase program in late July through at year end, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at a cost of $53 million. Cash at quarter end was $167 million. And lastly, capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled about $26 million and were $72 million for the full year. 
And with that, I'll open it up for questions."

We'll provide some additional color since we'll be a little further along in the quarter at our Investor Day on February 22. I think the second part of your question related to the fact that we generate an enormous amount of free cash flow on a very consistent basis. And as we've talked about in the past, we obviously want to make sure that we have the flexibility to invest in those products and investments that make sense to the future growth of our company. As well, we have focused certainly in the past year on returning additional capital to shareholders. For those of you who don't follow us as closely as other folks, in July we doubled our dividend and we reinstituted our share buyback program and said we'd buy back about $100 million of shares over the next 12 months. When we -- however, when we announced those actions, we did remind people that, that was just merely a first step and frankly, a good first step, given the very difficult economic backdrop we saw during the course of the summer. We also reminded everyone that the board will continually reassess these actions depending on economic and market conditions. So we're going to evaluate -- we're going to continue to evaluate our capital allocation in that context of delivering increasing value to shareholders while preserving our financial flexibility, and we'll look forward to providing greater detail on our capital allocation plans on the 22nd."

We've also enjoyed some political spending from the primaries that have already taken place in South Carolina, and that is going to take place in Florida, I guess, tomorrow. And so we're nicely on track from that perspective. With regard to specifics on the quarter, I think as I mentioned, November was the best month of the quarter as we shared, and as we said at UBS, a month does not a trend make. We've seen some volatility in our -- as I addressed in my remarks. December, on a retail basis, was I think impacted by the fact that consumer spending around the holidays seemed to slow after the initial excitement around the Black Friday, Cyber Monday activities. We also, as I mentioned, were impacted by the fact that Christmas fell on that last Sunday, and that obviously had an impact on preprint. So I'd say that December was stronger than certainly third quarter and earlier in the fourth quarter, but not quite as strong as the November comparisons."

We think the pie is going to continue to grow, and we're going to be the beneficiary of that in a meaningful way. As to Captivate, I think you're right on track. Captivate did not have the kind of quarter in the fourth quarter that we had hoped they would. They had some personnel changes. And frankly, I think in the out-of-home space, there was a little bit of a pullback in general in that space, and Captivate obviously is part of that space.

I think it'd be tough for us to kind of break out all of those components on CareerBuilder.

Dave Lougee, who runs our broadcast stations, always does a terrific job, and there are just natural factors on the expense side. When you have $47 million of incremental political spending and you have a lot of coverage, you have sales commissions and other pieces associated with that. You also have additional coverage that you clearly are doing at times and additional expenses when you're covering political and you're covering Olympics, particularly when it's overseas and the like. And so in an even year, you expect to see expenses rise. I don't think we have any particular formula other than that we obviously look, as we're budgeting for the next year, at commissions and travel and those pieces that relate on a variable basis to those kinds of events. And then clearly in a year like 2011 when those events are missing and -- those special events are missing, then we would expect expenses to reflect that. I think we have a terrific opportunity vis-à-vis the Olympics. With USA TODAY, with our 13 NBC affiliates and the fact that our Newsquest properties are on the ground there in the U.K., sharing of content resources, sharing of video resources and a variety of those kinds of factors, we believe, are going to be very helpful to us as we provide some very, very strong coverage of what we think is going to be a very interesting Olympics in London."

And in fact, if you look at our political spending in 2008 and 2010, what you'd see is that in the second half of the year, that's primarily when we generate the vast majority of our spending, something like 80%-plus of all of the political we receive, we received in 2010 and 2008 is in the back half of the year. And September, October, November being the particularly large, large months. But during the course of the year, obviously, we'll benefit from whatever happens. We have a -- from a footprint perspective, we've got 13 U.S Senate and 3 governors races in our markets, which is about the same number as 2008, although we're going to have to see how competitive each one of those races ultimately is. In 2010, obviously not a presidential year but there were like, I think, 16 Senate and 18 governors races in our market. But overall, I'd say, Mike, we would expect that this will be a very robust presidential year with direct spending and all the pack money we've all been hearing about being deployed. So we look forward to a strong year on the political front."

So I think we're right on track to achieve what we expect to achieve, but we'll continue to update everyone as the quarter unfolds. We always tend to be careful early in the quarter and then hope to come in at the high end of expectations. As you know in the fourth quarter, we had indicated 8% to 9% and then raised that up to the 11% range. We'll just have to see how the quarter unfolds. I will say that from a category standpoint, auto continues to be quite strong, particularly in February and March. And some other key categories like telcom and a few others are very strong.

I'm pleased you were able to join us today. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with me and today, we will be discussing our first quarter results and an update on the integrated growth strategy and c",2965,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased you were able to join us today. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with me and today, we will be discussing our first quarter results and an update on the integrated growth strategy and cash flow-funded capital programs that we unveiled at our Investor Day in February. Bob Dickey, President of U.S. Community Publishing, is also here and will discuss early progress on our new content subscription model. 
The strategy and capital allocation plan we discussed 8 weeks ago defines the path we are taking to position Gannett for success in the digital age and reflects the financial discipline underpinning all of our work. As we explained in February, we are executing an ambitious but achievable plan to revitalize our company. 
The media landscape is evolving rapidly, and we intend to be a leader in a reshaped industry. We expect the work currently going on across the company, as well as our continuing plans, will put Gannett on a sustainable growth trajectory and enable us to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders by 2015. 
Now let me begin by turning to the first quarter, and as expected and as we shared with you at our Investor Day, our results were impacted by the uneven and somewhat sluggish U.S. economic recovery, a particularly challenging start in January for advertising overall and the planned investments we made in growth initiatives that we will detail in a few moments. On track with our forecasted EPS, total revenue was approximately 3% lower than a year ago, and total expenses excluding special items were basically unchanged. 
Earnings per share in the quarter when adjusted for special items were $0.34, which exceeds the $0.28 to $0.32 range we provided on Investor Day, as well as the First Call consensus, in part due to slightly lower-than-expected spending on strategic investments this quarter. 
As we said in February, the investments we are making this year in our growth strategy would be front-loaded. In this quarter, again, we invested about $20 million of the expected $65 million outlay we will make this year. Our results also reflect higher pension expense, which we also previously discussed in several special items. 
Each of our business segments had solid performances this quarter. We continue to generate substantial free cash flow, which we will use to return capital to shareholders, to self-fund our growth strategy and to continue to pay down debt. Operating income from the quarter excluding special items was approximately $157 million, and operating cash flow was $204 million. These numbers included the impact of the investments in our strategic initiatives. And by the way, the initiative investments had about 150 basis point impact on our operating margins overall. That also translates to a 200 basis point impact on the operating margin in the Publishing segment and a 100 basis point impact on the already terrific margins in Broadcasting. 
Our Digital and Broadcasting segments, both of which experienced growth, accounted for about 50% of this quarter's operating income excluding special items and the initiative investment. Digital had solid revenue growth of about 7% and Broadcasting, about 8%. These revenue results were offset again by continuing soft advertising demand in Publishing. The 7% revenue growth in our Digital segment resulted in revenue of $168 million in the segment this quarter. 
CareerBuilder again represented the lion's share of this segment's revenue and again led the way with gains of over 10% over last year. CareerBuilder is the clear North American market leader, and better execution than their competitors allowed them to capture market share again this quarter. Additionally, CareerBuilder had significant growth in its international business, and expansion in selected markets remains a key area of focus. 
Our outlook for the remainder of the year for CareerBuilder is very promising. As you know, Gannett's Digital revenues occur across the company and aren't just reported in our Digital segment. Revenues from Digital products and services, including our Digital Marketing Services offerings, are reflected in our Publishing and Broadcast segment results as well. 
In the Publishing segment for example, Digital revenue was up about 13% in the first quarter, with display advertising in the auto, employment and retail categories leading the way. Digital revenue in just U.S. Community Publishing alone grew by approximately 11% over last year. Our Digital Marketing Services offerings that I'll talk more about in a few minutes are beginning to make a contribution to Publishing, and we expect to rapidly expand that as we move forward. 
Reported Digital revenue was up about 25% at USA TODAY and its associated businesses and over 6% in pounds at Newsquest. This growth is a positive development and a measurable example of how our Publishing business is evolving. 
If we look at Gannett's Digital revenue in the aggregate, first quarter revenue grew by 8% and totaled $273 million company-wide or approximately 22% of our total company-wide revenue. 
Now let me turn to Broadcast for a moment. There, revenues were up 7.5%, and in television, all cylinders were firing. We benefited from stronger core advertising demand, particularly auto spending and the impact of the Super Bowl on our NBC affiliates and primary season political spending. In addition, retrans and Digital were also important contributors to revenue growth. 
In Broadcasting and television, we are looking forward to a strong second quarter and second half from them, driven by the Summer Olympics in July and August and political spending, roughly 80% of which typically occurs between Labor Day and Election Day in presidential election years. 
In Publishing, we continue to be impacted by the industry's secular decline that we have talked about previously. First quarter revenue declined approximately 6% year-over-year. January was the softest month of the quarter and was consistent with industry-wide performance. Performance improved in February and again in March. In fact, the average of ad revenue comparisons in the Publishing segment in February and March combined was better than fourth quarter comparisons. 
Drilling down into the categories, classified advertising comparisons in the first quarter improved relative to the fourth quarter, and at U.S. Community Publishing, employment advertising revenue in March was flat for print-only and of course, was in positive territory for print and online combined. 
The ongoing volatility and softness in the national advertising environment was most notable at USA TODAY. USA TODAY is an iconic brand with tremendous value and visibility, but that volatility has impacted its performance. We know we can do better in growing the business to match the scale and power of the brand. 
To remind you, USA TODAY has historically made up less than 10% of our revenues and continues to be a small contributor to overall cash flow results as it has historically been. That fact actually says a lot about the strength and diversity in our business and about the significant upside opportunity in USA TODAY in a more digital era. We are working to more fully realize its potential as we approach the brand's 30th anniversary in September. Our priority right now is to recruit a top-notch publisher to advance the promising initiatives already underway and grow the business by spearheading USA TODAY's continuing evolution into a leading multiplatform media brand. 
Turning to the U.K., Newsquest results continue to reflect that challenging economic environment as total revenue and local currency was down about 6%. But I will tell you that our results were stronger by far than any other regional publisher in the U.K. National advertising was positive in the quarter and up solidly in February and March. Expenses were well controlled and declined in the quarter, in line with revenue. As a result, Newsquest profits were down just 3% for the quarter and up in March compared to the same period last year in pounds. 
Now I'd like to shift gears and spend the next few minutes updating you on our growth strategy. To quickly summarize, our blueprint for growth is based on Gannett's 3 distinct advantages: First is our hometown advantage, the deep understanding of and presence in the communities we serve. We can't say this enough. The knowledge we've accumulated and our strong relationships with consumers and local businesses are the bedrock of our plan. 
Next is what we call our brand advantage. Gannett's iconic national brands like USA TODAY and CareerBuilder and our more than 100 trusted local brands give us excellent platforms to build new businesses and offerings. 
And of course, the third is our financial advantage. Even during the worst economic times in our country, we paid down debt and kept our balance sheet strong. Financial discipline is one of our hallmarks, and because of it, we are in position to utilize our strong cash flow to fund our growth plan while returning significant capital to our shareholders. 
Each of these advantages is fundamental to our planning and crucial to our future. Our integrated plan is already well underway, and as we discussed, we are expecting to begin to see results by the end of the year. 
First off, we are working to stabilize our Publishing business, which we continue to believe is integral to our success and a business that remains very profitable for us. I want to remind you, however, that this particular effort is not a quick fix. This isn't a 1- or 2-quarter solution. Rather, it is a continuous effort which is going to begin to show results later this year. We'll build on the impact of it over the next few years, and then we will fully realize the benefits of all that we are doing in 2015 and beyond. And at the same time, we are focused on continuing to build on the growth of our Broadcasting and Digital segments. 
Secondly, we've been hard at work to accelerate growth by entering or expanding into new high-potential related businesses where we have a hometown and a brand advantage. I'm going to highlight a few of those in a moment, and Bob Dickey will also talk about the third. 
And thirdly, we continue to focus this quarter on optimizing our assets without sacrificing our strong financial profile. 
Now I know that many of you were at our Investor Day or followed along on the webcast so I'm not obviously going to do a full strategy review this morning. But I do encourage those of you who weren't able to participate to visit the Investor Relations section of our website and review the presentations. And please, don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any questions. 
I'd like to now update you on 2 of the higher visibility initiatives we have underway: the USA TODAY Sports Media Group and our Digital Marketing Services initiative. In a few minutes, Bob Dickey will also update you on the progress of the third, U.S. Community Publishing's All Access paidContent subscription model. 
I believe our sports initiative meets all the criteria of being a big transformative idea. It all starts with Gannett's existing and impressive national, regional and local sports resources. From in-depth high school and college sports coverage to the national and professional sports scene to showcase events like the Kentucky Derby, auto racing and the Olympics, Gannett is a sports news and information powerhouse. Our strategic sports initiative is our plan to take our sports business to the next level by building out our portfolio. 
In November, we acquired MAAjunkie.com, the premier mixed martial arts site. In doing so, we tapped into a younger skewing, rapidly growing national sports phenomenon with absolutely rabid fans that generate 12 million page views on MMAJ per month. 
In January, we acquired Fantasy Sports Ventures, including Big League Sports, which at the time was the largest independent digital sports property in North America. In February, we announced a joint venture with MLB Advanced Media, Major League Baseball's interactive media and Internet company. These acquisitions, along with partnerships with NASCAR, the PGA and others have put Gannett on the path towards category leadership. 
We set our sights on becoming a top 5 digital sports property from being 17th when all of these activities were initially conceived. And in early March, we reached our goal when we announced that Comscore had named USA TODAY Sports Media Group the fourth most-visited digital sports entity in its February and March rankings and there's more to come. This was exciting news that comes with more than just pride and some bragging rights. USA TODAY Sports Media Group had almost 24 million unique visitors in March. That size audience, particularly with such a well-defined demographic, opens up important new local and national advertising and e-commerce revenue streams for us. 
Thanks in large part to our digital reach, we are now deeply involved in tickets, memorabilia and sporting good sales. And it is also -- I'm sorry, the second strategic initiative I want to discuss today is Digital Marketing Services. DMS is an exciting growth opportunity to put our hometown and brand advantages to work for the 150,000-plus merchants who have been turning to Gannett for years, and in some cases decades to help them reach their customers. And it is also a great opportunity for new customers who want the advantage of quality one-stop shopping product sets. 
The local advertising market is huge, projected to be $149 billion per year by 2015. Marketing and services are the largest pieces of the pie, and within that, the sweet spot is Digital Marketing Services which are projected to reach nearly $38 billion annually by 2015. And daily deals, digital coupons and social media marketing, being among the fastest-growing areas in that niche. 
Digital Marketing Services is a new sizable opportunity that is additive to our existing display advertising and other digital revenue streams. We are keenly aware that digital marketing is a fast-track opportunity that we are pursuing with a great sense of urgency. We are uniquely positioned to profitably capture significant new business and search engine optimization and marketing, social media and web design. These are important to our client's success, and we have the know-how to deliver turnkey solutions. 
In addition to capability, we have one thing that no one else has: The digital world is changing fast, and business owners are looking for a trusted partner to help figure out how to take full advantage of the opportunity, and that's where we come in. That's Gannett's opportunity. Our advertisers know and trust us. We know our clients and the communities better than anyone, and so we are perfectly suited to be an end-to-end provider of digital solutions and services for these businesses. 
We have sales staff already on the ground, established brands and relationships in place, and we have growing capabilities to enable us to structure and sell packaged solutions for advertisers and marketers in our 100-plus local communities. And we are selling packaged solutions. We are not just evolving into a consulting business. We're getting paid to design and deliver advertising campaigns and programs. 
In addition, we have robust promotional capabilities over the year and in print. Our web and mobile base portfolio and capabilities are significant and growing. Having these capabilities are available from a trusted, knowledgeable, truly local source, we believe, gives us that advantage that we plan to exploit to the maximum. 
So who's buying these services and what does a Gannett solution look like? Let me just give you one recent example. Our folks in Phoenix worked with a retailer that was a long-term customer and relied on traditional print media that included us and Yellow Pages. They wanted to make a change but were confused and frustrated by the complexity of digital options. They came to us because of our strong relationship, and we implemented a digital solution focused on search optimization, pay-per-click and click-to-call and mobile. 
We also improved the customer experience on their website and built out the digital back-end of their business to increase web traffic. The results for our customer speak for themselves. A ranking or 1 or 2 for all targeted keywords, a 500% increase in daily web visits, generating more revenue via both traditional media and a 42% conversion rate on their digital ad. 
Now the measurement criteria may be a bit different than many are used to but we can all understand the outcome. Using new tools, Gannett was able to help the client be successful. In the process, we strengthened our overall relationship with a more than satisfied customer as well, and the customer gained and we gained more profitable revenue we wouldn't have had a year ago. 
During the first quarter, we continued rolling out our Digital Marketing Services in our top markets and have an aggressive program in place to continue to build it out. As we ramp up these efforts, we anticipate full year DMS revenues in the range of $75 million to $100 million this year. 
As we move through 2012, we will continue to leverage our strong local media franchises and iconic national brands and deliver our valued content to customers across multiple platforms while providing innovative solutions for our advertisers. Let me emphasize, our strategy is not a quick fix. It is a well thought-out roadmap to growth. We are confident in our strategy for growth and our ability to deliver significant capital to shareholders. 
Now on that note, let me turn the call over to Bob Dickey to discuss one of the most important initiatives underway to revitalize U.S. Community Publishing, our new all access content subscription model. We know this effort is of particular importance and interest to all of you, and we want to share some of the very early feedback we've been receiving as we roll the new model out to our local markets. Bob?"
20571,183391637,284351,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2012",2012-04-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gracia. As Gracia pointed out, we are in the very early stages with our test sites, but I remain optimistic our approach will indeed help stabilize U.S. Community Publishing. Let me share some of these early results. In March, which is our first 4",609,"Thanks, Gracia. As Gracia pointed out, we are in the very early stages with our test sites, but I remain optimistic our approach will indeed help stabilize U.S. Community Publishing. Let me share some of these early results. In March, which is our first 4 months, the year-over-year circulation revenue gains ranging from 20% to 37%. Thus, the entire test group combined, revenues increased 29% year-over-year. 
St. Cloud and Wilmington were our top-performing markets. We suddenly received many questions about the potential impact on advertising revenues. I'm happy to report that the test sites executed all of their digital campaigns in March. We are successfully communicating with our local advertisers so they understand how we are working to provide them a more engaged consumer. 
The test sites' total advertising revenues were 2 percentage points better than the U.S. EP average in March. Pre-print and digital revenues were impacted less than projected in our business model. 5 of our 6 markets have successfully sold sponsorships with their smartphones and tablet apps. 40% of sponsorship revenue is coming from new customers. 
Combined, the test sites posted year-over-year digital revenue growth. Utilizing the media approach, we've been able to test various levels and feel comfortable that we are understanding [indiscernible]. It remains very early in the billing cycle but our March 13-week retention improved slightly year-over-year for the test site and is just above the U.S. EP average. This is led by successful conversion programs to our EasyPay plan, and that is helping drive the retention. In just 6 weeks, we have seen an increase of 2 to 5 percentage points in the test markets. 
EasyPay in some of the test markets now exceeds 60% of our total subscribers and is growing. In every market, we outperformed our projections for circulation volumes. Daily and Sunday home delivery and Daily single-copy declines are below projections, while Sunday single-copy declines are projected or as projected in the markets we move to $3 and better than expected in our $2 markets. As a result, we're doing further analysis to determine the best possible price point as we roll out future sites. 
After 6 weeks, we are currently at 50% of our annual goal for digital subscriptions in these test markets, and we're confident we'll exceed these early projections. Based on local market research, we are charging between $9 and $15 per month for our digital-only subscriptions. The good news is our new digital subscribers index younger, male, married with children and more affluent than we first realized, filling an important audience gap for us. 
Our investment in new technology is providing a much better consumer experience as they manage their accounts. As a result, customers are activating their accounts at a much faster pace than the first test sites, and we're already 35% to our annual goal. 
As we outlined at Investor Day, this new subscription model offers us the ability to reinvest in our local markets and provide better customer service across Gannett. To date, we have hired over 100 employees to enhance our customer service centers, consumer marketing efforts and to provide more unique local content. Those investments, in conjunction with the creation of Gannett Publishing Services, provided us the resources and the expertise to move quickly and successfully into these test markets. 
We remain committed to this model, and as Gracia pointed out, it focuses on the value of our content and the strength of our local bands. Our next wave of 17 sites takes place beginning May 1. I'm very confident based on the early results that we will continue to execute at the highest possible level going forward. Thank you."
20571,183391637,284351,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2012",2012-04-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Well, thank you, Bob. I'll provide some additional detail on the quarterly results for each of our business segments and cover some items from the balance sheet. Operating revenues in the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion. Total expenses excluding s",1556,"Well, thank you, Bob. I'll provide some additional detail on the quarterly results for each of our business segments and cover some items from the balance sheet. Operating revenues in the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion. Total expenses excluding special items totaled $1.1 billion, relatively unchanged year-over-year despite about $20 million of investment in initiatives and about $6 million in higher pension expense. 
Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.28. Earning per diluted share excluding special items were $0.34. We recorded net special items in the first quarter related to facility consolidations and workforce restructuring that totaled approximately $21 million pretax or about $0.06 per share, as detailed on Table 3 of our earnings release. 
Now let me quickly cover those in more detail. First, we recorded pretax facility consolidation charges of approximately $5 million or about $0.01 per share and reflected primarily accelerated depreciation costs associated with the transfer of production activities for The Cincinnati Enquirer to a third-party printer in Columbus, Ohio, that's the move that was announced in the fourth quarter of last year. As previously disclosed, similar levels of accelerated depreciation will be recorded in the second and third quarters until the move is completed. 
Second, we recorded pretax workforce restructuring charges of just over $16 million or about $0.04 per share that related primarily to an early retirement offer program we announced for U.S. Community Publishing employees during the quarter. 
Turning to our segment results. In our Publishing segment, revenues were $874 million, down 6% in the quarter, reflecting an 8% decline in advertising revenue while circulation was about 2% lower. Advertising demand firmed during the quarter but not enough to mitigate a slow start to the year. Ad demand in January was soft across all categories, particularly the retail and national categories which experienced double-digit declines. Comparison narrowed significantly within the quarter, and all ad categories were down in the mid-single digit in March. 
In the quarter, retail and classified advertising were down 8% and 7%, respectively, and national advertising was 13% lower. Retail advertising at our domestic operations was 7% lower for the quarter. However, result improved sequentially in the quarter, and year-over-year comparisons for March were almost 7 percentage points better than comparisons in January. 
Retail advertising at Newsquest in pounds declined over 6%, reflecting a soft economic environment in the U.K. Our national advertising for the Publishing segment was down 13% in the quarter but improved sequentially during the quarter. In our domestic Publishing operations, the difference from January to March was almost 13 percentage points. 
As Gracia noted, USA TODAY has been impacted by soft national advertising. Increases in the technology and advocacy categories were more than offset by declines in several categories, including entertainment, telecom, auto and financials. 
At Newsquest, national advertising was up over 2% in local currency. This has been a bright spot for Newsquest since the second quarter of last year. Classified advertising was about 6.5% lower for the Publishing segment but better than fourth quarter comparisons. 
In the U.S., classified advertising revenues were approximately 6% lower but were also better than the fourth quarter. We saw improvements in almost all of the classified categories in the first quarter relative to the fourth. 
Employment in the U.S., although down marginally in the quarter, improved within the quarter and finished up over 3 percentage -- or 3% in March compared with the prior year. 
Real estate classified advertising was down in the quarter, but results improved again during the quarter. A continuing trend we identified in the fourth quarter, the states most impacted by the real estate crisis: California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada had real estate results in line with the rest of our markets, but employment and auto advertising trends were better for properties outside these states. 
Looking at our domestic results across regions, our West and Midwest regions outperformed our Northeast and South regions in the first quarter. Publishing properties in the West performed particularly well, given that they were cycling a strong performance in the first quarter of last year. The Midwest also showed improvement, excluding the upper Midwest which was up against challenging comparisons due to the Super Bowl spending in Wisconsin last year. 
In the Northeast, our New York locations showed substantial improvements in the quarter while New Jersey still lags. And in the South, results have been mixed, but the highlight being Florida which appears to be on an upward swing. 
Gracia cover the Digital revenue results in the Publishing segment in some detail. The growth rates of Digital revenue in this segment continues to be a bright spot as we explain our Digital Marketing -- as we expand our digital marketing capabilities and the solutions we can provide to advertisers. 
Publishing expenses excluding special items declined over 1% in the quarter and were down 3.4% excluding $18 million in initiative investments. Newsprint expense declined 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 7% consumption decline, which was partially offset by a 1% increase in usage prices year-over-year. 
Now let me comment briefly on you spent on the newsprint market. Our newsprint prices remain stable throughout the quarter. The combined impact of softening demand internationally, new supply options that entered in the market in the first quarter and a recent announcement that a major mill will restart in the second quarter all point to a more favorable pricing environment. 
Focusing for a moment on the Publishing segment profitability, that's shown on Table 4, operating income in the Publishing segment was $85 million excluding special items of $23 million. Now, the $85 million reflects $18 million of initiative investments. Therefore, if you exclude special items and strategic initiative investments, operating margins for the Publishing segment would have been about 460 basis point higher in the quarter. 
Now let me give you a quick update on Gannett Publishing Services. As we previously disclosed, we expect to benefit from our consolidation of domestic printing and distribution capabilities into Gannett Publishing Services to be approximately $40 million this year. The savings consist of streamlining our management structure, optimizing our capacity and network capability, consolidating purchasing and leveraging sourcing opportunities. And we are on track to deliver the majority of our targeted savings in the second half of the year. 
Turning to the Broadcasting segment. Total television revenues were 8% higher in the quarter, driven in part by strong auto advertising both locally and nationally, and advertising related to the Super Bowl and political spending of $5.1 million. Retransmission revenues totaled $23 million in the quarter, an increase of 17% from the first quarter of last year. Online revenues were 6% higher. 
Total adjusted television revenues, defined to exclude the incremental impact of even-year political ad demand, were up 5.6%. Now based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total television revenues for the second quarter of 2012 to be in the high single-digits compared with the second quarter of 2011. 
Broadcasting segment expenses were up approximately 3%. Excluding strategic investment of approximately $2 million, operating expenses were up 1.5%. Operating income totaled about $73 million in the quarter, an increase of over 14% from the first quarter last year. 
Excluding investment in initiatives, the operating margin for Broadcasting would have been about 100 basis points higher, and operating cash flow was up over 12% to $80 million. 
Our Digital segment revenues were about 7% year in the quarter, driven by another strong performance by CareerBuilder which was up 10%. Operating expenses in the Digital segment were up about 7.5% due to higher sales and marketing costs at CareerBuilder. Operating income and operating cash flow in the Digital segment were $16 million and $24 million, respectively. 
Now in February if you recall, we announced a new capital allocation plan that included 150% dividend increase to $0.80 per share on an annual basis and a new $300 million share repurchase authorization targeted to be completed over the next 2 years. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares at a cost of $35.5 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.67 billion of debt outstanding, a reduction of $95 million during the quarter. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities, was about 1.7x at the end of the quarter. 
Interest expense in the first quarter was $7 million lower than the first quarter of last year, due primarily to lower average debt balances. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.7%. 
Cash at quarter end was $157 million, and capital expenditures in the first quarter were about $18 million. Now free cash flow in the quarter totaled $148 million after a $54 million contribution to our pension plan. 
Now finally before I open it up for questions, I wanted to remind you that similar to this quarter, we expect the second quarter to reflect continued investments in our strategic initiatives and higher pension expense. Initiative investment is expected to total $30 million in the second quarter. The increase in pension expenses will be $24 million for the entire year so the expense next quarter will be in line with the first quarter and will be about $6 million. 
And with that, I will open up for questions."

Overall, as we indicated, our advertising comparisons got much better as the first quarter went on. And like many others, I think January was a slow month. But clearly, we accelerated through February and March, and as I said earlier, our average for February and March was better than what we did in the fourth quarter. So starting out of the blocks, we currently anticipate that the second quarter will be much more like the way we ended the first quarter rather than the sluggishness that we obviously saw in January. On the television side, I don't think that our guidance is implying that core business will be a little softer. Obviously, we don't have the Super Bowl, which helped a little bit in the first quarter on our NBC affiliates. Political, I think we'll see how that all plays out but I don't think we're looking for heroic political numbers in the second quarter. Frankly, as we mentioned, about 80% of our political dollars are garnered between Labor Day and Election Day, so usually, the first and second quarters are not a significant political opportunity. So I think our core businesses hanging in there quite well. I look at auto and auto pacings, I think, are up in the 20%-plus range for Broadcasting. Obviously, a little bit of that is in comparison to the last year's second quarter when we had, towards the end of the quarter, the impact of the Japanese tsunami but we also had, absent the auto side, up revenues in Broadcasting last year in the second quarter. So in no way does that guidance imply that we expect core revenues to be softer. I think frankly where we sit today, we only really have good pacings for April and into May. I think June, we'll have to see. I think Dave Lougee, when we talk to him, he thinks that there's potential for some upside to the June pacings that we're obviously having just very early glances on right at the moment. Newsquest, I think we'll continue to do a good job and continue to outpace their regional competition in the U.K. So overall, I'd say the comment is again that the second quarter is starting out, and we expect it to be much more like the way we finished the first quarter than the January aberration."

In 2008, we had about $5 million of political spending in the second quarter. In 2010, I think there were more gubernatorial and senatorial races and those sorts of things that tend to generate dollars a little bit earlier in the year. I'd say at this point, our expectation is that political will probably be somewhere between $5 million and $10 million in the quarter. We're going to have to wait and see. Obviously, we are heartened by the fact that it appears that the presidential fundraising and the presidential election is finally getting underway in a very big way. And if you listen to any of the pundits about the kind of spending that is going to occur this year, it is going to be potentially unprecedented. We will be the beneficiary of that as it rolls out but it will be primarily in that Labor Day to Election Day period where we see the vast majority of that. In the interim, unlike 2010, we have fewer senatorial and fewer gubernatorial races. That's consistent with 2008."

And the other thing I would mention is video. Again, all of the prognosticators talk about the fact that video growth and dollars that are going to be placed along site video are going to grow and grow in an outsized way. That's one of the reasons behind the video production center that we have just put in our television station WXIA in Atlanta that is going to be servicing the entire Gannett organization. We see video was an incredible opportunity. Having 23 television stations gives us a nice boost in that area with folks who understand video, who can teach the rest of the organization about that and who can share video in a much more meaningful way than if we just simply had publishing assets. So you're absolutely right, those are areas that we are all very focused on, areas that we are spending a lot of the time and investment on and areas that we see as propelling -- helping to propel our growth into the future."

I'm pleased you're able to join us today. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with me, and together we will be discussing our first quarter results and an update on the integrated growth strategy and cash flow-funded capital programs that we unveiled at our Investor Day in February. Bob Dickey, President of U.S. Community Publishing, is also here and will discuss early progress on our new content subscription model. 
The strategy and capital allocation plan we discussed 8 weeks ago defines the path we are taking to position Gannett for success in the digital age and reflects the financial discipline underpinning all of our work. As we explained in February, we are executing an ambitious but achievable plan to revitalize our company. The media landscape is evolving rapidly, and we intend to be a leader in a reshaped industry. We expect the work currently going on across the company, as well as our continuing plans, will put Gannett on a sustainable growth trajectory and enable us to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders by 2015. 
Now let me begin by turning to the first quarter. And as expected and as we shared with you at our Investor Day, our results were impacted by the uneven and somewhat sluggish U.S. economic recovery, a particularly challenging start in January for advertising overall and the planned investments we made in growth initiatives that we will detail in a few moments. On track with our forecasted EPS, total revenue was approximately 3% lower than a year ago and total expenses, excluding special items, were basically unchanged. Earnings per share in the quarter, when adjusted for special items, were $0.34, which exceeds the $0.28 to $0.32 range we provided on Investor Day, as well as the First Call consensus, in part due to slightly lower-than-expected spending on strategic investments this quarter. 
As we said in February, the investments we are making this year in our growth strategy would be front-loaded. In this quarter, again, we invested about $20 million of the expected $65 million outlay we will make this year. Our results also reflect higher pension expense, which we also previously discussed, and several special items. 
Each of our business segments had solid performances this quarter. We continue to generate substantial free cash flow, which we will use to return capital to shareholders, to self-fund our growth strategy and to continue to pay down debt. Operating income from the quarter, excluding special items, was approximately $157 million, and operating cash flow was $204 million. These numbers included the impact of the investments in our strategic initiatives. And by the way, the initiative investments had about 150 basis point impact on our operating margins overall. That also translates to a 200 basis point impact on the operating margin in the Publishing segment and a 100 basis point impact on the already terrific margins in Broadcasting. 
Our Digital and Broadcasting segments, both of which experienced growth, accounted for about 50% of this quarter's operating income, excluding special items and the initiative investment. Digital had solid revenue growth of about 7% and Broadcasting, about 8%. These revenue results were offset again by continuing soft advertising demand in Publishing. The 7% revenue growth in our Digital segment resulted in revenue of $168 million in this segment this quarter. CareerBuilder again represented the lion's share of this segment's revenue and again led the way with gains of over 10% over last year. CareerBuilder is the clear North American market leader, and better execution than their competitors allowed them to capture market share again this quarter. Additionally, CareerBuilder had significant growth in its international business, and expansion in selected markets remains a key area of focus. 
Our outlook for the remainder of the year for CareerBuilder is very promising. As you know, Gannett's Digital revenues occur across the company and aren't just reported in our Digital segment. Revenues from Digital products and services, including our Digital Marketing Services offerings, are reflected in our Publishing and Broadcast segment results as well. 
In the Publishing segment, for example, Digital revenue was up about 13% in the first quarter, with display advertising in the auto, employment and retail categories leading the way. Digital revenue in just U.S. Community Publishing alone grew by approximately 11% over last year. Our Digital Marketing Services offerings that I'll talk more about in a few minutes are beginning to make a contribution to Publishing, and we expect to rapidly expand that as we move forward. Reported Digital revenue was up about 25% at USA TODAY and its associated businesses and over 6% in pounds at Newsquest. This growth is a positive development and a measurable example of how our Publishing business is evolving. If we look at Gannett's Digital revenue in the aggregate, first quarter revenue grew by 8% and totaled $273 million company-wide or approximately 22% of our total company-wide revenue. 
Now let me turn to Broadcast for a moment. There, revenues were up 7.5%. And in television, all cylinders were firing. We benefited from stronger core advertising demand, particularly auto spending and the impact of the Super Bowl on our NBC affiliates and primary season political spending. In addition, retrans in Digital were also important contributors to revenue growth. In Broadcasting and television, we are looking forward to a strong second quarter and second half from them, driven by the Summer Olympics in July and August and political spending, roughly 80% of which typically occurs between Labor Day and Election Day in presidential election years. 
In Publishing, we continue to be impacted by the industry's secular decline that we have talked about previously. First quarter revenue declined approximately 6% year-over-year. January was the softest month of the quarter and was consistent with industry-wide performance. Performance improved in February and again in March. In fact, the average of ad revenue comparisons in the Publishing segment in February and March combined was better than fourth quarter comparisons. Drilling down into the categories, classified advertising comparisons in the first quarter improved relative to the fourth quarter. And at U.S. Community Publishing, employment advertising revenue in March was flat for print-only and, of course, was in positive territory for print and online combined. 
The ongoing volatility and softness in the national advertising environment was most notable at USA TODAY. USA TODAY is an iconic brand with tremendous value and visibility. But that volatility has impacted its performance. We know we can do better in growing the business to match the scale and power of the brand. To remind you, USA TODAY has historically made up less than 10% of our revenues and continues to be a small contributor to overall cash flow results as it has historically been. That fact actually says a lot about the strength and diversity in our business and about the significant upside opportunity in USA TODAY in a more digital era. We are working to more fully realize its potential as we approach the brand's 30th anniversary in September. Our priority right now is to recruit a top-notch publisher to advance the promising initiatives already underway and grow the business by spearheading USA TODAY's continuing evolution into a leading multiplatform media brand. 
Turning to the U.K. Newsquest results continue to reflect that challenging economic environment as total revenue and local currency was down about 6%. But I will tell you that our results were stronger by far than any other regional publisher in the U.K. National advertising was positive in the quarter and up solidly in February and March. Expenses were well controlled and declined in the quarter in line with revenue. As a result, Newsquest profits were down just 3% for the quarter and up in March compared to the same period last year in pounds. 
Now I'd like to shift gears and spend the next few minutes updating you on our growth strategy. To quickly summarize, our blueprint for growth is based on Gannett's 3 distinct advantages. The first is our hometown advantage, the deep understanding of and presence in the communities we serve. We can't say this enough. The knowledge we've accumulated and our strong relationships with consumers and local businesses are the bedrock of our plan. Next is what we call our brand advantage. Gannett's iconic national brands like USA TODAY and CareerBuilder and our more than 100 trusted local brands give us excellent platforms to build new businesses and offerings. And of course, the third is our financial advantage. Even during the worst economic times in our country, we paid down debt and kept our balance sheet strong. Financial discipline is one of our hallmarks, and because of it, we are in position to utilize our strong cash flow to fund our growth plan while returning significant capital to our shareholders. 
Each of these advantages is fundamental to our planning and crucial to our future. Our integrated plan is already well underway. And as we discussed, we are expecting to begin to see results by the end of the year. First off, we are working to stabilize our Publishing business, which we continue to believe is integral to our success and a business that remains very profitable for us. I want to remind you, however, that this particular effort is not a quick fix. This isn't a 1- or 2-quarter solution. Rather, it is a continuous effort, which is going to begin to show results later this year. We'll build on the impact of it over the next few years, and then we will fully realize the benefits of all that we are doing in 2015 and beyond. And at the same time, we are focused on continuing to build on the growth of our Broadcasting and Digital segments. Secondly, we've been hard at work to accelerate growth by entering or expanding into new, high-potential-related businesses where we have a hometown and a brand advantage. I'm going to highlight a few of those in a moment, and Bob Dickey will also talk about the third. And thirdly, we continue to focus this quarter on optimizing our assets without sacrificing our strong financial profile. 
Now I know that many of you were at our Investor Day or followed along on the webcast, so I'm not obviously going to do a full strategy review this morning. But I do encourage those of you who weren't able to participate to visit the Investor Relations section of our website and review the presentations. And please don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any questions. 
I'd like to now update you on 2 of the higher-visibility initiatives we have underway: the USA TODAY Sports Media Group and our Digital Marketing Services initiative. In a few minutes, Bob Dickey will also update you on the progress of the third, U.S. Community Publishing's all-access paid content subscription model. I believe our sports initiative meets all the criteria of being a big transformative idea. It all starts with Gannett's existing and impressive national, regional and local sports resources. From in-depth high school and college sports coverage to the national and professional sports scene to showcase events, like the Kentucky Derby, auto racing and the Olympics, Gannett is a sports news and information powerhouse. Our strategic sports initiative is our plan to take our sports business to the next level by building out our portfolio. 
In November, we acquired MMAjunkie.com, the premier mixed martial arts site. In doing so, we tapped into a younger-skewing, rapidly growing national sports phenomenon with absolutely rabid fans that generate 12 million page views on MMAJ [ph] per month. In January, we acquired Fantasy Sports Ventures, including Big Lead Sports, which at the time was the largest independent digital sports property in North America. In February, we announced a joint venture with MLB Advanced Media, Major League Baseball's interactive media and Internet company. These acquisitions, along with partnerships with NASCAR, the PGA and others, have put Gannett on the path towards category leadership. 
We set our sights on becoming a top 5 digital sports property from being 17th when all of these activities were initially conceived. And in early March, we reached our goal when we announced that comScore had named USA TODAY Sports Media Group the fourth most-visited digital sports entity in its February and March rankings, and there's more to come. This was exciting news that comes with more than just pride and some bragging rights. USA TODAY Sports Media Group had almost 24 million unique visitors in March. That size audience, particularly with such a well-defined demographic, opens up important new local and national advertising and e-commerce revenue streams for us. Thanks in large part to our digital reach, we are now deeply involved in tickets, memorabilia and sporting goods sales. 
And it is also -- I'm sorry, the second strategic initiative I want to discuss today is Digital Marketing Services. DMS is an exciting growth opportunity to put our hometown and brand advantages to work for the 150,000-plus merchants who have been turning to Gannett for years, and in some cases, decades to help them reach their customers. And it is also a great opportunity for new customers who want the advantage of quality one-stop shopping product sets. The local advertising market is huge, projected to be $149 billion per year by 2015. Marketing and services are the largest pieces of the pie. And within that, the sweet spot is Digital Marketing Services, which are projected to reach nearly $38 billion annually by 2015. And daily deals, digital coupons and social media marketing, being among the fastest-growing areas in that niche. Digital Marketing Services is a new, sizable opportunity that is additive to our existing display advertising and other digital revenue streams. We are keenly aware that digital marketing is a fast-track opportunity that we are pursuing with a great sense of urgency. We are uniquely positioned to profitably capture significant new business in search engine optimization and marketing, social media and Web design. These are important to our clients' success, and we have the know-how to deliver turnkey solutions. 
In addition to capability, we have one thing that no one else has. The digital world is changing fast and business owners are looking for a trusted partner to help figure out how to take full advantage of the opportunity, and that's where we come in. That's Gannett's opportunity. Our advertisers know and trust us. We know our clients and the communities better than anyone, and so we are perfectly suited to be an end-to-end provider of digital solutions and services for these businesses. We have sales staff already on the ground, established brands and relationships in place, and we have growing capabilities to enable us to structure and sell packaged solutions for advertisers and marketers in our 100-plus local communities. And we are selling packaged solutions. We are not just evolving into a consulting business. We're getting paid to design and deliver advertising campaigns and programs. In addition, we have robust promotional capabilities over the air and in print. Our Web- and mobile-based portfolio and capabilities are significant and growing. Having these capabilities available from a trusted, knowledgeable, truly local source, we believe, gives us that advantage that we plan to exploit to the maximum. 
So who's buying these services and what does a Gannett solution look like? Let me just give you one recent example. Our folks in Phoenix worked with a retailer that was a long-term customer and relied on traditional print media that included us and Yellow Pages. They wanted to make a change but were confused and frustrated by the complexity of digital options. They came to us because of our strong relationship, and we implemented a digital solution focused on search optimization, pay-per-click and click-to-call and mobile. We also improved the customer experience on their website and built out the digital back-end of their business to increase Web traffic. The results for our customer speak for themselves: a ranking of 1 or 2 for all targeted keywords, a 500% increase in daily Web visits, generating more revenue via both traditional media and a 42% conversion rate on their digital ad. Now the measurement criteria may be a bit different than many are used to, but we can all understand the outcome. Using new tools, Gannett was able to help the client be successful. In the process, we strengthened our overall relationship with a more-than-satisfied customer as well. And the customer gained and we gained more profitable revenue we wouldn't have had a year ago. 
During the first quarter, we continued rolling out our Digital Marketing Services in our top markets and have an aggressive program in place to continue to build it out. As we ramp up these efforts, we anticipate full year DMS revenues in the range of $75 million to $100 million this year.  As we move through 2012, we will continue to leverage our strong local media franchises and iconic national brands and deliver our valued content to customers across multiple platforms while providing innovative solutions for our advertisers. Let me emphasize, our strategy is not a quick fix. It is a well thought-out roadmap to growth. We are confident in our strategy for growth and our ability to deliver significant capital to shareholders. 
Now on that note, let me turn the call over to Bob Dickey to discuss one of the most important initiatives underway to revitalize U.S. Community Publishing, our new, all-access content subscription model. We know this effort is of particular importance and interest to all of you, and we want to share some of the very early feedback we've been receiving as we roll the new model out to our local markets. Bob?"

As Gracia pointed out, we are in the very early stages with our test sites, but I remain optimistic our approach will indeed help stabilize U.S. Community Publishing. Let me share some of these early results. 
In March, which was our first full month [indiscernible] the year-over-year circulation revenue gains ranging from 20% to 37%. Across the entire test group combined, revenues increased 29% year-over-year.  St. Cloud and Wilmington were our top-performing markets. Recently, we received many questions about the potential impact on advertising revenues. I'm happy to report that the test sites executed all of their digital campaigns in March. We are successfully communicating with our local advertisers so they understand how we are working to provide them a more engaged consumer. 
The test sites' total advertising revenues were 2 percentage points better than the USCP average in March. Preprint and digital revenues were impacted less than projected in our business model. 5 of our 6 markets have successfully sold sponsorships with their smartphones and tablet apps. 40% of sponsorship revenue is coming from new customers. Combined, the test sites posted year-over-year digital revenue growth. Utilizing the meter approach, we've been able to test various levels and feel comfortable that we are understanding where to set the meter. It remains very early in the billing cycle, but our March 13-week retentions improved slightly year-over-year for the test sites and is just above the USCP average. This is led by successful conversion programs to our EasyPay plan, and that is helping drive the retention. In just 6 weeks, we have seen an increase of 2 to 5 percentage points in the test markets. 
EasyPay in some of the test markets now exceeds 60% of our total subscribers and is growing. In every market, we outperformed our projections for circulation volumes. Daily and Sunday home delivery and Daily single-copy declines are below projections, while Sunday single-copy declines are as projected in the markets we move to $3 and better-than-expected in our $2 markets. As a result, we're doing further analysis to determine the best possible price point as we roll out future sites. 
After 6 weeks, we are currently at 50% of our annual goal for digital subscriptions in these test markets, and we're confident we'll exceed these early projections. Based on local market research, we are charging between $9 and $15 per month for our digital-only subscriptions. The good news is our new digital subscribers index younger, male, married with children and more affluent than we first realized, filling an important audience gap for us. Our investment in new technology is providing a much better consumer experience as they manage their accounts. As a result, customers are activating their accounts at a much faster pace than the first test sites, and we're already 35% to our annual goal. 
As we outlined at Investor Day, this new subscription model offers us the ability to reinvest in our local markets and provide better customer service across Gannett. To date, we have hired over 100 employees to enhance our customer service centers, consumer marketing efforts and to provide more unique local content. Those investments, in conjunction with the creation of Gannett Publishing Services, provided us the resources and the expertise to move quickly and successfully into these test markets. We remain committed to this model, and as Gracia pointed out, it focuses on the value of our content and the strength of our local brands. Our next wave of 17 sites takes place beginning May 1. I'm very confident based on the early results that we will continue to execute at the highest possible level going forward. Thank you."
20571,183391637,284373,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2012",2012-04-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Well, thank you, Bob. I'll provide some additional detail on the quarterly results for each of our business segments and cover some items from the balance sheet.

I'll provide some additional detail on the quarterly results for each of our business segments and cover some items from the balance sheet. Operating revenues in the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion. Total expenses, excluding special items, totaled $1.1 billion, relatively unchanged year-over-year despite about $20 million of investment in initiatives and about $6 million in higher pension expense. Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.28. Earning per diluted share, excluding special items, were $0.34. We recorded net special items in the first quarter related to facility consolidations and workforce restructuring that totaled approximately $21 million pretax or about $0.06 per share, as detailed on Table 3 of our earnings release. 
Now let me quickly cover those in more detail. First, we recorded pretax facility consolidation charges of approximately $5 million or about $0.01 per share that reflected primarily accelerated depreciation costs associated with the transfer of production activities for The Cincinnati Enquirer to a third-party printer in Columbus, Ohio. That's the move that was announced in the fourth quarter of last year. As previously disclosed, similar levels of accelerated depreciation will be recorded in the second and third quarters until the move is completed. Second, we recorded pretax workforce restructuring charges of just over $16 million or about $0.04 per share that related primarily to an early retirement offer program we announced for U.S. Community Publishing employees during the quarter. 
Turning to our segment results. In our Publishing segment, revenues were $874 million, down 6% in the quarter, reflecting an 8% decline in advertising revenue while circulation was about 2% lower. Advertising demands firmed during the quarter but not enough to mitigate a slow start to the year. Ad demand in January was soft across all categories, particularly the retail and national categories which experienced double-digit declines. Comparison narrowed significantly within the quarter, and all ad categories were down in the mid-single-digit in March. 
In the quarter, retail and classified advertising were down 8% and 7%, respectively, and national advertising was 13% lower. Retail advertising at our domestic operations was 7% lower for the quarter. However, result improved sequentially in the quarter, and year-over-year comparisons for March were almost 7 percentage points better than comparisons in January. 
Retail advertising at Newsquest in pounds declined over 6%, reflecting a soft economic environment in the U.K. Our national advertising for the Publishing segment was down 13% in the quarter but improved sequentially during the quarter. In our domestic Publishing operations, the difference from January to March was almost 13 percentage points. 
As Gracia noted, USA TODAY has been impacted by soft national advertising. Increases in the technology and advocacy categories were more than offset by declines in several categories, including entertainment, telecom, auto and financial. At Newsquest, national advertising was up over 2% in local currency. This has been a bright spot for Newsquest since the second quarter of last year. 
Classified advertising was about 6.5% lower for the Publishing segment but better than fourth quarter comparisons. In the U.S., classified advertising revenues were approximately 6% lower but were also better than the fourth quarter. We saw improvements in almost all of the classified categories in the first quarter relative to the fourth. 
Employment in the U.S., although down marginally in the quarter, improved within the quarter and finished up over 3 percentage -- 3% in March compared with the prior year. Real estate classified advertising was down in the quarter, but results improved again during the quarter. A continuing trend we identified in the fourth quarter, the states most impacted by the real estate crisis, California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada had real estate results in line with the rest of our markets, but employment and auto advertising trends were better for properties outside these states. 
Looking at our domestic result across regions. Our West and Midwest regions outperformed our Northeast and South regions in the first quarter. Publishing properties in the West performed particularly well, given that they were cycling a strong performance in the first quarter of last year. The Midwest also showed improvement, excluding the upper Midwest, which was up against challenging comparisons due to the Super Bowl spending in Wisconsin last year. In the Northeast, our New York locations shows substantial improvements in the quarter, while New Jersey still lags. And in the South, results have been mixed, with the highlight being Florida, which appears to be on an upward swing. 
Now Gracia covered the digital revenue results in the Publishing segment in some detail. The growth rates of digital revenue in the segment continues to be a bright spot as we explain our digital marketing -- as we expand our digital marketing capabilities and the solutions we can provide to advertisers. Publishing expenses excluding special items declined over 1% in the quarter and were down 3.4%, excluding $18 million in initiative investments. Newsprint expense declined 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 7% consumption decline, which was partially offset by a 1% increase in usage prices year-over-year. 
Now let me comment briefly on the newsprint market. Our newsprint prices remain stable throughout the quarter. But the combined impact of softening demand internationally, new supply options that entered in the market in the first quarter and a recent announcement that a major mill will restart in the second quarter all point to a more favorable pricing environment. 
Focusing for a moment on the Publishing segment profitability that's shown on Table 4. Operating income in the Publishing segment was $85 million, excluding special items of $23 million. Now the $85 million reflects $18 million of initiative investments. Therefore, if you exclude special items and strategic initiative investments, operating margins for the Publishing segment would have been about 460 basis point higher in the quarter. 
Now let me give you a quick update on Gannett Publishing Services. As we previously disclosed, we expect to benefit from our consolidation of domestic printing and distribution capabilities into Gannett Publishing Services to be approximately $40 million this year. The savings consists of streamlining our management structure, optimizing our capacity and network capability, consolidating purchasing and leveraging sourcing opportunities. And we are on track to deliver the majority of our targeted savings in the second half of the year. 
Turning to the Broadcasting segment. Total television revenues were 8% higher in the quarter, driven in part by strong auto advertising both locally and nationally, and advertising related to the Super Bowl and political spending of $5.1 million. Retransmission revenues totaled $23 million in the quarter, an increase of 17% from the first quarter of last year. Online revenues were 6% higher. Total adjusted television revenues, defined to exclude the incremental impact of even-year political ad demand, were up 5.6%. Now based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total television revenues for the second quarter of 2012 to be in the high single-digits compared with the second quarter of 2011. 
Broadcasting segment expenses were up approximately 3%. Excluding strategic investment of approximately $2 million, operating expenses were up 1.5%. Operating income totaled about $73 million in the quarter, an increase of over 14% from the first quarter last year. Excluding investment in initiatives, the operating margin for Broadcasting would have been about 100 basis points higher, and operating cash flow was up over 12% to $80 million. 
Our Digital segment revenues were about 7% higher in the quarter, driven by another strong performance by CareerBuilder, which was up 10%. Operating expenses in the Digital segment were up about 7.5% due to higher sales and marketing costs at CareerBuilder. Operating income and operating cash flow in the Digital segment were $16 million and $24 million, respectively. 
Now in February if you recall, we announced a new capital allocation plan that included 150% dividend increase to $0.80 per share on an annual basis and a new $300 million share repurchase authorization targeted to be completed over the next 2 years. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares at a cost of $35.5 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.67 billion of debt outstanding, a reduction of $95 million during the quarter. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities, was about 1.7x at the end of the quarter. 
Interest expense in the first quarter was $7 million lower than the first quarter of last year, due primarily to lower average debt balances. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.7%. Cash at quarter end was $157 million and capital expenditures in the first quarter were about $18 million. Now free cash flow in the quarter totaled $148 million after a $54 million contribution to our pension plan. 
Now finally before I open it up for questions, I wanted to remind you that similar to this quarter, we expect the second quarter to reflect continued investments in our strategic initiatives and higher pension expense. Initiative investment is expected to total $30 million in the second quarter. The increase in pension expenses will be $24 million for the entire year, so the expense next quarter will be in line with the first quarter and will be about $6 million. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions."

Overall, as we indicated, our advertising comparisons got much better as the first quarter went on. And like many others, I think January was a slow month. But clearly, we accelerated through February and March. And as I said earlier, our average for February and March was better than what we did in the fourth quarter. So starting out of the blocks, we currently anticipate that the second quarter will be much more like the way we ended the first quarter rather than the sluggishness that we obviously saw in January. On the television side, I don't think that our guidance is implying that core business will be a little softer. Obviously, we don't have the Super Bowl, which helped a little bit in the first quarter on our NBC affiliates. Political, I think we'll see how that all plays out, but I don't think we're looking for heroic political numbers in the second quarter. Frankly, as we mentioned, about 80% of our political dollars are garnered between Labor Day and Election Day. So usually, the first and second quarters are not a significant political opportunity. So I think our core businesses hanging in there quite well. I look at auto and auto pacings, I think, are up in the 20% plus range for Broadcasting. Obviously, a little bit of that is in comparison to the last year's second quarter when we had, towards the end of the quarter, the impact of the Japanese tsunami. But we also had, absent the auto side, up revenues in Broadcasting last year in the second quarter. So in no way does that guidance imply that we expect core revenues to be softer. I think frankly where we sit today, we only really have good pacings for April and into May. I think June, we'll have to see. I think Dave Lougee, when we talk to him, he thinks that there is potential for some upside to the June pacings that we're obviously having just very early glances on right at the moment. Newsquest, I think, will continue to do a good job and continue to outpace their regional competition in the U.K. So overall, I'd say the comment is again that the second quarter is starting out, and we expect it to be much more like the way we finished the first quarter than the January aberration."

Obviously, we are heartened by the fact that it appears that the presidential fundraising and the presidential election is finally getting underway in a very big way. And if you listen to any of the pundits about the kind of spending that is going to occur this year, it is going to be potentially unprecedented. We will be the beneficiary of that as it rolls out, but it will be primarily in that Labor Day to Election Day period where we see the vast majority of that.

I'm pleased you're able to join us today. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with me, and together we will be discussing our first quarter results and an update on the integrated growth strategy and",2952,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased you're able to join us today. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with me, and together we will be discussing our first quarter results and an update on the integrated growth strategy and cash flow-funded capital programs that we unveiled at our Investor Day in February. Bob Dickey, President of U.S. Community Publishing, is also here and will discuss early progress on our new content subscription model. 
The strategy and capital allocation plan we discussed 8 weeks ago defines the path we are taking to position Gannett for success in the digital age and reflects the financial discipline underpinning all of our work. As we explained in February, we are executing an ambitious but achievable plan to revitalize our company. The media landscape is evolving rapidly, and we intend to be a leader in a reshaped industry. We expect the work currently going on across the company, as well as our continuing plans, will put Gannett on a sustainable growth trajectory and enable us to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders by 2015. 
Now let me begin by turning to the first quarter. And as expected and as we shared with you at our Investor Day, our results were impacted by the uneven and somewhat sluggish U.S. economic recovery, a particularly challenging start in January for advertising overall and the planned investments we made in growth initiatives that we will detail in a few moments. On track with our forecasted EPS, total revenue was approximately 3% lower than a year ago and total expenses, excluding special items, were basically unchanged. Earnings per share in the quarter, when adjusted for special items, were $0.34, which exceeds the $0.28 to $0.32 range we provided on Investor Day, as well as the First Call consensus, in part due to slightly lower-than-expected spending on strategic investments this quarter. 
As we said in February, the investments we are making this year in our growth strategy would be front-loaded. In this quarter, again, we invested about $20 million of the expected $65 million outlay we will make this year. Our results also reflect higher pension expense, which we also previously discussed, and several special items. 
Each of our business segments had solid performances this quarter. We continue to generate substantial free cash flow, which we will use to return capital to shareholders, to self-fund our growth strategy and to continue to pay down debt. Operating income from the quarter, excluding special items, was approximately $157 million, and operating cash flow was $204 million. These numbers included the impact of the investments in our strategic initiatives. And by the way, the initiative investments had about a 150-basis-point impact on our operating margins overall. That also translates to a 200-basis-point impact on the operating margin in the Publishing segment and a 100-basis-point impact on the already terrific margins in Broadcasting. 
Our Digital and Broadcasting segments, both of which experienced growth, accounted for about 50% of this quarter's operating income, excluding special items and the initiative investment. Digital had solid revenue growth of about 7% and Broadcasting, about 8%. These revenue results were offset again by continuing soft advertising demand in Publishing. The 7% revenue growth in our Digital segment resulted in revenue of $168 million in the segment this quarter. CareerBuilder again represented the lion's share of this segment's revenue and again led the way with gains of over 10% over last year. CareerBuilder is the clear North American market leader, and better execution than their competitors allowed them to capture market share again this quarter. Additionally, CareerBuilder had significant growth in its international business, and expansion in selected markets remains a key area of focus. 
Our outlook for the remainder of the year for CareerBuilder is very promising. As you know, Gannett's Digital revenues occur across the company and aren't just reported in our Digital segment. Revenues from Digital products and services, including our Digital Marketing Services offerings, are reflected in our Publishing and Broadcast segment results as well. 
In the Publishing segment, for example, Digital revenue was up about 13% in the first quarter, with display advertising in the auto, employment and retail categories leading the way. Digital revenue in just U.S. Community Publishing alone grew by approximately 11% over last year. Our Digital Marketing Services offerings that I'll talk more about in a few minutes are beginning to make a contribution to Publishing, and we expect to rapidly expand that as we move forward. Reported Digital revenue was up about 25% at USA TODAY and its associated businesses and over 6% in pounds at Newsquest. This growth is a positive development and a measurable example of how our Publishing business is evolving. If we look at Gannett's Digital revenue in the aggregate, first quarter revenue grew by 8% and totaled $273 million company-wide or approximately 22% of our total company-wide revenue. 
Now let me turn to Broadcast for a moment. There, revenues were up 7.5%. And in television, all cylinders were firing. We benefited from stronger core advertising demand, particularly auto spending and the impact of the Super Bowl on our NBC affiliates and primary season political spending. In addition, retrans in Digital were also important contributors to revenue growth. In Broadcasting and television, we are looking forward to a strong second quarter and second half from them, driven by the Summer Olympics in July and August and political spending, roughly 80% of which typically occurs between Labor Day and Election Day in Presidential election years. 
In Publishing, we continue to be impacted by the industry's secular decline that we have talked about previously. First quarter revenue declined approximately 6% year-over-year. January was the softest month of the quarter and was consistent with industry-wide performance. Performance improved in February and again in March. In fact, the average of ad revenue comparisons in the Publishing segment in February and March combined was better than fourth quarter comparisons. Drilling down into the categories, classified advertising comparisons in the first quarter improved relative to the fourth quarter. And at U.S. Community Publishing, employment advertising revenue in March was flat for print only and, of course, was in positive territory for print and online combined. 
The ongoing volatility and softness in the national advertising environment was most notable at USA TODAY. USA TODAY is an iconic brand with tremendous value and visibility. But that volatility has impacted its performance. We know we can do better in growing the business to match the scale and power of the brand. To remind you, USA TODAY has historically made up less than 10% of our revenues and continues to be a small contributor to overall cash flow results as it has historically been. That fact actually says a lot about the strength and diversity in our business and about the significant upside opportunity in USA TODAY in a more digital era. We are working to more fully realize its potential as we approach the brand's 30th anniversary in September. Our priority right now is to recruit a top-notch publisher to advance the promising initiatives already underway and grow the business by spearheading USA TODAY's continuing evolution into a leading multiplatform media brand. 
Turning to the U.K., Newsquest results continue to reflect that challenging economic environment as total revenue in local currency was down about 6%. But I will tell you that our results were stronger by far than any other regional publisher in the U.K. National advertising was positive in the quarter and up solidly in February and March. Expenses were well controlled and declined in the quarter in line with revenue. As a result, Newsquest profits were down just 3% for the quarter and up in March compared to the same period last year in pounds. 
Now I'd like to shift gears and spend the next few minutes updating you on our growth strategy. To quickly summarize, our blueprint for growth is based on Gannett's 3 distinct advantages. The first is our hometown advantage, the deep understanding of and presence in the communities we serve. We can't say this enough. The knowledge we've accumulated and our strong relationships with consumers and local businesses are the bedrock of our plan. Next is what we call our brand advantage. Gannett's iconic national brands like USA TODAY and CareerBuilder and our more than 100 trusted local brands give us excellent platforms to build new businesses and offerings. And of course, the third is our financial advantage. Even during the worst economic times in our country, we paid down debt and kept our balance sheet strong. Financial discipline is one of our hallmarks, and because of it, we are in position to utilize our strong cash flow to fund our growth plan while returning significant capital to our shareholders. 
Each of these advantages is fundamental to our planning and crucial to our future. Our integrated plan is already well underway. And as we discussed, we are expecting to begin to see results by the end of the year. First off, we are working to stabilize our Publishing business, which we continue to believe is integral to our success and a business that remains very profitable for us. I want to remind you, however, that this particular effort is not a quick fix. This isn't a 1- or 2-quarter solution. Rather, it is a continuous effort, which is going to begin to show results later this year. We'll build on the impact of it over the next few years, and then we will fully realize the benefits of all that we are doing in 2015 and beyond. And at the same time, we are focused on continuing to build on the growth of our Broadcasting and Digital segments. Secondly, we've been hard at work to accelerate growth by entering or expanding into new, high-potential-related businesses where we have a hometown and a brand advantage. I'm going to highlight a few of those in a moment, and Bob Dickey will also talk about the third. And thirdly, we continue to focus this quarter on optimizing our assets without sacrificing our strong financial profile. 
Now I know that many of you were at our Investor Day or followed along on the webcast, so I'm not obviously going to do a full strategy review this morning. But I do encourage those of you who weren't able to participate to visit the Investor Relations section of our website and review the presentations. And please don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any questions. 
I'd like to now update you on 2 of the higher-visibility initiatives we have underway: the USA TODAY Sports Media Group and our Digital Marketing Services initiative. In a few minutes, Bob Dickey will also update you on the progress of the third, U.S. Community Publishing's all-access paid content subscription model. I believe our sports initiative meets all the criteria of being a big transformative idea. It all starts with Gannett's existing and impressive national, regional and local sports resources. From in-depth high school and college sports coverage to the national and professional sports scene to showcase events, like the Kentucky Derby, auto racing and the Olympics, Gannett is a sports news and information powerhouse. Our strategic sports initiative is our plan to take our sports business to the next level by building out our portfolio. 
In November, we acquired MMAjunkie.com, the premier mixed martial arts site. In doing so, we tapped into a younger-skewing, rapidly growing national sports phenomenon with absolutely rabid fans that generate 12 million page views on MMAJ per month. In January, we acquired Fantasy Sports Ventures, including Big Lead Sports, which at the time was the largest independent digital sports property in North America. In February, we announced a joint venture with MLB Advanced Media, Major League Baseball's interactive media and Internet company. These acquisitions, along with partnerships with NASCAR, the PGA and others, have put Gannett on the path towards category leadership. 
We set our sights on becoming a top 5 digital sports property from being 17th when all of these activities were initially conceived. And in early March, we reached our goal when we announced that comScore had named USA TODAY Sports Media Group the fourth most-visited digital sports entity in its February and March rankings, and there's more to come. This was exciting news that comes with more than just pride and some bragging rights. USA TODAY Sports Media Group had almost 24 million unique visitors in March. That size audience, particularly with such a well-defined demographic, opens up important new local and national advertising and e-commerce revenue streams for us. Thanks in large part to our digital reach, we are now deeply involved in tickets, memorabilia and sporting goods sales. 
And it is also -- I'm sorry, the second strategic initiative I want to discuss today is Digital Marketing Services. DMS is an exciting growth opportunity to put our hometown and brand advantages to work for the 150,000-plus merchants who have been turning to Gannett for years, and in some cases, decades to help them reach their customers. And it is also a great opportunity for new customers who want the advantage of quality one-stop shopping product sets. 
The local advertising market is huge, projected to be $149 billion per year by 2015. Marketing and services are the largest pieces of the pie. And within that, the sweet spot is Digital Marketing Services, which are projected to reach nearly $38 billion annually by 2015. And daily deals, digital coupons and social media marketing, being among the fastest-growing areas in that niche. Digital Marketing Services is a new, sizable opportunity that is additive to our existing display advertising and other digital revenue streams. We are keenly aware that digital marketing is a fast-track opportunity that we are pursuing with a great sense of urgency. We are uniquely positioned to profitably capture significant new business in search engine optimization and marketing, social media and Web design. These are important to our clients' success, and we have the know-how to deliver turnkey solutions. 
In addition to capability, we have one thing that no one else has. The digital world is changing fast and business owners are looking for a trusted partner to help figure out how to take full advantage of the opportunity, and that's where we come in. That's Gannett's opportunity. Our advertisers know and trust us. We know our clients and the communities better than anyone, and so we are perfectly suited to be an end-to-end provider of digital solutions and services for these businesses. We have sales staff already on the ground, established brands and relationships in place, and we have growing capabilities to enable us to structure and sell packaged solutions for advertisers and marketers in our 100-plus local communities. And we are selling packaged solutions. We are not just evolving into a consulting business. We're getting paid to design and deliver advertising campaigns and programs. In addition, we have robust promotional capabilities over the air and in print. Our Web- and mobile-based portfolio and capabilities are significant and growing. Having these capabilities available from a trusted, knowledgeable, truly local source, we believe, gives us that advantage that we plan to exploit to the maximum. 
So who's buying these services and what does a Gannett solution look like? Let me just give you one recent example. Our folks in Phoenix worked with a retailer that was a long-term customer and relied on traditional print media that included us and Yellow Pages. They wanted to make a change but were confused and frustrated by the complexity of digital options. They came to us because of our strong relationship, and we implemented a digital solution focused on search optimization, pay-per-click and click-to-call and mobile. We also improved the customer experience on their website and built out the digital back end of their business to increase Web traffic. The results for our customer speak for themselves: a ranking of 1 or 2 for all targeted keywords, a 500% increase in daily Web visits, generating more revenue via both traditional media and a 42% conversion rate on their digital ad. 
Now the measurement criteria may be a bit different than many are used to, but we can all understand the outcome. Using new tools, Gannett was able to help the client be successful. In the process, we strengthened our overall relationship with a more-than-satisfied customer as well. And the customer gained and we gained more profitable revenue we wouldn't have had a year ago. 
During the first quarter, we continued rolling out our Digital Marketing Services in our top markets and have an aggressive program in place to continue to build it out. As we ramp up these efforts, we anticipate full-year DMS revenues in the range of $75 million to $100 million this year.  As we move through 2012, we will continue to leverage our strong local media franchises and iconic national brands and deliver our valued content to customers across multiple platforms while providing innovative solutions for our advertisers. Let me emphasize, our strategy is not a quick fix. It is a well-thought-out roadmap to growth. We are confident in our strategy for growth and our ability to deliver significant capital to shareholders. 
Now on that note, let me turn the call over to Bob Dickey to discuss one of the most important initiatives underway to revitalize U.S. Community Publishing: our new, all-access content subscription model. We know this effort is of particular importance and interest to all of you, and we want to share some of the very early feedback we've been receiving as we roll the new model out to our local markets. Bob?"

As Gracia pointed out, we are in the very early stages with our test sites, but I remain optimistic our approach will indeed help stabilize U.S. Community Publishing. Let me share some of those early results. 
In March, which was our first full month [indiscernible] the year-over-year circulation revenue gains ranging from 20% to 37%. Across the entire test group combined, revenues increased 29% year-over-year.  St. Cloud and Wilmington were our top-performing markets. Recently, we received many questions about the potential impact on advertising revenues. I'm happy to report that the test sites executed all of their digital campaigns in March. We are successfully communicating with our local advertisers so they understand how we are working to provide them a more engaged consumer. 
The test sites' total advertising revenues were 2 percentage points better than the USCP average in March. Preprint and digital revenues were impacted less than projected in our business model. Five of our 6 markets have successfully sold sponsorships with their smartphones and tablet apps. 40% of sponsorship revenue is coming from new customers. Combined, the test sites posted year-over-year digital revenue growth. 
Utilizing the meter approach, we've been able to test various levels and feel comfortable that we are understanding where to set the meter. It remains very early in the billing cycle, but our March 13-week retention improved slightly year-over-year for the test sites and is just above the USCP average. This is led by successful conversion programs to our EasyPay plan, and that is helping drive the retention. In just 6 weeks, we have seen an increase of 2 to 5 percentage points in the test markets. 
EasyPay in some of the test markets now exceeds 60% of our total subscribers and is growing. In every market, we outperformed our projections for circulation volumes. Daily and Sunday home delivery and Daily single-copy declines are below projections, while Sunday single-copy declines are as projected in the markets we moved to $3 and better-than-expected in our $2 markets. As a result, we're doing further analysis to determine the best possible price point as we roll out future sites. 
After 6 weeks, we are currently at 50% of our annual goal for digital subscriptions in these test markets, and we're confident we'll exceed these early projections. Based on local market research, we are charging between $9 and $15 per month for our digital-only subscriptions. The good news is our new digital subscribers index younger, male, married with children and more affluent than we first realized, filling an important audience gap for us. Our investment in new technology is providing a much better consumer experience as they manage their accounts. As a result, customers are activating their accounts at a much faster pace than the first test sites, and we're already 35% to our annual goal. 
As we outlined at Investor Day, this new subscription model offers us the ability to reinvest in our local markets and provide better customer service across Gannett. To date, we have hired over 100 employees to enhance our customer service centers, consumer marketing efforts and to provide more unique local content. Those investments, in conjunction with the creation of Gannett Publishing Services, provided us the resources and the expertise to move quickly and successfully into these test markets. We remain committed to this model, and as Gracia pointed out, it focuses on the value of our content and the strength of our local brands. Our next wave of 17 sites takes place beginning May 1. I'm very confident based on the early results that we will continue to execute at the highest possible level going forward. Thank you."

I'll provide some additional detail on the quarterly results for each of our business segments and cover some items from the balance sheet. Operating revenues in the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion. Total expenses, excluding",1555,"Well, thank you, Bob. I'll provide some additional detail on the quarterly results for each of our business segments and cover some items from the balance sheet. Operating revenues in the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion. Total expenses, excluding special items, totaled $1.1 billion, relatively unchanged year-over-year despite about $20 million of investment in initiatives and about $6 million in higher pension expense. Earning per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.28. Earning per diluted share, excluding special items, were $0.34. We recorded net special items in the first quarter related to facility consolidations and workforce restructuring that totaled approximately $21 million pretax or about $0.06 per share, as detailed on Table 3 of our earnings release. 
Now let me quickly cover those in more detail. First, we recorded pretax facility consolidation charges of approximately $5 million or about $0.01 per share that reflected primarily accelerated depreciation costs associated with the transfer of production activities for The Cincinnati Enquirer to a third-party printer in Columbus, Ohio. That's the move that was announced in the fourth quarter of last year. As previously disclosed, similar levels of accelerated depreciation will be recorded in the second and third quarters until the move is completed. Second, we recorded pretax workforce restructuring charges of just over $16 million or about $0.04 per share that related primarily to an early retirement offer program we announced for U.S. Community Publishing employees during the quarter. 
Turning to our segment results. In our Publishing segment, revenues were $874 million, down 6% in the quarter, reflecting an 8% decline in advertising revenue while circulation was about 2% lower. Advertising demands firmed during the quarter but not enough to mitigate a slow start to the year. Ad demand in January was soft across all categories, particularly the retail and national categories which experienced double-digit declines. Comparison narrowed significantly within the quarter, and all ad categories were down in the mid-single-digit in March. 
In the quarter, retail and classified advertising were down 8% and 7%, respectively, and national advertising was 13% lower. Retail advertising at our domestic operations was 7% lower for the quarter. However, result improved sequentially in the quarter, and year-over-year comparisons for March were almost 7 percentage points better than comparisons in January. 
Retail advertising at Newsquest in pounds declined over 6%, reflecting a soft economic environment in the U.K. Our national advertising for the Publishing segment was down 13% in the quarter but improved sequentially during the quarter. In our domestic Publishing operations, the difference from January to March was almost 13 percentage points. 
As Gracia noted, USA TODAY has been impacted by soft national advertising. Increases in the technology and advocacy categories were more than offset by declines in several categories, including entertainment, telecom, auto and financial. At Newsquest, national advertising was up over 2% in local currency. This has been a bright spot for Newsquest since the second quarter of last year. 
Classified advertising was about 6.5% lower for the Publishing segment but better than fourth quarter comparisons. In the U.S., classified advertising revenues were approximately 6% lower but were also better than the fourth quarter. We saw improvements in almost all of the classified categories in the first quarter relative to the fourth. 
Employment in the U.S., although down marginally in the quarter, improved within the quarter and finished up over 3 percentage -- 3% in March compared with the prior year. Real estate classified advertising was down in the quarter, but results improved again during the quarter. A continuing trend we identified in the fourth quarter, the states most impacted by the real estate crisis, California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada had real estate results in line with the rest of our markets, but employment and auto advertising trends were better for properties outside these states. 
Looking at our domestic result across regions. Our West and Midwest regions outperformed our Northeast and South regions in the first quarter. Publishing properties in the West performed particularly well, given that they were cycling a strong performance in the first quarter of last year. The Midwest also showed improvement, excluding the upper Midwest, which was up against challenging comparisons due to the Super Bowl spending in Wisconsin last year. In the Northeast, our New York locations showed substantial improvements in the quarter, while New Jersey still lags. And in the South, results have been mixed, with the highlight being Florida, which appears to be on an upward swing. 
Now Gracia covered the digital revenue results in the Publishing segment in some detail. The growth rates of digital revenue in the segment continues to be a bright spot as we explain our digital marketing -- as we expand our digital marketing capabilities and the solutions we can provide to advertisers. Publishing expenses excluding special items declined over 1% in the quarter and were down 3.4%, excluding $18 million in initiative investments. Newsprint expense declined 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 7% consumption decline, which was partially offset by a 1% increase in usage prices year-over-year. 
Now let me comment briefly on the newsprint market. A newsprint prices remained stable throughout the quarter. But the combined impact of softening demand internationally, new supply options that entered in the market in the first quarter and a recent announcement that a major mill will restart in the second quarter all point to a more favorable pricing environment. 
Focusing for a moment on the Publishing segment profitability that's shown on Table 4. Operating income in the Publishing segment was $85 million, excluding special items of $23 million. Now the $85 million reflects $18 million of initiative investments. Therefore, if you exclude special items and strategic initiative investments, operating margins for the Publishing segment would have been about 460 basis point higher in the quarter. 
Now let me give you a quick update on Gannett Publishing Services. As we previously disclosed, we expect to benefit from our consolidation of domestic printing and distribution capabilities into Gannett Publishing Services to be approximately $40 million this year. The savings consists of streamlining our management structure, optimizing our capacity and network capability, consolidating purchasing and leveraging sourcing opportunities. And we are on track to deliver the majority of our targeted savings in the second half of the year. 
Turning to the Broadcasting segment. Total television revenues were 8% higher in the quarter, driven in part by strong auto advertising both locally and nationally, and advertising related to the Super Bowl and political spending of $5.1 million. Retransmission revenues totaled $23 million in the quarter, an increase of 17% from the first quarter of last year. Online revenues were 6% higher. Total adjusted television revenues, defined to exclude the incremental impact of even-year political ad demand, were up 5.6%. Now based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total television revenues for the second quarter of 2012 to be in the high single digits compared with the second quarter of 2011. 
Broadcasting segment expenses were up approximately 3%. Excluding strategic investment of approximately $2 million, operating expenses were up 1.5%. Operating income totaled about $73 million in the quarter, an increase of over 14% from the first quarter last year. Excluding investment in initiatives, the operating margin for Broadcasting would have been about 100 basis point higher, and operating cash flow was up over 12% to $80 million. 
Digital segment revenues were about 7% higher in the quarter, driven by another strong performance by CareerBuilder, which was up 10%. Operating expenses in the Digital segment were up about 7.5% due to higher sales and marketing costs at CareerBuilder. Operating income and operating cash flow in the Digital segment were $16 million and $24 million, respectively. 
Now in February if you recall, we announced a new capital allocation plan that included a 150% dividend increase to $0.80 per share on an annual basis and a new $300 million share repurchase authorization targeted to be completed over the next 2 years. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares at a cost of $35.5 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.67 billion of debt outstanding, a reduction of $95 million during the quarter. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities, was about 1.7x at the end of the quarter. 
Interest expense in the first quarter was $7 million lower than the first quarter of last year, due primarily to lower average debt balances. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.7%. Cash at quarter end was $157 million and capital expenditures in the first quarter were about $18 million. Now free cash flow in the quarter totaled $148 million after a $54 million contribution to our pension plan. 
Now finally before I open it up for questions, I wanted to remind you that similar to this quarter, we expect the second quarter to reflect continued investments in our strategic initiatives and higher pension expense. Initiative investment is expected to total $30 million in the second quarter. The increase in pension expenses will be $24 million for the entire year, so the expense next quarter will be in line with the first quarter and will be about $6 million. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions."

Overall, as we indicated, our advertising comparisons got much better as the first quarter went on. And like many others, I think January was a slow month. But clearly, we accelerated through February and March. And as I said earlier, our average for February and March was better than what we did in the fourth quarter. So starting out of the blocks, we currently anticipate that the second quarter will be much more like the way we ended the first quarter rather than the sluggishness that we obviously saw in January. On the television side, I don't think that our guidance is implying that core business will be a little softer. Obviously, we don't have the Super Bowl, which helped a little bit in the first quarter on our NBC affiliates. Political, I think we'll see how that all plays out, but I don't think we're looking for heroic political numbers in the second quarter. Frankly, as we mentioned, about 80% of our political dollars are garnered between Labor Day and Election Day. So usually, the first and second quarters are not a significant political opportunity. So I think our core business is hanging in there quite well. I look at auto and auto pacings, I think, are up in the 20% plus range for Broadcasting. Obviously, a little bit of that is in comparison to the last year's second quarter when we had, towards the end of the quarter, the impact of the Japanese tsunami. But we also had, absent the auto side, up revenues in Broadcasting last year in the second quarter. So in no way does that guidance imply that we expect core revenues to be softer. I think frankly where we sit today, we only really have good pacings for April and into May. I think June, we'll have to see. I think Dave Lougee, when we talk to him, he thinks that there is potential for some upside to the June pacings that we're obviously having just very early glances on right at the moment. Newsquest, I think, will continue to do a good job and continue to outpace their regional competition in the U.K. So overall, I'd say the comment is again that the second quarter is starting out, and we expect it to be much more like the way we finished the first quarter than the January aberration."

Obviously, we are heartened by the fact that it appears that the presidential fundraising and the presidential election is finally getting underway in a very big way. And if you listen to any of the pundits about the kind of spending that is going to occur this year, it is going to be potentially unprecedented. We will be the beneficiary of that as it rolls out, but it'll be primarily in that Labor Day to Election Day period where we see the vast majority of that.

And the other thing I would mention is video. Again, all of the prognosticators talk about the fact that video growth and dollars that are going to be placed alongside video are going to grow and grow in an outsized way. That's one of the reasons behind the video production center that we have just put in our television station at WXIA in Atlanta that is going to be servicing the entire Gannett organization. We see video as an incredible opportunity. Having 23 television stations gives us a nice boost in that area with folks who understand video, who can teach the rest of the organization about that and who can share video in a much more meaningful way than if we just simply had publishing assets. So you're absolutely right, those are areas that we are all very focused on, areas that we are spending a lot of the time and investment on and areas that we see as propelling -- helping to propel our growth into the future."

I'm pleased you're able to join us today. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with me, and together we will be discussing our first quarter results and an update on the integrated growth strategy and",2953,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased you're able to join us today. Paul Saleh, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with me, and together we will be discussing our first quarter results and an update on the integrated growth strategy and cash flow-funded capital programs that we unveiled at our Investor Day in February. Bob Dickey, President of U.S. Community Publishing, is also here and will discuss early progress on our new content subscription model. 
The strategy and capital allocation plan we discussed 8 weeks ago defines the path we are taking to position Gannett for success in the digital age and reflects the financial discipline underpinning all of our work. As we explained in February, we are executing an ambitious but achievable plan to revitalize our company. The media landscape is evolving rapidly, and we intend to be a leader in a reshaped industry. We expect the work currently going on across the company, as well as our continuing plans, will put Gannett on a sustainable growth trajectory and enable us to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders by 2015. 
Now let me begin by turning to the first quarter. And as expected and as we shared with you at our Investor Day, our results were impacted by the uneven and somewhat sluggish U.S. economic recovery, a particularly challenging start in January for advertising overall and the planned investments we made in growth initiatives that we will detail in a few moments. On track with our forecasted EPS, total revenue was approximately 3% lower than a year ago and total expenses, excluding special items, were basically unchanged. Earnings per share in the quarter, when adjusted for special items, were $0.34, which exceeds the $0.28 to $0.32 range we provided on Investor Day, as well as the First Call consensus, in part due to slightly lower-than-expected spending on strategic investments this quarter. 
As we said in February, the investments we are making this year in our growth strategy would be front-loaded. In this quarter, again, we invested about $20 million of the expected $65 million outlay we will make this year. Our results also reflect higher pension expense, which we also previously discussed, and several special items. 
Each of our business segments had solid performances this quarter. We continue to generate substantial free cash flow, which we will use to return capital to shareholders, to self-fund our growth strategy and to continue to pay down debt. Operating income from the quarter, excluding special items, was approximately $157 million, and operating cash flow was $204 million. These numbers included the impact of the investments in our strategic initiatives. And by the way, the initiative investments had about a 150-basis-point impact on our operating margins overall. That also translates to a 200-basis-point impact on the operating margin in the Publishing segment and a 100-basis-point impact on the already terrific margins in Broadcasting. 
Our Digital and Broadcasting segments, both of which experienced growth, accounted for about 50% of this quarter's operating income, excluding special items and the initiative investment. Digital had solid revenue growth of about 7% and Broadcasting, about 8%. These revenue results were offset again by continuing soft advertising demand in Publishing. The 7% revenue growth in our Digital segment resulted in revenue of $168 million in the segment this quarter. CareerBuilder again represented the lion's share of this segment's revenue and again led the way with gains of over 10% over last year. CareerBuilder is the clear North American market leader, and better execution than their competitors allowed them to capture market share again this quarter. Additionally, CareerBuilder had significant growth in its international business, and expansion in selected markets remains a key area of focus. 
Our outlook for the remainder of the year for CareerBuilder is very promising. As you know, Gannett's Digital revenues occur across the company and aren't just reported in our Digital segment. Revenues from Digital products and services, including our Digital Marketing Services offerings, are reflected in our Publishing and Broadcast segment results as well. 
In the Publishing segment, for example, Digital revenue was up about 13% in the first quarter, with display advertising in the auto, employment and retail categories leading the way. Digital revenue in just U.S. Community Publishing alone grew by approximately 11% over last year. Our Digital Marketing Services offerings that I'll talk more about in a few minutes are beginning to make a contribution to Publishing, and we expect to rapidly expand that as we move forward. Reported Digital revenue was up about 25% at USA TODAY and its associated businesses and over 6% in pounds at Newsquest. This growth is a positive development and a measurable example of how our Publishing business is evolving. If we look at Gannett's Digital revenue in the aggregate, first quarter revenue grew by 8% and totaled $273 million company-wide or approximately 22% of our total company-wide revenue. 
Now let me turn to Broadcast for a moment. There, revenues were up 7.5%. And in television, all cylinders were firing. We benefited from stronger core advertising demand, particularly auto spending and the impact of the Super Bowl on our NBC affiliates and primary season political spending. In addition, retrans in Digital were also important contributors to revenue growth. In Broadcasting and television, we are looking forward to a strong second quarter and second half from them, driven by the Summer Olympics in July and August and political spending, roughly 80% of which typically occurs between Labor Day and Election Day in Presidential election years. 
In Publishing, we continue to be impacted by the industry's secular decline that we have talked about previously. First quarter revenue declined approximately 6% year-over-year. January was the softest month of the quarter and was consistent with industry-wide performance. Performance improved in February and again in March. In fact, the average of ad revenue comparisons in the Publishing segment in February and March combined was better than fourth quarter comparisons. Drilling down into the categories, classified advertising comparisons in the first quarter improved relative to the fourth quarter. And at U.S. Community Publishing, employment advertising revenue in March was flat for print only and, of course, was in positive territory for print and online combined. 
The ongoing volatility and softness in the national advertising environment was most notable at USA TODAY. USA TODAY is an iconic brand with tremendous value and visibility. But that volatility has impacted its performance. We know we can do better in growing the business to match the scale and power of the brand. To remind you, USA TODAY has historically made up less than 10% of our revenues and continues to be a small contributor to overall cash flow results as it has historically been. That fact actually says a lot about the strength and diversity in our business and about the significant upside opportunity in USA TODAY in a more digital era. We are working to more fully realize its potential as we approach the brand's 30th anniversary in September. Our priority right now is to recruit a top-notch publisher to advance the promising initiatives already underway and grow the business by spearheading USA TODAY's continuing evolution into a leading multiplatform media brand. 
Turning to the U.K. Newsquest results continue to reflect that challenging economic environment as total revenue in local currency was down about 6%. But I will tell you that our results were stronger by far than any other regional publisher in the U.K. National advertising was positive in the quarter and up solidly in February and March. Expenses were well controlled and declined in the quarter in line with revenue. As a result, Newsquest profits were down just 3% for the quarter and up in March compared to the same period last year in pounds. 
Now I'd like to shift gears and spend the next few minutes updating you on our growth strategy. To quickly summarize, our blueprint for growth is based on Gannett's 3 distinct advantages. The first is our hometown advantage, the deep understanding of and presence in the communities we serve. We can't say this enough. The knowledge we've accumulated and our strong relationships with consumers and local businesses are the bedrock of our plan. Next is what we call our brand advantage. Gannett's iconic national brands like USA TODAY and CareerBuilder and our more than 100 trusted local brands give us excellent platforms to build new businesses and offerings. And of course, the third is our financial advantage. Even during the worst economic times in our country, we paid down debt and kept our balance sheet strong. Financial discipline is one of our hallmarks, and because of it, we are in position to utilize our strong cash flow to fund our growth plan while returning significant capital to our shareholders. 
Each of these advantages is fundamental to our planning and crucial to our future. Our integrated plan is already well underway. And as we discussed, we are expecting to begin to see results by the end of the year. First off, we are working to stabilize our Publishing business, which we continue to believe is integral to our success and a business that remains very profitable for us. I want to remind you, however, that this particular effort is not a quick fix. This isn't a 1- or 2-quarter solution. Rather, it is a continuous effort, which is going to begin to show results later this year. We'll build on the impact of it over the next few years, and then we will fully realize the benefits of all that we are doing in 2015 and beyond. And at the same time, we are focused on continuing to build on the growth of our Broadcasting and Digital segments. Secondly, we've been hard at work to accelerate growth by entering or expanding into new, high-potential-related businesses where we have a hometown and a brand advantage. I'm going to highlight a few of those in a moment, and Bob Dickey will also talk about the third. And thirdly, we continue to focus this quarter on optimizing our assets without sacrificing our strong financial profile. 
Now I know that many of you were at our Investor Day or followed along on the webcast, so I'm not obviously going to do a full strategy review this morning. But I do encourage those of you who weren't able to participate to visit the Investor Relations section of our website and review the presentations. And please don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any questions. 
I'd like to now update you on 2 of the higher-visibility initiatives we have underway: the USA TODAY Sports Media Group and our Digital Marketing Services initiative. In a few minutes, Bob Dickey will also update you on the progress of the third, U.S. Community Publishing's all-access paid content subscription model. I believe our sports initiative meets all the criteria of being a big transformative idea. It all starts with Gannett's existing and impressive national, regional and local sports resources. From in-depth high school and college sports coverage to the national and professional sports scene to showcase events, like the Kentucky Derby, auto racing and the Olympics, Gannett is a sports news and information powerhouse. Our strategic sports initiative is our plan to take our sports business to the next level by building out our portfolio. 
In November, we acquired MMAjunkie.com, the premier mixed martial arts site. In doing so, we tapped into a younger-skewing, rapidly growing national sports phenomenon with absolutely rabid fans that generate 12 million page views on MMAJ per month. In January, we acquired Fantasy Sports Ventures, including Big Lead Sports, which at the time was the largest independent digital sports property in North America. In February, we announced a joint venture with MLB Advanced Media, Major League Baseball's interactive media and Internet company. These acquisitions, along with partnerships with NASCAR, the PGA and others, have put Gannett on the path towards category leadership. 
We set our sights on becoming a top 5 digital sports property from being 17th when all of these activities were initially conceived. And in early March, we reached our goal when we announced that comScore had named USA TODAY Sports Media Group the fourth most-visited digital sports entity in its February and March rankings, and there's more to come. This was exciting news that comes with more than just pride and some bragging rights. USA TODAY Sports Media Group had almost 24 million unique visitors in March. That size audience, particularly with such a well-defined demographic, opens up important new local and national advertising and e-commerce revenue streams for us. Thanks in large part to our digital reach, we are now deeply involved in tickets, memorabilia and sporting goods sales. 
And it is also -- I'm sorry, the second strategic initiative I want to discuss today is Digital Marketing Services. DMS is an exciting growth opportunity to put our hometown and brand advantages to work for the 150,000-plus merchants who have been turning to Gannett for years, and in some cases, decades to help them reach their customers. And it is also a great opportunity for new customers who want the advantage of quality one-stop shopping product sets. 
The local advertising market is huge, projected to be $149 billion per year by 2015. Marketing and services are the largest pieces of the pie. And within that, the sweet spot is Digital Marketing Services, which are projected to reach nearly $38 billion annually by 2015. And daily deals, digital coupons and social media marketing, being among the fastest-growing areas in that niche. Digital Marketing Services is a new, sizable opportunity that is additive to our existing display advertising and other digital revenue streams. We are keenly aware that digital marketing is a fast-track opportunity that we are pursuing with a great sense of urgency. We are uniquely positioned to profitably capture significant new business in search engine optimization and marketing, social media and Web design. These are important to our clients' success, and we have the know-how to deliver turnkey solutions. 
In addition to capability, we have one thing that no one else has. The digital world is changing fast and business owners are looking for a trusted partner to help figure out how to take full advantage of the opportunity, and that's where we come in. That's Gannett's opportunity. Our advertisers know and trust us. We know our clients and the communities better than anyone, and so we are perfectly suited to be an end-to-end provider of digital solutions and services for these businesses. We have sales staff already on the ground, established brands and relationships in place, and we have growing capabilities to enable us to structure and sell packaged solutions for advertisers and marketers in our 100-plus local communities. And we are selling packaged solutions. We are not just evolving into a consulting business. We're getting paid to design and deliver advertising campaigns and programs. In addition, we have robust promotional capabilities over the air and in print. Our Web- and mobile-based portfolio and capabilities are significant and growing. Having these capabilities available from a trusted, knowledgeable, truly local source, we believe, gives us that advantage that we plan to exploit to the maximum. 
So who's buying these services and what does a Gannett solution look like? Let me just give you one recent example. Our folks in Phoenix worked with a retailer that was a long-term customer and relied on traditional print media that included us and Yellow Pages. They wanted to make a change but were confused and frustrated by the complexity of digital options. They came to us because of our strong relationship, and we implemented a digital solution focused on search optimization, pay-per-click and click-to-call and mobile. We also improved the customer experience on their website and built out the digital back end of their business to increase Web traffic. The results for our customer speak for themselves: a ranking of 1 or 2 for all targeted keywords, a 500% increase in daily Web visits, generating more revenue via both traditional media and a 42% conversion rate on their digital ad. 
Now the measurement criteria may be a bit different than many are used to, but we can all understand the outcome. Using new tools, Gannett was able to help the client be successful. In the process, we strengthened our overall relationship with a more-than-satisfied customer as well. And the customer gained and we gained more profitable revenue we wouldn't have had a year ago. 
During the first quarter, we continued rolling out our Digital Marketing Services in our top markets and have an aggressive program in place to continue to build it out. As we ramp up these efforts, we anticipate full year DMS revenues in the range of $75 million to $100 million this year.  As we move through 2012, we will continue to leverage our strong local media franchises and iconic national brands and deliver our valued content to customers across multiple platforms while providing innovative solutions for our advertisers. Let me emphasize, our strategy is not a quick fix. It is a well-thought-out roadmap to growth. We are confident in our strategy for growth and our ability to deliver significant capital to shareholders. 
Now on that note, let me turn the call over to Bob Dickey to discuss one of the most important initiatives underway to revitalize U.S. Community Publishing: our new, all-access content subscription model. We know this effort is of particular importance and interest to all of you, and we want to share some of the very early feedback we've been receiving as we roll the new model out to our local markets. Bob?"
20571,183391637,284422,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2012",2012-04-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gracia. As Gracia pointed out, we are in the very early stages with our test sites, but I remain optimistic our approach will indeed help stabilize U.S. Community Publishing. Let me share some of those early results. In March, which was our firs",608,"Thanks, Gracia. As Gracia pointed out, we are in the very early stages with our test sites, but I remain optimistic our approach will indeed help stabilize U.S. Community Publishing. Let me share some of those early results. 
In March, which was our first full month [indiscernible] the year-over-year circulation revenue gains ranging from 20% to 37%. Across the entire test group combined, revenues increased 29% year-over-year.  St. Cloud and Wilmington were our top-performing markets. Recently, we received many questions about the potential impact on advertising revenues. I'm happy to report that the test sites executed all of their digital campaigns in March. We are successfully communicating with our local advertisers so they understand how we are working to provide them a more engaged consumer. 
The test sites' total advertising revenues were 2 percentage points better than the USCP average in March. Preprint and digital revenues were impacted less than projected in our business model. 5 of our 6 markets have successfully sold sponsorships with their smartphones and tablet apps. 40% of sponsorship revenue is coming from new customers. Combined, the test sites posted year-over-year digital revenue growth. 
Utilizing the meter approach, we've been able to test various levels and feel comfortable that we are understanding where to set the meter. It remains very early in the billing cycle, but our March 13-week retention improved slightly year-over-year for the test sites and is just above the USCP average. This is led by successful conversion programs to our EasyPay plan, and that is helping drive the retention. In just 6 weeks, we have seen an increase of 2 to 5 percentage points in the test markets. 
EasyPay in some of the test markets now exceeds 60% of our total subscribers and is growing. In every market, we outperformed our projections for circulation volumes. Daily and Sunday home delivery and Daily single-copy declines are below projections, while Sunday single-copy declines are as projected in the markets we moved to $3 and better-than-expected in our $2 markets. As a result, we're doing further analysis to determine the best possible price point as we roll out future sites. 
After 6 weeks, we are currently at 50% of our annual goal for digital subscriptions in these test markets, and we're confident we'll exceed these early projections. Based on local market research, we are charging between $9 and $15 per month for our digital-only subscriptions. The good news is our new digital subscribers index younger, male, married with children and more affluent than we first realized, filling an important audience gap for us. Our investment in new technology is providing a much better consumer experience as they manage their accounts. As a result, customers are activating their accounts at a much faster pace than the first test sites, and we're already 35% to our annual goal. 
As we outlined at Investor Day, this new subscription model offers us the ability to reinvest in our local markets and provide better customer service across Gannett. To date, we have hired over 100 employees to enhance our customer service centers, consumer marketing efforts and to provide more unique local content. Those investments, in conjunction with the creation of Gannett Publishing Services, provided us the resources and the expertise to move quickly and successfully into these test markets. We remain committed to this model, and as Gracia pointed out, it focuses on the value of our content and the strength of our local brands. Our next wave of 17 sites takes place beginning May 1. I'm very confident based on the early results that we will continue to execute at the highest possible level going forward. Thank you."
20571,183391637,284422,"Gannett Co., Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2012",2012-04-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Well, thank you, Bob. I'll provide some additional detail on the quarterly results for each of our business segments and cover some items from the balance sheet. Operating revenues in the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion. Total expenses, excluding",1555,"Well, thank you, Bob. I'll provide some additional detail on the quarterly results for each of our business segments and cover some items from the balance sheet. Operating revenues in the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion. Total expenses, excluding special items, totaled $1.1 billion, relatively unchanged year-over-year despite about $20 million of investment in initiatives and about $6 million in higher pension expense. Earning per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.28. Earning per diluted share, excluding special items, were $0.34. We recorded net special items in the first quarter related to facility consolidations and workforce restructuring that totaled approximately $21 million pretax or about $0.06 per share, as detailed on Table 3 of our earnings release. 
Now let me quickly cover those in more detail. First, we recorded pretax facility consolidation charges of approximately $5 million or about $0.01 per share that reflected primarily accelerated depreciation costs associated with the transfer of production activities for The Cincinnati Enquirer to a third-party printer in Columbus, Ohio. That's the move that was announced in the fourth quarter of last year. As previously disclosed, similar levels of accelerated depreciation will be recorded in the second and third quarters until the move is completed. Second, we recorded pretax workforce restructuring charges of just over $16 million or about $0.04 per share that related primarily to an early retirement offer program we announced for U.S. Community Publishing employees during the quarter. 
Turning to our segment results. In our Publishing segment, revenues were $874 million, down 6% in the quarter, reflecting an 8% decline in advertising revenue while circulation was about 2% lower. Advertising demands firmed during the quarter but not enough to mitigate a slow start to the year. Ad demand in January was soft across all categories, particularly the retail and national categories which experienced double-digit declines. Comparison narrowed significantly within the quarter, and all ad categories were down in the mid-single-digit in March. 
In the quarter, retail and classified advertising were down 8% and 7%, respectively, and national advertising was 13% lower. Retail advertising at our domestic operations was 7% lower for the quarter. However, result improved sequentially in the quarter, and year-over-year comparisons for March were almost 7 percentage points better than comparisons in January. 
Retail advertising at Newsquest in pounds declined over 6%, reflecting a soft economic environment in the U.K. Our national advertising for the Publishing segment was down 13% in the quarter but improved sequentially during the quarter. In our domestic Publishing operations, the difference from January to March was almost 13 percentage points. 
As Gracia noted, USA TODAY has been impacted by soft national advertising. Increases in the technology and advocacy categories were more than offset by declines in several categories, including entertainment, telecom, auto and financial. At Newsquest, national advertising was up over 2% in local currency. This has been a bright spot for Newsquest since the second quarter of last year. 
Classified advertising was about 6.5% lower for the Publishing segment but better than fourth quarter comparisons. In the U.S., classified advertising revenues were approximately 6% lower but were also better than the fourth quarter. We saw improvements in almost all of the classified categories in the first quarter relative to the fourth. 
Employment in the U.S., although down marginally in the quarter, improved within the quarter and finished up over 3 percentage -- 3% in March compared with the prior year. Real estate classified advertising was down in the quarter, but results improved again during the quarter. A continuing trend we identified in the fourth quarter, the states most impacted by the real estate crisis, California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada had real estate results in line with the rest of our markets, but employment and auto advertising trends were better for properties outside these states. 
Looking at our domestic result across regions. Our West and Midwest regions outperformed our Northeast and South regions in the first quarter. Publishing properties in the West performed particularly well, given that they were cycling a strong performance in the first quarter of last year. The Midwest also showed improvement, excluding the upper Midwest, which was up against challenging comparisons due to the Super Bowl spending in Wisconsin last year. In the Northeast, our New York locations showed substantial improvements in the quarter, while New Jersey still lags. And in the South, results have been mixed, with the highlight being Florida, which appears to be on an upward swing. 
Now Gracia covered the digital revenue results in the Publishing segment in some detail. The growth rates of digital revenue in the segment continues to be a bright spot as we explain our digital marketing -- as we expand our digital marketing capabilities and the solutions we can provide to advertisers. Publishing expenses excluding special items declined over 1% in the quarter and were down 3.4%, excluding $18 million in initiative investments. Newsprint expense declined 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 7% consumption decline, which was partially offset by a 1% increase in usage prices year-over-year. 
Now let me comment briefly on the newsprint market. A newsprint prices remained stable throughout the quarter. But the combined impact of softening demand internationally, new supply options that entered in the market in the first quarter and a recent announcement that a major mill will restart in the second quarter all point to a more favorable pricing environment. 
Focusing for a moment on the Publishing segment profitability that's shown on Table 4. Operating income in the Publishing segment was $85 million, excluding special items of $23 million. Now the $85 million reflects $18 million of initiative investments. Therefore, if you exclude special items and strategic initiative investments, operating margins for the Publishing segment would have been about 460 basis point higher in the quarter. 
Now let me give you a quick update on Gannett Publishing Services. As we previously disclosed, we expect to benefit from our consolidation of domestic printing and distribution capabilities into Gannett Publishing Services to be approximately $40 million this year. The savings consists of streamlining our management structure, optimizing our capacity and network capability, consolidating purchasing and leveraging sourcing opportunities. And we are on track to deliver the majority of our targeted savings in the second half of the year. 
Turning to the Broadcasting segment. Total television revenues were 8% higher in the quarter, driven in part by strong auto advertising both locally and nationally, and advertising related to the Super Bowl and political spending of $5.1 million. Retransmission revenues totaled $23 million in the quarter, an increase of 17% from the first quarter of last year. Online revenues were 6% higher. Total adjusted television revenues, defined to exclude the incremental impact of even-year political ad demand, were up 5.6%. Now based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in total television revenues for the second quarter of 2012 to be in the high single digits compared with the second quarter of 2011. 
Broadcasting segment expenses were up approximately 3%. Excluding strategic investment of approximately $2 million, operating expenses were up 1.5%. Operating income totaled about $73 million in the quarter, an increase of over 14% from the first quarter last year. Excluding investment in initiatives, the operating margin for Broadcasting would have been about 100 basis point higher, and operating cash flow was up over 12% to $80 million. 
Digital segment revenues were about 7% higher in the quarter, driven by another strong performance by CareerBuilder, which was up 10%. Operating expenses in the Digital segment were up about 7.5% due to higher sales and marketing costs at CareerBuilder. Operating income and operating cash flow in the Digital segment were $16 million and $24 million, respectively. 
Now in February if you recall, we announced a new capital allocation plan that included a 150% dividend increase to $0.80 per share on an annual basis and a new $300 million share repurchase authorization targeted to be completed over the next 2 years. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares at a cost of $35.5 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.67 billion of debt outstanding, a reduction of $95 million during the quarter. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured for the covenant test in our credit facilities, was about 1.7x at the end of the quarter. 
Interest expense in the first quarter was $7 million lower than the first quarter of last year, due primarily to lower average debt balances. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.7%. Cash at quarter end was $157 million and capital expenditures in the first quarter were about $18 million. Now free cash flow in the quarter totaled $148 million after a $54 million contribution to our pension plan. 
Now finally before I open it up for questions, I wanted to remind you that similar to this quarter, we expect the second quarter to reflect continued investments in our strategic initiatives and higher pension expense. Initiative investment is expected to total $30 million in the second quarter. The increase in pension expenses will be $24 million for the entire year, so the expense next quarter will be in line with the first quarter and will be about $6 million. 
And with that, I will open it up for questions."

Overall, as we indicated, our advertising comparisons got much better as the first quarter went on. And like many others, I think January was a slow month. But clearly, we accelerated through February and March. And as I said earlier, our average for February and March was better than what we did in the fourth quarter. So starting out of the blocks, we currently anticipate that the second quarter will be much more like the way we ended the first quarter rather than the sluggishness that we obviously saw in January. On the television side, I don't think that our guidance is implying that core business will be a little softer. Obviously, we don't have the Super Bowl, which helped a little bit in the first quarter on our NBC affiliates. Political, I think we'll see how that all plays out, but I don't think we're looking for heroic political numbers in the second quarter. Frankly, as we mentioned, about 80% of our political dollars are garnered between Labor Day and Election Day. So usually, the first and second quarters are not a significant political opportunity. So I think our core business is hanging in there quite well. I look at auto and auto pacings, I think, are up in the 20% plus range for Broadcasting. Obviously, a little bit of that is in comparison to the last year's second quarter when we had, towards the end of the quarter, the impact of the Japanese tsunami. But we also had, absent the auto side, up revenues in Broadcasting last year in the second quarter. So in no way does that guidance imply that we expect core revenues to be softer. I think frankly where we sit today, we only really have good pacings for April and into May. I think June, we'll have to see. I think Dave Lougee, when we talk to him, he thinks that there is potential for some upside to the June pacings that we're obviously having just very early glances on right at the moment. Newsquest, I think, will continue to do a good job and continue to outpace their regional competition in the U.K. So overall, I'd say the comment is again that the second quarter is starting out, and we expect it to be much more like the way we finished the first quarter than the January aberration."

I'd say at this point, our expectation is that political will probably be somewhere between $5 million and $10 million in the quarter. We're going to have to wait to see. Obviously, we are heartened by the fact that it appears that the presidential fundraising and the presidential election is finally getting underway in a very big way. And if you listen to any of the pundits about the kind of spending that is going to occur this year, it is going to be potentially unprecedented. We will be the beneficiary of that as it rolls out, but it'll be primarily in that Labor Day to Election Day period where we see the vast majority of that. In the interim, unlike 2010, we have fewer senatorial and fewer gubernatorial races; that's consistent with 2008."

Again, all of the prognosticators talk about the fact that video growth and dollars that are going to be placed alongside video are going to grow and grow in an outsized way. That's one of the reasons behind the video production center that we have just put in our television station at WXIA in Atlanta that is going to be servicing the entire Gannett organization. We see video as an incredible opportunity. Having 23 television stations gives us a nice boost in that area with folks who understand video, who can teach the rest of the organization about that and who can share video in a much more meaningful way than if we just simply had publishing assets.

As you also know, we provided a",3252,"Thanks, Jeff, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to be discussing our second quarter results and further updating you on the growth strategy we announced at our Investor Day in February. As you also know, we provided a comprehensive update, both on our strategy in the quarter at our presentation to the media and entertainment analysts of New York in late June. The transcripts and other documents from that presentation are available on the Investor Relations section of our website for those who would like to do a little bit of a deeper dive. 
So we'll be a little bit briefer today. Also today joining us is Dave Lougee who as you know heads Gannett Broadcasting. He'll be commenting and discussing Broadcasting's strong quarter and the outlook for the second half of the year. 
So now let's jump into it. It's been a busy quarter but I believe a very productive one for our company. To start with, we continue to make strong progress on our strategic initiatives, including our new all access content subscription model. As of the end of the quarter, the program was up and running in about 38 of our markets and delivering as expected. In fact, the plan, though we are in the very early innings, helped deliver our first uptick in circulation revenue at U.S. Community Publishing literally in years. 
It goes without saying that we are extremely pleased with results thus far and much more to come. We rolled out 11 more markets in the last 2 weeks, and now as they say, past performance is no guarantee but we are expecting larger total USCP circulation revenue gains going forward as the rollout continues. 
We're making good progress as well in our push into new businesses like Digital Marketing Services and sports that leverage our hometown and brand advantages. These advantages put Gannett in a unique position to succeed in the digital age. We are the trusted source of news and information in the 100-plus local markets we serve. The important role we've played has helped us build deep actionable relationships with both consumers and businesses. And in a world where more and more voices are fighting to be heard, we have seen that brands really matter. 
Our strong local and iconic national brands are not only recognized and trusted, they give us an important leg up over the competition. Digital Marketing Services is now fully operational in all of our TV markets and our top 35 Publishing markets. We know that our business customers need and want these services, and they want them from a trusted partner like Gannett. Demand for our Digital Marketing Services is strong and is attracting significant new client relationships. It continues to generate new revenue growth for Gannett, and we're looking for revenue of $75 million to $100 million for the year from DMS and much more to come over the next few years. 
Thanks in part to DMS and the impact of the all access subscription model, our digital revenue continues to climb. Digital revenues now account for nearly 1/4 of our total revenue company-wide. 
Our USA TODAY sports franchise is strong and getting stronger. We're working to make all of our assets work more effectively together and building a presence across all platforms. The USA TODAY Sports Media Group is now consistently ranked in the top 5 digital sports properties. We're moving ahead with a stronger, more pronounced voice that will be read, seen and heard across multiple platforms. And of course, as we do that, we're giving advertisers and marketers new opportunities to reach and engage with their customers. 
And of course, at Gannett, we're optimizing assets wherever we can. The Gannett Publishing Services team continues to find ways to operate more efficiently, drive costs out of the business and look for revenue opportunities. They're also improving the return on our assets, particularly our print capacity. And in June, we entered into an agreement that will enable us to reduce our costs for all of our third-party printing by over $60 million over the next 5 years. 
This agreement will also enable Gannett to place all of our printing and distribution assets into this vendor's network, enabling us to more effectively and efficiently market our excess manufacturing, packaging and distribution capacities. We're extending our commercial printing and distribution sales channel across their customer base. 
All in, GPS is on track to deliver a positive impact and contribution of approximately $40 million. And we've also been busy on the leadership front. In May, we announced that Larry Kramer, a journalist and digital media pioneer, now leads USA TODAY, and he's just brought in Dave Calloway as editor-in-chief. If anybody knows the intersection of journalism and digital media better than Larry and Dave, I'd be pretty surprised. We're confident that USA TODAY, our most recognizable brand, is in great hands under their leadership. 
In September, USA TODAY celebrates its 30th anniversary and will be relaunched as a terrific multiplatform news and information leader. And with the phenomenal brand and print online and mobile and a growing audience, they have a great base from which to start. USATODAY.com is one of the most popular newspaper sites, and the USA TODAY app is a top news app with almost 15 million downloads. Reflecting the proliferation of mobile devices and our strong product offerings, USA TODAY's mobile traffic was up strongly in June this year as page use increased 154% and total monthly visitors were 49% higher compared to June a year ago. And we look forward to even more growth as we relaunch our USA TODAY digital platforms in September. And we're all looking forward to Larry and his team driving USA TODAY to even greater heights. 
And as well this month, we'll be welcoming our new CFO, Victoria Harker, to the team on July 23. We are absolutely delighted to have her, and you'll be hearing from her beginning with our third quarter earnings call. And I also want to recognize Michael Hart, our Treasurer, for doing a terrific job in this interim period until Victoria joins us. 
Before moving on, I just want to note that over the course of the last year or so, we've added strong depth and breadth to our leadership team. We have an excellent mix of Gannett veterans and talented newcomers, and I am convinced we have the people in place to drive both our strategy and the company forward and they are already beginning to prove that. 
You know, when I look at Gannett today, what I see is a strong leadership team, a bold but achievable growth plan, a fortress balance sheet and of course, an excellent team of 5,000-plus journalists, digital media experts and talented staff. I know we are all determined to win, and I'm certain of it. 
So now let's go to the highlights of the quarter. In the second quarter, earnings per share excluding special items were $0.56, which you saw this morning, which exceeds First Call's consensus estimates. They reflect robust results for Broadcasting, strong growth in digital revenues company-wide and the positive impact of our strategic initiatives, particularly the all access content subscription model. 
And they also reflect, as we previously announced, an investment of approximately $30 million in our strategic initiatives. By the way, all in all, the results we reported this morning met or exceeded the guidance we gave at our mini presentation in June. 
So let's dig a little deeper. Total operating revenues as you saw were $1.31 billion, down just 2% from last year's quarter. Despite our initiative investments and the higher pension expense discussed in June, our expenses were well-controlled, and we continued to find efficiencies. As a result, operating expenses were lower in the quarter compared to the quarter last year, particularly when you exclude special items. 
Each of our business segments again generated solid profitability in the quarter. Operating income excluding special items was $237 million, while operating cash flow was $285 million and free cash flow totaled $140 million. As you saw, we had $20 million in special items in the quarter related to facility consolidation charges, workforce restructuring and a pension settlement charge. The facility consolidation and workforce restructuring charges impacted results in our Publishing segment, while the pension charges are included in corporate expenses. Details are in our press release from this morning. 
Our initiative investments relate primarily to the new all access content subscription model, Digital Marketing Services and our digital relaunch. Each of these initiatives is important to our future, and as I noted earlier, each is gaining good traction. As we said in February, we fully expect them to more positively impact results in the latter half of this year and well beyond. 
Now approximately $28 million of those investments were in the Publishing segment, a little under $2 million in Broadcasting and the balance in the Digital segment. All of the special items and the strategic initiative expenses impact our operating income. 
Now let me turn to a quick review of our segments, and again Dave Lougee will provide a deep dive into Broadcasting in a few moments. It comes as no new news that Publishing continues to face secular headwinds and an uneven advertising market. We also know that the economic environment is tepid as a persistent 8%-plus unemployment rate and anemic retail sales  reported this morning show us. Consumers and marketers are more cautious as a result. 
As a result of all this, the Publishing segment had a revenue decline of 5.5% overall on a constant currency basis but strong digital revenue growth. Here again, it's important to note that our plans to revitalize the segment and return it to growth by 2015 as we said in February were not a 1- or 2-quarter phenomenon. We expect to do that by 2015, we are making progress and we are on track. 
Now advertising revenue was 8% lower in the quarter. The great news, however, is that circulation revenue was up in USCP, ahead of plan. Overall for the company, it was down less than 1%. Volatility in advertising revenue reflected a lot of factors, including the calendar shift of some important dates for advertisers. 
Advertising revenue declined by month on a constant currency basis were a bit of a roller coaster, approximately 12%, 2% and 9% for April, May and June, respectively, and consistent with the volatility we noted in June. Circulation revenue improved sequentially in the quarter, reflecting again the early successes we are seeing on the rollout of our subscription plan. As I mentioned earlier, this new model resulted in USCP having the increase of a little over 1% in circulation revenue in the quarter. 
As you can see, this plan will be of growing importance to our Publishing results, so let me switch gears for a moment and talk about the model in a little more detail. Now I'm sure that you've noticed that we insist on calling our plan an all access content subscription model while other publishers talk about payrolls. Why is that? Well, very simply put, our strategy is just simply different than theirs. In our strategy, content is king and the foundation of the model's success. Under the new plan, for a monthly fee, all subscribers in our markets will get access to all of our content on all digital platforms when and where they want it, all during the course of the day. And in addition to that, they'll have several home delivery options. The price points for the total subscription package increase with the frequency of home delivery choice, whether it's Sunday-only, home delivery or 3- or 4-day or a full 7-day home delivery, the price points vary. 
Access, of course, to CareerBuilder and Cars.com is free, and nonsubscriber access is metered and limited. Projections are on track and by the end of 2013, we fully expect that USCP's subscription revenue will be about 25% higher. That translates to a roughly $100 million contribution to operating profit in 2013. 
Now let me give you an update on some of the metrics we are using to gauge our performance. As I noted through the end of the quarter, the new subscription model was launched in 38 markets, reflecting 4 waves of launches. We have launched another 11 sites, our fifth wave, in early July. 
Let's start with the first 2 waves since they've been in place the longest. We continue to see positive results, sustained results for our initial wave of launches in February and expect to realize year-over-year total circulation revenue growth in the range of 25% at these locations once we cycle our longer-term subscriptions. We will cycle 26-week subscriptions for early launches later this month and into next and 52-week subscriptions for the early launches in late January or early February of next year. 
Now also let me share some very early results for the 2 waves that launched in April and May. In June, which would've been the first full month for those 2 waves, we generated year-over-year circulation revenue growth depending on the location in the range of 16% to 47%. Now that increase again doesn't reflect also subscribers with longer-term subscriptions. In June, the average increase was about 25%, but as I noted, we are still very early on in the process at these sites. 
On the advertising front, since there've been questions on that, total advertising revenue for our first wave performed better than projected in our business model. Now based on our first 3 waves, which represent 25 sites that all launched by early May, we are seeing daily home delivery losses that are better than the 5 percentage point incremental decline to trend the model projected. 
And then on the single-copy side where you may recall, we are instituting price increases of anywhere from 30% to 100% in some locations. Daily single-copy circulation declines are significantly smaller than the model was based on, and we are below the low end of the range of projected Sunday singles copy circulation declines of 30% to 40% so well on our way. 
In terms of digital subscribers, we are on pace to achieve our goal. For all of the sites launched through the end of the quarter, we have just over 16,500 digital subscribers. We have added another 4,500 since the MEANY presentation in late June alone. And as Bob Dickey noted at the MEANY presentation, we have not been aggressively marketing the digital-only subscription alternative to date, which is changing now that we have a new marketing campaign out there. The good news on this front is that these digital-only subscribers are a younger, very affluent demographic, new advertising and marketing targets that have been elusive for us in the past. 
The content subscription model played a role in helping year-over-year total revenue for U.S. Community Publishing. Close to 25% of U.S. Community properties had higher total revenues in the second quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. 
Now let me very briefly turn to the advertising categories in publishing. Advertising revenue overall was about 8% lower in the quarter. Each of the advertising categories, retail, national and classified was volatile to varying degrees. Retail and classified had better comparisons in the second quarter relative to the first. Better classified advertising comparisons in the U.S. helped to close the gap. In fact, year-over-year comparisons for all the major classified categories were better compared to first quarter comparisons. 
In the U.S., classified advertising revenues were down 3.7%. Auto was actually up almost 1% and employment was just 0.7% lower. Digital revenues in Publishing were up almost 30% from last year, driven by growth in digital advertising and marketing services and growing contributions again from the new content subscription model. Digital revenues were up 33% in U.S. Community Publishing. At USA TODAY and its associated businesses, digital revenues were up 37% overall. And Newsquest digital revenue was up 10% in local currency. 
As you know, we have been very focused for some time on ensuring that we are the go to source of digital marketing solutions in our local markets. Gannett Digital Marketing Services is positioning itself as a one-stop shop, offering a full suite of digital marketing solutions. The basic products include search-related marketing products like SCM and SEO, as well as e-mail marketing campaigns, website design and construction and social marketing. Our digital toolkit also includes daily deals and digital coupons. We are continuing to see strong results for these products, particularly at Deal Chicken, our daily deal site. We just celebrated Deal Chicken's one-year anniversary, and we saw another strong quarter of sequential improvement as second quarter revenue was up 20% compared to the first quarter. 
Now let me turn to expenses for a moment. Publishing's expenses excluding special items were down almost 3% in the quarter, including those $28 million of initiative investments. The initiative investments offset in part the impact of our successful cost efficiency efforts and facility consolidations in prior quarters. The reworked by Publishing Services and our sourcing initiatives have clearly helped, as did a decline in newsprint expense of over 7%. 
Now regarding Newsprint, a domestic regional price drop occurred in the second quarter, driven by continued weakness in exports. These offshore shipments have declined sharply and are down nearly 30% year-to-date. When offshore shipments decline, downward price pressures grow. Market conditions are expected to favor publishers for the remainder of 2012, and prices for Newsquest were lower in the first half and are declining further in the latter half of the year. 
Turning to profitability in our Publishing segment, operating income excluding special items of about $15 million totaled $119 million, and that includes that strategic investment spending I mentioned earlier. If you include both special items and the strategic initiative spending, the operating margin would have been 350 basis points higher than the reported margin. 
In U.S. Community Publishing, more than 1/2 of our sites had higher profitability compared to the second quarter last year. 
Now let me turn to the U.K. for a second. Newsquest continues to operate very well in a tough economy. Total revenues in pounds were about 4% lower in the quarter, but once again showed improved performance compared to the first quarter, and will again, I believe, outpace the competition. Continued cost containment efforts resulted in a 6% expense reduction that outpaced the revenue decline. As a result, Newsquest and IBT in pounds was better year-over-year. 
Now let me quickly cover our Digital segment. As you saw, Digital segment revenues in the second quarter were up 4.5%. CareerBuilder's revenue grew 7%. Expenses were about 5% higher, reflecting higher costs at CB and digital strategic spending. Operating income for the Digital segment totaled $37 million, a 1% increase. If you exclude strategic spending in that segment, operating income would have been up 2.5%. 
As I noted earlier, digital advertising and marketing solutions, as well as the early impact of our subscription program, contributed to company-wide digital revenue growth of 13% in the quarter. Digital revenues totaled almost $312 million or 24% of digital revenues company-wide. 
Now 2 big even-year events, the Olympics and the elections, are shaping up very nicely for us. Dave is here to review Broadcasting's performance and provide some color around expected Olympic and political spending, as well as the outlook for the remainder of the year. Dave?"

For the second quarter, Broadcast revenues totaled $205 million, an increase of more than 11% compared to the same quarter last year. Our growth drivers were strong core advertising results, higher political demand and increases in digital and retransmission revenues. 
Core advertising was led by an increase in the auto category of almost 30%. Auto has been strong all year but part of the growth this quarter is related to the negative impact last year of the Japanese tsunami particularly in June. 
But several other top categories were also up in the quarter, including medical, retail, local services, home improvement and financial services, offsetting losses in media and telecom spending. 
Political, which we'll talk a little bit more about later, totaled $11.8 million in the second quarter, an increase of $9 million over last year. Retransmission revenues were $23 million in the quarter, about 17% higher compared to the second quarter last year. Digital revenues and broadcasting were up 13%, and Captivate itself was up 15%. 
Total adjusted TV revenues, defined to exclude the incremental impact of our even-year political ad demand, were up 6.2%. Expenses in the Broadcasting segment were just -- were up just under 7%, due primarily to an increase in sales and marketing costs associated with the significant ramp up in revenues and about $2 million in the initiative investments that Gracia referred to earlier. Excluding the strategic investments, operating expenses were up about 5%. 
Operating income, including the net impact of the strategic initiatives, was up almost 18% compared to the second quarter last year and totaled approximately $95 million. Operating cash flow was up just under -- was $102 million, an increase of just under 16%. 
Now we will have a very strong third quarter. We already have significantly more dollars on the books for the London Olympics than we finished with for the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and we still have inventory left to sell. Over a year ago, we decided to transform our Olympic sales process, and through training and investment, we are getting and frankly overachieving the results we have hoped for. 
Specifically, we've got a significant increase in local businesses who are advertising in the games on our stations. National Olympic sales are strong as well. When the closing ceremonies are complete, we'll end up $10 million to $12 million ahead of 2008 or in percentage terms the low 40s or the low 50s. We are very proud of our team's performance. 
Now turning to political spending. As anticipated, it's shaping up to be very strong for us in the third and fourth quarter. As we've indicated in the past, our portfolio of strong new stations in the presidential swing states has us very well positioned and that's proving to be true. Specifically, spending in Ohio, Colorado, Florida and Virginia is robust and growing. We've also got some key center races in Missouri, Virginia and Maine, and we'll have numerous contested House seats as we always have in the years past. 
It's worth noting that inventory management and pricing are far more strategic issues than ever in terms of successfully managing the demand of political business. That's because of how late the political dollars are now booked for strategic purposes on the part of the campaigns and the packs and the amount of inventory they can take in targeted markets. 
A lot of money can be made or lost depending on the sophistication of the station's process for managing that demand. To that end, we centralized our sales traffic and process 2 years ago so that we can have a centralized view of inventory at all times, and through software and tracking of political spending trends, we can assist the stations in making better, real-time pricing decisions which benefits us and all our advertisers, both core and political. 
Based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in third quarter TV ad revenues to be up in the low 30s compared to the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the incremental impact of Olympics and political. However, because the majority of our political advertising will be placed later in the quarter, it's too early to call that number with much precision. Gracia?"

Now quickly, I want to turn to some balance sheet items before we open it up for questions. As you know, our new capital allocation plan included a 150% dividend increase to $0.80 per share on an annual basis and a $300 million share repurchase authorization targeted to be completed over the next 2 years. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased 3.4 million shares at a cost of $45.5 million. 
At the end of the second quarter, we have approximately $1.66 billion of debt and our all-in cost of debt currently stands at about 6.75%. Cash at quarter end was 212 -- $202 million, we spent $20 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow totaled $140 million in the quarter after a $22 million contribution to our pension plan. 
We've contributed about $76 million to the pension plan through the first half of the year. Our guidance had anticipated contributions of approximately $118 million in 2012. However, recent changes in legislation have reduced the required funding in the near to medium term. We now anticipate that we will contribute a total of $94 million for the entire year. 
At the end of this year -- at the end of last year, our principal pension plan was about 82% funded. The impact of the new legislation will move the funded percentage up to the 90% to 95% range. We expect there will also be an impact on next year's funding, but it is still a little too early to call. 
Finally, before I open it up for questions, I wanted to remind you that similar to this quarter, we expect the third quarter to reflect continued investments in our strategic initiatives and higher pension expense. Initiative investment is expected to total roughly $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter, and the increase in pension expense will be about $5 million. 
So to sum up, we are making meaningful progress on all fronts to make Gannett a winner in the digital age. Our initiatives are gaining traction and there's much more to come. Robust Olympics and political advertising seasons, as Dave said, lie ahead and our all access subscription program is delivering. Second quarter expenses are down despite $30 million in initiative investments as we continue to manage our business carefully. 
We are making sound investments in our future. Our strong financial position will enable us to deliver on our plan to return approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases by 2015, while making the investments we need to make for our business and our future. And with that, Dave and I will be happy to take your questions."

Where third quarter will end is very difficult to say for us because the Olympics so much affects our inventory and especially political. But it is pacing very good right now. That pace and that's industry-wide as core advertisers place their business early in advance of political demands so it's very difficult to say where it will finish, but the fundamentals appear to be strong specifically auto remains very strong and frankly is tracking along with a good sales data that we're all seeing on car sales."

And Alexia on the other parts of our business, we feel very good about the progress on the Publishing side that we're making on circulation. And you saw that U.S. Community Publishing had circulation revenue growth a little over 1%. We would fully expect that, that number would be reasonably higher in the third quarter as the launches continue to take hold and we launch more sites so that will be a very nice story for Publishing in the third quarter. I hesitate to really comment on advertising because the level of volatility, and as Dave said, the placement of advertising very late makes it really difficult to hone in on trends. You saw the volatility that we just came through in the second quarter. But a lot will obviously depend on consumers and marketers and how they feel. Olympics will be good for USA TODAY in our sports group there. We're starting out the quarter as we would have expected so a lot will be said over these next few months. And obviously, this quarter, September is a very important month with the back-to-school trends that we'll see. So it's just a little early. We'll make sure that we'll keep everybody updated as the quarter unfolds. And then Newsquest, of course, is doing a terrific job and outperforming their regional press competition on the top line side and certainly on the bottom line side as well. And then on the Digital segment part, CareerBuilder continues to post very good numbers despite what is a very high unemployment rate and a tepid view of the economy. But I think that a lot of the product innovation that they have done at CareerBuilder has resulted in them being able to post very strong numbers even in light of a difficult job environment. And then obviously, for them on the international front, they've done some good acquisitions, and that part of the business is a strong positive for them. So we feel good about where we are headed this coming quarter, feel good about the progress we're making on a lot of fronts. The economy, as it will for a lot of industries, will ultimately determine how things go but broadcast obviously is going to be a terrific home run for us in the third quarter."

The third quarter, John, it's sort of hard to tell as Gracia and I referred earlier because frankly, our numbers are so artificially strong. We've got, in addition to the Olympics, we've got some key NFL football games. We owned the vendor broncos inventory in the preseason with Peyton Manning and all that stacks of that in Denver which is also a key political state, et cetera, et cetera. So we've got an extraordinarily strong inventory position so we'll have a disproportionately high share of revenues and so a little difficult to say where it's all going to fall out in the third quarter on the ex political business.

But even when you extract those revenues related to the Jubilee as kind of a one-off event, our numbers would have sequentially been better than the first quarter. And I think if you look at total ad rev, it would have been less than 0.5% impact on ad revenues. So I think a lot of the work that the folks in the U.K., Paul Davidson and his team, are doing on initiatives of their own, revenue initiatives of their own, as well as continuing to do a terrific job from an expense standpoint, have put them in a good position to navigate what are even more difficult waters in the U.K."

Let me take the second question first, separation versus integration. You heard us talk a lot about, and I'll ask Dave to comment on this as well, talk a lot about our Digital Marketing Services and talk about the tremendous scale that we have locally. We don't think of these as newspaper markets or broadcast markets. We think of these as local media markets where we have tremendous brands, strong deep relationships with advertisers and marketers, and scale, the scale that, that provides us being in 100-plus local markets. So for instance, when we're thinking about Digital Marketing Services and we're executing against that, you heard me say that we've already rolled it out all of our TV markets and our top 35 U.S. Community Publishing markets, and we'll be rolling out the rest of them over the course of the year. That's because Digital Marketing Services is something that transcends the platform that you're on, whether it's TV or print because it's a digital opportunity for you. And in each of our markets, we have a strong digital market, digital presence, lots of different digital platforms from mobile to desktop to print and television. So we actually see that as a tremendous advantage for us to have that kind of scale across so many markets, to have those the brand relationships, deep advertiser and marketing relationships. And we are a trusted advisor to advertisers and marketers in those communities, whether we start from the print platform or the television platform. And Dave, you might mention some of the successes you're seeing on the digital marketing side."

The fulfillment structure that we've got in place that we're allowed to have in place scaled across our company gives us the ability to take to market a product that our competitors do not. And we are already seeing a sweet spot in the marketplace. I think as Gracia talked about at MEANY, simply put, we have thousands and thousands of local clients and businesses that are getting 20 to 35 calls a month from search and social and SCO and marketing and a different marketing vendors. We come in as a one-stop shop offering and they love it. We're seeing tremendous early success so we're in a position where we're now -- we're getting the supply to meet the demand, which is a high-class problem as we like to call it. And just to add on to Gracia's point, from a broadcaster's perspective, the ability to be part of a company with 100 local markets and a national brand is something that's unique for us from a strategic standpoint because as the economy recovers, the growth will be in local, and our ability to take to market scale products in 100 local markets is a differentiator for us as the broadcast division."

I talked about Deal Chicken today, and when you think about what we've done with Deal Chicken, scaling that up from one market in September of 2010 to 60 markets a short year later, doing that at an incredibly low cost base but generating results that are very good, it's because people know us, people understand us and it isn't our only product. It is part of a full suite of products that we can provide on the Digital Marketing Services to meet the needs of those folks. And so that's just another example of what I think is the terrific integration we see across both our newspapers as well as our television stations. On the Publishing expense profile side, we always will do a good job on the expense side. I can't this early in the quarter give you a sense of where we think things will end up. A lot of that will depend obviously on the top line picture. But I will say that given the strength of the Digital Marketing Services and what we're seeing is terrific demand for this, you may see us doing some strategic adds to sales forces. We also are adding selectively to our content, local content generation resources, because of our content subscription model. So I think we'll make some strategic investments that make really good sense that we're able to monetize very quickly. Whether it's in that quarter or not, we're not managing for quarter-to-quarter. We're managing for really meeting the demand that we are seeing. So we'll do the great job we always do on expenses. That won't be an issue."

But as we all know, this has been a volatile several months in the economy, and consumer sentiment and marketer sentiment campaign change on a dime depending on what the last numbers that come out are.

And then at PointRoll, obviously, the good news at PointRoll is that they saw an 18% increase in the number of advertisers that worked with them this past quarter. They saw additional campaigns but they did see, there is pretty much globally pressure on pricing. And so they too as a business are looking at redefining some of the things that they have historically been doing and repositioning themselves for other areas of growth. So I think that's sort of in a nutshell gets you to what I think you're looking at. Hopefully, that was helpful."

In the markets where we are introducing the all access content model at the same time we are also introducing for most of those markets single-copy price increases. So both of those things are going on at the same time. And so as a result as I mentioned and we shared in February, we expected that single-copy losses would be in the range of 30% to 40%. Actually, we're doing much better than that in the places where we have instituted that. And then on all access, we also gave ranges that we thought that the all access would impact circulation by about 5 percentage points more than the trend of circulation. In fact, we're doing better than that. On the digital-only, what I would say is that, that is another component of it but the first 2 components we just talked about at this point are the lion's share of what we expect is going to drive the results that we've talked about, that $100 million contribution next year, et cetera. On the digital-only, that's something that we are now really focusing more on from a sense of marketing as well as from a sense of additional offerings, et cetera. But what I will tell you on that is that we are finding that most consumers that we're talking to want to have some frequency of home delivery of the print product in addition to their all access content of all of our digital platforms. That's the vast majority of the consumers that we are dealing with so far. And so that we believe is a good thing. But certainly for those who are nonsubscribers or who have not in the past had the experience of interacting with our content, this is a new opportunity for them, and so we expect that, that will grow gradually. But none of that, to any degree, was built into the modeling that we did in any meaningful way. Most of it depended on the all access and the single-copy price actions."

I think on the digital revenue front on the Digital segment, a lot of that is driven by CareerBuilder. Some of that will depend obviously on where the jobs market goes, but some of that clearly depends on the great innovations that they have been doing around the product set. So we would anticipate, we're hopeful that our revenue growth in the third quarter will be at or above the level that we've generated in the second quarter. And from a margin perspective again and particularly in that segment, that's not an area where we manage margins quarter-to-quarter. We manage -- we always manage incredibly well from an expense perspective. We are diligent, we are fiscally responsible. We're managing to drive revenues because we know that by driving revenues, given the financial discipline we have, a lot of that money will flow to the bottom line so we feel very good about what we can accomplish there. And we obviously, there will be vagaries particularly in small new businesses that start up in investing in them, and we're not going to hold off on an investment just because a margin is a certain level in a certain quarter. But the one thing you can always count on to get that company to do is to get very fiscally prudent, and we will make sure that every dollar that we spent on investment we have a clear track to providing ultimately a very strong return on those dollars."

This morning, I'm going to be discussing our second quarter results and further updating you on the growth strategy we announced at our Investor Day in February. As you also know, we provided a comprehensive update, both on our strategy and the quarter, at our presentation to the media and entertainment analysts of New York in late June. The transcripts and other documents from that presentation are available on the Investor Relations section of our website for those who would like to do a little bit of a deeper dive. So we'll be a little bit briefer today. 
Also, today, joining us is Dave Lougee who, as you know, heads Gannett Broadcasting. He'll be commenting and discussing Broadcasting's strong quarter and the outlook for the second half of the year. 
So now let's jump into it. It's been a busy quarter, but I believe a very productive one for our company. To start with, we continue to make strong progress on our strategic initiatives, including our new all access content subscription model. As of the end of the quarter, the program was up and running in about 38 of our markets and delivering as expected. In fact, the plan, though we are in the very early innings, helped deliver our first uptick in circulation revenue at U.S. Community Publishing literally in years. It goes without saying that we are extremely pleased with results thus far and much more to come. We rolled out 11 more markets in the last 2 weeks, and now, as they say, past performance is no guarantee but we are expecting larger total USCP circulation revenue gains going forward as the rollout continues. 
We're making good progress as well in our push into new businesses like Digital Marketing Services and sports that leverage our hometown and brand advantages. These advantages put Gannett in a unique position to succeed in the digital age. We are the trusted source of news and information in the 100-plus local markets we serve. The important role we've played has helped us build deep actionable relationships with both consumers and businesses. And in a world where more and more voices are fighting to be heard, we have seen that brands really matter. Our strong local and iconic national brands are not only recognized and trusted, they give us an important leg up over the competition. 
Digital Marketing Services is now fully operational in all of our TV markets and our top 35 publishing markets. We know that our business customers need and want these services, and they want them from a trusted partner like Gannett. Demand for our Digital Marketing Services is strong and is attracting significant new client relationships. It continues to generate new revenue growth for Gannett, and we're looking for revenue of $75 million to $100 million for the year from DMS and much more to come over the next few years. 
Thanks in part to DMS and the impact of the all access subscription model, our Digital revenue continues to climb. Digital revenues now account for nearly 1/4 of our total revenue company-wide. 
Our USA TODAY sports franchise is strong and getting stronger. We're working to make all of our assets work more effectively together and building a presence across all platforms. The USA TODAY Sports Media Group is now consistently ranked in the top 5 digital sports properties. We're moving ahead with a stronger, more pronounced voice that will be read, seen and heard across multiple platforms. And of course, as we do that, we're giving advertisers and marketers new opportunities to reach and engage with their customers. 
And of course, at Gannett, we're optimizing assets wherever we can. The Gannett Publishing Services team continues to find ways to operate more efficiently, drive costs out of the business and look for revenue opportunities. They're also improving the return on our assets, particularly our print capacity. And in June, we entered into an agreement that will enable us to reduce our costs for all of our third-party printing by over $60 million over the next 5 years. This agreement will also enable Gannett to place all of our printing and distribution assets into this vendor's network, enabling us to more effectively and efficiently market our excess manufacturing, packaging and distribution capacities. We're extending our commercial printing and distribution sales channel across their customer base. All in, GPS is on track to deliver a positive impact and contribution of approximately $40 million. 
And we've also been busy on the leadership front. In May, we announced that Larry Kramer, a journalist and digital media pioneer, now leads USA TODAY, and he's just brought in Dave Callaway as editor-in-chief. If anybody knows the intersection of journalism and digital media better than Larry and Dave, I'd be pretty surprised. We're confident that USA TODAY, our most recognizable brand, is in great hands under their leadership. 
In September, USA TODAY celebrates its 30th anniversary and will be relaunched as a terrific multi-platform news and information leader. And with the phenomenal brand in print, online and mobile and a growing audience, they have a great base from which to start. USATODAY.com is one of the most popular newspaper sites and the USA TODAY app is a top news app with almost 15 million downloads. Reflecting the proliferation of mobile devices and our strong product offerings, USA TODAY's mobile traffic was up strongly in June this year as page views increased 154% and total monthly visitors were 49% higher compared to June a year ago. And we look forward to even more growth as we relaunch our USA TODAY digital platforms in September. And we're all looking forward to Larry and his team driving USA TODAY to even greater heights. 
And as well, this month, we'll be welcoming our new CFO, Victoria Harker, to the team on July 23. We are absolutely delighted to have her, and you'll be hearing from her beginning with our third quarter earnings call. And I also want to recognize Michael Hart, our Treasurer, for doing a terrific job in this interim period until Victoria joins us. 
Before moving on, I just want to note that over the course of the last year or so, we've added strong depth and breadth to our leadership team. We have an excellent mix of Gannett veterans and talented newcomers, and I am convinced we have the people in place to drive both our strategy and the company forward and they are already beginning to prove that. 
You know, when I look at Gannett today, what I see is a strong leadership team, a bold but achievable growth plan, a fortress balance sheet, and of course, an excellent team of 5,000-plus journalists, digital media experts and talented staff. I know we are all determined to win, and I'm certain of it. 
So now let's go to the highlights of the quarter. In the second quarter, earnings per share, excluding special items, were $0.56, which you saw this morning, which exceeds First Call's consensus estimates. They reflect robust results for Broadcasting, strong growth in Digital revenues company-wide and the positive impact of our strategic initiatives, particularly the all access content subscription model. And they also reflect, as we previously announced, an investment of approximately $30 million in our strategic initiatives. By the way, all in all, the results we reported this morning met or exceeded the guidance we gave at our MEANY presentation in June. 
So let's dig a little deeper. Total operating revenues, as you saw, were $1.31 billion, down just 2% from last year's quarter. Despite our initiative investments and the higher pension expense discussed in June, our expenses were well-controlled and we continued to find efficiencies. As a result, operating expenses were lower in the quarter compared to the quarter last year, particularly when you exclude special items. 
Each of our business segments, again, generated solid profitability in the quarter. Operating income, excluding special items, was $237 million while operating cash flow was $285 million. And free cash flow totaled $140 million. As you saw, we had $20 million in special items in the quarter, related to facility consolidation charges, workforce restructuring and a pension settlement charge. The facility consolidation and workforce restructuring charges impacted results in our Publishing segment while the pension charges are included in corporate expenses. Details are in our press release from this morning. 
Our initiative investments relate primarily to the new all access content subscription model, Digital Marketing Services and our digital relaunch. Each of these initiatives is important to our future, and as I noted earlier, each is gaining good traction. As we said in February, we fully expect them to more positively impact results in the latter half of this year and well beyond. 
Now approximately $28 million of those investments were in the Publishing segment, a little under $2 million in Broadcasting and the balance in the Digital segment. All of the special items and the strategic initiative expenses impact our operating income. 
Now let me turn to a quick review of our segments, and again Dave Lougee will provide a deep dive into Broadcasting in a few moments. It comes as no new news that Publishing continues to face secular headwinds and an uneven advertising market. We also know that the economic environment is tepid as a persistent 8%-plus unemployment rate and anemic retail sales reported this morning show us. Consumers and marketers are more cautious as a result. 
As a result of all this, the Publishing segment had a revenue decline of 5.5% overall on a constant-currency basis, but strong Digital revenue growth. Here again, it's important to note that our plans to revitalize the segment and return it to growth by 2015 as we said in February were not a one or 2-quarter phenomenon. We expect to do that by 2015. We are making progress and we are on track. 
Now advertising revenue was 8% lower in the quarter. The great news, however, is that circulation revenue was up in USCP, ahead of plan. Overall, for the company, it was down less than 1%. Volatility in advertising revenue reflected a lot of factors, including the calendar shift of some important dates for advertisers. Advertising revenue declined by month on a constant-currency basis were a bit of a roller coaster, approximately 12%, 2% and 9% for April, May and June, respectively, and consistent with the volatility we noted in June. 
Circulation revenue improved sequentially in the quarter, reflecting again the early successes we are seeing on the rollout of our subscription plan. As I mentioned earlier, this new model resulted in USCP having the increase of a little over 1% in circulation revenue in the quarter. 
As you can see, this plan will be of growing importance to our Publishing results, so let me switch gears for a moment and talk about the model in a little more detail. Now I'm sure that you've noticed that we insist on calling our plan an all access content subscription model while other publishers talk about payrolls. Well, why is that? Well, very simply put, our strategy is just simply different than theirs. In our strategy, content is king and the foundation of the model's success. Under the new plan, for a monthly fee, all subscribers in our markets will get access to all of our content on all digital platforms when and where they want it, all during the course of the day. And in addition to that, they'll have several home delivery options. The price points for the total subscription package increase with the frequency of home delivery choice, whether it's Sunday-only, home delivery or 3- or 4-day or a full 7-day home delivery, the price points vary. Access, of course, to CareerBuilder and Cars.com is free, and nonsubscriber access is metered and limited. 
Projections are on track and by the end of 2013, we fully expect that USCP's subscription revenue will be about 25% higher. That translates to a roughly $100 million contribution to operating profit in 2013. 
Now let me give you an update on some of the metrics we are using to gauge our performance. As I noted, through the end of the quarter, the new subscription model was launched in 38 markets, reflecting 4 waves of launches. We have launched another 11 sites, our fifth wave, in early July. 
Let's start with the first 2 waves since they've been in place the longest. We continue to see positive results, sustained results, for our initial wave of launches in February and expect to realize year-over-year total circulation revenue growth in the range of 25% at these locations once we cycle our longer-term subscriptions. We will cycle 26-week subscriptions for early launches later this month and into next and 52-week subscriptions for the early launches in late January or early February of next year. 
Now also let me share some very early results for the 2 waves that launched in April and May. In June, which would've been the first full month for those 2 waves, we generated year-over-year circulation revenue growth, depending on the location, in the range of 16% to 47%. Now that increase again doesn't reflect all subscribers with longer-term subscriptions. In June, the average increase was about 25%. But as I noted, we are still very early on in the process at these sites. 
On the advertising front, since there have been questions on that, total advertising revenue for our first wave performed better than projected in our business model. 
Now based on our first 3 waves, which represent 25 sites that all launched by early May, we are seeing daily home delivery losses that are better than the 5 percentage point incremental decline to trend the model projected. 
And then on the single-copy side where, you may recall, we are instituting price increases of anywhere from 30% to 100% in some locations. Daily single-copy circulation declines are significantly smaller than the model was based on, and we are below the low end of the range of projected Sunday single-copy circulation declines of 30% to 40%, so well on our way. 
In terms of digital subscribers, we are on pace to achieve our goal. For all of the sites launched through the end of the quarter, we have just over 16,500 digital subscribers. We have added another 4,500 since the MEANY presentation in late June alone. And as Bob Dickey noted at the MEANY presentation, we have not been aggressively marketing the digital-only subscription alternative to date, which is changing now that we have a new marketing campaign out there. The good news on this front is that these digital-only subscribers are a younger, very affluent demographic, new advertising and marketing targets that have been elusive for us in the past. 
The content subscription model played a role in helping year-over-year total revenue for U.S. Community Publishing. Close to 25% of U.S. Community properties had higher total revenues in the second quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. 
Now let me very briefly turn to the advertising categories in Publishing. Advertising revenue overall was about 8% lower in the quarter. Each of the advertising categories, retail, national and classified was volatile to varying degrees. Retail and classified had better comparisons in the second quarter relative to the first. Better classified advertising comparisons in the U.S. helped to close the gap. In fact, year-over-year comparisons for all the major classified categories were better compared to first quarter comparisons. 
In the U.S., classified advertising revenues were down 3.7%. Auto was actually up almost 1% and employment was just 0.7% lower. Digital revenues in Publishing were up almost 30% from last year, driven by growth in digital advertising and marketing services and growing contributions again from the new content subscription model. Digital revenues were up 33% in U.S. Community Publishing. At USA TODAY and its associated businesses, digital revenues were up 37% overall. And Newsquest digital revenue was up 10% in local currency. 
As you know, we have been very focused for some time on ensuring that we are the go-to source of digital marketing solutions in our local markets. Gannett Digital Marketing Services is positioning itself as a one-stop shop, offering a full suite of digital marketing solutions. The basic products include search-related marketing products like SEM and SEO, as well as e-mail marketing campaigns, website design and construction and social marketing. Our digital toolkit also includes daily deals and digital coupons. We are continuing to see strong results for these products, particularly at DealChicken, our daily deal site. We just celebrated DealChicken's one-year anniversary, and we saw another strong quarter of sequential improvement as second quarter revenue was up 20% compared to the first quarter. 
Now let me turn to expenses for a moment. Publishing's expenses excluding special items, were down almost 3% in the quarter, including those $28 million of initiative investments. The initiative investments offset in part the impact of our successful cost efficiency efforts and facility consolidations in prior quarters. The rework by Publishing Services and our sourcing initiatives have clearly helped, as did a decline in newsprint expense of over 7%. 
Now regarding newsprint, a domestic regional price drop occurred in the second quarter driven by continued weakness in exports. These offshore shipments have declined sharply and are down nearly 30% year-to-date. And offshore shipments decline, downward price pressures grow. Market conditions are expected to favor publishers for the remainder of 2012, and prices for Newsquest were lower in the first half and are declining further in the latter half of the year. 
Turning to profitability in our Publishing segment. Operating income, excluding special items of about $15 million, totaled $119 million, and that includes that strategic investment spending I mentioned earlier. If you include both special items and the strategic initiative spending, the operating margin would have been 350 basis points higher than the reported margin. 
In U.S. Community Publishing, more than 1/2 of our sites had higher profitability compared to the second quarter last year. 
Now let me turn to the U.K. for a second. Newsquest continues to operate very well in a tough economy. Total revenues in pounds were about 4% lower in the quarter, but once again showed improved performance compared to the first quarter and will again, I believe, outpace their competition. Continued cost containment efforts resulted in a 6% expense reduction that outpaced the revenue decline. As a result, Newsquest and IBT, in pounds, was better year-over-year. 
Now let me quickly cover our Digital segment. As you saw, Digital segment revenues in the second quarter were up 4.5%. CareerBuilder's revenue grew 7%. Expenses were about 5% higher, reflecting higher costs at CB and digital strategic spending. Operating income for the Digital segment totaled $37 million, a 1% increase. If you exclude strategic spending in that segment, operating income would have been up 2.5%. As I noted earlier, digital advertising and marketing solutions, as well as the early impact of our subscription program, contributed to company-wide Digital revenue growth of 13% in the quarter. Digital revenues totaled almost $312 million or 24% of digital revenues company-wide. 
Now 2 big even-year events, the Olympics and the elections, are shaping up very nicely for us. Dave is here to review Broadcasting's performance and provide some color around expected Olympic and political spending, as well as the outlook for the remainder of the year. Dave?"

For the second quarter, Broadcast revenues totaled $205 million, an increase of more than 11% compared to the same quarter last year. Our growth drivers were strong core advertising results, higher political demand and increases in digital and retransmission revenues. 
Core advertising was led by an increase in the auto category of almost 30%. Auto has been strong all year, but part of the growth this quarter is related to the negative impact last year of the Japanese tsunami, particularly in June. But several other top categories were also up in the quarter including medical, retail, local services, home improvement and financial services, offsetting losses in media and telecom spending. 
Political, which we'll talk a little bit more about later, totaled $11.8 million in the second quarter, an increase of $9 million over last year. Retransmission revenues were $23 million in the quarter, about 17% higher compared to the second quarter last year. Digital revenues and broadcasting were up 13%, and Captivate, itself, was up 15%. 
Total adjusted TV revenues, defined to exclude the incremental impact of our even-year political ad demand, were up 6.2%. Expenses in the Broadcasting segment were just -- were up just under 7%, due primarily to an increase in sales and marketing costs associated with the significant ramp-up in revenues and about $2 million in the initiative investments that Gracia referred to earlier. Excluding the strategic investments, operating expenses were up about 5%. 
Operating income, including the net impact of the strategic initiatives, was up almost 18% compared to the second quarter last year and totaled approximately $95 million. Operating cash flow was up just under -- was $102 million, an increase of just under 16%. 
Now we will have a very strong third quarter. We already have significantly more dollars on the books for the London Olympics than we finished with for the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and we still have inventory left to sell. Over a year ago, we decided to transform our Olympic sales process, and through training and investment, we are getting and frankly overachieving the results we had hoped for. Specifically, we've got a significant increase in local businesses who are advertising in the games on our stations. National Olympic sales are strong as well. When the closing ceremonies are complete, we'll end up $10 million to $12 million ahead of 2008, or in percentage terms, the low 40s or the low 50s. We are very proud of our team's performance. 
Now turning to political spending. As anticipated, it's shaping up to be very strong for us in the third and fourth quarter. As we've indicated in the past, our portfolio of strong new stations in the presidential swing states has us very well positioned and that's proving to be true. Specifically, spending in Ohio, Colorado, Florida and Virginia is robust and growing. We've also got some key center races in Missouri, Virginia and Maine, and we'll have numerous contested House seats as we always have in the years past. 
It's worth noting that inventory management and pricing are far more strategic issues than ever in terms of successfully managing the demand of political business. That's because of how late the political dollars are now booked for strategic purposes on the part of the campaigns and the packs and the amount of inventory they can take in targeted markets. 
A lot of money can be made or lost depending on the sophistication of the station's process for managing that demand. To that end, we centralized our sales trafficking process 2 years ago so that we can have a centralized view of inventory at all times, and through software and tracking of political spending trends, we can assist the stations in making better real-time pricing decisions, which benefits us and all our advertisers, both core and political. 
Based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in third quarter TV ad revenues to be up in the low 30s compared to the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the incremental impact of Olympics and political. However, because the majority of our political advertising will be placed later in the quarter, it's too early to call that number with much precision. Gracia?"

Now quickly, I want to turn to some balance sheet items before we open it up for questions. As you know, our new capital allocation plan included a 150% dividend increase to $0.80 per share on an annual basis and a $300 million share repurchase authorization targeted to be completed over the next 2 years. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased 3.4 million shares at a cost of $45.5 million. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.66 billion of debt and our all-in cost of debt currently stands at about 6.75%. Cash at quarter end was 212 -- $202 million. We spent $20 million on capital expenditures. And free cash flow totaled $140 million in the quarter after a $22 million contribution to our pension plan. 
We've contributed about $76 million to the pension plan through the first half of the year. Our guidance had anticipated contributions of approximately $118 million in 2012. However, recent changes in legislation have reduced the required funding in the near to medium term. We now anticipate that we will contribute a total of $94 million for the entire year. 
At the end of this year -- at the end of last year, our principal pension plan was about 82% funded. The impact of the new legislation will move the funded percentage up to the 90% to 95% range. We expect there will also be an impact on next year's funding, but it is still a little too early to call. 
Finally, before I open it up for questions, I wanted to remind you that similar to this quarter, we expect the third quarter to reflect continued investments in our strategic initiatives and higher pension expense. Initiative investment is expected to total roughly $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter, and the increase in pension expense will be about $5 million. 
So to sum up, we are making meaningful progress on all fronts to make Gannett a winner in the digital age. Our initiatives are gaining traction, and there's much more to come. Robust Olympics and political advertising seasons, as Dave said, lie ahead and our all access subscription program is delivering. Second quarter expenses are down despite $30 million in initiative investments as we continue to manage our business carefully. 
We are making sound investments in our future. Our strong financial position will enable us to deliver on our plan to return approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases by 2015, while making the investments we need to make for our business and our future. And with that, Dave and I will be happy to take your questions."

But our core for the second quarter finished up about 5%. But frankly, we had some political displacement in June in some of our key political markets where the political funnel began in mid-May. So if you extrapolate the core that we displaced in June, we probably were up closer to 6.5% and 7% if we'd not had that political in core in the second quarter. Where third quarter will end is very difficult to say for us because the Olympics so much affects our inventory and especially political. But it is pacing very good right now. That pace -- and that's industry-wide as core advertisers place their business early in advance of political demands, so it's very difficult to say where it will finish, but the fundamentals appear to be strong. Specifically, auto remains very strong, and frankly, is tracking along with a good sales data that we're all seeing on car sales."

And you saw that U.S. Community Publishing had circulation revenue growth a little over 1%. We would fully expect that, that number would be reasonably higher in the third quarter as the launches continue to take hold and we launch more sites so that will be a very nice story for Publishing in the third quarter. I hesitate to really comment on advertising because the level of volatility, and as Dave said, the placement of advertising very late, makes it really difficult to hone in on trends. You saw the volatility that we just came through in the second quarter. But a lot will obviously depend on consumers and marketers and how they feel. Olympics will be good for USA TODAY in our sports group there. We're starting out the quarter as we would have expected so a lot will be said over these next few months. And it's -- and obviously, this quarter, September is a very important month with the back-to-school trends that we'll see. So it's just a little early. We'll make sure that we keep everybody updated as the quarter unfolds. And then Newsquest, of course, is doing a terrific job and outperforming their regional press competition on the top line side and certainly on the bottom line side as well. And then on the Digital segment part, CareerBuilder continues to post very good numbers despite what is a very high unemployment rate and a tepid view of the economy. But I think that a lot of the product innovation that they have done at CareerBuilder has resulted in them being able to post very strong numbers even in light of a difficult job environment. And then obviously, for them on the international front, they've done some good acquisitions and that part of the business is a strong positive for them. So we feel good about where we are headed this coming quarter, feel good about the progress we're making on a lot of fronts. The economy, as it will for a lot of industries, will ultimately determine how things go, but broadcast obviously is going to be a terrific home run for us in the third quarter."

The third quarter, John, it's sort of hard to tell as Gracia and I referred earlier, because frankly, our numbers are so artificially strong. We've got, in addition to the Olympics, we've got some key NFL football games. We own the Denver Broncos inventory in the preseason with Peyton Manning and all that's attached to that in Denver, which is also a key political state, et cetera, et cetera.

But even when you extract those revenues related to the Jubilee as kind of a one-off event, our numbers would have sequentially been better than the first quarter. And I think if you look at total ad rev, it would have been less than 0.5% impact on ad revenues. So I think a lot of the work that the folks in the U.K., Paul Davidson and his team, are doing on initiatives of their own -- revenue initiatives of their own as well as continuing to do a terrific job from an expense standpoint, have put them in a good position to navigate what are even more difficult waters in the U.K."

And scale, the scale that, that provides us being in a 100-plus local markets. So for instance, when we're thinking about Digital Marketing Services and we're executing against that, you heard me say that we've already rolled it out to all of our TV markets and our top 35 U.S. Community Publishing markets, and we'll be rolling out the rest of them over the course of the year. That's because Digital Marketing Services is something that transcends the platform that you're on, whether it's TV or print because it's a digital opportunity for you. And in each of our markets, we have a strong digital market, digital presence, lots of different digital platforms from mobile to desktop to print and television. So we actually see that as a tremendous advantage for us to have that kind of scale across so many markets, to have those deep brand relationships, deep advertiser and marketing relationships.

The fulfillment structure that we've got in place that we're allowed to have in place scaled across our company gives us the ability to take to market a product that our competitors do not. And we are already seeing a sweet spot in the marketplace. I think as Gracia talked about at MEANY, simply put, we have thousands and thousands of local clients and businesses that are getting 20 to 35 calls a month from search and social and SEO and marketing -- different marketing vendors, we come in as a one-stop shop offering and they love it. We're seeing tremendous early success so we're in a position where we're now -- we're getting the supply to meet the demand, which is a high-class problem as we like to call it. And just to add on to Gracia's point, from a broadcaster's perspective, the ability to be part of a company with 100 local markets and a national brand is something that's unique for us from a strategic standpoint because as the economy recovers, the growth will be in local. And our ability to take to market scaled products in 100 local markets is a differentiator for us as the Broadcast division."

It is part of a full suite of products that we can provide on the Digital Marketing Services to meet the needs of those folks. And so that's just another example of what I think is the terrific integration we see across both our newspapers as well as our television stations. On the Publishing expense profile side, we always will do a good job on the expense side. I can't this early in the quarter give you a sense of where we think things will end up. A lot of that will depend, obviously, on the top line picture. But I will say that given the strength of the Digital Marketing Services and the -- what we're seeing is terrific demand for this, you may see us doing some strategic adds to sales forces. We also are adding selectively to our content, local content generation resources, because of our content subscription model. So I think we'll make some strategic investments that make really good sense that we're able to monetize very quickly. Whether it's in that quarter or not, we're not managing for quarter-to-quarter. We're managing for really meeting the demand that we are seeing. So we'll do the great job we always do on expenses. That won't be an issue."

But then in a more macro way, I think what we're seeing right now is some of the southern states being a little weaker and New Jersey being a little weaker than what we've seen in other parts of the company -- country. So it's a bit of a mixed blend of things. You also have the overlay obviously around the uncertainty of the election and you can see that a little bit in some of the retail spend this morning where consumers seem to pull back a little bit given some of the uncertainty they see out there. But as we all know, this has been a volatile several months in the economy, and consumer sentiment and marketer sentiment campaign can change on a dime depending on what the last numbers that come out are. So a little bit hard these days to have a crystal ball that gives you the precision that all of us would love to have.

Yes, we refinanced obviously part of the notes that came due in -- from cash as well as from our revolving credit agreement. Our revolving credit agreement right now has -- is tied to LIBOR, whatever LIBOR is these days. And so that borrowing is around 2.5%, 2.6% versus the higher rate we were paying on that debt. And then we're also cycling some of the payoff of some other -- payoff of some shorter-term debt with longer-term debt last year that took place that we also have to take into account. So you're absolutely correct in focusing in on that. Then as to the non-CareerBuilder elements of our Digital segment, we have a couple of small pieces in there that reflect businesses that were acquired in the last year or 2 where we are investing in their -- those businesses in a more meaningful way to scale them up, to ramp them up. And so from quarter-to-quarter, there's going to be some volatility in their earnings. And then at PointRoll, obviously, the good news at PointRoll is that they saw an 18% increase in the number of advertisers that worked with them this past quarter. They saw additional campaigns but they did see there is pretty much globally pressure on pricing. And so they, too, as a business are looking at redefining some of the things that they have historically been doing and repositioning themselves for other areas of growth.

I think the -- maybe to recalibrate, really state there isn't stage 1 and stage 2. In the markets where we are introducing the all access content model, at the same time we are also introducing for most of those markets single-copy price increases. So both of those things are going on at the same time. And so as a result, as I mentioned, and we shared in February, we expected that single-copy losses would be in the range of 30% to 40%. Actually, we're doing much better than that in the places where we have instituted that. And then on all access, we also gave ranges that we thought that the all access would impact circulation by about 5 percentage points more than the trend of circulation. In fact, we're doing better than that. On the digital-only, what I would say is that, that is another component of it. But the first 2 components we just talked about, at this point, are the lion's share of what we expect is going to drive the results that we've talked about, that $100 million contribution next year, et cetera. On the digital-only, that's something that we are now really focusing more on from a sense of marketing as well as from a sense of additional offerings, et cetera. But what I will tell you on that is that we are finding that most consumers that we're talking to want to have some frequency of home delivery of the print product in addition to their all access content of all of our digital platforms. That's the vast majority of the consumers that we are dealing with so far. And so that, we believe, is a good thing. But certainly for those who are nonsubscribers or who have not in the past had the experience of interacting with our content, this is a new opportunity for them and so we expect that, that will grow gradually. But none of that, to any degree, was built into the modeling that we did in any meaningful way. Most of it depended on the all access and the single-copy price actions."

I think on the digital revenue front on the Digital segment, a lot of that is driven by CareerBuilder. Some of that will depend obviously on where the jobs market goes, but some of that clearly depends on the great innovations that they have been doing around the product set. So we would anticipate, we're hopeful that our revenue growth in the third quarter will be at or above the level that we've generated in the second quarter. And from a margin perspective again and particularly in that segment, that's not an area where we manage margins quarter-to-quarter. We manage -- we always manage incredibly well from an expense perspective. We are diligent. We are fiscally responsible. We're managing to drive revenues because we know that by driving revenues, given the financial discipline we have, a lot of that money will flow to the bottom line so we feel very good about what we can accomplish there. And we obviously, there are going to be vagaries, particularly in small new businesses that start up, in investing in them, and we're not going to hold off on an investment just because a margin is at certain level in a certain quarter. But the one thing you can always count on that Gannett Co. to do is to be very fiscally prudent and we will make sure that every dollar that we spent on investment we have a clear track to providing ultimately a very strong return on those dollars."

This morning, I'm going to be discussing our second quarter results and further updating you on the growth strategy we announced at our Investor Day in February. As you also know, we provided a comprehensive update, both on our strategy and the quarter, at our presentation to the media and entertainment analysts of New York in late June. The transcripts and other documents from that presentation are available on the Investor Relations section of our website for those who would like to do a little bit of a deeper dive. So we'll be a little bit briefer today. 
Also today joining us is Dave Lougee who, as you know, heads Gannett Broadcasting. He'll be commenting and discussing Broadcasting's strong quarter and the outlook for the second half of the year. 
So now let's jump into it. It's been a busy quarter, but I believe a very productive one for our company. To start with, we continue to make strong progress on our strategic initiatives, including our new all access content subscription model. As of the end of the quarter, the program was up and running in about 38 of our markets and delivering as expected. In fact, the plan, though we are in the very early innings, helped deliver our first uptick in circulation revenue at U.S. Community Publishing literally in years. It goes without saying that we are extremely pleased with results thus far and much more to come. We rolled out 11 more markets in the last 2 weeks, and now, as they say, past performance is no guarantee but we are expecting larger total USCP circulation revenue gains going forward as the rollout continues. 
We're making good progress as well in our push into new businesses like Digital Marketing Services and sports that leverage our hometown and brand advantages. These advantages put Gannett in a unique position to succeed in the digital age. We are the trusted source of news and information in the 100-plus local markets we serve. The important role we've played has helped us build deep actionable relationships with both consumers and businesses. And in a world where more and more voices are fighting to be heard, we have seen that brands really matter. Our strong local and iconic national brands are not only recognized and trusted, they give us an important leg up over the competition. 
Digital Marketing Services is now fully operational in all of our TV markets and our top 35 publishing markets. We know that our business customers need and want these services, and they want them from a trusted partner like Gannett. Demand for our Digital Marketing Services is strong and is attracting significant new client relationships. It continues to generate new revenue growth for Gannett, and we're looking for revenue of $75 million to $100 million for the year from DMS and much more to come over the next few years. 
Thanks in part to DMS and the impact of the all access subscription model, our Digital revenue continues to climb. Digital revenues now account for nearly 1/4 of our total revenue company-wide. 
Our USA TODAY sports franchise is strong and getting stronger. We're working to make all of our assets work more effectively together and building a presence across all platforms. The USA TODAY Sports Media Group is now consistently ranked in the top 5 digital sports properties. We're moving ahead with a stronger, more pronounced voice that will be read, seen and heard across multiple platforms. And of course, as we do that, we're giving advertisers and marketers new opportunities to reach and engage with their customers. 
And of course, at Gannett, we're optimizing assets wherever we can. The Gannett Publishing Services team continues to find ways to operate more efficiently, drive costs out of the business and look for revenue opportunities. They're also improving the return on our assets, particularly our print capacity. And in June, we entered into an agreement that will enable us to reduce our costs for all of our third-party printing by over $60 million over the next 5 years. This agreement will also enable Gannett to place all of our printing and distribution assets into this vendor's network, enabling us to more effectively and efficiently market our excess manufacturing, packaging and distribution capacities. We're extending our commercial printing and distribution sales channel across their customer base. All in, GPS is on track to deliver a positive impact and contribution of approximately $40 million. 
And we've also been busy on the leadership front. In May, we announced that Larry Kramer, a journalist and digital media pioneer, now leads USA TODAY, and he's just brought in Dave Callaway as editor-in-chief. If anybody knows the intersection of journalism and digital media better than Larry and Dave, I'd be pretty surprised. We're confident that USA TODAY, our most recognizable brand, is in great hands under their leadership. 
In September, USA TODAY celebrates its 30th anniversary and will be relaunched as a terrific multi-platform news and information leader. And with a phenomenal brand in print, online and mobile and a growing audience, they have a great base from which to start. USATODAY.com is one of the most popular newspaper sites and the USA TODAY app is a top news app with almost 15 million downloads. Reflecting the proliferation of mobile devices and our strong product offerings, USA TODAY's mobile traffic was up strongly in June this year as page views increased 154% and total monthly visitors were 49% higher compared to June a year ago. And we look forward to even more growth as we relaunch our USA TODAY digital platforms in September. And we're all looking forward to Larry and his team driving USA TODAY to even greater heights. 
And as well, this month, we'll be welcoming our new CFO, Victoria Harker, to the team on July 23. We are absolutely delighted to have her, and you'll be hearing from her beginning with our third quarter earnings call. And I also want to recognize Michael Hart, our Treasurer, for doing a terrific job in this interim period until Victoria joins us. 
Before moving on, I just want to note that over the course of the last year or so, we've added strong depth and breadth to our leadership team. We have an excellent mix of Gannett veterans and talented newcomers, and I am convinced we have the people in place to drive both our strategy and the company forward and they are already beginning to prove that. 
When I look at Gannett today, what I see is a strong leadership team, a bold but achievable growth plan, a fortress balance sheet, and of course, an excellent team of 5,000-plus journalists, digital media experts and talented staff. I know we are all determined to win, and I'm certain of it. 
So now let's go to the highlights of the quarter. In the second quarter, earnings per share, excluding special items, were $0.56, which you saw this morning, which exceeds First Call's consensus estimates. They reflect robust results for Broadcasting, strong growth in Digital revenues company-wide and the positive impact of our strategic initiatives, particularly the all access content subscription model. And they also reflect, as we previously announced, an investment of approximately $30 million in our strategic initiatives. By the way, all in all, the results we reported this morning met or exceeded the guidance we gave at our MEANY presentation in June. 
So let's dig a little deeper. Total operating revenues, as you saw, were $1.31 billion, down just 2% from last year's quarter. Despite our initiative investments and the higher pension expense discussed in June, our expenses were well-controlled and we continued to find efficiencies. As a result, operating expenses were lower in the quarter compared to the quarter last year, particularly when you exclude special items. 
Each of our business segments, again, generated solid profitability in the quarter. Operating income, excluding special items, was $237 million while operating cash flow was $285 million. And free cash flow totaled $140 million. As you saw, we had $20 million in special items in the quarter, related to facility consolidation charges, workforce restructuring and a pension settlement charge. The facility consolidation and workforce restructuring charges impacted results in our Publishing segment while the pension charges are included in corporate expenses. Details are in our press release from this morning. 
Our initiative investments relate primarily to the new all access content subscription model, Digital Marketing Services and our digital relaunch. Each of these initiatives is important to our future, and as I noted earlier, each is gaining good traction. As we said in February, we fully expect them to more positively impact results in the latter half of this year and well beyond. 
Now approximately $28 million of those investments were in the Publishing segment, a little under $2 million in Broadcasting and the balance in the Digital segment. All of the special items and the strategic initiative expenses impact our operating income. 
Now let me turn to a quick review of our segments, and again Dave Lougee will provide a deep dive into Broadcasting in a few moments. It comes as no new news that Publishing continues to face secular headwinds and an uneven advertising market. We also know that the economic environment is tepid as a persistent 8%-plus unemployment rate and anemic retail sales reported this morning show us. Consumers and marketers are more cautious as a result. 
As a result of all this, the Publishing segment had a revenue decline of 5.5% overall on a constant-currency basis, but strong Digital revenue growth. Here again, it's important to note that our plans to revitalize the segment and return it to growth by 2015 as we said in February were not a 1- or 2-quarter phenomenon. We expect to do that by 2015. We are making progress and we are on track. 
Now advertising revenue was 8% lower in the quarter. The great news, however, is that circulation revenue was up in USCP, ahead of plan. Overall, for the company, it was down less than 1%. Volatility in advertising revenue reflected a lot of factors, including the calendar shift of some important dates for advertisers. Advertising revenue declines by month on a constant-currency basis were a bit of a roller coaster, approximately 12%, 2% and 9% for April, May and June, respectively, and consistent with the volatility we noted in June. 
Circulation revenue improved sequentially in the quarter, reflecting again the early successes we are seeing on the rollout of our subscription plan. As I mentioned earlier, this new model resulted in USCP having the increase of a little over 1% in circulation revenue in the quarter. 
As you can see, this plan will be of growing importance to our Publishing results, so let me switch gears for a moment and talk about the model in a little more detail. Now I'm sure that you've noticed that we insist on calling our plan an all access content subscription model while other publishers talk about pay walls. Well, why is that? Well, very simply put, our strategy is just simply different than theirs. In our strategy, content is king and the foundation of the model's success. Under the new plan, for a monthly fee, all subscribers in our markets will get access to all of our content on all digital platforms when and where they want it, all during the course of the day. And in addition to that, they'll have several home delivery options. The price points for the total subscription package increase with the frequency of home delivery choice, whether it's Sunday-only, home delivery or 3- or 4-day or full 7-day home delivery, the price points vary. Access, of course, to CareerBuilder and Cars.com is free, and nonsubscriber access is metered and limited. 
Projections are on track and by the end of 2013, we fully expect that USCP's subscription revenue will be about 25% higher. That translates to a roughly $100 million contribution to operating profit in 2013. 
Now let me give you an update on some of the metrics we are using to gauge our performance. As I noted, through the end of the quarter, the new subscription model was launched in 38 markets, reflecting 4 waves of launches. We have launched another 11 sites, our fifth wave, in early July. 
Let's start with the first 2 waves since they've been in place the longest. We continue to see positive results, sustained results for our initial wave of launches in February and expect to realize year-over-year total circulation revenue growth in the range of 25% at these locations once we cycle our longer-term subscriptions. We will cycle 26-week subscriptions for early launches later this month and into next and 52-week subscriptions for the early launches in late January or early February of next year. 
Now also let me share some very early results for the 2 waves that launched in April and May. In June, which would've been the first full month for those 2 waves, we generated year-over-year circulation revenue growth, depending on the location, in the range of 16% to 47%. Now that increase again doesn't reflect all subscribers with longer-term subscriptions. In June, the average increase was about 25%. But as I noted, we are still very early on in the process at these sites. 
On the advertising front, since there have been questions on that, total advertising revenue for our first wave performed better than projected in our business model. 
Now based on our first 3 waves, which represent 25 sites that all launched by early May, we are seeing daily home delivery losses that are better than the 5 percentage point incremental decline to trend the model projected. 
And then on the single-copy side, where you may recall we are instituting price increases of anywhere from 30% to 100% in some locations, daily single-copy circulation declines are significantly smaller than the model was based on, and we are below the low end of the range of projected Sunday single-copy circulation declines of 30% to 40%, so well on our way. 
In terms of digital subscribers, we are on pace to achieve our goal. For all of the sites launched through the end of the quarter, we have just over 16,500 digital subscribers. We have added another 4,500 since the MEANY presentation in late June alone. And as Bob Dickey noted at the MEANY presentation, we have not been aggressively marketing the digital-only subscription alternative to date, which is changing now that we have a new marketing campaign out there. The good news on this front is that these digital-only subscribers are a younger, very affluent demographic, new advertising and marketing targets that have been elusive for us in the past. 
The content subscription model played a role in helping year-over-year total revenue for U.S. Community Publishing. Close to 25% of U.S. Community properties had higher total revenues in the second quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. 
Now let me very briefly turn to the advertising categories in Publishing. Advertising revenue overall was about 8% lower in the quarter. Each of the advertising categories, retail, national and classified was volatile to varying degrees. Retail and classified had better comparisons in the second quarter relative to the first. Better classified advertising comparisons in the U.S. helped to close the gap. In fact, year-over-year comparisons for all the major classified categories were better compared to first quarter comparisons. 
In the U.S., classified advertising revenues were down 3.7%. Auto was actually up almost 1% and employment was just 0.7% lower. Digital revenues in Publishing were up almost 30% from last year, driven by growth in digital advertising and marketing services and growing contributions again from the new content subscription model. Digital revenues were up 33% in U.S. Community Publishing. At USA TODAY and its associated businesses, digital revenues were up 37% overall. And Newsquest digital revenue was up 10% in local currency. 
As you know, we have been very focused for some time on ensuring that we are the go-to source of digital marketing solutions in our local markets. Gannett Digital Marketing Services is positioning itself as a one-stop shop, offering a full suite of digital marketing solutions. The basic products include search-related marketing products like SEM and SEO, as well as e-mail marketing campaigns, website design and construction and social marketing. Our digital toolkit also includes daily deals and digital coupons. We are continuing to see strong results for these products, particularly at DealChicken, our daily deal site. We just celebrated DealChicken's one-year anniversary, and we saw another strong quarter of sequential improvement as second quarter revenue was up 20% compared to the first quarter. 
Now let me turn to expenses for a moment. Publishing's expenses, excluding special items, were down almost 3% in the quarter, including those $28 million of initiative investments. The initiative investments offset in part the impact of our successful cost efficiency efforts and facility consolidations in prior quarters. The rework by Publishing Services and our sourcing initiatives have clearly helped, as did a decline in newsprint expense of over 7%. 
Now regarding newsprint, a domestic regional price drop occurred in the second quarter driven by continued weakness in exports. These offshore shipments have declined sharply and are down nearly 30% year-to-date. And offshore shipments decline, downward price pressures grow. Market conditions are expected to favor publishers for the remainder of 2012, and prices for Newsquest were lower in the first half and are declining further in the latter half of the year. 
Turning to profitability in our Publishing segment. Operating income, excluding special items of about $15 million, totaled $119 million, and that includes that strategic investment spending I mentioned earlier. If you include both special items and the strategic initiative spending, the operating margin would have been 350 basis points higher than the reported margin. In U.S. Community Publishing, more than half of our sites had higher profitability compared to the second quarter last year. 
Now let me turn to the U.K. for a second. Newsquest continues to operate very well in a tough economy. Total revenues in pounds were about 4% lower in the quarter, but once again showed improved performance compared to the first quarter and will again, I believe, outpace their competition. Continued cost containment efforts resulted in a 6% expense reduction that outpaced the revenue decline. As a result, Newsquest and IBT, in pounds, was better year-over-year. 
Now let me quickly cover our Digital segment. As you saw, Digital segment revenues in the second quarter were up 4.5%. CareerBuilder's revenue grew 7%. Expenses were about 5% higher, reflecting higher costs at CB and digital strategic spending. Operating income for the Digital segment totaled $37 million, a 1% increase. If you exclude strategic spending in that segment, operating income would have been up 2.5%. As I noted earlier, digital advertising and marketing solutions, as well as the early impact of our subscription program, contributed to company-wide Digital revenue growth of 13% in the quarter. Digital revenues totaled almost $312 million or 24% of digital revenues company-wide. 
Now, 2 big even-year events, the Olympics and the elections, are shaping up very nicely for us. Dave is here to review Broadcasting's performance and provide some color around expected Olympic and political spending, as well as the outlook for the remainder of the year. Dave?"

For the second quarter, Broadcast revenues totaled $205 million, an increase of more than 11% compared to the same quarter last year. Our growth drivers were strong core advertising results, higher political demand and increases in digital and retransmission revenues. 
Core advertising was led by an increase in the auto category of almost 30%. Auto's been strong all year, but part of the growth this quarter is related to the negative impact last year of the Japanese tsunami, particularly in June. But several other top categories were also up in the quarter including medical, retail, local services, home improvement and financial services, offsetting losses in media and telecom spending. 
Political, which we'll talk a little bit more about later, totaled $11.8 million in the second quarter, an increase of $9 million over last year. Retransmission revenues were $23 million in the quarter, about 17% higher compared to the second quarter last year. Digital revenues and broadcasting were up 13%, and Captivate, itself, was up 15%. 
Total adjusted TV revenues, defined to exclude the incremental impact of our even-year political ad demand, were up 6.2%. Expenses in the Broadcasting segment were just -- were up just under 7%, due primarily to an increase in sales and marketing costs associated with the significant ramp-up in revenues and about $2 million in the initiative investments that Gracia referred to earlier. Excluding the strategic investments, operating expenses were up about 5%. 
Operating income, including the net impact of the strategic initiatives, was up almost 18% compared to the second quarter last year and totaled approximately $95 million. Operating cash flow was up just under -- was $102 million, an increase of just under 16%. 
Now we will have a very strong third quarter. We already have significantly more dollars on the books for the London Olympics than we finished with for the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and we still have inventory left to sell. Over a year ago, we decided to transform our Olympic sales process, and through training and investment, we are getting and frankly overachieving the results we had hoped for. Specifically, we've got a significant increase in local businesses who are advertising in the games on our stations. National Olympic sales are strong as well. When the closing ceremonies are complete, we'll end up $10 million to $12 million ahead of 2008, or in percentage terms, the low 40s or the low 50s. We are very proud of our team's performance. 
Now turning to political spending. As anticipated, it's shaping up to be very strong for us in the third and fourth quarter. As we've indicated in the past, our portfolio of strong new stations in the presidential swing states has us very well positioned and that's proving to be true. Specifically, spending in Ohio, Colorado, Florida and Virginia is robust and growing. We've also got some key Senate races in Missouri, Virginia and Maine, and we'll have numerous contested House seats as we always have in the years past. 
It's worth noting that inventory management and pricing are far more strategic issues than ever in terms of successfully managing the demand of political business. That's because of how late the political dollars are now booked for strategic purposes on the part of the campaigns and the packs and the amount of inventory they can take in targeted markets. 
A lot of money can be made or lost depending on the sophistication of the station's process for managing that demand. To that end, we centralized our sales trafficking process 2 years ago so that we can have a centralized view of inventory at all times, and through software and tracking of political spending trends, we can assist the stations in making better real-time pricing decisions, which benefits us and all our advertisers, both core and political. 
Based on current trends, we expect the percentage increase in third quarter TV ad revenues to be up in the low 30s compared to the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the incremental impact of Olympics and political. However, because the majority of our political advertising will be placed later in the quarter, it's too early to call that number with much precision. Gracia?"

It's obviously great to be in television, especially Gannett television this year. Now quickly, I want to turn to some balance sheet items before we open it up for questions. As you know, our new capital allocation plan included a 150% div",457,"Thanks, Dave. It's obviously great to be in television, especially Gannett television this year. 
Now quickly, I want to turn to some balance sheet items before we open it up for questions. As you know, our new capital allocation plan included a 150% dividend increase to $0.80 per share on an annual basis and a $300 million share repurchase authorization targeted to be completed over the next 2 years. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased 3.4 million shares at a cost of $45.5 million. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.66 billion of debt and our all-in cost of debt currently stands at about 6.75%. Cash at quarter end was 212 -- $202 million. We spent $20 million on capital expenditures. And free cash flow totaled $140 million in the quarter after a $22 million contribution to our pension plan. 
We've contributed about $76 million to the pension plan through the first half of the year. Our guidance had anticipated contributions of approximately $118 million in 2012. However, recent changes in legislation have reduced the required funding in the near to medium term. We now anticipate that we will contribute a total of $94 million for the entire year. 
At the end of this year -- at the end of last year, our principal pension plan was about 82% funded. The impact of the new legislation will move the funded percentage up to the 90% to 95% range. We expect there will also be an impact on next year's funding, but it is still a little too early to call. 
Finally, before I open it up for questions, I wanted to remind you that similar to this quarter, we expect the third quarter to reflect continued investments in our strategic initiatives and higher pension expense. Initiative investment is expected to total roughly $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter, and the increase in pension expense will be about $5 million. 
So to sum up, we are making meaningful progress on all fronts to make Gannett a winner in the digital age. Our initiatives are gaining traction, and there's much more to come. Robust Olympics and political advertising seasons, as Dave said, lie ahead and our all access subscription program is delivering. Second quarter expenses are down despite $30 million in initiative investments as we continue to manage our business carefully. 
We are making sound investments in our future. Our strong financial position will enable us to deliver on our plan to return approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases by 2015, while making the investments we need to make for our business and our future. And with that, Dave and I will be happy to take your questions."

But our core for the second quarter finished up about 5%. But frankly, we had some political displacement in June in some of our key political markets where the political funnel began in mid-May. So if you extrapolate the core that we displaced in June, we probably were up closer to 6.5% and 7% if we'd not had that political in core in the second quarter. Where third quarter will end is very difficult to say for us because the Olympics so much affects our inventory and especially political. But it is pacing very good right now. That pace -- and that's industry-wide as core advertisers place their business early in advance of political demand, so it's very difficult to say where it will finish, but the fundamentals appear to be strong. Specifically, auto remains very strong, and frankly, is tracking along with the good sales data that we're all seeing on car sales."

And then when you think about the markets we have like Cleveland, Tampa, St. Louis, Denver, which are going to be very heavy from a swing state perspective, that's going to also result in the displacement. So the core will be, I think as you look into September, artificially lower because of that significant displacement factor that's very focused on a finite set of market."

And then, Alexia, on the other parts of our business, we feel very good about the progress on the Publishing side that we're making on circulation. And you saw that U.S. Community Publishing had circulation revenue growth a little over 1%. We would fully expect that, that number would be reasonably higher in the third quarter as the launches continue to take hold and we launch more sites, so that will be a very nice story for Publishing in the third quarter. I hesitate to really comment on advertising because the level of volatility, and as Dave said, the placement of advertising very late, makes it really difficult to hone in on trends. You saw the volatility that we just came through in the second quarter. But a lot will obviously depend on consumers and marketers and how they feel. Olympics will be good for USA TODAY and our sports group there. We're starting out the quarter as we would have expected so a lot will be said over these next few months. And it's -- and obviously, this quarter, September is a very important month with the back-to-school trends that we'll see. So it's just a little early. We'll make sure that we keep everybody updated as the quarter unfolds. And then Newsquest, of course, is doing a terrific job and outperforming their regional press competition on the top line side and certainly on the bottom line side as well. And then on the Digital segment part, CareerBuilder continues to post very good numbers despite what is a very high unemployment rate and a tepid view of the economy. But I think that a lot of the product innovation that they have done at CareerBuilder has resulted in them being able to post very strong numbers even in light of a difficult job environment. And then obviously, for them on the international front, they've done some good acquisitions and that part of the business is a strong positive for them. So we feel good about where we are headed this coming quarter, feel good about the progress we're making on a lot of fronts. The economy, as it will for a lot of industries, will ultimately determine how things go, but broadcast obviously is going to be a terrific home run for us in the third quarter."

In the third quarter, John, it's sort of hard to tell as Gracia and I referred earlier, because frankly, our numbers are so artificially strong. We've got, in addition to the Olympics, we've got some key NFL football games. We own the Denver Broncos inventory in the preseason with Peyton Manning and all that's attached to that in Denver, which is also a key political state, et cetera, et cetera. So we've got an extraordinarily strong inventory position, so our -- we'll have a disproportionately high share of revenues.

But even when you extract those revenues related to the Jubilee as kind of a one-off event, our numbers would have sequentially been better than the first quarter. And I think if you look at total ad rev, it would have been less than 0.5% impact on ad revenues. So I think a lot of the work that the folks in the U.K., Paul Davidson and his team, are doing on initiatives of their own, revenue initiatives of their own as well as continuing to do a terrific job from an expense standpoint, have put them in a good position to navigate what are even more difficult waters in the U.K."

Let me take the second question first, separation versus integration. You heard us talk a lot about, and I'll ask Dave to comment on this as well, talk a lot about our Digital Marketing Services and talk about the tremendous scale that we have locally. We don't think of these as newspaper markets or broadcast markets. We think of these as local media markets where we have tremendous brands, strong deep relationships with advertisers and marketers. And scale, the scale that, that provides us being in 100-plus local markets. So for instance, when we're thinking about Digital Marketing Services and we're executing against that, you heard me say that we've already rolled it out to all of our TV markets and our top 35 U.S. Community Publishing markets, and we'll be rolling out the rest of them over the course of the year. That's because Digital Marketing Services is something that transcends the platform that you're on, whether it's TV or print because it's a digital opportunity for you. And in each of our markets, we have a strong digital market, digital presence, lots of different digital platforms from mobile to desktop to print and television. So we actually see that as a tremendous advantage for us to have that kind of scale across so many markets, to have those deep brand relationships, deep advertiser and marketing relationships. And we are a trusted advisor to advertisers and marketers in those communities, whether we start from the print platform or the television platform. And Dave, you might mention some of the successes you're seeing on the Digital Marketing side."

The fulfillment structure that we've got in place that we're allowed to have in place scaled across our company gives us the ability to take to market a product that our competitors do not. And we are already seeing a sweet spot in the marketplace. I think as Gracia talked about at MEANY, simply put, we have thousands and thousands of local clients and businesses that are getting 20 to 35 calls a month from search and social and SEO and marketing -- different marketing vendors; we come in as a one-stop shop offering and they love it. We're seeing tremendous early success so we're in a position where we're now -- we're getting the supply to meet the demand, which is a high-class problem, as we like to call it. And just to add on to Gracia's point, from a broadcaster's perspective, the ability to be part of a company with 100 local markets and a national brand is something that's unique for us from a strategic standpoint because as the economy recovers, the growth will be in local. And our ability to take to market scaled products in 100 local markets is a differentiator for us as the Broadcast division."

I talked about DealChicken today and when you think about what we've done with DealChicken, scaling that up from one market in September of 2010 to 60 markets a short year later, doing that at an incredibly low cost base but generating results that are very good, it's because people know us, people understand us and it isn't our only product. It is part of a full suite of products that we can provide on the Digital Marketing Services to meet the needs of those folks. And so that's just another example of what I think is the terrific integration we see across both our newspapers as well as our television stations. On the Publishing expense profile side, we always will do a good job on the expense side. I can't, this early in the quarter, give you a sense of where we think things will end up. A lot of that will depend, obviously, on the top line picture. But I will say that given the strength of the Digital Marketing Services and the -- what we're seeing is terrific demand for this. You may see us doing some strategic adds to sales forces. We also are adding selectively to our content, local content generation resources, because of our content subscription model. So I think we'll make some strategic investments that make really good sense that we're able to monetize very quickly. Whether it's in that quarter or not, we're not managing for quarter-to-quarter. We're managing for really meeting the demand that we are seeing. So we'll do the great job we always do on expenses. That won't be an issue."

Yes, we refinanced, obviously, part of the notes that came due in -- from cash as well as from our revolving credit agreement. Our revolving credit agreement right now has -- is tied to LIBOR, whatever LIBOR is these days. And so that borrowing is around 2.5%, 2.6% versus the higher rate we were paying on that debt. And then we're also cycling some of the payoff of some other -- payoff of some shorter-term debt with longer-term debt last year that took place that we also have to take into account. So you're absolutely correct in focusing in on that. Then as to the non-CareerBuilder elements of our Digital segment, we have a couple of small pieces in there that reflect businesses that were acquired in the last year or 2 where we are investing in their -- those businesses in a more meaningful way to scale them up, to ramp them up. And so from quarter-to-quarter, there's going to be some volatility in their earnings. And then at PointRoll, obviously, the good news at PointRoll is that they saw an 18% increase in the number of advertisers that worked with them this past quarter. They saw additional campaigns but they did see there is pretty much globally pressure on pricing. And so they, too, as a business are looking at redefining some of the things that they have historically been doing and repositioning themselves for other areas of growth. So I think that sort of, in a nutshell, gets you to what I think you're looking at. Hopefully, that was helpful."

I think the -- maybe to recalibrate, really there isn't stage 1 and stage 2. In the markets where we are introducing the all access content model, at the same time we are also introducing for most of those markets single-copy price increases. So both of those things are going on at the same time. And so as a result, as I mentioned, and we shared in February, we expected that single-copy losses would be in a range of 30% to 40%. Actually, we're doing much better than that in the places where we have instituted that. And then on all access, we also gave ranges that we thought that the all access would impact circulation by about 5 percentage points more than the trend of circulation. In fact, we're doing better than that. On the digital-only, what I would say is that, that is another component of it. But the first 2 components we just talked about, at this point, are the lion's share of what we expect is going to drive the results that we've talked about, that $100 million contribution next year, et cetera. On the digital-only, that's something that we are now really focusing more on from a sense of marketing as well as from a sense of additional offerings, et cetera. But what I will tell you on that is that we are finding that most consumers that we're talking to want to have some frequency of home delivery of the print product in addition to their all access content of all of our digital platforms. That's the vast majority of the consumers that we are dealing with so far. And so that, we believe, is a good thing. But certainly for those who are nonsubscribers or who have not in the past had the experience of interacting with our content, this is a new opportunity for them and so we expect that, that will grow gradually. But none of that, to any degree, was built into the modeling that we did in any meaningful way. Most of it depended on the all access and the single-copy price actions."

I think on the digital revenue front on the Digital segment, a lot of that is driven by CareerBuilder. Some of that will depend obviously on where the jobs market goes, but some of that clearly depends on the great innovations that they have been doing around the product set. So we would anticipate, we're hopeful that our revenue growth in the third quarter will be at or above the level that we've generated in the second quarter. And from a margin perspective again, particularly in that segment, that's not an area where we manage margins quarter-to-quarter. We manage -- we always manage incredibly well from an expense perspective. We are diligent. We are fiscally responsible. We're managing to drive revenues because we know that by driving revenues, given the financial discipline we have, a lot of that money will flow to the bottom line so we feel very good about what we can accomplish there. And we -- obviously, there are going to be vagaries, particularly in small new businesses that start up, in investing in them, and we're not going to hold off on an investment just because a margin is a certain level in a certain quarter. But the one thing you can always count on that Gannett Co. to do is to be very fiscally prudent and we will make sure that every dollar that we spent on investment we have a clear track to providing ultimately a very strong return on those dollars."

As Jeff said, I'll begin with the highlights of the quarter in which we, I am extremely pleased to report, delivered both strong revenue and profitability growth ahead of expectations. I will also update you on the excellent progress we're making on implementing our growth strategy. We'll then do a deeper dive on performance before taking your questions. 
Bob Dickey, who is in charge of our local domestic Publishing operations; and Dave Lougee, who heads Gannett Broadcasting, are here with me today as is Victoria Harker, our CFO. Bob and Dave will talk about the significant contributions their teams made to our excellent results this morning. Bob will provide an update on our All Access content subscription model that helped us achieve our first company-wide circulation revenue increase since early 2007 and continues to build. 
Dave and his team at Broadcasting delivered a quarter that was simply outstanding, the best television third quarter in our history. In his comments, Dave will talk about the business, including the impact of Olympic and political advertising, which drove a 36% increase in Broadcasting revenue. He'll also discuss the outlook for political spending in the fourth quarter, which should be quite robust. 
So let's get started with a quick update on our results. Top line, I'm very, very pleased with our performance this quarter, in which we returned to growth, revenue growth by delivering a 3% increase in operating revenues. Broadcasting is the headliner this quarter, and we also delivered our 6% increase in company-wide circulation revenue, and CareerBuilder delivered another strong performance that drove a nearly 5% increase in Digital segment revenues alone. 
On the expense side, we invested about $10 million in our strategic initiatives this quarter while continuing to focus on creating efficiencies and tightly managing costs. For the quarter, operating income, excluding special items, was up 12%, and net income attributable to Gannett on the same basis was 23% higher. Earnings per share for the quarter, both including and excluding special items, were $0.56, thus a $0.12 per share or 27% increase compared to last year's earnings per share. All in all, a very strong showing that we'll explore in more detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll update you on our growth strategy. 
As you've heard us say, our strategy has 3 components: First, we are enhancing our local core news and marketing businesses; secondly, leveraging our hometown and brand advantages and accelerating growth by entering or expanding into new high potential businesses; and thirdly, we're optimizing our assets and maintaining our strong financial profile to fund growth and deliver increased value to shareholders. 
We're making great progress on all 3 fronts to position Gannett for success in the digital age. Here are just a few highlights. First, as I said, our All Access subscription model. As of October 15, the new model is up and successfully running in 71 markets, and we're on track to complete the rollout by year end. If you recall, our approach starts from the premise that people want and find great value in our content and are willing to pay for it. We also know that more and more consumers want to access content on digital platforms. Our model takes all of this into account and delivers reliable, timely and compelling content to consumers via the print and digital platforms they prefer. And I'm pleased to report the formula is working. 
I'm going to steal a little bit of Bob Dickey's thunder and say that our local domestic Publishing operations had a 10% increase in circulation revenue in the third quarter. That's the second straight quarter of circulation revenue growth in local Publishing and a terrific result. 
Now just a reminder that we won't see the full impact until the end of next year but at that point, we expect subscription revenue at our local domestic Publishing sites will be 25% higher than it was at the beginning of this year. That buildout and ramp-up translates into about $100 million contribution to 2013 operating profit. 
Digital Marketing Services or DMS is another key component of our strategy and a great example of how we're accelerating growth by entering high potential businesses where we have a hometown and a brand advantage. Now it's no secret that local businesses are spending more of their ad and marketing dollars on digital services. What's not as well-known is that navigating the complex and fragmented digital landscape is hard work, particularly for someone running a car dealership or a plumbing supply company or a landscaping business. That's where we come in. We know media and we've worked closely with tens of thousands of local businesses for years and decades. We're a trusted partner who can offer a full digital marketing product set tailored to each business's needs. 
Our DMS rollout is on track and hit a key milestone in the third quarter when we completed the rollout across all of our domestic markets. Demand for these services is strong, revenue is growing at a good pace and we are excited about the long-term prospects for DMS. 
Now as you know, the digital space doesn't stand still, so we're constantly looking for opportunities to augment our offerings. We made 2 important bolt-on acquisitions in the third quarter to strengthen our hand. In August, we acquired Blink Media, which specializes in social engagement advertising and has managed social marketing campaigns for over 600 of the world's largest advertisers. Their ability to deliver social media marketing solutions on the local level further positions our DMS business for growth. 
And then in September, we acquired Mobestream Media, which is the developer of the Key Ring consumer loyalty app for smartphones. More than 5 million users have downloaded the free Key Ring app that allows consumers to scan and store existing loyalty cards, join new reward programs and receive mobile coupons. Key Ring's connection with consumers and its strong retailer relationships give us another leg up in the digital marketing space. 
And in September, we also relaunched USA TODAY. This iconic brand has been redesigned for today's audience and reimagined as a print and digital powerhouse. When it was introduced 30 years ago, USA TODAY was a truly revolutionary idea to leverage the leading-edge technology of the today to deliver news nationally and in attractive easy-to-read format. We believe that in its new incarnation, USA TODAY can make the same kind of impact with today's consumers, and in the process provide a great marketing platform. Larry Kramer and his team are doing a good job with USA TODAY and early returns are promising. Watch for more to come. 
Now I'd like to pivot to asset optimization, specifically our real estate portfolio. As we've discussed before, we are actively engaged in finding ways to use our real estate assets more efficiently to enhance shareholder value. Gannett has been actively managing its real estate portfolio for many years. Since 2005, we sold more than 2 million square feet of office space, notwithstanding the severe 2008 to '10 real estate downturn. We currently have more than 3 million square feet of office space actively on the market out of our total U.S. portfolio of about 14 million feet. 
I also want to be clear that as we look to optimize our real estate portfolio, none of our facilities, including our Tyson's Corner building, are off the table. We already have tenants in the headquarters facility, and we're actively marketing additional space. We are open to all options on any other building in the portfolio if the economics makes sense. And as with all of our assets, we will be opportunistic. 
As I turn to the third quarter review, I want to assure you that while we have covered a lot of ground executing on our strategy in a very short time, there is a lot more we will do. We're playing offense and thus far achieving the results we've anticipated. Our third quarter results are already beginning to show the favorable impact of our early successes. Needless to say, I'm extremely pleased to report the return to revenue growth and the significant percentage increase in EPS compared to last year. 
The top line numbers are the result of solid performance in each of our businesses, as I noted. Now as we always do, as we focus on building the business, we also are keeping tight control on costs and making prudent investments in our strategic initiatives. Those investments amounted to about $10 million in the quarter, and we had additional pension expense of about $5 million compared to last year. 
Including the investments and pension expense but excluding special items, we generated $280 million in operating cash flow this quarter, a 10% increase from the third quarter a year ago. Free cash flow totaled $162 million. 
Now regarding special items, very quickly approximately $15 million of them affected operating income. We also had a small non-cash charge related to a newspaper partnership investment that impacted nonoperating income. And finally, offsetting the charges was a net tax benefit of approximately $13 million related to a tax decision covering multiple years. Details of all of these are in our press release. 
So let me now turn to a quick review of our segments. Total Publishing segment revenues were 3% lower in the quarter as a result of a decrease of approximately 6% -- 7% in advertising spending, offset by our circulation growth. This is the best year-over-year total Publishing revenue comparison since the first quarter of 2007. 
Circulation revenue at our local domestic Publishing operations was up almost 10%, and we had our second consecutive quarterly increase in circulation revenue there. Before I hand the discussion over to Bob, I wanted to note that he and his team have done just an exceptional job rolling out this model. Bob?"

At quarter's end, our new All Access subscription model was in place at 69 U.S. Community Publishing markets, and we remain on target to complete the rollout by mid-November. We're on track to realize subscription revenue increases of about 25% to prelaunch levels. Our projections continue to indicate those increases will yield a $100 million improvement in operating profit in 2013. 
It is still early as longer-term subscriptions have not yet cycled in many markets. In September, we generated year-over-year subscription revenue growth, and depending on the wave, it ranged from 13% to 31%. 
Based on our first 6 waves, which represents 60 markets that all launched by early August, we are seeing daily home delivery losses of approximately 4.9 percentage points beyond the prelaunch trends, just better than the 5 percentage points that we had in our model. 
Sunday home delivery losses for those same waves are at about 6.8 percentage points beyond the prelaunch trends as we cycle the coupon craze of last year. And then on the single-copy side, where you may recall we are increasing rates anywhere from 30% to 100%, daily single copy circulation volumes have declined 3.1 percentage points from trend, significantly less than the projections in our model. And on Sunday, single-copy volumes have declined 11.2 percentage points from trend across those same markets, also better than our initial projections. 
We continue to make strong progress in acquiring digital subscribers, with roughly 30,000 at the end of the quarter, an 80% increase over Q2. We found that approximately 40% of our digital subscribers have some prior history of home delivery subscriptions. These are lapsed former subscribers who transitioned to digital. We are now able to recapture those consumers as paying subscribers after reducing access to just a few articles each month for nonsubscribers. 
Digital subscription revenue came in just shy of our model for the quarter. We should stress that our digital subscription -- subscriber acquisition to date has been largely organic. Now that we have substantially completed the rollout, we're in Phase 2 in the process of implementing a digital marketing strategy to drive acquisition as our subscriber and revenue targets ramp going into 2013. 
Currently, about 720,000 subscribers have activated the digital access on their accounts, which is on pace to achieve our goal of 60% subscriber activation in year one."

Now let me turn to the advertising categories in Publishing, where advertising continues to be impacted by the slow pace of economic recovery, weak job growth and certain secular pressures. We did not interestingly",850,"Thanks very much, Bob, for that update. Now let me turn to the advertising categories in Publishing, where advertising continues to be impacted by the slow pace of economic recovery, weak job growth and certain secular pressures. We did not interestingly experienced the same level of volatility we saw on the first and second quarters. As expected, advertising results were better than in the second quarter, and September was the best month of the third quarter. 
In terms of major ad categories, retail comparisons were in line with second quarter comparisons. National advertising comps were considerably better than both first and second quarter comps, and classified advertising comps improved slightly from the second quarter. A lot of additional advertising category detail is contained in our press release this morning. 
Publishing segment digital revenues were up significantly in the quarter and posted a gain of nearly 65%. The growth was due to revenue associated with the All Access content subscription model, as well as our digital advertising and marketing solutions. As a reminder, those revenues are included in the Publishing categories in our income statement. 
At our local domestic Publishing operations, digital revenues were up 76%, again due in part to the new subscription model, as well as our DMS efforts. We saw substantial digital revenue increases as well at USA TODAY and its associated businesses. USA TODAY digital revenue was up about 70%, and Newsquest increased by approximately 10% in pounds. 
Digital Marketing Services is attracting more advertisers and their business. For instance, Deal Chicken, just one of the many products in the suite of Digital Marketing Services, was about 3x larger in the third quarter this year compared to last year. We believe there is plenty of demand for DMS products with lots of room to grow. 
Turning to expenses in the Publishing segment, excluding special items but including initiative spending, they were relatively unchanged this quarter. The increase was just over $3 million, including approximately $9 million of strategic initiative investment. We continue to benefit from our cost efficiency efforts and facility consolidations. As well, newsprint expense was about 11% lower to both -- due to both lower volume and lower usage prices. 
Let me just spend one second on Newsprint. Prices held stable throughout the third quarter, while the outcome of a regional price increase announced for the fourth quarter remains quite uncertain. Nonetheless, market conditions continue to favor publishers as exports weakened and an eastern mill reopens. And in the U.K., for Newsquest, news from prices have declined for the second half. 
Now turning to the profitability in our Publishing segment. Operating income for the quarter was $86 million, excluding special items of over $12 million but including about $9 million of initiative investments. If you exclude the net impact of our strategic initiative investments and special items, the operating margin would have been about 240 basis points higher than reported and expense is almost 1% lower. 
Let me touch briefly on Newsquest. The management team there is executing well in an extremely challenging economy. Total revenues, as you saw, were down about 7% in pounds. However, on a percentage basis, expense reductions outpaced revenue declines, and as a result, operating income was just 2% lower and the operating margin actually improved from the third quarter last year. 
Now let me quickly cover our Digital segment. Revenues in the Digital segment grew again this quarter by approximately 5%. As I mentioned earlier, CareerBuilder had another solid quarter with revenue growth of almost 7%. Higher expenses associated with CareerBuilder's revenue growth and digital strategic spending drove an increase in expenses of just 2%, and as a result, operating income was over 16% higher and totaled almost $40 million. 
Company-wide, digital revenues increased by 23% and totaled almost $335 million in the quarter. Digital advertising and marketing solutions, as well as the early impact of the content subscription program, contributed to the growth. Digital revenues company-wide now account for more than 25% of total revenues. 
Now finally, almost saving the best for last, moving to the Broadcasting segment. As I noted, the management of our TV station group achieved a record level of third quarter revenues and operating results. In doing so, they did a fantastic job of leveraging top ratings and a great footprint to capture significant Olympic and political spending. 
Broadcasting also had solid growth in retransmission revenue, with more to come. For the quarter, revenues in Broadcasting segment were up 36% to $237 million. Now that's a great number but an even greater achievement is the bottom line result. Operating income was over $118 million, that's 73% higher compared to the third quarter last year, and it's an increase of over $15 million on a revenue increase of $63 million. So no question, the third quarter was a tremendous one for our Broadcasting segment. 
Dave Lougee is now going to discuss some details of the Olympic and political spending and what his team did to maximize those revenue opportunities, and he will also give us a preview on political spending for the fourth quarter. Dave?"

As a",574,"Thank you, Gracia. Gracia touched on the Olympics. We had a great scaled editorial presence in London to complement NBC's terrific coverage, and we were able to use that to showcase our hometown athletes like Denver's Missy Franklin in many new ways. As a result, KUSA in Denver was the top-rated major market NBC affiliate in the adults 25-54 demographic. Our stations in Minneapolis, Atlanta and St. Louis placed in the top five, and when you add Cleveland and Phoenix, we had 6 of the top 10 rated in that demographic. 
On the revenue side, we've put in place a year-long Olympic sales transformation process of training and execution and are very pleased with our team's results. We brought a lot of new local advertisers and partners in to the Olympics and are already working with them on packages for the Sochi Winter Olympics in 16 months. 
We finished the Olympics with a record $37 million in billing, which includes $4 million of political and that's up 58% from the Beijing Olympics in 2008. It's hard for us to put an exact number on how much of that billing is incremental to the quarter, but we put in a range of 55% to 65%. 
On political advertising, we had a record third quarter as well. We built $42 million in political revenue compared to $26 million in 2008. As we said earlier this year, we have a strong political footprint, with large and strong stations serving the presidential swing states of Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Colorado. Spending has been very strong, as you all know, and we are taking very good shares of that business. Our stations have done a tremendous job with both technology and psychology and pricing and managing our inventory quickly. The technology is our centralized traffic operations, along with our inventory yield management software. That's allowed us to minimize displacement of our core revenues but like all strong stations in heavy political states, we did have core displacement in September because of the record levels of political demand. 
All of those same dynamics are in place and then some for a record fourth quarter in political. It's too early to put a number on it as the heaviest booking days of the year are still ahead of us. But there's no question, it will be a new high. 
Beyond presidential, big spending is now kicking in for the Virginia U.S. Senate race, and we have numerous contested House races across the division, as well as some key local issues. 
On retransmission consent, many of you likely heard that we just completed a retransmission consent agreement with The Dish Network. We are pleased that we were able to come to terms without our viewers losing service, although we did have to warn them of a possible disruption, which was the first time we've ever had to do that with a major distributor. With Dish, we have agreed to strict confidentiality terms that won't allow us to discuss the terms of that agreement just like we don't discuss the terms of any of our agreements. But generically, we will point to our past numbers that show our stations have always allowed us in the past to get top of market rates on retransmission consent. We have 2 more agreements up in the end of this year, one large and one somewhat smaller, and we'll have good 2013 guidance for you in September."

Employment has been a little bit of a tougher slot given what is really an anemic employment picture. But when I think about CareerBuilder, they have done just a fabulous job on new product innovation. They have seen some strong growth here that I think focuses less on the anemic job market but more on the additional products that they are bringing to market to assist companies in their attempts to find the best talent. This quarter, they did an acquisition of Economic Modeling Specialist International or EMSI. They have an economics software that specializes in employment data and labor market analysis. And CareerBuilder had been investing in a workforce analytics platform that tracks hiring and job search trends, and so this kind of just turbocharges that effort to look at real-time labor information in varying markets and help us to help companies who are looking for certain kinds of employees do a better job at understanding where they can find those employees.

I will also update you on the excellent progress we're making on implementing our growth strategy. We'll then do a deeper dive on performance before taking your questions.
Bob Dickey, who is in charge of our local domestic publishing operations; and Dave Lougee, who heads Gannett Broadcasting, are here with me today, as is Victoria Harker, our CFO. Bob and Dave will talk about the significant contributions their teams made to our excellent results this morning. Bob will provide an update on our all access content subscription model that helped us achieve our first company-wide circulation revenue increase since early 2007, and continues to build.
Dave and his team at Broadcasting delivered a quarter that was simply outstanding, the best television third quarter in our history. In his comments, Dave will talk about the business, including the impact of Olympic and political advertising, which drove a 36% increase in Broadcasting revenue. He'll also discuss the outlook for political spending in the fourth quarter, which should be quite robust.
So let's get started with a quick update on our results. Top line, I'm very, very pleased with our performance this quarter, in which we returned to growth, revenue growth, by delivering a 3% increase in operating revenues.
Broadcasting is the headliner this quarter, and we also delivered our 6% increase in company-wide circulation revenue. And CareerBuilder delivered another strong performance that drove a nearly 5% increase in Digital segment revenues alone.
On the expense side, we invested about $10 million in our strategic initiatives this quarter while continuing to focus on creating efficiencies and tightly managing costs.
For the quarter, operating income, excluding special items, was up 12%, and net income attributable to Gannett on the same basis was 23% higher. Earnings per share for the quarter, both including and excluding special items, were $0.56. That's a $0.12 per share or 27% increase compared to last year's earnings per share. All in all, a very strong showing that we'll explore in more detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll update you on our growth strategy.
As you've heard us say, our strategy has 3 components: first, we are enhancing our local core news and marketing businesses; secondly, leveraging our hometown and brand advantages and accelerating growth by entering or expanding into new high-potential businesses; and thirdly, we're optimizing our assets and maintaining our strong financial profile to fund growth and deliver increased value to shareholders.
We're making great progress on all 3 fronts to position Gannett for success in the digital age. Here are just a few highlights. First, as I said, our All Access subscription model.
As of October 15, the new model is up and successfully running in 71 markets, and we're on track to complete the rollout by year end. If you recall, our approach starts from the premise that people want and find great value in our content and are willing to pay for it. We also know that more and more consumers want to access content on digital platforms. Our model takes all of this into account and delivers reliable, timely and compelling content to consumers via the print and digital platforms they prefer. And I'm pleased to report the formula is working.
I'm going to steal a little bit of Bob Dickey's thunder and say that our local domestic publishing operations had a 10% increase in circulation revenue in the third quarter. That's the second straight quarter of circulation revenue growth in local publishing, and a terrific result.
Now just a reminder that we won't see the full impact until the end of next year but, at that point, we expect subscription revenue at our local domestic publishing sites will be 25% higher than it was at the beginning of this year. That build-out and ramp-up translates into about $100 million contribution to 2013 operating profit.
Digital Marketing Services, or DMS, is another key component of our strategy and a great example of how we're accelerating growth by entering high-potential businesses where we have a hometown and a brand advantage.
Now it's no secret that local businesses are spending more of their ad and marketing dollars on digital services. What's not as well known is that navigating the complex and fragmented digital landscape is hard work, particularly for someone running a car dealership or a plumbing supply company or a landscaping business. That's where we come in. We know media, and we've worked closely with tens of thousands of local businesses for years and decades. We're a trusted partner who can offer a full digital marketing product set tailored to each business's needs.
Our DMS rollout is on track and hit a key milestone in the third quarter when we completed the rollout across all of our domestic markets. Demand for these services is strong, revenue is growing at a good pace and we are excited about the long-term prospects for DMS.
Now as you know, the digital space doesn't stand still, so we're constantly looking for opportunities to augment our offerings. We made 2 important bolt-on acquisitions in the third quarter to strengthen our hand.
In August, we acquired BLiNQ Media, which specializes in social engagement advertising and has managed social marketing campaigns for over 600 of the world's largest advertisers. Their ability to deliver social media marketing solutions on the local level further positions our DMS business for growth.
And then in September, we acquired Mobestream Media, which is the developer of the Key Ring consumer loyalty app for smartphones. More than 5 million users have downloaded the free Key Ring app that allows consumers to scan and store existing loyalty cards, join new reward programs and receive mobile coupons. Key Ring's connection with consumers and its strong retailer relationships give us another leg up in the digital marketing space.
And, in September, we also relaunched USA TODAY. This iconic brand has been redesigned for today's audience and reimagined as a print and digital powerhouse. When it was introduced 30 years ago, USA TODAY was a truly revolutionary idea to leverage the leading-edge technology of the day to deliver news nationally in an attractive, easy-to-read format. We believe that, in its new incarnation, USA TODAY can make the same kind of impact with today's consumers and, in the process, provide a great marketing platform. Larry Kramer and his team are doing a good job with USA TODAY, and early returns are promising. Watch for more to come.
Now I'd like to pivot to asset optimization, specifically our real estate portfolio. As we've discussed before, we are actively engaged in finding ways to use our real estate assets more efficiently to enhance shareholder value. Gannett has been actively managing its real estate portfolio for many years. Since 2005, we sold more than 2 million square feet of office space, notwithstanding the severe 2008 to '10 real estate downturn. We currently have more than 3 million square feet of office space actively on the market out of our total U.S. portfolio of about 14 million feet.
I also want to be clear that as we look to optimize our real estate portfolio, none of our facilities, including our Tyson's Corner building, are off the table. We already have tenants in the headquarters facility, and we're actively marketing additional space. We are open to all options on any other building in the portfolio if the economics makes sense. And as with all of our assets, we will be opportunistic.
As I turn to the third quarter review, I want to assure you that while we have covered a lot of ground executing on our strategy in a very short time, there is a lot more we will do. We're playing offense and thus far, achieving the results we've anticipated. Our third quarter results are already beginning to show the favorable impact of our early successes. Needless to say, I'm extremely pleased to report the return to revenue growth and the significant percentage increase in EPS compared to last year.
The top line numbers are the result of solid performance in each of our businesses, as I noted. Now as we always do, as we focus on building the business, we also are keeping tight control on costs and making prudent investments in our strategic initiatives. Those investments amounted to about $10 million in the quarter, and we had additional pension expense of about $5 million compared to last year.
Including the investments and pension expense but excluding special items, we generated $280 million in operating cash flow this quarter, a 10% increase from the third quarter a year ago. Free cash flow totaled $162 million.
Now regarding special items, very quickly, approximately $15 million of them affected operating income. We also had a small non-cash charge related to a newspaper partnership investment that impacted non-operating income. And finally, offsetting the charges was a net tax benefit of approximately $13 million related to a tax decision covering multiple years. Details of all of these are in our press release.
So let me now turn to a quick review of our segments. Total Publishing segment revenues were 3% lower in the quarter as a result of a decrease of approximately 6% -- 7% in advertising spending, offset by our circulation growth. This is the best year-over-year total publishing revenue comparison since the first quarter of 2007.
Circulation revenue at our local domestic publishing operations was up almost 10%, and we had our second consecutive quarterly increase in circulation revenue there.
Before I hand the discussion over to Bob, I wanted to note that he and his team have done just an exceptional job rolling out this model. Bob?"

At quarter's end, our new All Access subscription model was in place at 69 U.S. Community Publishing markets, and we remain on target to complete the rollout by mid-November. We're on track to realize subscription revenue",391,"Thank you, Gracia. Good morning. At quarter's end, our new All Access subscription model was in place at 69 U.S. Community Publishing markets, and we remain on target to complete the rollout by mid-November. We're on track to realize subscription revenue increases of about 25% to prelaunch levels. Our projections continue to indicate those increases will yield a $100-million improvement in operating profit in 2013. It is still early as longer-term subscriptions have not yet cycled in many markets.
In September, we generated year-over-year subscription revenue growth. And depending on the wave, it ranged from 13% to 31%. Based on our first 6 waves, which represents 60 markets that all launched by early August, we are seeing daily home delivery losses of approximately 4.9 percentage points beyond the prelaunch trends, just better than the 5 percentage points that we had in our model.
Sunday home delivery losses for those same waves are at about 6.8 percentage points beyond the prelaunch trends as we cycle the coupon craze of last year.
And then on the single-copy side, where, you may recall, we are increasing rates anywhere from 30% to 100%. Daily single-copy circulation volumes have declined 3.1 percentage points from trend, significantly less than the projections in our model. And on Sunday, single-copy volumes have declined 11.2 percentage points from trend across those same markets, also better than our initial projections.
We continue to make strong progress in acquiring digital subscribers, with roughly 30,000 at the end of the quarter, an 80% increase over Q2. We found that approximately 40% of our digital subscribers have some prior history of home delivery subscriptions. These are lapsed former subscribers who transitioned to digital. We are now able to recapture those consumers as paying subscribers after reducing access to just a few articles each month for non-subscribers.
Digital subscription revenue came in just shy of our model for the quarter. We should stress that our digital subscriber acquisition to date has been largely organic. Now that we have substantially completed the rollout, we're in Phase 2 in the process of implementing a digital marketing strategy to drive acquisition as our subscriber and revenue targets ramp going into 2013.
Currently, about 720,000 subscribers have activated the digital access on their accounts, which is on pace to achieve our goal of 60% subscriber activation in year one."

Now let me turn to the advertising categories in Publishing, where advertising continues to be impacted by the slow pace of the economic recovery, weak job growth and certain secular pressures. We did not, interestingly, experience the same level of volatility we saw on the first and second quarters. As expected, advertising results were better than in the second quarter, and September was the best month of the third quarter.
In terms of major ad categories, retail comparisons were in line with second quarter comparisons. National advertising comps were considerably better than both first and second quarter comps. And classified advertising comps improved slightly from the second quarter. A lot of additional advertising category detail is contained in our press release this morning.
Publishing segment digital revenues were up significantly in the quarter and posted a gain of nearly 65%. The growth was due to revenue associated with the All Access content subscription model, as well as our digital advertising and marketing solutions. As a reminder, those revenues are included in the publishing categories in our income statement.
At our local domestic publishing operations, digital revenues were up 76%, again due in part to the new subscription model, as well as our DMS efforts. We saw substantial digital revenue increases as well at USA TODAY and its associated businesses. USA TODAY digital revenue was up about 70%, and Newsquest increased by approximately 10% in pounds.
Digital Marketing Services is attracting more advertisers and their business. For instance, DealChicken, just one of the many products in the suite of Digital Marketing Services, was about 3x larger in the third quarter this year compared to last year. We believe there is plenty of demand for DMS products, with lots of room to grow.
Turning to expenses in the Publishing segment, excluding special items but including initiative spending, they were relatively unchanged this quarter. The increase was just over $3 million, including approximately $9 million of strategic initiative investment. We continue to benefit from our cost efficiency efforts and facility consolidations. As well, newsprint expense was about 11% lower to both -- due to both lower volume and lower usage prices.
Let me just spend one second on newsprint. Prices held stable throughout the third quarter, while the outcome of a regional price increase announced for the fourth quarter remains quite uncertain. Nonetheless, market conditions continue to favor publishers as exports weakened and an eastern mill reopens. And in the U.K., for Newsquest, news from prices have declined for the second half.
Now turning to the profitability in our Publishing segment, operating income for the quarter was $86 million, excluding special items of over $12 million but including about $9 million of initiative investments. If you exclude the net impact of our strategic initiative investments and special items, the operating margin would have been about 240 basis points higher than reported and expense is almost 1% lower.
Let me touch briefly on Newsquest. The management team there is executing well in an extremely challenging economy. Total revenues, as you saw, were down about 7% in pounds. However, on a percentage basis, expense reductions outpaced revenue declines and as a result, operating income was just 2% lower and the operating margin actually improved from the third quarter last year.
Now let me quickly cover our Digital segment. Revenues in the Digital segment grew again this quarter by approximately 5%. As I mentioned earlier, CareerBuilder had another solid quarter, with revenue growth of almost 7%. Higher expenses associated with CareerBuilder's revenue growth and digital strategic spending drove an increase in expenses of just 2%, and as a result, operating income was over 16% higher and totaled almost $40 million.
Company-wide, digital revenues increased by 23% and totaled almost $335 million in the quarter. Digital advertising and marketing solutions, as well as the early impact of the content subscription program, contributed to the growth. Digital revenues company-wide now account for more than 25% of total revenues.
Now finally, almost saving the best for last, moving to the Broadcasting segment. As I noted, the management of our TV station group achieved a record level of third quarter revenues and operating results. In doing so, they did a fantastic job of leveraging top ratings and a great footprint to capture significant Olympic and political spending.
Broadcasting also had solid growth in retransmission revenue, with more to come. For the quarter, revenues in Broadcasting segment were up 36% to $237 million. Now that's a great number, but an even greater achievement is the bottom line result. Operating income was over $118 million. That's 73% higher compared to the third quarter last year, and it's an increase of over $15 million on a revenue increase of $63 million.
So no question, the third quarter was a tremendous one for our Broadcasting segment.
Dave Lougee is now going to discuss some details of the Olympic and political spending and what his team did to maximize those revenue opportunities, and he will also give us a preview on political spending for the fourth quarter. Dave?"

A",571,"Thank you, Gracia. Gracia touched on the Olympics. We had a great scaled editorial presence in London to complement NBC's terrific coverage, and we're were able to use that to showcase our hometown athletes like Denver's Missy Franklin in many new ways. As a result, KUSA in Denver was the top-rated major market NBC affiliate in the adults 25-54 demographic. Our stations in Minneapolis, Atlanta and St. Louis, placed in the top five. And when you add Cleveland and Phoenix, we had 6 of the top 10-rated in that demographic.
On the revenue side, we've put in place a year-long Olympic sales transformation process of training and execution and are very pleased with our team's results. We brought a lot of new local advertisers and partners into the Olympics and are already working with them on packages for the Sochi Winter Olympics in 16 months.
We've finished the Olympics with a record $37 million in billing, which includes $4 million of political, and that's up 58% from the Beijing Olympics in 2008. It's hard for us to put an exact number on how much of that billing is incremental to the quarter, but we put it in a range of 55% to 65%.
On political advertising, we had a record third quarter as well. We built $42 million in political revenue compared to $26 million in 2008. As we said earlier this year, we have a strong political footprint, with large and strong stations serving the presidential swing states of Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Colorado. Spending has been very strong, as you all know, and we are taking very good shares of that business. Our stations have done a tremendous job with both technology and psychology and pricing and managing our inventory correctly. The technology is our centralized traffic operations, along with our inventory yield management software. That's allowed us to minimize displacement of our core revenues. But like all strong stations in heavy political states, we did have core displacement in September because of the record levels of political demand.
All of those same dynamics are in place and then some for a record fourth quarter in political. It's too early to put a number on it as the heaviest booking days of the year are still ahead of us. But there's no question, it will be a new high.
Beyond presidential, big spending is now kicking in for the Virginia U.S. Senate race, and we have numerous contested House races across the division, as well as some key local issues.
On retransmission consent, many of you likely heard that we just completed a retransmission consent agreement with the DISH Network. We are pleased that we were able to come to terms without our viewers losing service, although we did have to warn them of a possible disruption, which was the first time we've ever had to do that with a major distributor.
With DISH, we have agreed to strip confidentiality terms that won't allow us to discuss the terms of that agreement, just like we don't discuss the terms of any of our agreements. But generically, we will point to our past numbers that show our stations have always allowed us in the past to get top-of-market rates on retransmission consent. We have 2 more agreements up in the end of this year, one large and one somewhat smaller, and we'll have good 2013 guidance for you in December."

During the quarter, we repurchased over 2 million shares at a cost of approximately $35 million as part of our ongoing buyback program announced earlier this year.

Between share repurchases and dividends alone, we have returned almost $230 million to shareholders to date this year.
At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $1.63 billion of debt outstanding. At this point in time, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 7.02%.
Our cash balance at quarter end was $237 million. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were about $25 million and $63 million year-to-date, with the growing percentage being invested in the digital product and platform feature functionality.
Free cash flow in the quarter totaled $162 million after a planned $18-million contribution to our pension plan.

And as Bob mentioned, we have, at this point, before any kind of significant push on this, about 30,000 digital-only subscribers. I know that Bob has some very significant plans for significant increases in those digital subscribers for next year. I wouldn't say it was an unintended consequence.

On auto, as we said earlier, we are seeing good traction on the number of units. And I think based on our activities, both from a Digital Marketing Services perspective and focus on the auto category, we're seeing some good follow-through on that almost universally. Employment has been a little bit of a tougher slot given what is really an anemic employment picture. When I -- but when I think about CareerBuilder, they have done just a fabulous job on new product innovation. They have seen some strong growth here that I think focuses less on the anemic job market but more on the additional products that they are bringing to market to assist companies in their attempts to find the best talent. This quarter, they did an acquisition of Economic Modeling Specialists Intl. or EMSI. They have an economics software that specializes in employment data and labor market analysis. And they -- CareerBuilder had been investing in a workforce analytics platform that tracks hiring and job search trends. And so this kind of just turbocharges that effort to look at real-time labor information in varying markets and help us to help companies who are looking for certain kinds of employees do a better job at understanding where they can find those employees. So I think that gives you kind of a broadbrush of our categories."

As Jeff said, I'll begin with the highlights of a quarter in which we, I am extremely pleased to report, delivered both strong revenue and profitability growth, ahead of expectations. I will also update you on the excellent progress we're making on implementing our growth strategy. We'll then do a deeper dive on performance before taking your questions.
Bob Dickey, who is in charge of our local domestic publishing operations; and Dave Lougee, who heads Gannett Broadcasting, are here with me today, as is Victoria Harker, our CFO. Bob and Dave will talk about the significant contributions their teams made to our excellent results this morning. Bob will provide an update on our all access content subscription model that helped us achieve our first company-wide circulation revenue increase since early 2007 and continues to build.
Dave and his team at Broadcasting delivered a quarter that was simply outstanding, the best television third quarter in our history. In his comments, Dave will talk about the business, including the impact of Olympic and political advertising, which drove a 36% increase in Broadcasting revenue. He'll also discuss the outlook for political spending in the fourth quarter, which should be quite robust.
So let's get started with a quick update on our results. Top line, I'm very, very pleased with our performance this quarter, in which we returned to growth, revenue growth, by delivering a 3% increase in operating revenues.
Broadcasting is the headliner this quarter, and we also delivered a 6% increase in company-wide circulation revenue. And CareerBuilder delivered another strong performance that drove a nearly 5% increase in Digital segment revenues alone.
On the expense side, we invested about $10 million in our strategic initiatives this quarter while continuing to focus on creating efficiencies and tightly managing costs.
For the quarter, operating income, excluding special items, was up 12%, and net income attributable to Gannett on the same basis was 23% higher. Earnings per share for the quarter, both including and excluding special items, were $0.56. That's a $0.12 per share or 27% increase compared to last year's earnings per share. All in all, a very strong showing that we'll explore in more detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll update you on our growth strategy.
As you've heard us say, our strategy has 3 components: first, we are enhancing our local core news and marketing businesses; secondly, leveraging our hometown and brand advantages and accelerating growth by entering or expanding into new high-potential businesses; and thirdly, we're optimizing our assets and maintaining our strong financial profile to fund growth and deliver increased value to shareholders.
We're making great progress on all 3 fronts to position Gannett for success in the digital age. Here are just a few highlights. First, as I said, our all access subscription model.
As of October 15, the new model is up and successfully running in 71 markets, and we're on track to complete the rollout by year end. If you recall, our approach starts from the premise that people want and find great value in our content and are willing to pay for it. We also know that more and more consumers want to access content on digital platforms. Our model takes all of this into account and delivers reliable, timely and compelling content to consumers via the print and digital platforms they prefer. And I'm pleased to report the formula is working.
I'm going to steal a little bit of Bob Dickey's thunder and say that our local domestic publishing operations had a 10% increase in circulation revenue in the third quarter. That's the second straight quarter of circulation revenue growth in local publishing and a terrific result.
Now just a reminder that we won't see the full impact until the end of next year but, at that point, we expect subscription revenue at our local domestic publishing sites will be 25% higher than it was at the beginning of this year. That build-out and ramp-up translates into about $100 million contribution to 2013 operating profit.
Digital Marketing Services, or DMS, is another key component of our strategy and a great example of how we're accelerating growth by entering high-potential businesses where we have a hometown and a brand advantage.
Now it's no secret that local businesses are spending more of their ad and marketing dollars on digital services. What's not as well known is that navigating the complex and fragmented digital landscape is hard work, particularly for someone running a car dealership or a plumbing supply company or a landscaping business. That's where we come in. We know media, and we've worked closely with tens of thousands of local businesses for years and decades. We're a trusted partner who can offer a full digital marketing product set tailored to each business's needs.
Our DMS rollout is on track and hit a key milestone in the third quarter when we completed the rollout across all of our domestic markets. Demand for these services is strong, revenue is growing at a good pace and we are excited about the long-term prospects for DMS.
Now as you know, the digital space doesn't stand still, so we're constantly looking for opportunities to augment our offerings. We made 2 important bolt-on acquisitions in the third quarter to strengthen our hand.
In August, we acquired BLiNQ Media, which specializes in social engagement advertising and has managed social marketing campaigns for over 600 of the world's largest advertisers. Their ability to deliver social media marketing solutions on the local level further positions our DMS business for growth.
And then in September, we acquired Mobestream Media, which is the developer of the Key Ring consumer loyalty app for smartphones. More than 5 million users have downloaded the free Key Ring app that allows consumers to scan and store existing loyalty cards, join new reward programs and receive mobile coupons. Key Ring's connection with consumers and its strong retailer relationships give us another leg up in the digital marketing space.
And, in September, we also relaunched USA TODAY. This iconic brand has been redesigned for today's audience and reimagined as a print and digital powerhouse. When it was introduced 30 years ago, USA TODAY was a truly revolutionary idea to leverage the leading-edge technology of the day to deliver news nationally in an attractive, easy-to-read format. We believe that, in its new incarnation, USA TODAY can make the same kind of impact with today's consumers and, in the process, provide a great marketing platform. Larry Kramer and his team are doing a good job with USA TODAY, and early returns are promising. Watch for more to come.
Now I'd like to pivot to asset optimization, specifically our real estate portfolio. As we've discussed before, we are actively engaged in finding ways to use our real estate assets more efficiently to enhance shareholder value. Gannett has been actively managing its real estate portfolio for many years. Since 2005, we've sold more than 2 million square feet of office space, notwithstanding the severe 2008 to '10 real estate downturn. We currently have more than 3 million square feet of office space actively on the market out of our total U.S. portfolio of about 14 million feet.
I also want to be clear that as we look to optimize our real estate portfolio, none of our facilities, including our Tyson's Corner building, are off the table. We already have tenants in the headquarters facility, and we're actively marketing additional space. We are open to all options on any other building in the portfolio if the economics make sense. And as with all of our assets, we will be opportunistic.
If I turn to the third quarter review, I want to assure you that while we have covered a lot of ground executing on our strategy in a very short time, there is a lot more we will do. We're playing offense and thus far, achieving the results we've anticipated. Our third quarter results are already beginning to show the favorable impact of our early successes. Needless to say, I'm extremely pleased to report the return to revenue growth and the significant percentage increase in EPS compared to last year.
The top line numbers are the result of solid performance in each of our businesses, as I noted. Now as we always do, as we focus on building the business, we also are keeping tight control on costs and making prudent investments in our strategic initiatives. Those investments amounted to about $10 million in the quarter, and we had additional pension expense of about $5 million compared to last year.
Including the investments and pension expense but excluding special items, we generated $280 million in operating cash flow this quarter, a 10% increase from the third quarter a year ago. Free cash flow totaled $162 million.
Now regarding special items, very quickly, approximately $15 million of them affected operating income. We also had a small non-cash charge related to a newspaper partnership investment that impacted non-operating income. And finally, offsetting the charges was a net tax benefit of approximately $13 million related to a tax decision covering multiple years. Details of all of these are in our press release.
So let me now turn to a quick review of our segments. Total Publishing segment revenues were 3% lower in the quarter as a result of a decrease of approximately 6% -- 7% in advertising spending, offset by our circulation growth. This is the best year-over-year total publishing revenue comparison since the first quarter of 2007.
Circulation revenue at our local domestic publishing operations was up almost 10%, and we had our second consecutive quarterly increase in circulation revenue there.
Before I hand the discussion over to Bob, I wanted to note that he and his team have done just an exceptional job rolling out this model. Bob?"

At quarter's end, our new all access subscription model was in place at 69 U.S. Community Publishing markets, and we remain on target to complete the rollout by mid-November. We're on track to realize subscription revenue increases of about 25% to prelaunch levels. Our projections continue to indicate those increases will yield a $100-million improvement in operating profit in 2013. It is still early as longer-term subscriptions have not yet cycled in many markets.
In September, we generated year-over-year subscription revenue growth. And depending on the wave, it ranged from 13% to 31%. Based on our first 6 waves, which represent 60 markets that all launched by early August, we are seeing daily home delivery losses of approximately 4.9 percentage points beyond the prelaunch trends, just better than the 5 percentage points that we had in our model.
Sunday home delivery losses for those same waves are at about 6.8 percentage points beyond the prelaunch trends as we cycle the coupon craze of last year.
And then on the single-copy side, where, you may recall, we are increasing rates anywhere from 30% to 100%. Daily single-copy circulation volumes have declined 3.1 percentage points from trend, significantly less than the projections in our model. And on Sunday, single-copy volumes have declined 11.2 percentage points from trend across those same markets, also better than our initial projections.
We continue to make strong progress in acquiring digital subscribers, with roughly 30,000 at the end of the quarter, an 80% increase over Q2. We have found that approximately 40% of our digital subscribers have some prior history of home delivery subscriptions. These are lapsed former subscribers who transitioned to digital. We are now able to recapture those consumers as paying subscribers after reducing access to just a few articles each month for non-subscribers.
Digital subscription revenue came in just shy of our model for the quarter. We should stress that our digital subscriber acquisition to date has been largely organic. Now that we have substantially completed the rollout, we're in Phase 2 in the process of implementing a digital marketing strategy to drive acquisition as our subscriber and revenue targets ramp going into 2013.
Currently, about 720,000 subscribers have activated the digital access on their accounts, which is on pace to achieve our goal of 60% subscriber activation in year one."

Now let me turn to the advertising categories in Publishing, where advertising continues to be impacted by the slow pace of the economic recovery, weak job growth and certain secular pressures. We did not, interestingly, experience the same level of volatility we saw on the first and second quarters. As expected, advertising results were better than in the second quarter, and September was the best month of the third quarter.
In terms of major ad categories, retail comparisons were in line with second quarter comparisons. National advertising comps were considerably better than both first and second quarter comps. And classified advertising comps improved slightly from the second quarter. A lot of additional advertising category detail is contained in our press release this morning.
Publishing segment digital revenues were up significantly in the quarter and posted a gain of nearly 65%. The growth was due to revenue associated with the all access content subscription model, as well as our digital advertising and marketing solutions. As a reminder, those revenues are included in the publishing categories in our income statement.
At our local domestic publishing operations, digital revenues were up 76%, again due in part to the new subscription model, as well as our DMS efforts. We saw substantial digital revenue increases as well at USA TODAY and its associated businesses. USA TODAY digital revenue was up about 70%, and Newsquest increased by approximately 10% in pounds.
Digital Marketing Services is attracting more advertisers and their business. For instance, DealChicken, just one of the many products in the suite of Digital Marketing Services, was about 3x larger in the third quarter this year compared to last year. We believe there is plenty of demand for DMS products, with lots of room to grow.
Turning to expenses in the Publishing segment, excluding special items but including initiative spending, they were relatively unchanged this quarter. The increase was just over $3 million, including approximately $9 million of strategic initiative investment. We continue to benefit from our cost efficiency efforts and facility consolidations. As well, newsprint expense was about 11% lower to both -- due to both lower volume and lower usage prices.
Let me just spend one second on newsprint. Prices held stable throughout the third quarter, while the outcome of a regional price increase announced for the fourth quarter remains quite uncertain. Nonetheless, market conditions continue to favor publishers as exports weakened and an eastern mill reopens. And in the U.K., for Newsquest, newsprint prices have declined for the second half.
Now turning to the profitability in our Publishing segment, operating income for the quarter was $86 million, excluding special items of over $12 million but including about $9 million of initiative investments. If you exclude the net impact of our strategic initiative investments and special items, the operating margin would have been about 240 basis points higher than reported and expenses almost 1% lower.
Let me touch briefly on Newsquest. The management team there is executing well in an extremely challenging economy. Total revenues, as you saw, were down about 7% in pounds. However, on a percentage basis, expense reductions outpaced revenue declines and, as a result, operating income was just 2% lower and the operating margin actually improved from the third quarter last year.
Now let me quickly cover our Digital segment. Revenues in the Digital segment grew again this quarter by approximately 5%. As I mentioned earlier, CareerBuilder had another solid quarter, with revenue growth of almost 7%. Higher expenses associated with CareerBuilder's revenue growth and digital strategic spending drove an increase in expenses of just 2%, and as a result, operating income was over 16% higher and totaled almost $40 million.
Company-wide, digital revenues increased by 23% and totaled almost $335 million in the quarter. Digital advertising and marketing solutions, as well as the early impact of the content subscription program, contributed to the growth. Digital revenues company-wide now account for more than 25% of total revenues.
Now finally, almost saving the best for last, moving to the Broadcasting segment. As I noted, the management of our TV station group achieved a record level of third quarter revenues and operating results. In doing so, they did a fantastic job of leveraging top ratings and a great footprint to capture significant Olympic and political spending.
Broadcasting also had solid growth in retransmission revenue, with more to come. For the quarter, revenues in Broadcasting segment were up 36% to $237 million. Now that's a great number, but an even greater achievement is the bottom line result. Operating income was over $118 million. That's 73% higher compared to the third quarter last year, and it's an increase of over $50 million on a revenue increase of $63 million.
So no question, the third quarter was a tremendous one for our Broadcasting segment.
Dave Lougee is now going to discuss some details of the Olympic and political spending and what his team did to maximize those revenue opportunities, and he will also give us a preview on political spending for the fourth quarter. Dave?"

As a",571,"Thank you, Gracia. Gracia touched on the Olympics. We had a great scaled editorial presence in London to complement NBC's terrific coverage, and we were able to use that to showcase our hometown athletes like Denver's Missy Franklin in many new ways. As a result, KUSA in Denver was the top-rated major market NBC affiliate in the adults 25-54 demographic. Our stations in Minneapolis, Atlanta and St. Louis, placed in the top 5. And when you add Cleveland and Phoenix, we had 6 of the top 10-rated in that demographic.
On the revenue side, we've put in place a year-long Olympic sales transformation process of training and execution and are very pleased with our team's results. We brought a lot of new local advertisers and partners into the Olympics and are already working with them on packages for the Sochi Winter Olympics in 16 months.
We finished the Olympics with a record $37 million in billing, which includes $4 million of political, and that's up 58% from the Beijing Olympics in 2008. It's hard for us to put an exact number on how much of that billing is incremental to the quarter, but we put it in the range of 55% to 65%.
On political advertising, we had a record third quarter as well. We built $42 million in political revenue compared to $26 million in 2008. As we said earlier this year, we have a strong political footprint, with large and strong stations serving the presidential swing states of Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Colorado. Spending has been very strong, as you all know, and we are taking very good shares of that business. Our stations have done a tremendous job with both technology and psychology in pricing and managing our inventory correctly. The technology is our centralized traffic operations, along with our inventory yield management software. That's allowed us to minimize displacement of our core revenues. But like all strong stations in heavy political states, we did have core displacement in September because of the record levels of political demand.
All of those same dynamics are in place and then some for a record fourth quarter in political. It's too early to put a number on it as the heaviest booking days of the year are still ahead of us. But there's no question, it will be a new high.
Beyond presidential, big spending is now kicking in for the Virginia U.S. Senate race, and we have numerous contested House races across the division, as well as some key local issues.
On retransmission consent, many of you likely heard that we just completed a retransmission consent agreement with the DISH Network. We are pleased that we were able to come to terms without our viewers losing service, although we did have to warn them of a possible disruption, which was the first time we've ever had to do that with a major distributor.
With DISH, we have agreed to strict confidentiality terms that won't allow us to discuss the terms of that agreement, just like we don't discuss the terms of any of our agreements. But generically, we will point to our past numbers that show our stations have always allowed us in the past to get top-of-market rates on retransmission consent. We have 2 more agreements up at the end of this year, one large and one somewhat smaller, and we'll have good 2013 guidance for you in December."

During the quarter, we repurchased over 2 million shares at a cost of approximately $35 million as part of our ongoing buyback program announced earlier this year.

Between share repurchases and dividends alone, we have returned almost $230 million to shareholders to date this year.
At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $1.63 billion of debt outstanding. At this point in time, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 7.02%.
Our cash balance at quarter end was $237 million. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were about $25 million and $63 million year-to-date, with a growing percentage being invested in the digital product and platform feature functionality.
Free cash flow in the quarter totaled $162 million after a planned $18-million contribution to our pension plan.

But as importantly, the expectation for adding additional customers to use our print capacity, which InnerWorkings has a fairly sophisticated network to be able to accomplish that, that's something that we are equally focused on as an opportunity over the next few years from that agreement. And then as a result of what we did back in September of 2011 by putting together Gannett Publishing Services, we knew that not only on the production side, but as well on the distribution side, given that we have probably a network second only to the U.S. Post Office in terms of distribution, that we felt that there would be some good opportunities there to take on some additional distribution from others, both in our industry as well as potentially others outside.

Some -- a lot of that having to do with the, as I mentioned earlier, the EasyPay promotions have really grown over time in those markets, and that has added to the retention. We've seen single copy stabilize. That certainly helps as well. What we're seeing is that some waves in markets will perform very -- in a very similar way. And other waves, there's uniquenesses in those markets, so we have to manage each market differently. But we're definitely seeing a stabilization of the circulation volumes, and our focus now going forward will be a very aggressive acquisition mode."

We all read the same statistics, and we're beginning to see a little bit of that coming through the numbers, especially in some specific geographic areas. On auto, as we said earlier, we are seeing good traction on the number of units. And I think based on our activities, both from a Digital Marketing Services perspective and focus on the auto category, we're seeing some good follow-through on that almost universally. Employment has been a little bit of a tougher slot given what is really an anemic employment picture. When I -- but when I think about CareerBuilder, they have done just a fabulous job on new product innovation. They have seen some strong growth here that I think focuses less on the anemic job market but more on the additional products that they are bringing to market to assist companies in their attempts to find the best talent. This quarter, they did an acquisition of Economic Modeling Specialists Intl. or EMSI. They have an economics software that specializes in employment data and labor market analysis. And they -- CareerBuilder had been investing in a workforce analytics platform that tracks hiring and job search trends. And so this kind of just turbocharges that effort to look at real-time labor information in varying markets and help us to help companies who are looking for certain kinds of employees do a better job at understanding where they can find those employees. So I think that gives you kind of a broadbrush of our categories."
