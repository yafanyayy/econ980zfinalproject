Good morning, and welcome to our call, the December 31 quarter. Our results for the quarter reflected the effect of 2011's second half market turmoil which impacted our asset and revenue levels. Even so, our core business fundamentals hel",2106,"Thank you, Alan. Good morning, and welcome to our call, the December 31 quarter. Our results for the quarter reflected the effect of 2011's second half market turmoil which impacted our asset and revenue levels. Even so, our core business fundamentals held up well particularly when you add back the considerable transition costs this quarter, which largely concludes our streamlining initiative. 
Our flow picture improved for the period. Its performance across our key affiliates remain strong, our distribution teams work closely with them to build momentum. At the end of the period we have completed the 18 months streamlining that we announced in May 2010, on time and on budget. We are now realizing our target of $140 million in annual cost savings. We could not have done this without the tireless efforts of our employees and we thank them for the successful execution of this ambitious initiative. 
In addition, we enter the new calendar year with a balance sheet that remain strong and flexible with year-over-year cash levels almost flat even after the return of $0.5 billion to shareholders over the past 12 months. This financial strength not only allows us to deploy capital opportunistically, but it also allows us to confidently invest in growing the business in new products and segments. Earlier this month we held an investment forum for clients, FAs and media in New York. The senior investment professionals from Western, Permal, ClearBridge and Royce. 
We had over 1,000 participants accessing the webcast or dialing in on the phone with more attending in person. One of the central questions in the discussion to what will it take to get investors back into the markets, particularly the equity markets. Panelists agree that most advisers and retail investors will need to see a sustained rise in equity prices for some period of time. In this regard, we are encouraged by January's good start. 
In the meantime, our managers continue to see value in the market whether that be yields on high-quality equities that are the most attractive relative to bonds since the mid-'50s, or non-treasury sectors of the bond markets such as munis, credit and high-yield. Now let's shift to our results on Slide 3. For the quarter, Legg Mason reported net income of $28 million and adjusted income of nearly $77 million. Results were impacted by higher transition related charges, lower average AUM, which drove lower revenues, as well as lower performance fees. 
Importantly we completed our restructuring on time and on budget, we had $26 million in cost savings this quarter and we achieved our goal of $35 million in the current quarter for $140 million on an annualized basis. We ended the quarter in a position of strength with $1.2 billion of cash in our balance sheet which we expect to use to both investing growth and as appropriate, return to shareholders. 
On Slide 4, we see our Assets Under Management by asset class. We ended the quarter with $627 billion, up sequentially driven by market appreciation and reduced outflows overall and for long-term assets. By asset class, we had 25% of our assets in equity, 56% in fixed income and 19% in liquidity. Slide 5 shows our net flows for the quarter. The long-term outflows improved from the prior quarter while liquidity flows were positive reflecting an overall trend away from risk. 
Equity outflows were down slightly consistent with industry experience. Liquidity inflows were nearly $11 billion, again reflecting the derisking that occurred in the quarter. Fixed-income outflows decreased from the prior quarter resulted from continued withdrawals in the low fee, local sovereign mandate, risk balancing among institutional clients that continued move by some clients to pass of mandates. Of the $7.1 billion in fixed-income outflows, sovereign mandate accounted for $3.8 billion. 
Though the quarter's outflows were modestly better than last quarter, they were significantly improved from the December quarter's in each of the prior 3 years. Then we saw fixed income flows in the month of December despite the continued outflows from the global sovereign mandate. Overall, while 1 month is not a trend, based on the facts today, we are encouraged by the momentum we see both at key affiliates and in the markets. 
Slide 6 shows our assets by affiliates. Let's start with the Western with $442 billion, up from the previous quarter driven by market appreciation and liquidity inflows. Fixed-income outflows were driven primarily by the global sovereign mandate we've referenced for some time and other factors cited previously. These were partially offset by continued money into specialized mandates. We will go into more detail about Western in the next slide. 
Next is Royce, nearly $36 billion, up from the prior quarter due to market appreciation. Royce had outflows in the quarter and for the calendar year. Importantly, Royce's 3- and 5-year performance numbers remained strong. We are very pleased to partner with Royce in our offshore usage range, which we raised $600 million in the calendar year. 
Next is Permal at nearly $18 billion. Gains in the U.S. institutional segment, new geographic regions in Asia and the Middle East were offset with continued high network outflows as the eurozone and general market volatility remained in the headlines. Now it's continuing to grow the institutional business. In the U.S., they had additional inflows of $150 million in the quarter and continued advances in the U.K. We closed the $250 million opportunistic fund in the quarter and expected to roll out additional products that are similarly focused in the calendar year. 
Permal's cumulative unfunded wins were over $300 million. Legg Mason recently received approval from the SEC to offer a non-exchange listed closed-end fund that is a fund of hedge funds and is sub advised by Permal. We expect to begin offering this fund to accredited investors in the near future. 
Next is ClearBridge with $51 billion driven by higher equity markets. Looking forward to 2012, the key focus will be on income oriented products in which ClearBridge has good performance. Legg Mason and ClearBridge equity income builder performed well for the calendar year. The U.K. version of the fund launched in the quarter attracted $30 million in client money by year end and that has risen nearly $45 million through the first half of January. 
Next is Batterymarch at nearly $18 billion, up sequentially driven by market appreciation. Show improvement firm's performance for the quarter and year ending December 31, 2011 was strong across products 86% of the firm's composites beat their benchmarks for the quarter and 68% of composites beat their benchmarks for the year. 
Funding in fiscal Q4 includes an additional $200 million from an existing client into Batterymarch's U.S. small cap fund and approximately $50 million into the fund's global emerging market strategy. Longer-term, Batterymarch has also -- interest in several products under development, including managed volatility and inflation sensitive strategies. 
Brandywine ended the quarter at $33 billion driven by market appreciation and modest inflows. Brandywine has approximately $300 million in its 1 not funded pipeline. It's global bond fund has just established a 5-year track record with strong performance across the period. This fund has crossed the $1 billion mark and we've seen inflows of approximately $100 million a month over the past several months. 
We've worked with Brandywine to add the fund to various platforms and their specialists are out on the road with our wholesalers on a regular basis. Legg Mason Capital Management ended the quarter at over $8 billion. During the quarter, the firm announced that Sam Peters will be taking over as chief investment officer and as sole manager of the Value Trust in April 2012. 
Page 7 shows an update on Western Asset. The upper left slide shows the total assets by mandate. The percentage of assets specialized in broad market portfolios remain similar to last year last quarter while taxable liquidity rose by a couple of percentage points. Western continues to see the most interesting mix fixed-income business and specialized mandates. It's typically are for smaller dollar amounts but generally higher fee assignments. 
All of the final presentation held in the quarter were for specialized mandates, the vast majority of that mandates won but not yet funded in the quarter were also for specialized mandates. The upper right corner of the Slide shows the percentage of composites assets beating the benchmarks. It shows continued strength in the 3-year numbers. Our performance for the December '11 quarter remained strong in key strategies performance for the 1-year period modestly underperformed the benchmark and an even stronger December '10 quarter rolled off. 
Finally the chart on the bottom shows long-term net flows. As you can see, outflows were improved slightly versus the previous quarter. However, they significantly improved versus the December quarters in '08, '09 and '10. Western's business continues to improve even with the softness in the institutional demand active Core and Core Plus mandates. 
Various client interest include global credit, emerging market debt, high-yield and multisector strategy. Another emerging area is active ETFs earlier this month, an ETF sponsor announced a new partnership with Western to create credit products. Legg Mason has an application in front of the SEC for actively managed products and has filed a proposed short duration bond fund as an initial product. 
Slide 8 shows our composite performance versus the benchmarks covering 90% of our total assets. 3 and 10 year numbers remained strong but there was a drop in percentage assets beating benchmarks in the 1-year. This reflects the Q4 1011 differences that I cited previously. Slide 9 shows long-term fund performance against the category average, which shows performance against peers. Here, show marked improvement in 1-year numbers and consistent performance in 3, 5 and 10 year numbers each with over 70% majority. 
Slide 10 shows the breakdown of our global distribution platform. Total assets up $213 billion are serviced across North America, Asia, Europe, Australia and Japan and we continue to expand our presence in markets, channels and advisers globally. Reorganization of our sales team in the United States that we announced last summer became effective last quarter and we are very pleased with the initial receptivity to our expanded advisor coverage. 
Outside the U.S. our business in Japan, while down a bit, given currency moves in the quarter is still quite strong. It's complemented by investment in Europe in Asia. We are seeing encouraging receptivity to our efforts particularly in Europe. I'm not covering every category that product lineup that we are now marketing globally is the strongest it has been in years. We have multiple products with strong performance and key segments across equities, fixed-income alternatives to offer our clients. 
Slide 11 shows the trends in our U.S. distribution long-term flows. Net outflows in the quarter declined to $3.5 billion as opposed to $4.3 billion in the previous quarter. Over the past few months, redemption rates have modestly improved and compared favorably to the industry. Municipal and taxable fixed income mutual fund flows a return to positive in the quarter. We believe we are in the strongest position we have been with regard to our product set for some time. 
In the fixed-income side, this includes our Brandywine Global managed bond fund and contrast to what we've noted on the institutional side of the business, we see meaningful opportunity the retail market for Western and Core and Core Plus mandates and growing interest in emerging market debt and high-yield. Western's Core and Core Plus offerings were recently added to a large retirement plan. It is expected to fund in March with an initial $450 million. 
On the equity side there's growing interest in ClearBridge's income solutions and Royce's diverse offerings. Slide 12 shows trends in our International Distribution platform. Our international division posted its 12th straight quarter of positive flows although at a reduced level. Net flows were down driven primarily by reduced inflows into Brazilian and Australian bond funds, given currency and interest rate movements in the quarter. 
Also included in these numbers is an international client that moved out of the fund and into an institutional account through Western. Year-to-date even with challenges in Europe given events surrounding the euro, the region had modestly positive flows driven by clients in Brandywine's global Bond fund, Western's high-yield funds and ClearBridge's Aggressive Growth funds. During the period the U.K. business successfully launched a U.S. equity income fund mirroring the $4 billion strategy in the U.S. As the team looks to the year end and the year ahead, they believe they have a window of opportunity to capture market share from competitors, particularly on the fixed-income side. Now to Pete."

As you could tell from Mark's comments, we had a challenging quarter primarily due to market direct impacts on our long-term AUM, as well as our final round of large transition related cost. So while we saw improvement in our ending equity m",1562,"Thanks, Mark. As you could tell from Mark's comments, we had a challenging quarter primarily due to market direct impacts on our long-term AUM, as well as our final round of large transition related cost. So while we saw improvement in our ending equity market valuations from the prior quarter, our average AUM was still down quarter-over-quarter. Also volatility and investor risk aversion continue to adversely impact our high-yielding asset flows. 
While the decline in average AUM and lower performance fees resulted in lower sequential revenues, we continue to deliver strong investment performance to our clients and the flow picture did improve somewhat over the September quarter. We completed our streamlining as of December 31 and on the balance sheet front we ended the period with over $1.2 billion in cash, $850 million of which is available to invest in the business or return to shareholders. 
Our fiscal third quarter saw a ramp-up in transition related cost of $42 million as we completed all of our significant streamlining activities. Consequently, next quarter's results will be cleaner on this front as we will have minimal transitional related cost while seeing our first quarter of the full $35 million cost savings. For the period a number of other factors impacted our results. Though ending AUM of $627 billion was higher than the prior quarter end, average assets were lower by $21 billion despite improving long-term asset outflows and liquidity inflows. 
The lower average AUM put pressure on revenues, margins and earnings during the quarter. Also our performance fees came in below recent levels and significantly below the prior year quarter. Finally the unrealized losses on our balance sheet investments of $1.8 million were significantly improved from last quarter's unrealized losses of $19.7 million. This quarter's relatively small loss was primarily driven by our alternative and emerging market seed investments. As a reminder, the fact that GAAP requires us to mark these investments to market each quarter creates volatility in our short-term results but it is important to note these losses are unrealized in our strong balance sheet and liquidity give us the ability to hold these investments until our strategic objectives have been achieved. 
Now let's turn to Page 13 to review the financial highlights for the quarter. The fiscal third quarter 2012 net income of $28 million yield a $0.20 in earnings per diluted share, including the impact to transition related cost, which reduced our net income by $0.21 per diluted share. Operating revenues were down 6% compared to the prior quarter $21 billion or 31% decrease in average AUM slightly lower advisory fee yield reflecting a drop in equity AUM and decline in performance fees. 
The $6.1 million in performance fees earned this quarter were largely driven by our fixed income managers, Western Asset and Brandywine. The decline from the prior quarter reflected lower fees from Permal and Western. In Permal's case, their fees are based on absolute performance and our net basis, they're below their high water marks. Particularly in their fixed-income mandate, which drives a significant portion of their fees. 
On a relative performance basis, although this mandate had negative performance, it did beat the hedge fund index their institutional clients measure them against. We anticipate the next couple of quarters performance fees to be roughly in line with those generated in the December quarter. Operating expenses were up 1% reflecting a $42 million transition related cost this quarter, which was up $27 million from the prior quarter. In addition, the mark-to-market undeferred comp and investments, which were offset in other non-operating income and expenses was a $2 million positive in fiscal Q3 compared with a $14 million negative in the prior quarter. 
Excluding these 2 items, operating expenses were down 7% reflecting lower compensation of affiliates operating under our revenue share arrangements. Adjusted income, which exclude certain non-cash and other items, were $77 million for the quarter or $0.55 per diluted share, which also includes the transition related expenses. 
Moving on to Slide 14, the only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 26% on a GAAP basis compared with a net negative rate in the prior quarter as a result of the benefit from the U.K. tax reduction. For fiscal fourth quarter, we expect our rate to be low to mid-30% range on a GAAP basis. I'd also like to highlight, as has been the case in prior periods are cash taxes will be much lower as our net operating loss carry forwards and foreign credits along with our ability to amortize a significant amount of our intangible assets for tax purposes would generate $1.6 billion in future cash tax benefits. 
This will reduce the actual cash taxes we will pay for this year and prospectively and will allow us to utilize this extra cash for the benefit of shareholders. Moving to Slide 15, you can see that the advisory fee yield declined this quarter from 35 basis points to 34 basis points, driven by lower average equity AUM and simultaneous increase in average liquidity AUM during the quarter. On Slide 16, operating expenses for the quarter increased due to the transition-related costs compared with $15 million of transition-related costs in the prior quarter. 
In addition, the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on deferred comp and seed investments resulted in an increase of $2 million in compensation expense compared with the $14 million reduction last quarter. Distribution and servicing costs were lower due to the lower average AUM and revenues. Communications and technology increased as a result of transition-related costs, as well as higher consulting expenses incurred by revenue sharing affiliates. 
Occupancy also increased due to $28 million in transition-related costs associated with the closure of various op and tech facilities partially offset by lease reserves adjustment of approximately $5 million. Finally, the increase in other expenses also include some transition-related costs, as well as higher operating costs largely at certain revenue sharing affiliates, which were offset in comp and benefits. Comp and benefits highlighted on Slide 17 were down 3% from last quarter, reflecting lower revenues and in the case of comp, lower transition-related cost, which were partially offset by higher deferred comp and seed investment related expenses. 
Excluding the deferred comp and seed investment offset and transition-related costs, capital expenditure benefit in net revenue ratio was 52%. This was down slightly from prior quarter basically due to increases in other expenses as the affiliates that are of setting compensation. Normalized comp and net revenue ratio should approximate 53% in near term now that our streamlining is complete. Turning to Slide 18, the operating margin as adjusted came in slightly better than last quarter's results despite the 6% decrease in revenues as expenses x transition-related cost and mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed came in 7% lower. 
Turning to Slide 19, we were very pleased to have completed our streamlining on-time and on budget. As I highlighted on last quarter's call, December 31 was the final milestone in our streamlining initiatives as we completed missed closing of certain tech and ops centers and our final scheduled staff reductions. Over a 20-month period ending on January 1, 2012, we reduced headcount by over 500 employees or about 33% of our March 2010 corporate level staffing. 
Of the $42 million in transition-related expenses this quarter that brings our total transition-related cost to $126 million and we expect the final $3 million in transition-related cost next quarter. Also next quarter, we will achieve our $35 million savings, which represents an annual run rate of approximately $140 million. 
Speaking of our fiscal fourth quarter, while we normally do not provide guidance, we recognize that this year as had been an visual with our turnaround so I would like to provide you with update on our outlook with a market recovery in December quarter, we are continuing to project earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.52 per share reflecting moderate market appreciation for the remainder of the quarter. 
Our current thinking is that we will likely to come in at the mid to lower end of that range due to a drop in previously reported performance fees. Now turning to Slide 20. Despite continued market volatility, which led to our lower revenues, the ability of the Legg Mason operating model to generate substantial cash remain intact during the quarter. As you can see from our cash balances, we have over $1.2 billion of total cash as of December 31, 2011. $850 million of which is in excess of our operating needs. 
We also have seed investments of close to $400 million. Over the past 12 months we repurchased 470 million of stock and paid out $42 million in dividends while maintaining cash level substantially the same as of December 2010. As I indicated on the fiscal Q2 earnings call, we do not anticipate deploying the final $150 million, excuse me, $155 million of our current share repurchase authorization until fiscal 2013. 
Our ending share count is now around 140 million shares, reflecting cumulative repurchases of 28.2 million shares or 17% of the shares outstanding since the board authorization in May 2010. Complement our repurchases the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share, change from the prior quarter. Thank you for your time and attention this morning. And now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Slide 21 shows our 3 strategic drivers for value creation. First, outstanding independent investment managers; second, a continued disciplined on our corporate center that deliver strategic value particularly in global distribution; and third, balance portfolio across asset classes, geographies and channels. 
Slide 22 is a slide we introduced last quarter, which highlights our progress on various initiatives and performance metrics that we believe our positioning us for earnings beverage into an eventual recovery. One of the most important metrics, in our opinion, is the ability to generate cash even with volatile markets impacting assets and revenue levels. The chart at the top left highlights that our operating income as adjusted remains solid despite the lower average AUM this quarter. This is a strength of the affiliate model and we remain confident that if current trends hold, including ongoing volatility, this chart will likely hold up well. 
As Pete just covered and consistent with rating agency considerations, we do not anticipate repurchasing shares until the new fiscal year commences on April 1. But we are continually evaluating capital allocation. As you can see from the chart, the vast majority of the capital deployed in fiscal year-to-date is in a form of share repurchases and to a lesser extent, dividends. We also continue to look at seed investments in areas where we believe there is investor demand as we consider these investments to be an important driver for future organic growth. To this end, a listing of our top new products is shown in the appendix. 
Additionally, as you stay on Page 22 on the lower left, over the last 4 quarters, we've generated annualized cost savings of more than $100 million and as Pete stated, we are realizing the full $140 million annual run rate savings this quarter. Finally, we are focused on performance and client service and outperformance and the critical 3-year time period remains strong. I'm pleased that flow trends improved this quarter and are certainly working hard to build momentum over the longer term. 
Through our ongoing cash generation completed expense reductions, solid investment performance and customer service and the balance sheet capable of returning significant capital to shareholders is gives us optimism we're in a good position to grow our earnings over time and create long-term value for shareholders. We're excited to be executing on these goals. And with that, we'll open the line for questions and I thank you."

So we'll kind of keep you posted as we go along but that's the basic status."

And as we previously updated everyone, the performance improvement echoed by consultant support continues to show good results. So if you take a theme going forward and say, and I think a number of consultants have pointed out, that fixed-income globally will continue to have substantial demand although moderated from the prior year's. Westerns ability to win in that is improving and some highlights in terms of just updates that we've given in the past. They have a won but not yet funded amount of about $1.3 billion, which is the same as the prior quarter. They continue to get gains from existing clients. That is actually up 74% and our losses from those clients is reducing meaningfully. So kind of a net ability to grow the book off of existing clients is improving. The areas where they're getting momentum both from existing clients and new clients is a pretty good range of the specialized category. It's ranging from muni to high-yield to emerging market to limited duration to portable alpha. These are all areas where they had positive net flows for the quarter. So we feel good about the momentum there. And obviously if you kind of back into the month of December, that was an important milestone. As always, we're going to say a month is not a trend but we're encouraged across-the-board there."

Western is well along the path of pivoting to make sure that their specialized solutions across the global client base are being deployed successfully. And so in that regard, I kind of reemphasize this broad area ranging from high-yield to emerging markets to other kind of alpha-oriented strategies and really underscore one of the big themes that all of the consultants are talking about in this environment is kind of a global solution to this. And Western is really -- we believe one of the best, if not the best positioned to deliver that in terms of where their investment teams are located, their servicing teams and the client base that they serve in the markets that they invest in. So we think that's a good opportunity for us. Now I'll also say, the Core, Core Plus business, which Western is proud to have a leading position in remains an important asset base and they continue to win some business in that category. It's just at a lower rate as you would expect."

Good morning, and welcome to our call for the December 31 quarter. Our results for the quarter reflected the effect of 2011's second half market turmoil, which impacted our asset and revenue levels. Even so, our core business fundamentals",2143,"Thank you, Alan. Good morning, and welcome to our call for the December 31 quarter. Our results for the quarter reflected the effect of 2011's second half market turmoil, which impacted our asset and revenue levels. Even so, our core business fundamentals held up well, particularly when you add back the considerable transition costs this quarter, which largely concludes our streamlining initiative. 
Our flow picture improved for the period as performance across our key affiliates remain strong and our distribution teams work closely with them to build momentum. By the end of the period, we had completed the 18 months streamlining that we announced in May 2010, on time and on budget. We are now realizing our targeted $140 million in annual cost savings. We could not have done this without the tireless efforts of our employees, and we thank them for the successful execution of this ambitious initiative. 
In addition, we enter the new calendar year with a balance sheet that remains strong and flexible with year-over-year cash levels almost flat, even after the return of $0.5 billion to shareholders over the past 12 months. This financial strength not only allows us to deploy capital opportunistically, but it also allows us to confidently invest in growing the business in new products and segments. Earlier this month, we held an investment forum for clients, FAs and media in New York with senior investment professionals from Western, Permal, ClearBridge and Royce. 
We had over 1,000 participants accessing the webcast or dialing in on the phone with more attending in person. One of the central questions of the discussion was what will it take to get investors back into the markets, particularly the equity markets. Our panelists agree that most advisers and retail investors will need to see a sustained rise in equity prices for some period of time. In this regard, we are encouraged by January's good start. 
In the meantime, our managers continue to see value in the market whether that be yields on high-quality equities that are the most attractive relative to bonds since the mid-'50s or non-treasury sectors of the bond markets, such as munis, credit and high yield. 
So now let's shift to our results on Slide 3. For the quarter, Legg Mason reported net income of $28 million and adjusted income of nearly $77 million. Results were impacted by higher transition-related charges, lower average AUM, which drove lower revenues, as well as lower performance fees. 
Importantly, we completed our restructuring on time and on budget. We had $26 million in cost savings this quarter, and we achieved our goal of $35 million in the current quarter or $140 million on an annualized basis. We ended the quarter in a position of strength with $1.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet, which we expect to use to both investing growth and as appropriate, return to shareholders. 
On Slide 4, we see our Assets Under Management by asset class. We ended the quarter with $627 billion, up sequentially driven by market appreciation and reduced outflows both overall and for long-term assets. By asset class, we had 25% of our assets in equity, 56% in fixed income and 19% in liquidity. 
Slide 5 shows our net flows for the quarter. The long-term outflows improved from the prior quarter while liquidity flows were positive, reflecting an overall trend away from risk. Equity outflows were down slightly consistent with industry experience. Liquidity inflows were nearly $11 billion, again reflecting the derisking that occurred in the quarter. 
Fixed income outflows decreased from the prior quarter and resulted from continued withdrawals in the low fee, global sovereign mandate, risk rebalancing among institutional clients and a continued move by some clients to pass of mandates. Of the $7.1 billion in fixed income outflows, the sovereign mandate accounted for $3.8 billion. 
Though the quarter's outflows were modestly better than last quarter, they were significantly improved from the December quarters in each of the prior 3 years. And we saw positive fixed income income flows in the month of December despite the continued outflows from the global sovereign mandate. Overall, while 1 month is not a trend, based on the facts today, we are encouraged by the momentum we see both at key affiliates and in the markets. 
Slide 6 shows our assets by affiliates. Let's start with Western with $442 billion, up from the previous quarter driven by market appreciation and liquidity inflows. Fixed income outflows were driven primarily by the global sovereign mandate we've referenced for some time and other factors cited previously. These were partially offset by continued money into specialized mandates. We will go into more detail about Western in the next slide. 
Next is Royce at nearly $36 billion, up from the prior quarter due to market appreciation. Royce had outflows in the quarter and for the calendar year. Importantly, Royce's 3- and 5-year performance numbers remains strong. We are very pleased to partner with Royce in our offshore usage range, for which we raised $600 million in the calendar year. 
Next is Permal at nearly $18 billion. Gains in the U.S. institutional segment and new geographic regions in Asia and the Middle East were offset by continued high network outflows as the eurozone and general market volatility remained in the headlines. Permal is continuing to grow the institutional business. In the U.S., they had additional inflows of $150 million in the quarter and continued advances in the U.K. They closed the $250 million opportunistic fund in the quarter and expected to roll out additional products that are similarly focused in the calendar year. 
Permal's cumulative unfunded wins were over $300 million. Legg Mason recently received approval from the SEC to offer a non-exchange listed closed-end fund that is a fund of hedge funds and is sub-advised by Permal. We expect to begin offering this fund to accredited investors in the near future. 
Next is ClearBridge at $51 billion driven by higher equity markets. Looking forward to 2012, key focus will be on income-oriented products in which ClearBridge has good performance. The Legg Mason, ClearBridge equity income builder performed well for the calendar year. A U.K. version of the fund launched in the quarter and attracted $30 million in client money by year end, and that has risen nearly $45 million through the first half of January. 
Next is Batterymarch at nearly $18 billion, up sequentially driven by market appreciation. Showing improvement, the firm's performance for the quarter and year ending December 31, 2011, was strong across products. 86% of the firm's composites beat their benchmarks for the quarter and 68% of composites beat their benchmarks for the year. 
Projected funding in fiscal Q4 includes an additional $200 million from an existing client into Batterymarch's U.S. small cap fund and approximately $50 million into the fund's global emerging market strategy. Longer term, Batterymarch has also garnered interest in several products under development, including managed volatility and inflation-sensitive strategies. 
Brandywine ended the quarter at $33 billion driven by market appreciation and modest inflows. Brandywine has approximately $300 million in its one, but not funded pipeline. Its global bond fund has just established a 5-year track record with strong performance across the period. This fund has crossed the $1 billion mark, and we've seen inflows of approximately $100 million a month over the past several months. We have worked with Brandywine to add the fund to various platforms, and their specialists are out on the road with our wholesalers on a regular basis. 
Legg Mason Capital Management ended the quarter at over $8 billion. During the quarter, the firm announced that Sam Peters will be taking over as Chief Investment Officer and as sole Manager of the Value Trust in April 2012. 
Page 7 shows an update on Western asset. The upper left slide shows the total assets by mandate. The percentage of assets in specialized and broad market portfolios remains similar to last year -- last quarter, while taxable liquidity rose by a couple of percentage points. Western continues to see the most interest in its fixed-income business from specialized mandates, which typically are for smaller dollar amounts, but are generally higher fee assignments. 
All of the final presentations held in the quarter were for specialized mandates. The vast majority of the mandates won, but not yet funded in the quarter, were also for specialized mandates. The upper right corner of the slide shows the percentage of composite assets beating the benchmarks. It shows continued strength in the 3-year numbers. Our performance for the December '11 quarter remained strong in key strategies. Performance for the 1-year period modestly underperformed the benchmark as an even stronger December '10 quarter rolled off. 
Finally, the chart on the bottom shows long-term net flows. As you can see, outflows were improved slightly versus the previous quarter. However, they significantly improved versus the December quarters in '08, '09 and '10. Western's business continues to improve even with the softness in the institutional demand for active Core and Core Plus mandates. 
Areas of client interest include global credit, emerging market debt, high yield and multi-sector strategy. Another emerging area is active ETFs. Earlier this month, WisdomTree, an ETF sponsor, announced a new partnership with Western to create credit product. Legg Mason has an application in front of the SEC for actively managed products and has filed a proposed short duration bond fund as an initial product. 
Slide 8 shows our composite performance versus the benchmark covering 90% of our total assets. 3 and 10-year numbers remained strong, while there was a drop in percent of assets beating benchmarks in the 1 year. This reflects the Q4 '10, '11 differences that I cited previously. 
Slide 9 shows long-term fund performance against the category average, which shows performance against peers. Here, we show marked improvement in the 1-year numbers and consistent performance in 3-, 5- and 10-year numbers, each with over 70% majority. 
Slide 10 shows the breakdown of our global distribution platform. Total assets of $213 billion are serviced across North America, Asia, Europe, Australia and Japan. And we continue to expand our presence in markets, channels and advisers globally. The reorganization of our sales team in the United States that we announced last summer became effective last quarter, and we are very pleased with the initial receptivity to our expanded advisor coverage. 
Outside the U.S., our business in Japan, while down a bit given currency moves in the quarter, is still quite strong. It is complemented by beachhead investments in Europe and Asia. We are seeing encouraging receptivity to our efforts, particularly in Europe. 
While not covering every category, the product lineup that we are now marketing globally is the strongest it has been in years. We have multiple products with strong performance and key segments across equities, fixed-income alternatives to offer our clients. 
Slide 11 shows the trends in our U.S. distribution long-term flows. Net outflows in the quarter declined to $3.5 billion as opposed to $4.3 billion in the previous quarter. Over the past few months, redemption rates have modestly improved and compared favorably to the industry. Municipal and taxable fixed income mutual fund flows returned to positive in the quarter. And we believe we are in the strongest position we have been in with regard to our product set for some time. 
On the fixed-income side, this includes our Brandywine managed global bond fund and in contrast to what we've noted on the institutional side of the business, we see meaningful opportunity in the retail market for Western and Core and Core Plus mandates and growing interest in emerging market debt and high yield. Western's Core and Core Plus offerings were recently added to a large retirement plan. It is expected to fund in March with an initial $450 million. 
And on the equity side there's growing interest in ClearBridge's income solutions and Royce's diverse offerings. Slide 12 shows trends in our international distribution platform. Our international division posted its 12th straight quarter of positive flows although at a reduced level. Net flows were down driven primarily by reduced inflows into Brazilian and Australian bond funds, given currency and interest rate movements in the quarter. Also included in these numbers is an international client that moved out of the fund and into an institutional account through Western. 
Year-to-date, even with challenges in Europe given events surrounding the euro, the region had modestly positive flows driven by clients in Brandywine's Global bond fund, Western's high-yield fund and ClearBridge's aggressive growth fund. During the period, the U.K. business successfully launched a U.S. equity income fund mirroring the $4 billion strategy in the U.S. 
As the team looks to the year end and the year ahead, they believe they have a window of opportunity to capture market share from competitors, particularly on the fixed income side. And now to Pete."

So while we saw improvement in our ending equity",1573,"Thanks, Mark. As you could tell from Mark's comments, we had a challenging quarter, primarily due to market-driven impacts on our long-term AUM, as well as our final round of large transition-related cost. So while we saw improvement in our ending equity market valuations from the prior quarter, our average AUM was still down quarter-over-quarter. Also volatility and investor-risk aversion continue to adversely impact our high-yielding asset flows. 
While the decline in average AUM and lower performance fees resulted in lower sequential revenues, we continue to deliver strong investment performance to our clients and the flow picture did improve somewhat over the September quarter. We completed our streamlining as of December 31. And on the balance sheet front, we ended the period with over $1.2 billion in cash, $850 million of which is available to invest in the business or return to shareholders. 
Our fiscal third quarter saw a ramp-up in transition-related cost of $42 million as we completed all of our significant streamlining activities. Consequently, next quarter's results will be cleaner on this front as we will have minimal transition-related cost while seeing our first quarter of the full $35 million in cost savings. For the period, a number of other factors impacted our results. Though ending AUM of $627 billion was higher than the prior quarter end, average assets were lower by $21 billion despite improving long-term asset outflows and liquidity inflows. 
The lower average AUM put pressure on revenues, margins and earnings during the quarter. Also our performance fees came in below recent levels and significantly below the prior year quarter. Finally, the unrealized losses on our balance sheet investments of $1.8 million were significantly improved from last quarter's unrealized losses of $19.7 million. This quarter's relatively small loss was primarily driven by our alternative and emerging market seed investments. 
As a reminder, the fact that GAAP requires us to mark these investments to market each quarter creates volatility in our short-term results, but it is important to note these losses are unrealized, and our strong balance sheet and liquidity give us the ability to hold these investments until our strategic objectives have been achieved. 
Now let's turn to Page 13 to review the financial highlights for the quarter. The fiscal third quarter 2012 net income of $28 million yielded $0.20 in earnings per diluted share, including the impact to transition-related cost, which reduced our net income by $0.21 per diluted share. Operating revenues were down 6% compared to the prior quarter due to a $21 billion or 3% decrease in average AUM, a slightly lower advisory fee yield reflecting a drop in average equity AUM and a decline in performance fees. 
The $6.1 million in performance fees earned this quarter were largely driven by our fixed income managers: Western Asset and Brandywine. The decline from the prior quarter reflected lower fees from Permal and Western. In Permal's case, their fees are based on absolute performance and on net basis, they're below their high-water marks, particularly in their fixed-income mandate, which drives a significant portion of their fees. 
On a relative performance basis, although this mandate had negative performance, it did beat the hedge fund index their institutional clients measure them against. We anticipate the next couple of quarters' performance fees to be roughly in line with those generated in the December quarter. 
Operating expenses were up 1% reflecting a $42 million transition-related cost this quarter, which was up $27 million from the prior quarter. In addition, the mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed investments, which are offset in other nonoperating income and expenses was a $2 million positive in fiscal Q3 compared with a $14 million negative in the prior quarter. 
Excluding these 2 items, operating expenses were down 7% reflecting lower compensation of affiliates operating under our revenue share arrangements. The adjusted income, which excludes certain noncash and other items, were $77 million for the quarter or $0.55 per diluted share, which also includes the transition-related expenses. 
Moving on to Slide 14, the only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 26% on a GAAP basis compared with a net negative rate in the prior quarter as a result of the benefit from the U.K. tax reduction. 
For the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect our rate to be in the low to mid-30% range on a GAAP basis. But I'd also like to highlight, as has been the case in prior periods, our cash taxes will be much lower as our net operating loss carryforwards and foreign credits, along with our ability to amortize a significant amount of our intangible assets for tax purposes would generate $1.6 billion in future cash tax benefits. This will reduce the actual cash taxes we will pay both this year and prospectively and will allow us to utilize this extra cash for the benefit of shareholders. 
Flipping to Slide 15. You can see that the advisory fee yield declined this quarter from 35 basis points to 34 basis points, driven by lower average equity AUM and a simultaneous increase in average liquidity AUM during the quarter. 
On Slide 16, operating expenses for the quarter increased due to the transition-related costs compared with $15 million of transition-related costs in the prior quarter. In addition, the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on deferred comp and seed investments resulted in an increase of $2 million in compensation expense compared with the $14 million reduction last quarter. Distribution and servicing costs were lower due to the lower average AUM and revenues. Communications and technology increased as a result of transition-related costs, as well as higher consulting expenses incurred by revenue-sharing affiliates. 
Occupancy also increased due to $28 million in transition-related costs associated with the closure of various op and tech facilities, partially offset by lease reserves adjustment of approximately $5 million. 
And finally, the increase in other expenses also includes some transition-related costs, as well as higher operating costs largely at certain revenue-sharing affiliates, which are offset in comp and benefits. 
GAAP basis comp and benefits highlighted on Slide 17 were down 3% from last quarter, reflecting lower revenues and in the case of comp, lower transition-related cost, which were partially offset by higher deferred comp and seed investment-related expenses. Excluding the deferred comp and seed investment offset and transition-related costs, comp and benefit -- the net revenue ratio was 52%. This was down slightly from the prior quarter, principally due to increases in other expenses at the affiliates that are offsetting compensation. Normalized comp and net revenue ratio should approximate 53% in near term now that our streamlining is complete. 
Turning to Slide 18, the operating margin as adjusted came in slightly better than last quarter's results despite the 6% decrease in revenues as expenses x transition-related cost and mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed came in 7% lower. 
Turning to Slide 19, we were very pleased to have completed our streamlining on time and on budget. As I highlighted on last quarter's call, December 31 was the final milestone in our streamlining initiatives as we completed closing certain of our tech and op centers and had our final scheduled staff reductions. Over a 20-month period ending on January 1, 2012, we reduced headcount by over 500 employees or about 33% of our March 2010 corporate level staffing. 
With the $42 million in transition-related expenses this quarter, that brings our total transition-related cost to $126 million, and we expect the final $3 million in transition-related cost next quarter. Also next quarter, we will achieve our $35 million savings, which represents an annual run rate of approximately $140 million. 
Speaking of our fiscal fourth quarter, while we normally do not provide guidance, we recognize that this year is a bit unusual with our turnaround so I would like to provide you with an update on our outlook. For the market recovery in the December quarter, we are continuing to project earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.52 per share, reflecting moderate market appreciation for the remainder of the quarter. Our current thinking is that we will likely to come in at the mid to lower end of that range due to a drop in previously reported performance fees. 
Now turning to Slide 20. Despite continued market volatility, which led to our lower revenues, the ability of the Legg Mason operating model to generate substantial cash remain intact during the quarter. As you can see from our cash balances, we have over $1.2 billion of total cash as of December 31, 2011, $850 million of which is in excess of our operating needs. We also have seed investments of close to $400 million. And over the past 12 months, we've repurchased 470 million of stock and paid out $42 million in dividends while maintaining cash levels substantially the same as December 2010. 
As I indicated on the fiscal Q2 earnings call, we do not anticipate deploying the final $150 million of our -- excuse me, $155 million of our current share repurchase authorization until fiscal 2013. 
Our ending share count is now around 140 million shares, reflecting cumulative repurchases of 28.2 million shares or 17% of the shares outstanding since the board authorization in May 2010. Complement our repurchases, the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share, unchanged from the prior quarter. 
Thank you for your time and attention this morning, and now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Slide 21 shows our 3 strategic drivers for value creation: first, outstanding independent investment managers; second, a continued disciplined on a corporate center that delivers strategic value, particularly in global distribution; and third, a balanced portfolio across asset classes, geographies and channels. 
Slide 22 is a slide we introduced last quarter, which highlights our progress on various initiatives and performance metrics that we believe are positioning us for earnings leverage into an eventual recovery. One of the most important metrics in our opinion is the ability to generate cash even with volatile markets impacting asset and revenue levels. The chart at the top left highlights that our operating income as adjusted remains solid despite the lower average AUM this quarter. This is a strength of the affiliate model, and we remain confident that if current trends hold, including ongoing volatility, that this chart will likely hold up well. 
As Pete just covered in consistent with rating agency considerations, we do not anticipate repurchasing shares until the new fiscal year commences on April 1. But we are continually evaluating capital allocation. As you can see from the chart, the vast majority of the capital deployed in fiscal year-to-date is in the form of share repurchases and to a lesser extent, dividends. 
We also continue to look at seed investments in areas where we believe there is investor demand as we consider these investments to be important drivers of future organic growth. To this end, a listing of our top new product is shown in the Appendix. 
Additionally, as you stay on Page 22 on the lower left, over the last 4 quarters, we've generated annualized cost savings of more than $100 million. And as Pete stated, we are realizing the full $140 million annual run rate savings this quarter. 
Finally, we focused on performance and client service and out-performance in the critical 3-year time period remains strong. We were pleased that flow trends improved this quarter and are certainly working hard to build on our momentum over the longer term. 
So our ongoing cash generation, the completed expense reductions, solid investment performance and customer service and a balance sheet capable of returning significant capital to shareholders gives us optimism that we're in a good position to grow our earnings over time and create long-term value for shareholders. We're excited to be executing on these goals. 
And with that, we'll open the line for questions, and I thank you."

The legacy retail, which was their traditional high net worth business to intermediaries remains on the sidelines. And that has been disappointing.

The new retail, which they have really done quite a good job of, of working with kind of new distribution partners in Asia and parts of Europe is picking up some slack there.

Good morning, and welcome to our call for the December 31 quarter. Our results for the quarter reflected the effect of 2011's second half market turmoil, which impacted our asset and revenue levels. Even so, our core business fundamentals",2141,"Thank you, Alan. Good morning, and welcome to our call for the December 31 quarter. Our results for the quarter reflected the effect of 2011's second half market turmoil, which impacted our asset and revenue levels. Even so, our core business fundamentals held up well, particularly when you add back the considerable transition costs this quarter, which largely concludes our streamlining initiative. 
Our flow picture improved for the period as performance across our key affiliates remains strong and our distribution teams work closely with them to build momentum. By the end of the period, we had completed the 18 months streamlining that we announced in May 2010, on time and on budget. We are now realizing our targeted $140 million in annual cost savings. We could not have done this without the tireless efforts of our employees, and we thank them for the successful execution of this ambitious initiative. 
In addition, we enter the new calendar year with a balance sheet that remains strong and flexible with year-over-year cash levels almost flat, even after the return of $0.5 billion to shareholders over the past 12 months. This financial strength not only allows us to deploy capital opportunistically, but it also allows us to confidently invest in growing the business in new products and segments. Earlier this month, we held an investment forum for clients, FAs and media in New York with senior investment professionals from Western, Permal, ClearBridge and Royce. 
We had over 1,000 participants accessing the webcast or dialing in on the phone with more attending in person. One of the central questions of the discussion was what will it take to get investors back into the markets, particularly the equity markets. Our panelists agree that most advisers and retail investors will need to see a sustained rise in equity prices for some period of time. In this regard, we are encouraged by January's good start. 
In the meantime, our managers continue to see value in the market whether that be yields on high-quality equities that are the most attractive relative to bonds since the mid-'50s or non-treasury sectors of the bond markets, such as munis, credit and high yield. 
So now let's shift to our results on Slide 3. For the quarter, Legg Mason reported net income of $28 million and adjusted income of nearly $77 million. Results were impacted by higher transition-related charges, lower average AUM, which drove lower revenues, as well as lower performance fees. 
Importantly, we completed our restructuring on time and on budget. We had $26 million in cost savings this quarter, and we achieved our goal of $35 million in the current quarter or $140 million on an annualized basis. We ended the quarter in a position of strength with $1.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet, which we expect to use to both invest in growth and as appropriate, return to shareholders. 
On Slide 4, we see our Assets Under Management by asset class. We ended the quarter with $627 billion, up sequentially driven by market appreciation and reduced outflows both overall and for long-term assets. By asset class, we had 25% of our assets in equity, 56% in fixed income and 19% in liquidity. 
Slide 5 shows our net flows for the quarter. The long-term outflows improved from the prior quarter while liquidity flows were positive, reflecting an overall trend away from risk. Equity outflows were down slightly consistent with industry experience. Liquidity inflows were nearly $11 billion, again reflecting the derisking that occurred in the quarter. 
Fixed income outflows decreased from the prior quarter and resulted from continued withdrawals in the low fee, global sovereign mandate, risk rebalancing among institutional clients and a continued move by some clients to passive mandates. Of the $7.1 billion in fixed income outflows, the sovereign mandate accounted for $3.8 billion. 
Though the quarter's outflows were modestly better than last quarter, they were significantly improved from the December quarters in each of the prior 3 years. And we saw positive fixed income, income flows in the month of December despite the continued outflows from the global sovereign mandate. Overall, while 1 month is not a trend, based on the facts today, we are encouraged by the momentum we see both at key affiliates and in the markets. 
Slide 6 shows our assets by affiliates. Let's start with Western with $442 billion, up from the previous quarter driven by market appreciation and liquidity inflows. Fixed income outflows were driven primarily by the global sovereign mandate we've referenced for some time and other factors cited previously. These were partially offset by continued money into specialized mandates. We will go into more detail about Western in the next slide. 
Next is Royce at nearly $36 billion, up from the prior quarter due to market appreciation. Royce had outflows in the quarter and for the calendar year. Importantly, Royce's 3- and 5-year performance numbers remain strong. We are very pleased to partner with Royce in our offshore usage range,  which we raised $600 million in the calendar year. 
Next is Permal at nearly $18 billion. Gains in the U.S. institutional segment and new geographic regions in Asia and the Middle East were offset by continued high networth outflows as the eurozone and general market volatility remained in the headlines. Permal is continuing to grow the institutional business. In the U.S., they had additional inflows of $150 million in the quarter and continued advances in the U.K. They closed a $250 million opportunistic fund in the quarter and expected to roll out additional products that are similarly focused in the calendar year. 
Permal's cumulative unfunded wins were over $300 million. Legg Mason recently received approval from the SEC to offer a non-exchange listed closed-end fund that is a fund of hedge funds and is sub-advised by Permal. We expect to begin offering this fund to accredited investors in the near future. 
Next is ClearBridge at $51 billion driven by higher equity markets. Looking forward to 2012,the key focus will be on income-oriented products in which ClearBridge has good performance. The Legg Mason, ClearBridge Equity Income Builder performed well for the calendar year. A U.K. version of the fund launched in the quarter attracted $30 million in client money by year end, and that has risen nearly $45 million through the first half of January. 
Next is Batterymarch at nearly $18 billion, up sequentially driven by market appreciation. Showing improvement, the firm's performance for the quarter and year ending December 31, 2011, was strong across products. 86% of the firm's composites beat their benchmarks for the quarter and 68% of composites beat their benchmarks for the year. 
Projected funding in fiscal Q4 includes an additional $200 million from an existing client into Batterymarch's U.S. Small Cap fund and approximately $50 million into the fund's global emerging market strategy. Longer term, Batterymarch has also garnered interest in several products under development, including managed volatility and inflation-sensitive strategies. 
Brandywine ended the quarter at $33 billion driven by market appreciation and modest inflows. Brandywine has approximately $300 million in its one, but not funded pipeline. Its global bond fund has just established a 5-year track record with strong performance across the period. This fund has crossed the $1 billion mark, and we've seen inflows of approximately $100 million a month over the past several months. We have worked with Brandywine to add the fund to various platforms, and their specialists are out on the road with our wholesalers on a regular basis. 
Legg Mason Capital Management ended the quarter at over $8 billion. During the quarter, the firm announced that Sam Peters will be taking over as Chief Investment Officer and as sole Manager of the Value Trust in April 2012. 
Page 7 shows an update on Western asset. The upper left slide shows the total assets by mandate. The percentage of assets in specialized and broad market portfolios remains similar to last year -- last quarter, while taxable liquidity rose by a couple of percentage points. Western continues to see the most interest in its fixed-income business from specialized mandates, which typically are for smaller dollar amounts, but are generally higher fee assignments. 
All of the final presentations held in the quarter were for specialized mandates. The vast majority of the mandates won, but not yet funded in the quarter, were also for specialized mandates. The upper right corner of the slide shows the percentage of composite assets beating the benchmarks. It shows continued strength in the 3-year numbers. Our performance for the December '11 quarter remained strong in key strategies. Performance for the 1-year period modestly underperformed the benchmark as an even stronger December '10 quarter rolled off. 
Finally, the chart on the bottom shows long-term net flows. As you can see, outflows were improved slightly versus the previous quarter. However, they significantly improved versus the December quarters in '08, '09 and '10. Western's business continues to improve even with the softness in the institutional demand for active Core and Core Plus mandates. 
Areas of client interest include global credit, emerging market debt, high yield and multi-sector strategy. Another emerging area is active ETFs. Earlier this month, WisdomTree, an ETF sponsor, announced a new partnership with Western to create credit products. Legg Mason has an application in front of the SEC for actively managed products and has filed a proposed short duration bond fund as an initial product. 
Slide 8 shows our composite performance versus the benchmark covering 90% of our total assets. Three and 10-year numbers remained strong, while there was a drop in percent of assets beating benchmarks in the 1 year. This reflects the Q4 '10, '11 differences that I cited previously. 
Slide 9 shows long-term fund performance against the category average, which shows performance against peers. Here, we show marked improvement in the 1-year numbers and consistent performance in 3-, 5- and 10-year numbers, each with over 70% majority. 
Slide 10 shows the breakdown of our global distribution platform. Total assets of $213 billion are serviced across North America, Asia, Europe, Australia and Japan. And we continue to expand our presence in markets, channels and advisers globally. The reorganization of our sales team in the United States that we announced last summer became effective last quarter, and we are very pleased with the initial receptivity to our expanded advisor coverage. 
Outside the U.S., our business in Japan, while down a bit given currency moves in the quarter, is still quite strong. It is complemented by beachhead investments in Europe and Asia. We are seeing encouraging receptivity to our efforts, particularly in Europe. 
While not covering every category, the product lineup that we are now marketing globally is the strongest it has been in years. We have multiple products with strong performance in key segments across equities, fixed-income alternatives to offer our clients. 
Slide 11 shows the trends in our U.S. distribution long-term flows. Net outflows in the quarter declined to $3.5 billion as opposed to $4.3 billion in the previous quarter. Over the past few months, redemption rates have modestly improved and compared favorably to the industry. Municipal and taxable fixed income mutual fund flows returned to positive in the quarter. And we believe we are in the strongest position we have been in with regard to our product set for some time. 
On the fixed-income side, this includes our Brandywine managed global bond fund and in contrast to what we've noted on the institutional side of the business, we see meaningful opportunity in the retail market for Western and Core and Core Plus mandates and growing interest in emerging market debt and high yield. Western's Core and Core Plus offerings were recently added to a large retirement plan. It is expected to fund in March with an initial $450 million. 
And on the equity side there's growing interest in ClearBridge's income solutions and Royce's diverse offerings. Slide 12 shows trends in our international distribution platform. Our international division posted its 12th straight quarter of positive flows although at a reduced level. Net flows were down driven primarily by reduced inflows into Brazilian and Australian bond funds, given currency and interest rate movements in the quarter. Also included in these numbers is an international client that moved out of the fund and into an institutional account through Western. 
Year-to-date, even with challenges in Europe given events surrounding the euro, the region had modestly positive flows driven by clients in Brandywine's Global bond fund, Western's high-yield fund and ClearBridge's aggressive growth fund. During the period, the U.K. business successfully launched a U.S. equity income fund mirroring the $4 billion strategy in the U.S. 
As the team looks to the year end and the year ahead, they believe they have a window of opportunity to capture market share from competitors, particularly on the fixed income side. And now to Pete."

As you could tell from Mark's comments, we had a challenging quarter, primarily due to market-driven impacts on our long-term AUM, as well as our final round of large transition-related costs. So while we saw improvement in our ending equity",1573,"Thanks, Mark. As you could tell from Mark's comments, we had a challenging quarter, primarily due to market-driven impacts on our long-term AUM, as well as our final round of large transition-related costs. So while we saw improvement in our ending equity market valuations from the prior quarter, our average AUM was still down quarter-over-quarter. Also volatility and investor-risk aversion continue to adversely impact our high-yielding asset flows. 
While the decline in average AUM and lower performance fees resulted in lower sequential revenues, we continue to deliver strong investment performance to our clients and the flow picture did improve somewhat over the September quarter. We completed our streamlining as of December 31. And on the balance sheet front, we ended the period with over $1.2 billion in cash, $850 million of which is available to invest in the business or return to shareholders. 
Our fiscal third quarter saw a ramp-up in transition-related cost of $42 million as we completed all of our significant streamlining activities. Consequently, next quarter's results will be cleaner on this front as we will have minimal transition-related cost while seeing our first quarter of the full $35 million in cost savings. For the period, a number of other factors impacted our results. Though ending AUM of $627 billion was higher than the prior quarter end, average assets were lower by $21 billion despite improving long-term asset outflows and liquidity inflows. 
The lower average AUM put pressure on revenues, margins and earnings during the quarter. Also our performance fees came in below recent levels and significantly below the prior year quarter. Finally, the unrealized losses on our balance sheet investments of $1.8 million were significantly improved from last quarter's unrealized losses of $19.7 million. This quarter's relatively small loss was primarily driven by our alternative and emerging market seed investments. 
As a reminder, the fact that GAAP requires us to mark these investments to market each quarter creates volatility in our short-term results, but it is important to note these losses are unrealized, and our strong balance sheet and liquidity give us the ability to hold these investments until our strategic objectives have been achieved. 
Now let's turn to Page 13 to review the financial highlights for the quarter. The fiscal third quarter 2012 net income of $28 million yielded $0.20 in earnings per diluted share, including the impact of transition-related cost, which reduced our net income by $0.21 per diluted share. Operating revenues were down 6% compared to the prior quarter due to a $21 billion or 3% decrease in average AUM, a slightly lower advisory fee yield reflecting a drop in average equity AUM and a decline in performance fees. 
The $6.1 million in performance fees earned this quarter were largely driven by our fixed income managers: Western Asset and Brandywine. The decline from the prior quarter reflected lower fees from Permal and Western. In Permal's case, their fees are based on absolute performance and on that basis, they're below their high-water marks, particularly in their fixed-income mandate, which drives a significant portion of their fees. 
On a relative performance basis, although this mandate had negative performance, it did beat the hedge fund index their institutional clients measure them against. We anticipate the next couple of quarters' performance fees to be roughly in line with those generated in the December quarter. 
Operating expenses were up 1% reflecting a $42 million transition-related cost this quarter, which was up $27 million from the prior quarter. In addition, the mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed investments, which are offset in other nonoperating income and expenses was a $2 million positive in fiscal Q3 compared with a $14 million negative in the prior quarter. 
Excluding these 2 items, operating expenses were down 7% reflecting lower compensation of affiliates operating under our revenue share arrangements. The adjusted income, which excludes certain noncash and other items, was $77 million for the quarter or $0.55 per diluted share, which also includes the transition-related expenses. 
Moving on to Slide 14, the only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 26% on a GAAP basis compared with a net negative rate in the prior quarter as a result of the benefit from the U.K. tax reduction. 
For the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect our rate to be in the low to mid-30% range on a GAAP basis. But I'd also like to highlight, as has been the case in prior periods, our cash taxes will be much lower as our net operating loss carryforwards and foreign credits, along with our ability to amortize a significant amount of our intangible assets for tax purposes will generate $1.6 billion in future cash tax benefits. This will reduce the actual cash taxes we will pay both this year and prospectively and will allow us to utilize this extra cash for the benefit of shareholders. 
Flipping to Slide 15. You can see that the advisory fee yield declined this quarter from 35 basis points to 34 basis points, driven by lower average equity AUM and a simultaneous increase in average liquidity AUM during the quarter. 
On Slide 16, operating expenses for the quarter increased due to the transition-related costs compared with $15 million of transition-related costs in the prior quarter. In addition, the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on deferred comp and seed investments resulted in an increase of $2 million in compensation expense compared with a $14 million reduction last quarter. Distribution and servicing costs were lower due to the lower average AUM and revenues. Communications and technology increased as a result of transition-related costs, as well as higher consulting expenses incurred by revenue-sharing affiliates. 
Occupancy also increased due to $28 million in transition-related costs associated with the closure of various op and tech facilities, partially offset by lease reserves adjustment of approximately $5 million. 
And finally, the increase in other expenses also includes some transition-related costs, as well as higher operating costs largely at certain revenue-sharing affiliates, which are offset in comp and benefits. 
GAAP basis comp and benefits highlighted on Slide 17 were down 3% from last quarter, reflecting lower revenues and in the case of comp, lower transition-related cost, which were partially offset by higher deferred comp and seed investment-related expenses. Excluding the deferred comp and seed investment offset and transition-related costs, comp and benefit to net revenue ratio was 52%. This was down slightly from the prior quarter, principally due to increases in other expenses at the affiliates that are offsetting compensation. Normalized comp to net revenue ratio should approximate 53% in near term now that our streamlining is complete. 
Turning to Slide 18, the operating margin as adjusted came in slightly better than last quarter's results despite the 6% decrease in revenues as expenses ex transition-related cost and mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed came in 7% lower. 
Turning to Slide 19, we were very pleased to have completed our streamlining on time and on budget. As I highlighted on last quarter's call, December 31 was the final milestone in our streamlining initiatives as we completed closing certain of our tech and op centers and had our final scheduled staff reductions. Over a 20-month period ending on January 1, 2012, we reduced headcount by over 500 employees or about 33% of our March 2010 corporate level staffing. 
With the $42 million in transition-related expenses this quarter, that brings our total transition-related cost to $126 million, and we expect the final $3 million in transition-related cost next quarter. Also next quarter, we will achieve our $35 million savings, which represents an annual run rate of approximately $140 million. 
Speaking of our fiscal fourth quarter, while we normally do not provide guidance, we recognize that this year is a bit unusual with our turnaround so I would like to provide you with an update on our outlook. For the market recovery in the December quarter, we are continuing to project earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.52 per share, reflecting moderate market appreciation for the remainder of the quarter. Our current thinking is that we will likely to come in at the mid to lower end of that range due to a drop in previously reported performance fees. 
Now turning to Slide 20. Despite continued market volatility, which led to our lower revenues, the ability of the Legg Mason operating model to generate substantial cash remain intact during the quarter. As you can see from our cash balances, we have over $1.2 billion of total cash as of December 31, 2011, $850 million of which is in excess of our operating needs. We also have seed investments of close to $400 million. And over the past 12 months, we've repurchased $470 million of stock and paid out $42 million in dividends while maintaining cash levels substantially the same as December 2010. 
As I indicated on the fiscal Q2 earnings call, we do not anticipate deploying the final $150 million of our -- excuse me, $155 million of our current share repurchase authorization until fiscal 2013. 
Our ending share count is now around 140 million shares, reflecting cumulative repurchases of 28.2 million shares or 17% of the shares outstanding since the board authorization in May 2010. To complement our repurchases, the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share, unchanged from the prior quarter. 
Thank you for your time and attention this morning, and now I'll turn it back to Mark."

Slide 21 shows our 3 strategic drivers for value creation: first, outstanding independent investment managers; second, a continued disciplined on a corporate center that delivers strategic value, particularly in global distribution; and third, a balanced portfolio across asset classes, geographies and channels. 
Slide 22 is a slide we introduced last quarter, which highlights our progress on various initiatives and performance metrics that we believe are positioning us for earnings leverage into an eventual recovery. One of the most important metrics in our opinion is the ability to generate cash even with volatile markets impacting asset and revenue levels. The chart at the top left highlights that our operating income as adjusted remains solid despite the lower average AUM this quarter. This is a strength of the affiliate model, and we remain confident that if current trends hold, including ongoing volatility, that this chart will likely hold up well. 
As Pete just covered and consistent with rating agency considerations, we do not anticipate repurchasing shares until the new fiscal year commences on April 1. But we are continually evaluating capital allocation. As you can see from the chart, the vast majority of the capital deployed in fiscal year-to-date is in the form of share repurchases and to a lesser extent, dividends. 
We also continue to look at seed investments in areas where we believe there is investor demand as we consider these investments to be important drivers of future organic growth. To this end, a listing of our top new products is shown in the Appendix. 
Additionally, as you stay on Page 22 on the lower left, over the last 4 quarters, we've generated annualized cost savings of more than $100 million. And as Pete stated, we are realizing the full $140 million annual run rate savings this quarter. 
Finally, we focused on performance and client service and out-performance in the critical 3-year time period remains strong. We were pleased that flow trends improved this quarter and are certainly working hard to build on our momentum over the longer term. 
So our ongoing cash generation, completed expense reductions, solid investment performance and customer service and a balance sheet capable of returning significant capital to shareholders gives us optimism that we're in a good position to grow our earnings over time and create long-term value for shareholders. We're excited to be executing on these goals. 
And with that, we'll open the line for questions, and I thank you."

So if you take a theme going forward and say, and I think a number of consultants have pointed out, that fixed-income globally will continue to have substantial demand, although moderated from the prior years, Western's ability to win in that is improving. And some highlights in terms of just updates that we've given in the past, they have a won, but not yet funded amount of about $1.3 billion, which is the same as the prior quarter. They continue to get gains from existing clients. That is actually up 74%, and their losses from those clients is reducing meaningfully. So kind of the net ability to grow the book off of existing clients is improving. The areas where they're getting the momentum, both from existing clients and new clients is a pretty good range of this specialized category. It's ranging from muni to high yield to emerging market to limited duration to portable alpha. These are all areas where they had positive net flows for the quarter. So we feel good about the momentum there. And obviously, if you kind of back into the month of December, that was a important milestone. As always, we're going to say a month is not a trend make, but we're encouraged across-the-board there."

And so in that regard, I kind of reemphasize this broad area ranging from high yield to emerging markets to other kind of alpha-oriented strategies and really underscore one of the big themes that all of the consultants are talking about in this environment is kind of a global solution to this. And Western is really, we believe, one of the best, if not the best positioned to deliver that in terms of where their investment teams are located, their servicing teams and the client base that they serve in the markets that they invest in. So we think that's a good opportunity for us. I'll also say that the Core, Core Plus business, which Western is proud to have a leading position in, remains an important asset base.

Relative to the eurozone traditional high net worth business, Cynthia, Isaac Souede talks about kind of the new retail and the kind of legacy retail. The legacy retail, which was their traditional high net worth business through  intermediaries remains on the sidelines. And that has been disappointing. They were starting to come back in pre the volatility of second half of '11, and they've actually stepped back again. The new retail, which they have really done quite a good job of, of working with kind of new distribution partners in Asia and parts of Europe is picking up some slack there.

You can see in your mutual fund data through sources that small cap is meaningfully less in outflows January to date, so too is Royce. So that's kind of a favorable development that could continue.  Just basic returns give some support to that. The Russell 2000 is up 7% year-to-date versus the S&P in 5% and the Dow at 4%. Batterymarch improvement in performance in calendar year '11 is important because the longer-term challenges are now being kind of offset with improved performance in key strategies like emerging markets. And we referenced a couple of funded -- not yet funded wins in their both emerging market and small caps space. ClearBridge, I'm kind of hitting it several times because I think it's a very important opportunity is their income-oriented strategies, equity income builder, dividend strat, alongside their aggressive growth and even they're fundamental value has shown some performance.

And I would like to welcome everyone to the Legg Mason fiscal fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings call. Over the last fiscal year, we completed our streamlining initiatives and our full focus now is on growing our franchise. We believe that we have positioned the firm well across a number of categories to deliver investment solutions to our clients even with the near-term headwind of choppy markets.
Organic growth opportunities include strong positions in fixed income. With investment teams on the ground in most major investment centers, Western Asset can offer virtually any fixed-income solution in almost any currency. And Brandywine Global has strong traction in its global bond capability. Permal's macro strategies have significant appeal to investors in these markets, and we are working with them on opportunistic funds to capitalize on market volatility. Going forward, Permal see significant opportunity in China, sovereign wealth funds and U.S. and non-U.S. institutions and high net worth investors in the U.S. On the equity side, we continue to see opportunity in specific categories such as ClearBridge's income solutions products and MLP offerings as well as opportunities to expand Royce's presence with investors outside the U.S. We also actively looking at bolt-on and lift-out acquisitions to fill in product gaps. As markets around the world continue to work through structural issues, we recognize that it may take time to investor sentiment to get in line with the investment opportunities our managers see. But we believe we are well-positioned for the long term. And in the short term, we're well diversified and situated to withstand continued global financial challenges. 
Let's start with Slide 3 and discuss our progress across the strategic goals we laid out last year.
As I've said many times, our success starts with our investment managers. As we'll discuss in more detail later in the presentation, performance remains strong and our team managers with 80% of marketed composite assets beating benchmarks for the critical 3-year period. Managers continue to win recognition from third parties for performance in a variety of categories. We will go into more detail in the next slide. In the institutional space, our affiliates continue to see demand in specialized areas such as, as investors search for returns. Western has branched out into the active EPS space to the sub-advisory arrangement. And in addition, Legg Mason has an application pending with the SEC to start our offerings in that segment.
We have launched a 1099 fund of hedge funds to target U.S. high net worth individuals with Permal that we expect to gain traction later in the year. ClearBridge sees additional opportunities for MLP investment vehicles as that market expands particularly with institutions seeking yield.
At Legg Mason, we are focus on a corporate center that delivers strategic value. We've shifted resources in global distribution, providing more feet on the street and geographic reach. And we are working with our affiliates to launch new products where we see demand including 2 closed-end funds launch over the past year. And finally, we are allocating capital to benefit shareholders and strengthen our balanced portfolio. With our strong cash position, we repurchased 13.6 million shares in fiscal '12 and increase our quarterly dividend by 38% to $0.11 a share. Our SIV investment portfolio stands at nearly $400 million and represents $27 billion in assets today. And at the same time, we are more actively looking at targeted acquisitions to fill product gaps that will help to improve our asset mix inflows --
Slide 4 shows awards one, by Legg Mason managers. We are pleased to have won awards across several including Western, Royce, Permal, ClearBridge, Brandywine and our global asset allocation team. I would call out the institutional investor awards for Western and Brandywine who won municipal manager of the year and global fixed income manager of the year awards respectively, for 2011. 
Slide 5 highlights our results for the quarter. Legg Mason reported net income of approximately $76 million or $0.54 per diluted share, adjusted income which adds back certain noncash and other charges was approximately $124 million or $0.88 a share. In the quarter, we realized the remaining savings related to our completed streamlining initiatives. Our distribution team successfully completed the launch of the Legg Mason BW Global Income Opportunities closed-end fund raising approximately $459 million. The cost related to this successful launch for the quarter were $0.04 a share. We ended the year with a cash position of approximately $1.4 billion with $155 million remaining of our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which Pete will discuss later on. Long-term outflows improved 35% from the December '11 quarter.
Slide 6 shows assets by asset class. AUM was up to $643 billion driven by market appreciation. As of the March quarter, equity as a percent of those total assets rose 26%, fixed income was 55% and liquidity, 19%. And average AUM was also up 2% for the quarter as compared with December, which contributed to improved revenues.
Slide 7 shows net flows for the quarter. Importantly, fixed income flows continued to improve with the sequential reduction in outflows each quarter since September. In fact, fixed income flows improved throughout the quarter culminating in positive flows for the month of March despite continued outflows from the global sovereign mandate we've highlighted in the past. This outcome reflects positive trends at both Brandywine and Western.
Equity outflows were flat from the prior quarter reflecting continued industry-wide challenges for active equity managers, and we have inflows in liquidity assets. As we have discussed in the past, the final transfer of sweep assets to Morgan Stanley for offshore funds will occur at the beginning of May and the beginning of July. This will affect approximately $6 billion in liquidity AUM. We feel good about the improving trends we saw in the quarter and in the direction of our pipeline for current quarter. However, there will continue to be some near-term choppiness in month-to-month flows. In the month of April, there were some known redemptions including a previously announced $1 billion equity redemption from a public pension fund and a couple of fixed-income mandates that were partially offset by inflows in other categories.
Slide 8 shows assets under management by affiliate in order of their pre-tax contribution earnings per fiscal '12. First is Western Asset at $446 billion, up approximately 1% from last quarter driven by market appreciation, reduced long-term outflows and liquidity inflows.
We will go into greater detail in the next slide. Ever, performance, particularly in the 3-year time frame remains strong while the 1- 5- and 10-year   performance also improved from last quarter.
Western is seeking continued demand and is seeing continued demand in specialized mandates particularly global credit, emerging markets and high yield.
Overall, trends at Western are strengthening and the pipeline is growing. Second is Royce at nearly $40 billion, up 11% from the prior quarter driven by market appreciation. Royce experienced modest net outflows reflecting negative sentiment in the U.S. around equities including small cap. Outside the U.S., Royce is seeing continued interest in the funds they sub-advice for Legg Mason. Third is Permal. With over $18 billion up slightly from the prior quarter primarily driven by market appreciation as performance across their key funds continues to beat hedge fund indices. Gross the quarter were slightly positive. Permal made outstanding progress with institutions with net inflows of $340 million in the quarter primarily from U.S. institutions and sovereign wealth funds, which more than offset softness across the industry in their legacy high net worth channels. Fourth is ClearBridge at $56 billion. With improved AUM driven by market appreciation. ClearBridge is working through headwinds faced by many equity managers in terms of bringing retail demand back to equity products. However, they are beginning to build interest in income solutions strategies where they had net inflows for those products for the quarter. They've also built a won-but-not-funded pipeline of $600 million. This institutional effort has been building since 2010 and reflects focused differentiation around income solutions, low volatility and alpha generation. Early results are showing promise with 7 final presentations in the current quarter.
This is Batterymarch at $18 billion driven by market appreciation. Some institutions allocated money away from Batterymarch and from active mandates. This was partially offset by a small cap win at a large 401(k) platform. This mandate was in conjunction with the Legg Mason distribution team. In the quarter, Batterymarch also successfully rolled out the next generation of leadership towards investment in sales organization.
Next is Brandywine at $37 billion, up 12% for the quarter driven equally by market appreciation and inflows of approximately $2 billion. In addition to the Closed-End Funds and other funds sponsored by Legg Mason, Brandywine saw strong inflows from sovereign wealth funds. There are won-but-not-funded pipeline is approximately $1.2 billion. And Brandywine is adding salespeople to help turn performance momentum into an even better flow story.
Higher performance fees in the quarter reflect those strong performance in several accounts in which the annual performance fee is paid in the first calendar quarter of the year. And seventh is Legg Mason Capital Management at approximately $8 billion. On April 30, Sam Peters completed the transition as lead manager of the value trust. Slide 9 shows an update of Western Asset. The upper left-hand corner shows assets by mandate. As we've indicated for several quarters, they continue to see the greatest demand in specialized mandates, which represents 44% of the total. The upper right-hand corner shows composite performance against benchmarks, and that continues to be strong over most timeframes. But importantly, 91% is beating their benchmarks in the 3-year period, up from last quarter's level. There was also improved performance from last quarter against composites for the 1-, 5-, and 10-year timeframes as well. In the bottom, we show long-term net flowed trends. We continue to see improvement over the past several quarters. In fact, x the global sovereign mandate, the full year-over-year improvement is 64%. In particular, outflows from Core and Core Plus mandates have slowed year-over-year and this quarter.
Western's won-but-not-funded pipeline for the quarter ended March 31 is nearly $4 billion with the vast majority of that attributable in specialized mandates. RFP activity is significantly up from last quarter and from the prior year March quarter. In addition, our fund board has approved the addition of retail share classes to Western funds, which should occur in the current quarter and provide us with an opportunity to leverage those funds strong track record. And finally, Western opened an office in Dubai to serve existing clients and take advantage of the opportunities that they see in that region.
Slide 10 shows investment performance across the complex. Here we show the performance in 2 ways, by marketed composite versus their benchmarks and long-term U.S. fund assets versus the Lipper category averages.
We are pleased the performance continues to compare well across most periods in particular, the critical 3-year time period. In fact, the 1, 5 and 10-year performance versus benchmark and versus Lipper category average all improved this quarter from last quarter. 
Slide 11 provides an overview of our global distribution franchise. With offices in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and Japan. At $220 billion, this represents over 1/3 of Legg Mason's total assets under management. Here you also see our quarterly flow trends for the entire distribution platform both domestic and international. Net flows were positive for the quarter marking the sixth quarter in the last 9 where we've seen positive net flows from the global distribution team. International was a larger contributors to those flows, and while they have their, 13th straight quarter of inflows, they were down from prior quarters reflecting a slowdown in demand in Japan for some of the cross-border mandates.
On the U.S. side, outflows improved as overall growth sales were up 26% versus the prior quarter and redemption rates came down to 22% from 26% last quarter.
Moving forward, there is significant opportunity for specialized products like emerging market debt in the sub-advisory channel as well as global bonds and equity income solutions. Now let me turn it to Pete."

As Mark noted, we closed the fiscal year having completed our streamlining plan and realizing a full $35 million of cost saves in our fourth fiscal quarter. This quarter also saw an expected decline in transition related cost to $2 million f",1282,"Thanks, Mark. As Mark noted, we closed the fiscal year having completed our streamlining plan and realizing a full $35 million of cost saves in our fourth fiscal quarter. This quarter also saw an expected decline in transition related cost to $2 million from $42 million last quarter as we completed all of our streamlining activities. This will be our last quarter reporting transition related costs. For the period, a number of other factors impacted our results. This included higher average AUM, higher equity AUM as a percentage of the total, which helped to increase our effective yield. Both of which contributed to the increased advisory fee revenues. Our performance fees came in better than last quarter but still below last year's level. We also incurred $9.4 million in expenses related to Bwine's successful closed-end fund launch this quarter. These costs were more than offset by 2 onetime events where we realized a $7.5 million gain on the sale of a small wealth manager and an $8.6 million gain related to the resolution of the bankruptcy claim. Finally, there are a couple of tax items this quarter that resulted in a net benefit of $5 million or $0.03 per share. On the balance sheet front, we ended the fiscal year with $1.4 million in cash with over $1 billion available to invest in the business or return to shareholders.
On Slide 12, we provide a snapshot of the fiscal year. On the revenue front, lower average AUM and lower performance fees of $47 million drove the 4% decline in revenues while operating expenses declined 3% despite higher transition related costs. Earnings per share was down 6% for the fiscal year despite a 13% decline in net income due to the lower share count resulting from our stock buyback program. And finally, this year's effective tax rate benefited from a 2% decline in the U.K. corporate tax rate in fiscal 2012, which allowed us to revalue all of our deferred tax liabilities in the U.K. Turning to Slide 13, our fiscal fourth quarter 2012 net income of $76 million yielded $0.54 in earnings per diluted share. Operating revenues were up 3% compared to the prior quarter due to a $13 billion or 2% increase in average AUM. A slightly higher advisory fee yield reflecting a pickup in average equity AUM and a $9 million increase in performance fees. The $15 million in performance fees earned this quarter were largely driven by fixed-income mandates of Brandywine and Western Assets. The improvement in performance fees was principally due to annual performance fees earned at Brandywine this quarter. While difficult to predict with precision, we anticipate the next quarter's performance fees to likely be better than the December quarter but not quite as strong as the March quarter. Operating expenses were up 2% reflecting volume driven costs from the 3% increase in operating revenues, the closed-end fund cost of $9.4 million, an increase mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and SIV investments, which are offset in nonoperating income and expense. Partially offsetting these cost increases were lower transition related costs this quarter.
Adjusted income, which excludes certain noncash and other items, but includes transition related expenses, was $124 million for the quarter or $0.88 per diluted share. 
Moving on to Slide 14, the only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 30% on a GAAP basis compared with our targeted rate of the low to mid-30s. The lower rate reflected by the onetime credit and year-end adjustments. The tax outlook for fiscal '13 and beyond is for an effective GAAP tax run rate ranging from 34% to 36%. But we do expect fiscal '13 to benefit from another U.K. tax rate reduction of 2%, which will likely incur in the fiscal second quarter as it has for the last several years.
Slide 15 is a roll forward from fiscal Q3's EPS of $0.20 to this quarter's earnings per share of $0.24. Lower transition related costs and streamlining savings contributed a combined $0.23 of improvement, while higher net revenues and performance fees and other nonoperating income contributed $0.15 to the improved earnings per share. Finally, the closed-end fund launch this quarter cost $0.04 a share. Turning to Slide 16, you can see that the advisory fee yield increased this quarter from 34 to 35 basis points driven by an improved asset mix, specifically higher average equity AUM in the quarter.
Turning to 17. Operating expenses for the quarter increased primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, which I'll address and the next slide. Other factors impacting operating expenses were higher distribution and servicing cost reflecting both the closed-end fund launch this quarter and the higher average AUM and revenues, along with decreased technology and occupancy expenses reflecting the impact of last quarter's transition related costs.
Finally, other expenses decreased due to an assessment fee refund, lower fund related costs as well as lower advertising and professional fees.
Turning to Slide 18, total comp and benefits were up from last quarter reflecting higher deferred comp and SIV investment related expenses and due to higher net revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower transition related and severance costs. Excluding the deferred comp and SIV investment offset and transition related costs, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio was 55%. This was up from the prior quarter reflecting expenses related to the closed-end fund launch, which had a 1% impact on the comp ratio. In addition,, seasonal benefit costs and commissions related to increased sales contributed to the higher comp ratio. As a reminder, last quarter's compensation ratio was low by approximately 1% due to higher non-comp expenses in revenue share affiliates that were offset in compensation.
On Slide 19, the operating margin as adjusted is in line with last quarter as the approximately 2.5% improvement from the streamlining and increased revenue was offset by the closed-end fund launch and seasonal and variable compensation costs. On Slide 20, you can see that our fiscal '13 tax rate is projected to be approximately 35%, over 2/3 of which is noncash. This is an area where we will continue to highlight as we believe many investors don't fully appreciate the significantly reduced level of cash taxes that we pay. This lower level of cash taxes results from our NOL carryforwards and our ability to amortize our goodwill and indefinite live intangibles for tax purposes. When you translate our effective cash tax rate into dollars on the right-hand side of the schedule, you'll see that we will have a cash tax benefit related to these favorable tax attributes of $1.5 billion. But to be clear, our tax yield will save us prospectively $1.5 billion in actual cash taxes paid. 
Now turning to Slide 21, despite continued market volatility, the ability of the Legg Mason operating model to generate substantial cash remained intact. During the quarter, our total cash increased from $1.2 billion as of December 31, to $1.4 billion as of our fiscal year-end. Over $1 billion of that is in excess cash and in excess of our operating needs.
And over the past 12 months, we've repurchased 400 million of stock and paid out $44 million in dividends while maintaining cash levels substantially the same as March 31, 2011.
On the stock repurchase front, our ending share count remains at around 140 million shares after cumulative repurchases of 28.2 million shares or 17% of shares outstanding since the board authorization in May 2010. It is our expectation that we will deploy the remaining $155 million of the authorization in fiscal 2013. And thanks for your time and your attention. And now Mark, back to you."

Slide 22 shows the diversity and scale of our business across asset classes, client profile and revenues.
As the gross revenue pie at the bottom of page illustrates, Legg Mason does have significant diversity across equity, fixed income and alternatives. As we've stated, we intend to continue to seek balance across geographies, asset classes and channels and we'll look to do that by investing in our affiliate franchises and through selected bolt-on and lift-out acquisitions. Slide 23 shows our progress on various initiatives and performance metrics that we believe are positioning us for earnings leverage. The chart at the top left highlights the persistency of our operating income as adjusted. This quarter's results can also be adjusted for our closed-end fund cost. We remain confident that if current trends hold including ongoing volatility, this chart will likely hold up well. As Pete just covered, we plan to use the remaining $155 million in share repurchase authorization during fiscal '13. And we are continually evaluating capital allocation. As you can see from the chart, the vast majority of the capital we have deployed is in the form of share repurchases and to a lesser extent, dividends. Going forward, the board has approved a 38% increase on our dividend to shareholders. As you can see on the lower left, we have now completed our streamlining and we've generated annualized cost savings of more than $140 million effective this quarter. Finally, we focused on performance in client service and outperformance in the critical 3-year time period remains strong. We are pleased that flow trends improved this quarter, and are certainly working hard to build on our momentum over the long term. When our streamlining in the rearview mirror, Slide 24 lays out our roadmap for revenue and EPS growth. Our competitive strength include our multi-manager model, which brings together some of the top investors in the industry, with recognized expertise and respected brand. Another advantage is our scale. With over $640 billion in assets, we are one of the largest asset managers globally.
Of that $640 billion in assets, 37% is for clients outside the U.S. And other $2.7 billion in gross revenues, 44% comes from equity, 36% from fixed income, 14% from alternatives and 6% from liquidity. We will seek to strengthen this diversification with greater presence in international equity and alternatives. And finally, our global distribution franchise is a key competitive advantage with over $220 billion in assets. It is very leverageable and has the ability to be a significant contributor, up profitable growth as sales and flow trends improved. And as use on a previous chart, we have generated over $900 million in operating income as adjusted over the past 2 years. So on a go-forward basis, we plan to further diversify and grow our earnings by executing on 3 key priorities. First, organic growth. Our strong performance achievements will guide affiliate-led institutional expansion and LM's global retail momentum. Continued success in product development will target differentiated solutions to better meet client needs. And second, we will work with our affiliates on selected bolt-on and lift-out opportunities as well as targeted acquisitions to fill product gaps. And finally, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. As a management team, we are excited to be executing on on this growth agenda. And with that, we'll open the lines for questions, and I thank you."

We work closely with them to launch new funds and to work hard in expanding there share and so if you take the core and Core+ category this new initiative is to add share classes to those existing funds and make them more available to financial intermediaries regardless of how you want to buy the fund. So that's a key one. As it relates to ClearBridge on the equity side, this income solutions suite of products is getting a lot of momentum both at the fund side but also the separate account. There's a bit of a resurgence going on an intermediary land around retail separate accounts that are really conducive to this kind of market environment in terms of investors coming back. Permal, we're working with them on this 1099 fund, which will be quite an innovation, 1099 benefit to the investor, not K-1 and with their strong track record and LNG distribution, one of our distribution partners kind of referenced in a meeting last week, that's a powerful combination. Brandywine, what we've done in the closed-end side, most recently is indicative of leveraging their global capability. As you can see I can go on. With Royce, we work with them on a kind of a niche basis, where they have a legacy coverage in let's say certain areas like the IRA community where we supplement what they've done historically, but in the kind of traditional FA mutual fund suite program, we've been able to add some new momentum. Obviously, SIV is important in our ability to work with the affiliates and launch new products and where appropriate to get SIV capital to get them going, I think it's mutually beneficial."

And then if you look at the pipeline to see RFP pipeline at Western for example, that volume is up 30% sequentially, quarter-over-quarter and up 40% year-over-year and it's registering approximately $12 billion of potential business. Now all of these things are very encouraging. On the other hand, we do reference at this continue to be choppy markets, you've heard that from other firms reporting in the past couple of weeks. But we see and are most confident about is improved performance across the Board, real momentum in activity at patch and getting back to normalized win rates in most of our managers. And so this is all subject to work to be done but we are net-net encouraged."

I would say I would going back to a question you actually asked last time in terms of where we're growing is where the world is growing at Permal. In Asia, in U.S., et cetera.

But the reality from here on out, market mix and flows, are going to be the key things that are going to drive us. And while we don't control the market, we certainly like the general direction. And then mix and flows, we have fair ability to impact that in terms of where we choose to play, and as one example with Western going after more specialized product business.

As markets around the world continue to work through structural issues, we recognize that it may take time for investor sentiment to get in line with the investment opportunities our managers see. But we believe we are well-positioned for the long term. And in the short term, we're well diversified and situated to withstand continued global financial challenges. 
Let's start with Slide 3 and discuss our progress across the strategic goals we laid out last year.
As I've said many times, our success starts with our investment managers. As we'll discuss in more detail later in the presentation, performance remains strong in our team managers with 80% of marketed composite assets beating benchmarks for the critical 3-year period. Managers continue to win recognition from third parties for performance in a variety of categories. We will go into more detail in the next slide. In the institutional space, our affiliates continue to see demand in specialized areas such as, as investors search for returns. Western has branched out into the active ETF space to a sub-advisory arrangement. And in addition, Legg Mason has an application pending with the SEC to start our offerings in that segment.
We have launched a 1099 fund of hedge funds to target U.S. high net worth individuals with Permal, that we expect to gain traction later in the year. ClearBridge sees additional opportunities for MLP investment vehicles as that market expands particularly with institutions seeking yield.
At Legg Mason, we are focused on a corporate center that delivers strategic value. We've shifted resources in global distribution, providing more feet on the street and geographic reach. And we are working with our affiliates to launch new products where we see demand including 2 closed-end funds launched over the past year. And finally, we are allocating capital to benefit shareholders and strengthen our balanced portfolio. With our strong cash position, we repurchased 13.6 million shares in fiscal '12 and increase our quarterly dividend by 38% to $0.11 a share. Our SIV investment portfolio stands at nearly $400 million and represents $27 billion in assets today. And at the same time, we are more actively looking at targeted acquisitions to fill product gaps that will help to improve our asset mix inflows. 
Slide 4 shows awards won by Legg Mason managers. We're pleased to have won awards across several including Western, Royce, Permal, ClearBridge, Brandywine and our Global Asset Allocation team. I would call out the institutional investor awards for Western and Brandywine who won Municipal Manager of the Year and Global Fixed Income Manager of the Year awards respectively, for 2011. 
Slide 5 highlights our results for the quarter. Legg Mason reported net income of approximately $76 million or $0.54 per diluted share, adjusted income which adds back certain noncash and other charges was approximately $124 million or $0.88 a share. In the quarter, we realized the remaining savings related to our completed streamlining initiatives. Our distribution team successfully completed the launch of the Legg Mason BW Global Income Opportunities closed-end fund raising approximately $459 million. The cost related to this successful launch for the quarter were $0.04 a share. We ended the year with a cash position of approximately $1.4 billion with $155 million remaining of our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which Pete will discuss later on. Long-term outflows improved 35% from the December '11 quarter.
Slide 6 shows assets by asset class. AUM was up to $643 billion driven by market appreciation. As of the March quarter, equity as a percent of those total assets rose 26%, fixed income was 55% and liquidity, 19%. And average AUM was also up 2% for the quarter as compared with December, which contributed to improved revenues.
Slide 7 shows net flows for the quarter. Importantly, fixed income flows continued to improve with the sequential reduction in outflows each quarter since September. In fact, fixed income flows improved throughout the quarter culminating in positive flows for the month of March despite continued outflows from the global sovereign mandate we've highlighted in the past. This outcome reflects positive trends at both Brandywine and Western.
Equity outflows were flat from the prior quarter reflecting continued industrywide challenges for active equity managers, and we had inflows in liquidity assets. As we have discussed in the past, the final transfer of sweep assets to Morgan Stanley for offshore funds will occur at the beginning of May and the beginning of July. This will affect approximately $6 billion in liquidity AUM. We feel good about the improving trends we saw in the quarter and in the direction of our pipeline for current quarter. However, there will continue to be some near-term choppiness in month-to-month flows. In the month of April, there were some known redemptions including a previously announced $1 billion equity redemption from a public pension fund and a couple of fixed-income mandates that were partially offset by inflows in other categories.
Slide 8 shows assets under management by affiliate in order of their pre-tax contribution earnings per fiscal '12. First is Western Asset at $446 billion, up approximately 1% from last quarter driven by market appreciation, reduced long-term outflows and liquidity inflows.
We will go into greater detail in the next slide. Ever, performance, particularly in the 3-year timeframe remains strong while the 1-, 5- and 10-year performance also improved from last quarter.
Western is seeking continued demand and is seeing continued demand in specialized mandates particularly global credit, emerging markets and high yield.
Overall, trends at Western are strengthening and the pipeline is growing. Second is Royce at nearly $40 billion, up 11% from the prior quarter driven by market appreciation. Royce experienced modest net outflows reflecting negative sentiment in the U.S. around equities including small cap. Outside the U.S., Royce is seeing continued interest in the funds they sub-advice for Legg Mason. Third is Permal. With over $18 billion up slightly from the prior quarter primarily driven by market appreciation as performance across their key funds continues to beat hedge fund indices. Gross for the quarter were slightly positive. Permal made outstanding progress with institutions with net inflows of $340 million in the quarter primarily from U.S. institutions and sovereign wealth funds, which more than offset softness across the industry in their legacy high net worth channels. Fourth is ClearBridge at $56 billion. With improved AUM driven by market appreciation. ClearBridge is working through headwinds faced by many equity managers in terms of bringing retail demand back to equity products. However, they are beginning to build interest in income solutions strategies where they had net inflows for those products for the quarter. They've also built a won-but-not-funded pipeline of $600 million. This institutional effort has been building since 2010 and reflects focused differentiation around income solutions, low volatility and alpha generation. Early results are showing promise with 7 finals presentations in the current quarter.
This is Batterymarch at $18 billion driven by market appreciation. Some institutions allocated money away from Batterymarch and from active mandates. This was partially offset by a small cap win at a large 401(k) platform. This mandate was in conjunction with the Legg Mason distribution team. In the quarter, Batterymarch also successfully rolled out the next generation of leadership towards investment in sales organization.
Next is Brandywine at $37 billion, up 12% for the quarter driven equally by market appreciation and inflows of approximately $2 billion. In addition to the closed-end funds and other funds sponsored by Legg Mason, Brandywine saw strong inflows from sovereign wealth funds. Their won-but-not-funded pipeline is approximately $1.2 billion. And Brandywine is adding salespeople to help turn performance momentum into an even better flow story.
Higher performance fees in the quarter reflect those strong performance in several accounts in which the annual performance fee is paid in the first calendar quarter of the year. And seventh is Legg Mason Capital Management at approximately $8 billion. On April 30, Sam Peters completed the transition as lead manager of the Value Trust. 
Slide 9 shows an update of Western Asset. The upper left-hand corner shows assets by mandate. As we've indicated for several quarters, they continue to see the greatest demand in specialized mandates, which represents 44% of the total. The upper right-hand corner shows composite performance against benchmarks, and that continues to be strong over most timeframes. But importantly, 91% is beating their benchmarks in the 3-year period, up from last quarter's level. There was also improved performance from last quarter against composites for the 1-, 5-, and 10-year timeframes as well. In the bottom, we show long-term net flow trends. We continue to see improvement over the past several quarters. In fact, x the global sovereign mandate, the full year-over-year improvement is 64%. In particular, outflows from Core and Core Plus mandates have slowed year-over-year and this quarter.
Western's won-but-not-funded pipeline for the quarter ended March 31 is nearly $4 billion with the vast majority of that attributable to specialized mandates. RFP activity is significantly up from last quarter and from the prior year March quarter. In addition, our fund board has approved the addition of retail share classes to Western funds, which should occur in the current quarter and provide us with an opportunity to leverage those fund's strong track record. And finally, Western opened an office in Dubai to serve existing clients and take advantage of the opportunities that they see in that region.
Slide 10 shows investment performance across the complex. Here we show the performance in 2 ways, by marketed composite versus their benchmarks and long-term U.S. fund assets versus the Lipper category averages.
We are pleased the performance continues to compare well across most periods in particular, the critical 3-year time period. In fact, the 1-, 5- and 10-year performance versus benchmark and versus Lipper category average all improved this quarter from last quarter. 
Slide 11 provides an overview of our global distribution franchise. With offices in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and Japan. At $220 billion, this represents over 1/3 of Legg Mason's total assets under management. Here you also see our quarterly flow trends for the entire distribution platform both domestic and international. Net flows were positive for the quarter marking the sixth quarter in the last 9 where we've seen positive net flows from the global distribution team. International was a larger contributors to those flows, and while they had their, 13th straight quarter of inflows, they were down from prior quarters reflecting a slowdown in demand in Japan for some of the cross-border mandates.
On the U.S. side, outflows improved as overall growth sales were up 26% versus the prior quarter and redemption rates came down to 22% from 26% last quarter.
Moving forward, there is significant opportunity for specialized products like emerging market debt in the sub-advisory channel as well as global bonds and equity income solutions. Now let me turn it to Pete."
180481,184405373,293663,"Legg Mason Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. As Mark noted, we closed the fiscal year having completed our streamlining plan and realizing a full $35 million of cost saves in our fourth fiscal quarter. This quarter also saw an expected decline in transition-related cost to $2 million f",1279,"Thanks, Mark. As Mark noted, we closed the fiscal year having completed our streamlining plan and realizing a full $35 million of cost saves in our fourth fiscal quarter. This quarter also saw an expected decline in transition-related cost to $2 million from $42 million last quarter as we completed all of our streamlining activities. This will be our last quarter reporting transition related costs. 
For the period, a number of other factors impacted our results. This included higher average AUM, higher equity AUM as a percentage of the total, which helped to increase our effective yield. Both of which contributed to the increased advisory fee revenues. Our performance fees came in better than last quarter but still below last year's level. We also incurred $9.4 million in expenses related to Bwine's successful closed-end fund launch this quarter. These costs were more than offset by 2 one-time events where we realized a $7.5 million gain on the sale of a small wealth manager and an $8.6 million gain related to the resolution of a bankruptcy claim. 
Finally, there are a couple of tax items this quarter that resulted in a net benefit of $5 million or $0.03 per share. On the balance sheet front, we ended the fiscal year with $1.4 million in cash with over $1 billion available to invest in the business or return to shareholders.
On Slide 12, we provide a snapshot of the fiscal year. On the revenue front, lower average AUM and lower performance fees of $47 million drove the 4% decline in revenues while operating expenses declined 3% despite higher transition related costs. Earnings per share was down 6% for the fiscal year despite a 13% decline in net income due to the lower share count resulting from our stock buyback program. And finally, this year's effective tax rate benefited from a 2% decline in the U.K. corporate tax rate in fiscal 2012, which allowed us to revalue all of our deferred tax liabilities in the U.K. 
Turning to Slide 13, our fiscal fourth quarter 2012 net income of $76 million yielded $0.54 in earnings per diluted share. Operating revenues were up 3% compared to the prior quarter due to a $13 billion or 2% increase in average AUM. A slightly higher advisory fee yield reflecting a pickup in average equity AUM and a $9 million increase in performance fees. The $15 million in performance fees earned this quarter were largely driven by fixed-income mandates of Brandywine and Western Asset. The improvement in performance fees was principally due to annual performance fees earned at Brandywine this quarter. 
While difficult to predict with precision, we anticipate the next quarter's performance fees to likely be better than the December quarter but not quite as strong as the March quarter. Operating expenses were up 2% reflecting volume driven costs from the 3% increase in operating revenues, the closed-end fund cost of $9.4 million, an increase mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and SIV investments, which are offset in other nonoperating income and expense. Partially offsetting these cost increases were lower transition related costs this quarter.
Adjusted income, which excludes certain noncash and other items, but includes transition related expenses, was $124 million for the quarter or $0.88 per diluted share. 
Moving on to Slide 14, the only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 30% on a GAAP basis compared with our targeted rate of the low to mid-30s. The lower rate reflected by the one-time credit and year-end adjustments. The tax outlook for fiscal '13 and beyond is for an effective GAAP tax run rate ranging from 34% to 36%. But we do expect fiscal '13 to benefit from another U.K. tax rate reduction of 2%, which will likely incur in the fiscal second quarter as it has for the last several years.
Slide 15 is a roll forward from fiscal Q3's EPS of $0.20 to this quarter's earnings per share of $0.5. Lower transition related costs and streamlining savings contributed a combined $0.23 of improvement, while higher net revenues and performance fees and other nonoperating income contributed $0.15 to the improved earnings per share.  Finally, the closed-end fund launch this quarter cost $0.04 a share. 
Turning to Slide 16, you can see that the advisory fee yield increased this quarter from 34 to 35 basis points driven by an improved asset mix, specifically higher average equity AUM in the quarter.
Turning to 17. Operating expenses for the quarter increased primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, which I'll address on the next slide. Other factors impacting operating expenses were higher distribution and servicing cost reflecting both the closed-end fund launch this quarter and the higher average AUM and revenues, along with decreased technology and occupancy expenses reflecting the impact of last quarter's transition related costs.  Finally, other expenses decreased due to an assessment fee refund, lower fund related costs as well as lower advertising and professional fees.
Turning to Slide 18, total comp and benefits were up from last quarter reflecting higher deferred comp and SIV investment-related expenses and due to higher net revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower transition-related and severance costs. Excluding the deferred comp and SIV investment offset and transition related costs, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio was 55%. This was up from the prior quarter reflecting expenses related to the closed-end fund launch, which had a 1% impact on the comp ratio. In addition, seasonal benefit costs and commissions related to increased sales contributed to the higher comp ratio. And as a reminder, last quarter's compensation ratio was low by approximately 1% due to higher noncomp expenses in revenue share affiliates that were offset in compensation.
On Slide 19, the operating margin as adjusted is in line with last quarter as the approximately 2.5% improvement from the streamlining and increased revenue was offset by the closed-end fund launch and seasonable, seasonal and variable compensation costs. 
On Slide 20, you can see that our fiscal '13 tax rate is projected to be approximately 35%, over 2/3 of which is noncash. This is an area we will continue to highlight, as we believe many investors don't fully appreciate the significantly reduced level of cash taxes that we pay. This lower level of cash taxes results from our NOL carryforward and our ability to amortize our goodwill and indefinite live intangibles for tax purposes. When you translate our effective cash tax rate into dollars on the right-hand side of the schedule, you'll see that we will have a cash tax benefit related to these favorable tax attributes of $1.5 billion. But to be clear, our tax yield will save us prospectively $1.5 billion in actual cash taxes paid. 
Now turning to Slide 21, despite continued market volatility, the ability of the Legg Mason operating model to generate substantial cash remained intact. During the quarter, our total cash increased from $1.2 billion as of December 31, to $1.4 billion as of our fiscal year-end. Over $1 billion of that is an excess cash in excess of our operating needs.
And over the past 12 months, we've repurchased 400 million of stock and paid out $44 million in dividends while maintaining cash levels substantially the same as March 31, 2011.
On the stock repurchase front, our ending share count remains at around 140 million shares after cumulative repurchases of 28.2 million shares or 17% of shares outstanding since the board authorization in May 2010. It is our expectation that we will deploy the remaining $155 million of the authorization in fiscal 2013. Thanks for your time and your attention. And now Mark, back to you."

Slide 22 shows the diversity and scale of our business across asset classes, client profile and revenues.
As the gross revenue pie at the bottom of page illustrates, Legg Mason does have significant diversity across equity, fixed income and alternatives. As we've stated, we intend to continue to seek balance across geographies, asset classes and channels and we'll look to do that by investing in our affiliate franchises and through selected bolt-on and lift-out acquisitions. 
Slide 23 shows our progress on various initiatives and performance metrics that we believe are positioning us for earnings leverage. The chart at the top left highlights the persistency of our operating income as adjusted. This quarter's results can also be adjusted for our closed-end fund cost. We remain confident that if current trends hold including ongoing volatility, this chart will likely hold up well. As Pete just covered, we plan to use the remaining $155 million in share repurchase authorization during fiscal '13. And we are continually evaluating capital allocation. As you can see from the chart, the vast majority of the capital we have deployed is in the form of share repurchases and to a lesser extent, dividends. Going forward, the board has approved a 38% increase on our dividend to shareholders. As you can see on the lower left, we have now completed our streamlining and we've generated annualized cost savings of more than $140 million effective this quarter. 
Finally, we focused on performance in client service and outperformance in the critical 3-year time period remains strong. We are pleased that flow trends improved this quarter, and are certainly working hard to build on our momentum over the long term. 
When our streamlining in the rearview mirror, Slide 24 lays out our roadmap for revenue and EPS growth. Our competitive strength include our multi-manager model, which brings together some of the top investors in the industry, with recognized expertise and respected brand. Another advantage is our scale. With over $640 billion in assets, we are one of the largest asset managers globally.  Of that $640 billion in assets, 37% is for clients outside the U.S. And other $2.7 billion in gross revenues, 44% comes from equity, 36% from fixed income, 14% from alternatives and 6% from liquidity. We will seek to strengthen this diversification with greater presence in international equity and alternatives. 
And finally, our global distribution franchise is a key competitive advantage with over $220 billion in assets. It is very leverageable and has the ability to be a significant contributor, a profitable growth as sales and flow trends improved. And as you saw on a previous chart, we have generated over $900 million in operating income as adjusted over the past 2 years. 
So on a go-forward basis, we plan to further diversify and grow our earnings by executing on 3 key priorities. First, organic growth. Our strong performance achievements will guide affiliate-led institutional expansion and LM's global retail momentum. Continued success in product development will target differentiated solutions to better meet client needs. And second, we will work with our affiliates on selected bolt-on and lift-out opportunities as well as targeted acquisitions to fill product gaps. And finally, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. As a management team, we are excited to be executing on this growth agenda. And with that, we'll open the line for questions, and I thank you."

Western has a very good and broad product line in both the U.S. and international. We work closely with them on existing products like the top-ranked Core, Core Plus funds from the Western family as well as specific funds in international markets like Japan. We work closely with them to launch new funds and to work hard in expanding their share. So if you take the Core and Core Plus category, this new initiative is to add share classes to those existing funds and make them more available to financial intermediaries regardless of how you want to buy the fund. So that's a key one. As it relates to ClearBridge on the equity side, this income solutions suite of products is getting a lot of momentum both at the fund side but also the separate account. There's a bit of a resurgence going on in an intermediary land around retail separate accounts that are really conducive to this kind of market environment in terms of investors coming back. Permal, we're working with them on this 1099 fund, which will be quite an innovation, 1099 benefit to the investor, not K-1 and with their strong track record and LMG distribution, one of our distribution partners kind of referenced in a meeting last week, that's a powerful combination. Brandywine, what we've done on the closed-end side, most recently is indicative of leveraging their global capability. As you could see I can go on. With Royce, we work with them on a kind of a niche basis, where they have a legacy coverage in, let's say, certain areas like the RIA community where we supplement what they've done historically, but in the kind of traditional FA mutual fund suite program, we've been able to add some new momentum. Obviously, SIV is important in our ability to work with the affiliates and launch new products and where appropriate to put some SIV capital to get them going, I think it's been mutually beneficial."

And the forest is continued improvement across the flow story particularly in fixed income, particularly in alternatives and in some areas of equity. However, there will continue to be the trees, the month-to-month. We had a terrific March as you can back into and we affirm today. On the other hand, we do see a couple of known redemptions coming in April. But that doesn't offset our encouragement above the overall and it's the pipeline numbers that allow for that. Western it's $4 billion. Permal at approximately $400 million. ClearBridge at $600 million. Brandywine at $1.2 billion. These are one business that's not yet funded. And then if you look at the pipeline to see RFP pipeline at Western for example, that volume is up 30% sequentially, quarter-over-quarter and up 40% year-over-year and it's registering approximately $12 billion of potential business. Now all of these things are very encouraging. On the other hand, we do reference, there's continue to be choppy markets, you've heard that from other firms reporting in the past couple of weeks. And -- but what we see and are most confident about is improved performance across the board, real momentum in activity at patch and getting back to normalized win rates in most of our managers. And so this is all subject to work to be done but we're net-net encouraged."

So so long as you perform, you're actually pretty comparable. I would say, going back to actually the question you asked last time in terms of where we're growing is where the world is growing at Permal, in Asia, in U.S., et cetera.

Over the last fiscal year, we completed our streamlining initiatives and our full focus now is on growing our franchise. We beli",2026,"Thank you, Alan. And I would like to welcome everyone to the Legg Mason fiscal fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings call. Over the last fiscal year, we completed our streamlining initiatives and our full focus now is on growing our franchise. We believe that we have positioned the firm well across a number of categories to deliver investment solutions to our clients even with the near-term headwind of choppy markets.
Organic growth opportunities include strong positions in fixed income. With investment teams on the ground in most major investment centers, Western Asset can offer virtually any fixed-income solution in almost any currency. And Brandywine Global has strong traction in its global bond capability. Permal's macro strategies have significant appeal for investors in these markets, and we are working with them on opportunistic funds to capitalize on market volatility. Going forward, Permal sees significant opportunity in China, sovereign wealth funds, U.S. and non-U.S. institutions and high net-worth investors in the U.S. On the equity side, we continue to see opportunity in specific categories such as ClearBridge's income solutions products and MLP offerings, as well as opportunities to expand Royce's presence with investors outside the U.S. We also actively looking at bolt-on and lift-out acquisitions to fill in product gaps. As markets around the world continue to work through structural issues, we recognize that it may take time for investor sentiment to get in line with the investment opportunities our managers see. But we believe that we are well-positioned for the long term. And in the short term, we're well diversified and situated to withstand continued global financial challenges. 
Let's start with Slide 3 and discuss our progress across the strategic goals we laid out last year.
As I've said many times, our success starts with our investment managers. As we'll discuss in more detail later in the presentation, performance remains strong in our team managers, with 80% of marketed composite assets beating benchmarks for the critical 3-year period. Managers continue to win recognition from third parties for performance in a variety of categories. We will go into more detail in the next slide. In the institutional space, our affiliates continue to see demand in specialized areas such as -- as investors search for returns. Western has branched out into the active ETF space through a sub-advisory arrangement. And in addition, Legg Mason has an application pending with the SEC to start our offerings in that segment.
We have launched a 1099 fund of hedge funds to target U.S. high net-worth individuals with Permal, that we expect to gain traction later in the year. ClearBridge sees additional opportunities for MLP investment vehicles as that market expands, particularly with institutions seeking yield.
At Legg Mason, we are focused on a corporate center that delivers strategic value. We've shifted resources in global distribution, providing more feet on the street and geographic reach. And we are working with our affiliates to launch new products where we see demand including 2 closed-end funds launched over the past year. And finally, we are allocating capital to benefit shareholders and strengthen our balanced portfolio. With our strong cash position, we repurchased 13.6 million shares in fiscal '12 and increased our quarterly dividend by 38% to $0.11 a share. Our SIV [ph] investment portfolio stands at nearly $400 million and represents $27 billion in assets today. And at the same time, we are more actively looking at targeted acquisitions to fill product gaps that will help to improve our asset mix and flows. 
Slide 4 shows awards won by Legg Mason managers. We're pleased to have won awards across several including Western, Royce, Permal, ClearBridge, Brandywine and our Global Asset Allocation team. I would call out the institutional investor awards for Western and Brandywine, who won Municipal Manager of the Year and Global Fixed Income Manager of the Year awards, respectively, for 2011. 
Slide 5 highlights our results for the quarter. Legg Mason reported net income of approximately $76 million or $0.54 per diluted share. Adjusted income, which adds back certain noncash and other charges, was approximately $124 million or $0.88 a share. In the quarter, we realized the remaining savings related to our completed streamlining initiatives. Our distribution team successfully completed the launch of the Legg Mason BW Global Income Opportunities closed-end fund, raising approximately $459 million. The costs related to this successful launch for the quarter were $0.04 a share. We ended the year with a cash position of approximately $1.4 billion, with $155 million remaining of our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which Pete will discuss later on. Long-term outflows improved 35% from the December '11 quarter.
Slide 6 shows assets by asset class. AUM was up to $643 billion driven by market appreciation. As of the March quarter, equity as a percent of those total assets rose to 26%, fixed income was 55% and liquidity, 19%. And average AUM was also up 2% for the quarter as compared with December, which contributed to improved revenues.
Slide 7 shows net flows for the quarter. Importantly, fixed income flows continued to improve with the sequential reduction in outflows each quarter since September. In fact, fixed income flows improved throughout the quarter, culminating in positive flows for the month of March despite continued outflows from the global sovereign mandate we've highlighted in the past. This outcome reflects positive trends at both Brandywine and Western.
Equity outflows were flat from the prior quarter, reflecting continued industry-wide challenges for active equity managers, and we had inflows in liquidity assets. As we have discussed in the past, the final transfer of sweep assets to Morgan Stanley for offshore funds will occur at the beginning of May and the beginning of July. This will affect approximately $6 billion in liquidity AUM. We feel good about the improving trends we saw in the quarter and in the direction of our pipeline for the current quarter. However, there will continue to be some near-term choppiness in month-to-month flows. In the month of April, there were some known redemptions, including a previously announced $1 billion equity redemption from a public pension fund and a couple of fixed-income mandates that were partially offset by inflows in other categories.
Slide 8 shows assets under management by affiliate in order of their pre-tax contribution earnings for fiscal '12. First is Western Asset at $446 billion, up approximately 1% from last quarter driven by market appreciation, reduced long-term outflows and liquidity inflows.
We will go into greater detail in the next slide. However, performance, particularly in the 3-year timeframe remains strong, while the 1-, 5- and 10-year performance also improved from last quarter.
Western is seeking continued demand and is seeing continued demand in specialized mandates particularly global credit, emerging markets and high yield.  Overall, trends at Western are strengthening and the pipeline is growing. 
Second is Royce at nearly $40 billion, up 11% from the prior quarter driven by market appreciation. Royce experienced modest net outflows reflecting negative sentiment in the U.S. around equities including small cap. Outside the U.S., Royce is seeing continued interest in the funds they sub-advise for Legg Mason. 
Third is Permal, with over $18 billion up slightly from the prior quarter primarily driven by market appreciation as performance across their key funds continues to beat hedge fund indices. Gross for the quarter were slightly positive. Permal made outstanding progress with institutions, with net inflows of $340 million in the quarter primarily from U.S. institutions and sovereign wealth funds, which more than offset softness across the industry in their legacy high-net-worth channels. 
Fourth is ClearBridge at $56 billion, with improved AUM driven by market appreciation. ClearBridge is working through headwinds faced by many equity managers in terms of bringing retail demand back to equity products. However, they are beginning to build interest in income solutions strategies where they had net inflows for those products for the quarter. They've also built a won-but-not-funded pipeline of $600 million. This institutional effort has been building since 2010 and reflects focused differentiation around income solutions, low volatility and alpha generation. Early results are showing promise, with 7 finals presentations in the current quarter.
Fifth is Batterymarch at $18 billion driven by market appreciation. Some institutions allocated money away from Batterymarch and from active mandates. This was partially offset by a small cap win at a large 401(k) platform. This mandate was in conjunction with the Legg Mason distribution team. In the quarter, Batterymarch also successfully rolled out the next generation of leadership towards investment in sales organization.
Next is Brandywine at $37 billion, up 12% for the quarter driven equally by market appreciation and inflows of approximately $2 billion. In addition to the closed-end funds and other funds sponsored by Legg Mason, Brandywine saw strong inflows from sovereign wealth funds. Their won-but-not-funded pipeline is approximately $1.2 billion. And Brandywine is adding salespeople to help turn performance momentum into an even better flow story.
Higher performance fees in the quarter reflect those strong performance in several accounts in which the annual performance fee is paid in the first calendar quarter of the year. 
And seventh is Legg Mason Capital Management at approximately $8 billion. On April 30, Sam Peters completed the transition as lead manager of the Value Trust. 
Slide 9 shows an update of Western Asset. The upper left-hand corner shows assets by mandate. As we've indicated for several quarters, they continue to see the greatest demand in specialized mandates, which represents 44% of the total. The upper right-hand corner shows composite performance against benchmarks, and that continues to be strong over most timeframes, but importantly, 91% is beating their benchmarks in the 3-year period, up from last quarter's level. There was also improved performance from last quarter against composites for the 1-, 5-, and 10-year timeframes as well. On the bottom, we show long-term net flow trends. We continue to see improvement over the past several quarters. In fact, x the global sovereign mandate, the full year-over-year improvement is 64%. In particular, outflows from Core and Core Plus mandates have slowed year-over-year and this quarter.
Western's won-but-not-funded pipeline for the quarter ended March 31 is nearly $4 billion, with the vast majority of that attributable to specialized mandates. RFP activity is significantly up from last quarter and from the prior year March quarter. In addition, our fund board has approved the addition of retail share classes to Western funds, which should occur in the current quarter and provide us with an opportunity to leverage those fund's strong track record. And finally, Western opened an office in Dubai to serve existing clients and take advantage of the opportunities that they see in that region.
Slide 10 shows investment performance across the complex. Here we show the performance in 2 ways, by marketed composite versus their benchmarks and long-term U.S. fund assets versus the Lipper category averages.
We are pleased that performance continues to compare well across most periods, in particular, the critical 3-year time period. In fact, the 1-, 5- and 10-year performance versus benchmark and versus Lipper category average all improved this quarter from last quarter. 
Slide 11 provides an overview of our global distribution franchise. With offices in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and Japan. At $220 billion, this represents over 1/3 of Legg Mason's total assets under management. Here you also see our quarterly flow trends for the entire distribution platform, both domestic and international. Net flows were positive for the quarter marking the sixth quarter in the last 9 where we've seen positive net flows from the global distribution team. International was the larger contributors to those flows, and while they had their, 13th straight quarter of inflows, they were down from prior quarters reflecting a slowdown in demand in Japan for some of the cross-border mandates.
On the U.S. side, outflows improved as overall gross sales were up 26% versus the prior quarter and redemption rates came down to 22% from 26% last quarter.
Moving forward, there is significant opportunity for specialized products like emerging market debt in the sub-advisory channel as well as global bonds and equity income solutions. Now let me turn it to Pete."
180481,184405373,293866,"Legg Mason Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. As Mark noted, we closed the fiscal year having completed our streamlining plan and realizing a full $35 million of cost saves in our fourth fiscal quarter. This quarter also saw an expected decline in transition-related cost to $2 million f",1284,"Thanks, Mark. As Mark noted, we closed the fiscal year having completed our streamlining plan and realizing a full $35 million of cost saves in our fourth fiscal quarter. This quarter also saw an expected decline in transition-related cost to $2 million from $42 million last quarter as we completed all of our streamlining activities. This will be our last quarter reporting transition related costs. 
For the period, a number of other factors impacted our results. These included higher average AUM, higher equity AUM as a percentage of the total, which helped to increase our effective yield, both of which contributed to the increased advisory fee revenues. Our performance fees came in better than last quarter but still below last year's level. We also incurred $9.4 million in expenses related to Bwine's successful closed-end fund launch this quarter. These costs were more than offset by 2 one-time events where we realized a $7.5 million gain on the sale of a small wealth manager and an $8.6 million gain related to the resolution of a bankruptcy claim. 
Finally, there are a couple of tax items this quarter that resulted in a net benefit of $5 million or $0.03 per share. On the balance sheet front, we ended the fiscal year with $1.4 million in cash, with over $1 billion available to invest in the business or return to shareholders.
On Slide 12, we provide a snapshot of the fiscal year. On the revenue front, lower average AUM and lower performance fees of $47 million drove the 4% decline in revenues, while operating expenses declined 3% despite higher transition related costs. Earnings per share was down 6% for the fiscal year despite a 13% decline in net income due to the lower share count resulting from our stock buyback program. And finally, this year's effective tax rate benefited from a 2% decline in the U.K. corporate tax rate in fiscal 2012, which allowed us to revalue all of our deferred tax liabilities in the U.K. 
Turning to Slide 13, our fiscal fourth quarter 2012 net income of $76 million yielded $0.54 in earnings per diluted share. Operating revenues were up 3% compared to the prior quarter due to a $13 billion or 2% increase in average AUM, a slightly higher advisory fee yield reflecting a pickup in average equity AUM and a $9 million increase in performance fees. The $15 million in performance fees earned this quarter were largely driven by fixed-income mandates at Brandywine and Western Asset. The improvement in performance fees was principally due to annual performance fees earned at Brandywine this quarter. 
While difficult to predict with precision, we anticipate the next quarter's performance fees to likely be better than the December quarter but not quite as strong as the March quarter. Operating expenses were up 2% reflecting volume driven costs from the 3% increase in operating revenues, the closed-end fund cost of $9.4 million, an increase mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and SIV [ph] investments, which are offset in other nonoperating income and expense. Partially offsetting these cost increases were lower transition related costs this quarter.
Adjusted income, which excludes certain noncash and other items, but includes transition related expenses, was $124 million for the quarter or $0.88 per diluted share. 
Moving on to Slide 14, the only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 30% on a GAAP basis compared with our targeted rate of the low to mid-30s. The lower rate reflected both a one-time credit and year-end adjustments. The tax outlook for fiscal '13 and beyond is for an effective GAAP tax run rate ranging from 34% to 36%. But we do expect fiscal '13 to benefit from another U.K. tax rate reduction of 2%, which will likely incur in the fiscal second quarter as it has for the last several years.
Slide 15 is a roll forward from fiscal Q3's EPS of $0.20 to this quarter's earnings per share of $0.54. Lower transition related costs and streamlining savings contributed a combined $0.23 of improvement, while higher net revenues and performance fees and other nonoperating income contributed $0.15 to the improved earnings per share. Finally, the closed-end fund launch this quarter cost $0.04 a share. 
Turning to Slide 16, you can see that the advisory fee yield increased this quarter from 34 to 35 basis points, driven by an improved asset mix, specifically higher average equity AUM in the quarter.
Turning to 17. Operating expenses for the quarter increased primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, which I'll address on the next slide. Other factors impacting operating expenses were higher distribution and servicing costs reflecting both the closed-end fund launch this quarter and the higher average AUM and revenues, along with decreased technology and occupancy expenses reflecting the impact of last quarter's transition related costs. Finally, other expenses decreased due to an assessment fee refund, lower fund related costs as well as lower advertising and professional fees.
Turning to Slide 18, total comp and benefits were up from last quarter reflecting higher deferred comp and SIV [ph] investment-related expenses and due to higher net revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower transition-related and severance costs. Excluding the deferred comp and SIV [ph] investment offset and transition related costs, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio was 55%. This was up from the prior quarter reflecting expenses related to the closed-end fund launch, which had a 1% impact on the comp ratio. In addition, seasonal benefit costs and commissions related to increased sales contributed to the higher comp ratio. And as a reminder, last quarter's compensation ratio was low by approximately 1% due to higher noncomp expenses in revenue share affiliates that were offset in compensation.
On Slide 19, the operating margin as adjusted is in line with last quarter as the approximately 2.5% improvement from the streamlining and increased, revenue was offset by the closed-end fund launch and seasonable -- seasonal and variable compensation costs 
On Slide 20, you can see that our fiscal '13 tax rate is projected to be approximately 35%, over 2/3 of which is noncash. This is an area we will continue to highlight, as we believe many investors don't fully appreciate the significantly reduced level of cash taxes that we pay. This lower level of cash taxes results from our NOL carry forward and our ability to amortize our goodwill and indefinite live intangibles for tax purposes. When you translate our effective cash tax rate into dollars on the right-hand side of the schedule, you see that we will have a cash tax benefit related to these favorable tax attributes of $1.5 billion. But to be clear, our tax shield will save us prospectively $1.5 billion in actual cash taxes paid. 
Now turning to Slide 21. Despite continued market volatility, the ability of the Legg Mason operating model to generate substantial cash remained intact. During the quarter, our total cash increased from $1.2 billion as of December 31, to $1.4 billion as of our fiscal year-end. Over $1 billion of that is in excess cash, in excess of our operating needs.
And over the past 12 months, we've repurchased 400 million of stock and paid out $44 million in dividends while maintaining cash levels substantially the same as March 31, 2011.
On the stock repurchase front, our ending share count remains at around 140 million shares after cumulative repurchases of 28.2 million shares, or 17% of shares outstanding since the board authorization in May 2010. It is our expectation that we will deploy the remaining $155 million of the authorization in fiscal 2013. Thanks for your time and your attention. And now Mark, back to you."

Slide 22 shows the diversity and scale of our business across asset classes, client profile and revenues.As the gross revenue pie at the bottom of the page illustrates, Legg Mason does have significant diversity across equity, fixed income",573,"Thanks, Pete. Slide 22 shows the diversity and scale of our business across asset classes, client profile and revenues.
As the gross revenue pie at the bottom of the page illustrates, Legg Mason does have significant diversity across equity, fixed income and alternatives. As we've stated, we intend to continue to seek balance across geographies, asset classes and channels and we'll look to do that by investing in our affiliate franchises and through selected bolt-on and lift-out acquisitions. 
Slide 23 shows our progress on various initiatives and performance metrics that we believe are positioning us for earnings leverage. The chart at the top left highlights the persistency of our operating income as adjusted. This quarter's results can also be adjusted for our closed-end fund cost. We remain confident that if current trends hold, including ongoing volatility, this chart will likely hold up well. As Pete just covered, we plan to use the remaining $155 million in share repurchase authorization during fiscal '13. And we are continually evaluating capital allocation. As you can see from the chart, the vast majority of the capital we have deployed is in the form of share repurchases and to a lesser extent, dividends. Going forward, the board has approved a 38% increase on our dividend to shareholders. As you can see on the lower left, we have now completed our streamlining and we've generated annualized cost savings of more than $140 million effective this quarter. 
Finally, we focused on performance in client service and out-performance in the critical 3-year time period remains strong. We are pleased that flow trends improved this quarter, and are certainly working hard to build on our momentum over the long term. 
With our streamlining in the rearview mirror, Slide 24 lays out our roadmap for revenue and EPS growth. Our competitive strengths include our multi-manager model, which brings together some of the top investors in the industry, with recognized expertise and respected brands. Another advantage is our scale. With over $640 billion in assets, we are one of the largest asset managers globally. Of that $640 billion in assets, 37% is for clients outside the U.S. And other $2.7 billion in gross revenues, 44% comes from equity, 36% from fixed income, 14% from alternatives and 6% from liquidity. We will seek to strengthen this diversification with greater presence in international equity and alternatives. 
And finally, our global distribution franchise is a key competitive advantage with over $220 billion in assets. It is very leverageable and has the ability to be a significant contributor  [Audio Gap] profitable growth as sales and flow trends improve. And as you saw on the previous chart, we have generated over $900 million in operating income as adjusted over the past 2 years. 
So on a go-forward basis, we plan to further diversify and grow earnings by executing on 3 key priorities. First, organic growth. Our strong performance achievements will guide affiliate-led institutional expansion and LM's global retail momentum. Continued success in product development will target differentiated solutions to better meet client needs. And second, we will work with our affiliates on selected bolt-on and lift-out opportunities as well as targeted acquisitions to fill product gaps. And finally, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. As a management team, we are excited to be executing on this growth agenda. And with that, we'll open the line for questions, and I thank you."

Western has a very good and broad product line in both the U.S. and international. We work closely with them on existing products like the top-ranked Core, Core Plus funds from the Western family as well as specific funds in international markets like Japan. We work closely with them to launch new funds and to work hard in expanding their share. So if you take the Core and Core Plus category, this new initiative is to add share classes to those existing funds and make them more available to financial intermediaries regardless of how you want to buy the fund. So that's a key one. As it relates to ClearBridge on the equity side, this income solutions suite of products is getting a lot of momentum both at the fund side but also the separate account. There's a bit of a resurgence going on in intermediary land around retail separate accounts that are really conducive to this kind of market environment in terms of investors coming back. Permal, we're working with them on this 1099 fund, which will be quite an innovation, 1099 benefit to the investor, not K-1, and with their strong track record and LMG distribution, one of our distribution partners kind of referenced in a meeting last week, that's a powerful combination. Brandywine, what we've done on the closed-end side most recently is indicative of leveraging their global capability. As you could see I can go on. With Royce, we work with them on a kind of a niche basis, where they have a legacy coverage in, let's say, certain areas like the RIA community where we supplement what they've done historically, but in the kind of traditional FA mutual fund suite program, we've been able to add some new momentum. Obviously, SIV [ph] is important in our ability to work with the affiliates and launch new products and, where appropriate, to put some SIV [ph] capital to get them going, I think has been mutually beneficial."

We want to do that by really focusing on growing and leveraging the investments that we have at hand. So what we see is organic growth. As you see, kind of the pipeline's probably never been as strong, certainly since -- over the last several years across most of the managers. The ability to leverage that where appropriate through retail, where we get the incremental operating leverage, is valuable. So we see, subject to delivery, improving on flow improvements and getting into positive flows, getting the mix continued to improve, that we can then leverage and we can both improve margin with minimal incremental investment in some of these key distribution and corporate areas.

On the other hand, we do see a couple of known redemptions coming in April, but that doesn't offset our encouragement above the overall and it's the pipeline numbers that allow for that. Western it's $4 billion. Permal at approximately $400 million. ClearBridge at $600 million. Brandywine at $1.2 billion. These are one business that's not yet funded. And then if you look at the pipeline, to see RFP pipeline at Western for example, that volume is up 30% sequentially, quarter-over-quarter and up 40% year-over-year, and it's registering approximately $12 billion of potential business. Now all of these things are very encouraging. On the other hand, we do reference, there's continued to be choppy markets, you've heard that from other firms reporting in the past couple of weeks. And -- but what we see and are most confident about is improved performance across the board, real momentum in activity at patch [ph] and getting back to normalized win rates in most of our managers.

And I would like to welcome everyone to the Legg Mason fiscal fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings call. Over the last fiscal year, we completed our streamlining initiatives and our full focus now is on growing our franchise. We believe that we have positioned the firm well across a number of categories to deliver investment solutions to our clients even with the near-term headwind of choppy markets.
Organic growth opportunities include strong positions in fixed income. With investment teams on the ground in most major investment centers, Western Asset can offer virtually any fixed-income solution in almost any currency. And Brandywine Global has strong traction in its global bond capability. Permal's macro strategies have significant appeal for investors in these markets, and we are working with them on opportunistic funds to capitalize on market volatility. Going forward, Permal sees significant opportunity in China, sovereign wealth funds, U.S. and non-U.S. institutions and high net-worth investors in the U.S. On the equity side, we continue to see opportunity in specific categories such as ClearBridge's income solutions products and MLP offerings, as well as opportunities to expand Royce's presence with investors outside the U.S. We also actively looking at bolt-on and lift-out acquisitions to fill in product gaps. As markets around the world continue to work through structural issues, we recognize that it may take time for investor sentiment to get in line with the investment opportunities our managers see. But we believe that we are well-positioned for the long term. And in the short term, we're well diversified and situated to withstand continued global financial challenges. 
Let's start with Slide 3 and discuss our progress across the strategic goals we laid out last year.
As I've said many times, our success starts with our investment managers. As we'll discuss in more detail later in the presentation, performance remains strong in our team managers, with 80% of marketed composite assets beating benchmarks for the critical 3-year period. Managers continue to win recognition from third parties for performance in a variety of categories. We will go into more detail in the next slide. In the institutional space, our affiliates continue to see demand in specialized areas such as -- as investors search for returns. Western has branched out into the active ETF space through a sub-advisory arrangement. And in addition, Legg Mason has an application pending with the SEC to start our offerings in that segment.
We have launched a 1099 fund of hedge funds to target U.S. high net-worth individuals with Permal, that we expect to gain traction later in the year. ClearBridge sees additional opportunities for MLP investment vehicles as that market expands, particularly with institutions seeking yield.
At Legg Mason, we are focused on a corporate center that delivers strategic value. We've shifted resources in global distribution, providing more feet on the street and geographic reach. And we are working with our affiliates to launch new products where we see demand including 2 closed-end funds launched over the past year. And finally, we are allocating capital to benefit shareholders and strengthen our balanced portfolio. With our strong cash position, we repurchased 13.6 million shares in fiscal '12 and increased our quarterly dividend by 38% to $0.11 a share. Our SIV [ph] investment portfolio stands at nearly $400 million and represents $27 billion in assets today. And at the same time, we are more actively looking at targeted acquisitions to fill product gaps that will help to improve our asset mix and flows. 
Slide 4 shows awards won by Legg Mason managers. We're pleased to have won awards across several including Western, Royce, Permal, ClearBridge, Brandywine and our Global Asset Allocation team. I would call out the institutional investor awards for Western and Brandywine, who won Municipal Manager of the Year and Global Fixed Income Manager of the Year awards, respectively, for 2011. 
Slide 5 highlights our results for the quarter. Legg Mason reported net income of approximately $76 million or $0.54 per diluted share. Adjusted income, which adds back certain noncash and other charges, was approximately $124 million or $0.88 a share. In the quarter, we realized the remaining savings related to our completed streamlining initiatives. Our distribution team successfully completed the launch of the Legg Mason BW Global Income Opportunities closed-end fund, raising approximately $459 million. The costs related to this successful launch for the quarter were $0.04 a share. We ended the year with a cash position of approximately $1.4 billion, with $155 million remaining of our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which Pete will discuss later on. Long-term outflows improved 35% from the December '11 quarter.
Slide 6 shows assets by asset class. AUM was up to $643 billion driven by market appreciation. As of the March quarter, equity as a percent of those total assets rose to 26%, fixed income was 55% and liquidity, 19%. And average AUM was also up 2% for the quarter as compared with December, which contributed to improved revenues.
Slide 7 shows net flows for the quarter. Importantly, fixed income flows continued to improve with the sequential reduction in outflows each quarter since September. In fact, fixed income flows improved throughout the quarter, culminating in positive flows for the month of March despite continued outflows from the global sovereign mandate we've highlighted in the past. This outcome reflects positive trends at both Brandywine and Western.
Equity outflows were flat from the prior quarter, reflecting continued industry-wide challenges for active equity managers, and we had inflows in liquidity assets. As we have discussed in the past, the final transfer of sweep assets to Morgan Stanley for offshore funds will occur at the beginning of May and the beginning of July. This will affect approximately $6 billion in liquidity AUM. We feel good about the improving trends we saw in the quarter and in the direction of our pipeline for the current quarter. However, there will continue to be some near-term choppiness in month-to-month flows. In the month of April, there were some known redemptions, including a previously announced $1 billion equity redemption from a public pension fund and a couple of fixed-income mandates that were partially offset by inflows in other categories.
Slide 8 shows assets under management by affiliate in order of their pre-tax contribution earnings for fiscal '12. First is Western Asset at $446 billion, up approximately 1% from last quarter driven by market appreciation, reduced long-term outflows and liquidity inflows.
We will go into greater detail in the next slide. However, performance, particularly in the 3-year timeframe remains strong, while the 1-, 5- and 10-year performance also improved from last quarter.
Western is seeking continued demand and is seeing continued demand in specialized mandates particularly global credit, emerging markets and high yield.  Overall, trends at Western are strengthening and the pipeline is growing. 
Second is Royce at nearly $40 billion, up 11% from the prior quarter driven by market appreciation. Royce experienced modest net outflows reflecting negative sentiment in the U.S. around equities including small cap. Outside the U.S., Royce is seeing continued interest in the funds they sub-advise for Legg Mason. 
Third is Permal, with over $18 billion up slightly from the prior quarter primarily driven by market appreciation as performance across their key funds continues to beat hedge fund indices. Gross for the quarter were slightly positive. Permal made outstanding progress with institutions, with net inflows of $340 million in the quarter primarily from U.S. institutions and sovereign wealth funds, which more than offset softness across the industry in their legacy high-net-worth channels. 
Fourth is ClearBridge at $56 billion, with improved AUM driven by market appreciation. ClearBridge is working through headwinds faced by many equity managers in terms of bringing retail demand back to equity products. However, they are beginning to build interest in income solutions strategies where they had net inflows for those products for the quarter. They've also built a won-but-not-funded pipeline of $600 million. This institutional effort has been building since 2010 and reflects focused differentiation around income solutions, low volatility and alpha generation. Early results are showing promise, with 7 finals presentations in the current quarter.
Fifth is Batterymarch at $18 billion driven by market appreciation. Some institutions allocated money away from Batterymarch and from active mandates. This was partially offset by a small cap win at a large 401(k) platform. This mandate was in conjunction with the Legg Mason distribution team. In the quarter, Batterymarch also successfully rolled out the next generation of leadership towards investment in sales organization.
Next is Brandywine at $37 billion, up 12% for the quarter driven equally by market appreciation and inflows of approximately $2 billion. In addition to the closed-end funds and other funds sponsored by Legg Mason, Brandywine saw strong inflows from sovereign wealth funds. Their won-but-not-funded pipeline is approximately $1.2 billion. And Brandywine is adding salespeople to help turn performance momentum into an even better flow story.
Higher performance fees in the quarter reflect those strong performance in several accounts in which the annual performance fee is paid in the first calendar quarter of the year. 
And seventh is Legg Mason Capital Management at approximately $8 billion. On April 30, Sam Peters completed the transition as lead manager of the Value Trust. 
Slide 9 shows an update of Western Asset. The upper left-hand corner shows assets by mandate. As we've indicated for several quarters, they continue to see the greatest demand in specialized mandates, which represents 44% of the total. The upper right-hand corner shows composite performance against benchmarks, and that continues to be strong over most timeframes, but importantly, 91% is beating their benchmarks in the 3-year period, up from last quarter's level. There was also improved performance from last quarter against composites for the 1-, 5-, and 10-year timeframes as well. On the bottom, we show long-term net flow trends. We continue to see improvement over the past several quarters. In fact, x the global sovereign mandate, the full year-over-year improvement is 64%. In particular, outflows from Core and Core Plus mandates have slowed year-over-year and this quarter.
Western's won-but-not-funded pipeline for the quarter ended March 31 is nearly $4 billion, with the vast majority of that attributable to specialized mandates. RFP activity is significantly up from last quarter and from the prior year March quarter. In addition, our fund board has approved the addition of retail share classes to Western funds, which should occur in the current quarter and provide us with an opportunity to leverage those fund's strong track record. And finally, Western opened an office in Dubai to serve existing clients and take advantage of the opportunities that they see in that region.
Slide 10 shows investment performance across the complex. Here we show the performance in 2 ways, by marketed composite versus their benchmarks and long-term U.S. fund assets versus the Lipper category averages.
We are pleased that performance continues to compare well across most periods, in particular, the critical 3-year time period. In fact, the 1-, 5- and 10-year performance versus benchmark and versus Lipper category average all improved this quarter from last quarter. 
Slide 11 provides an overview of our global distribution franchise. With offices in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and Japan. At $220 billion, this represents over 1/3 of Legg Mason's total assets under management. Here you also see our quarterly flow trends for the entire distribution platform, both domestic and international. Net flows were positive for the quarter marking the sixth quarter in the last 9 where we've seen positive net flows from the global distribution team. International was the larger contributors to those flows, and while they had their, 13th straight quarter of inflows, they were down from prior quarters reflecting a slowdown in demand in Japan for some of the cross-border mandates.
On the U.S. side, outflows improved as overall gross sales were up 26% versus the prior quarter and redemption rates came down to 22% from 26% last quarter.
Moving forward, there is significant opportunity for specialized products like emerging market debt in the sub-advisory channel as well as global bonds and equity income solutions. Now let me turn it to Pete."
180481,184405373,293941,"Legg Mason Inc., Q4 2012 Earnings Call, May 01, 2012",2012-05-01,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. As Mark noted, we closed the fiscal year having completed our streamlining plan and realizing a full $35 million of cost saves in our fourth fiscal quarter. This quarter also saw an expected decline in transition-related cost to $2 million f",1284,"Thanks, Mark. As Mark noted, we closed the fiscal year having completed our streamlining plan and realizing a full $35 million of cost saves in our fourth fiscal quarter. This quarter also saw an expected decline in transition-related cost to $2 million from $42 million last quarter as we completed all of our streamlining activities. This will be our last quarter reporting transition related costs. 
For the period, a number of other factors impacted our results. These included higher average AUM, higher equity AUM as a percentage of the total, which helped to increase our effective yield, both of which contributed to the increased advisory fee revenues. Our performance fees came in better than last quarter but still below last year's level. We also incurred $9.4 million in expenses related to Bwine's successful closed-end fund launch this quarter. These costs were more than offset by 2 one-time events where we realized a $7.5 million gain on the sale of a small wealth manager and an $8.6 million gain related to the resolution of a bankruptcy claim. 
Finally, there are a couple of tax items this quarter that resulted in a net benefit of $5 million or $0.03 per share. On the balance sheet front, we ended the fiscal year with $1.4 million in cash, with over $1 billion available to invest in the business or return to shareholders.
On Slide 12, we provide a snapshot of the fiscal year. On the revenue front, lower average AUM and lower performance fees of $47 million drove the 4% decline in revenues, while operating expenses declined 3% despite higher transition related costs. Earnings per share was down 6% for the fiscal year despite a 13% decline in net income due to the lower share count resulting from our stock buyback program. And finally, this year's effective tax rate benefited from a 2% decline in the U.K. corporate tax rate in fiscal 2012, which allowed us to revalue all of our deferred tax liabilities in the U.K. 
Turning to Slide 13, our fiscal fourth quarter 2012 net income of $76 million yielded $0.54 in earnings per diluted share. Operating revenues were up 3% compared to the prior quarter due to a $13 billion or 2% increase in average AUM, a slightly higher advisory fee yield reflecting a pickup in average equity AUM and a $9 million increase in performance fees. The $15 million in performance fees earned this quarter were largely driven by fixed-income mandates at Brandywine and Western Asset. The improvement in performance fees was principally due to annual performance fees earned at Brandywine this quarter. 
While difficult to predict with precision, we anticipate the next quarter's performance fees to likely be better than the December quarter but not quite as strong as the March quarter. Operating expenses were up 2% reflecting volume driven costs from the 3% increase in operating revenues, the closed-end fund cost of $9.4 million, an increase mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and SIV [ph] investments, which are offset in other nonoperating income and expense. Partially offsetting these cost increases were lower transition related costs this quarter.
Adjusted income, which excludes certain noncash and other items, but includes transition related expenses, was $124 million for the quarter or $0.88 per diluted share. 
Moving on to Slide 14, the only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 30% on a GAAP basis compared with our targeted rate of the low to mid-30s. The lower rate reflected both a one-time credit and year-end adjustments. The tax outlook for fiscal '13 and beyond is for an effective GAAP tax run rate ranging from 34% to 36%. But we do expect fiscal '13 to benefit from another U.K. tax rate reduction of 2%, which will likely incur in the fiscal second quarter as it has for the last several years.
Slide 15 is a roll forward from fiscal Q3's EPS of $0.20 to this quarter's earnings per share of $0.54. Lower transition related costs and streamlining savings contributed a combined $0.23 of improvement, while higher net revenues and performance fees and other nonoperating income contributed $0.15 to the improved earnings per share. Finally, the closed-end fund launch this quarter cost $0.04 a share. 
Turning to Slide 16, you can see that the advisory fee yield increased this quarter from 34 to 35 basis points, driven by an improved asset mix, specifically higher average equity AUM in the quarter.
Turning to 17. Operating expenses for the quarter increased primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, which I'll address on the next slide. Other factors impacting operating expenses were higher distribution and servicing costs reflecting both the closed-end fund launch this quarter and the higher average AUM and revenues, along with decreased technology and occupancy expenses reflecting the impact of last quarter's transition related costs. Finally, other expenses decreased due to an assessment fee refund, lower fund related costs as well as lower advertising and professional fees.
Turning to Slide 18, total comp and benefits were up from last quarter reflecting higher deferred comp and SIV [ph] investment-related expenses and due to higher net revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower transition-related and severance costs. Excluding the deferred comp and SIV [ph] investment offset and transition related costs, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio was 55%. This was up from the prior quarter reflecting expenses related to the closed-end fund launch, which had a 1% impact on the comp ratio. In addition, seasonal benefit costs and commissions related to increased sales contributed to the higher comp ratio. And as a reminder, last quarter's compensation ratio was low by approximately 1% due to higher noncomp expenses in revenue share affiliates that were offset in compensation.
On Slide 19, the operating margin as adjusted is in line with last quarter as the approximately 2.5% improvement from the streamlining and increased, revenue was offset by the closed-end fund launch and seasonable -- seasonal and variable compensation costs 
On Slide 20, you can see that our fiscal '13 tax rate is projected to be approximately 35%, over 2/3 of which is noncash. This is an area we will continue to highlight, as we believe many investors don't fully appreciate the significantly reduced level of cash taxes that we pay. This lower level of cash taxes results from our NOL carry forward and our ability to amortize our goodwill and indefinite live intangibles for tax purposes. When you translate our effective cash tax rate into dollars on the right-hand side of the schedule, you see that we will have a cash tax benefit related to these favorable tax attributes of $1.5 billion. But to be clear, our tax shield will save us prospectively $1.5 billion in actual cash taxes paid. 
Now turning to Slide 21. Despite continued market volatility, the ability of the Legg Mason operating model to generate substantial cash remained intact. During the quarter, our total cash increased from $1.2 billion as of December 31, to $1.4 billion as of our fiscal year-end. Over $1 billion of that is in excess cash, in excess of our operating needs.
And over the past 12 months, we've repurchased 400 million of stock and paid out $44 million in dividends while maintaining cash levels substantially the same as March 31, 2011.
On the stock repurchase front, our ending share count remains at around 140 million shares after cumulative repurchases of 28.2 million shares, or 17% of shares outstanding since the board authorization in May 2010. It is our expectation that we will deploy the remaining $155 million of the authorization in fiscal 2013. Thanks for your time and your attention. And now Mark, back to you."

Slide 22 shows the diversity and scale of our business across asset classes, client profile and revenues.As the gross revenue pie at the bottom of the page illustrates, Legg Mason does have significant diversity across equity, fixed income",573,"Thanks, Pete. Slide 22 shows the diversity and scale of our business across asset classes, client profile and revenues.
As the gross revenue pie at the bottom of the page illustrates, Legg Mason does have significant diversity across equity, fixed income and alternatives. As we've stated, we intend to continue to seek balance across geographies, asset classes and channels and we'll look to do that by investing in our affiliate franchises and through selected bolt-on and lift-out acquisitions. 
Slide 23 shows our progress on various initiatives and performance metrics that we believe are positioning us for earnings leverage. The chart at the top left highlights the persistency of our operating income as adjusted. This quarter's results can also be adjusted for our closed-end fund cost. We remain confident that if current trends hold, including ongoing volatility, this chart will likely hold up well. As Pete just covered, we plan to use the remaining $155 million in share repurchase authorization during fiscal '13. And we are continually evaluating capital allocation. As you can see from the chart, the vast majority of the capital we have deployed is in the form of share repurchases and to a lesser extent, dividends. Going forward, the board has approved a 38% increase on our dividend to shareholders. As you can see on the lower left, we have now completed our streamlining and we've generated annualized cost savings of more than $140 million effective this quarter. 
Finally, we focused on performance in client service and out-performance in the critical 3-year time period remains strong. We are pleased that flow trends improved this quarter, and are certainly working hard to build on our momentum over the long term. 
With our streamlining in the rearview mirror, Slide 24 lays out our roadmap for revenue and EPS growth. Our competitive strengths include our multi-manager model, which brings together some of the top investors in the industry, with recognized expertise and respected brands. Another advantage is our scale. With over $640 billion in assets, we are one of the largest asset managers globally. Of that $640 billion in assets, 37% is for clients outside the U.S. And other $2.7 billion in gross revenues, 44% comes from equity, 36% from fixed income, 14% from alternatives and 6% from liquidity. We will seek to strengthen this diversification with greater presence in international equity and alternatives. 
And finally, our global distribution franchise is a key competitive advantage with over $220 billion in assets. It is very leverageable and has the ability to be a significant contributor  [Audio Gap] profitable growth as sales and flow trends improve. And as you saw on the previous chart, we have generated over $900 million in operating income as adjusted over the past 2 years. 
So on a go-forward basis, we plan to further diversify and grow earnings by executing on 3 key priorities. First, organic growth. Our strong performance achievements will guide affiliate-led institutional expansion and LM's global retail momentum. Continued success in product development will target differentiated solutions to better meet client needs. And second, we will work with our affiliates on selected bolt-on and lift-out opportunities as well as targeted acquisitions to fill product gaps. And finally, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. As a management team, we are excited to be executing on this growth agenda. And with that, we'll open the line for questions, and I thank you."

Western has a very good and broad product line in both the U.S. and international. We work closely with them on existing products like the top-ranked Core, Core Plus funds from the Western family as well as specific funds in international markets like Japan. We work closely with them to launch new funds and to work hard in expanding their share. So if you take the Core and Core Plus category, this new initiative is to add share classes to those existing funds and make them more available to financial intermediaries regardless of how you want to buy the fund. So that's a key one. As it relates to ClearBridge on the equity side, this income solutions suite of products is getting a lot of momentum both at the fund side but also the separate account. There's a bit of a resurgence going on in intermediary land around retail separate accounts that are really conducive to this kind of market environment in terms of investors coming back. Permal, we're working with them on this 1099 fund, which will be quite an innovation, 1099 benefit to the investor, not K-1, and with their strong track record and LMG distribution, one of our distribution partners kind of referenced in a meeting last week, that's a powerful combination. Brandywine, what we've done on the closed-end side most recently is indicative of leveraging their global capability. As you could see I can go on. With Royce, we work with them on a kind of a niche basis, where they have a legacy coverage in, let's say, certain areas like the RIA community where we supplement what they've done historically, but in the kind of traditional FA mutual fund suite program, we've been able to add some new momentum. Obviously, SIV [ph] is important in our ability to work with the affiliates and launch new products and, where appropriate, to put some SIV [ph] capital to get them going, I think has been mutually beneficial."

As you see, kind of the pipeline's probably never been as strong, certainly since -- over the last several years across most of the managers. The ability to leverage that where appropriate through retail, where we get the incremental operating leverage, is valuable.

Western it's $4 billion. Permal at approximately $400 million. ClearBridge at $600 million. Brandywine at $1.2 billion. These are one business that's not yet funded. And then if you look at the pipeline, to see RFP pipeline at Western for example, that volume is up 30% sequentially, quarter-over-quarter and up 40% year-over-year, and it's registering approximately $12 billion of potential business.

So again, as we look at the business going forward, we're focused on increasing combination of equity and alternatives and specialized products and fixed income as the best ways that we can impact profitability going forward."

Instead of thinking of the contribution by asset class, I mean, how should I -- is there a way to think about, as the relative contribution from different affiliates change, that some have a greater or lesser impact on the earnings? For example, Brandywine seems to have a lot of momentum compared to, say, Batterymarch. So if we start seeing that kind of move up in terms of its relative contribution, is there kind of an outsized benefit to Legg for some affiliates doing better, meaning maybe ClearBridge? I'm just trying to get some sense if that's something we should be thinking about."

And I would like to thank everyone for joining the Legg Mason earnings call. 
Legg Mason made significant progress, positioning the firm for long-term growth, even amid valuation retrenchment across global investment markets, which led to a drop in our quarterly revenues.
In particular, we believe these kinds of conditions played at the strengths of our diversified asset base and to the depth and breadth of our managers' specialized expertise. In a recent note to clients, Chuck Royce noted that as Europe meets its challenges, and as the U.S. begins to get its own fiscal house in order, which is not likely to happen until after the elections, we should move out of the range bound equity market to the upside.
Isaac Suede is in China meeting with clients and financial leaders, and has restated his belief that they will engineer to a soft landing. He points out that they have already cut rates twice, changed the reserve requirements 3 times. And while the Shanghai Index is still lagging, he reminds us, changes are never instantaneous in China and these equity markets should do much better and could be the harbinger for a wider September improvement.
And in a balanced profile, ClearBridge's first column continues to emphasize the unprecedented risk premium that high-quality dividend paying stocks have relative to bonds and sees growing opportunities in these stocks.
Meanwhile, in fixed income credit markets, where both institutional and retail investors continued to add flows, Western's Steve Walsh took a more cautious tone at the MorningStar investment conference recently. He stated that it is nearly impossible to come to a conclusive opinion on how Europe will play out. With the market price for negative outcomes, Western has concluded that staying modestly long spread risks and staying attuned to the changing landscape seems to be the right approach. 
Overall, at the corporate level, we continue to manage business, aware of the current environment, including keeping a close eye on expenses while investing in areas that will position us for long-term revenue and diversified earnings growth with a near-term focus on organic growth. 
Let's start with the highlights for the quarter on Slide 3. 
On a GAAP basis, we announced a net loss of $9.5 million, which reflects charges related to our very successful debt restructuring and fund launches. Adjusted income was nearly $89 million. In May, we announced the new capital plan, which is part of our broader efforts to enhance financial flexibility and position Legg Mason for sustained growth. In doing so, we reduced our outstanding debt by $350 million and refinanced debt that was due in 2015 with longer-term maturities. These resulted in a largely noncash charge of $0.32 per share. The quarter includes $800 million raised for ClearBridge's third MLP fund and $200 million in a new Western REIT. 
Our financial results reflect $0.11 per share in costs related to launching these new products. 
Our long-term flow story continues to improve, particularly in the critical area of fixed income. And in the quarter, we bought back the remaining $155 million of the original $1 billion board authorization, and we expect to continue the program under our new authorization throughout the year.
We ended the quarter with $800 million in cash. 
Slide 4 shows our assets by asset class. In the quarter, equity assets were affected by market depreciation of approximately $9 billion versus fixed income market appreciation of approximately $5 billion. Average AUM of $635 billion was in line with our prior quarter. Market valuation declines and outflows reduced equity as a percent of total AUM to 24% though [Audio Gap] data. 
Finally, our liquidity number includes the disposition of 4.6 billion in assets to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. There was about $2 billion remaining from these sweep assets at quarter end, and those were transferred this month. 
Slide 5 shows our net flows. Legg Mason continues to make progress on long-term flows with improvement in each of the last 3 quarters. This was the best quarter for long-term outflows in nearly 5 years. Key contributors to this improvement were Western and Brandywine in fixed income and ClearBridge in equity.
Both Legg Mason and our affiliates continue to focus on building our momentum in fixed income and equity. Liquidity flows were positive ex the disposition of assets to Morgan Stanley.
Slide 6 shows assets by affiliate in order of their contribution to the quarter's earnings. First is Western at $445 billion, in line with last quarter. And in terms of flows, they improved to modestly positive ex $1.6 billion out in the sovereign mandate we have been referencing for some time.
We'll talk about Western in more detail in the next slide. But it does continue to see interest in specialized mandates globally. And those specialized mandates continue to reflect higher fees and mandates that terminated in the quarter.
Growth in both specialized mandates and retail fund flows will, over time, have a positive impact on the revenues as well.
In investment performance continues to be strong, we see particular opportunity for them as we relaunched the Western U.S. funds to leverage their institutional brand to promote those funds in the retail, institutional and retirement segments. 
Next is Royce, at $36 billion, down primarily due to market depreciation and, to a lesser degree, an increase in outflows consistent with industry trends and small cap equities.
Royce is actively engaged with their clients and distribution partners amidst these sector headwinds. Most recent market trends are emphasizing mega caps overall and defensive stocks in small caps. And this creates pressure on their short-term performance. However, as they have done throughout their history over similar cycles, they're increasing their vigilance to make sure they are positioned well for the long-term opportunities.
Next is ClearBridge, at $56 billion, down slightly for the quarter. Under Clarence Murphy, the firm is making real progress with a sharpened strategic focus on 3 core competitive advantages: equity income, concentrated alpha and low volatility. ClearBridge has approximately $3 billion in new wins in the quarter, of which $1.9 billion was funded ending the quarter, with $1.1 billion in unfunded wins.
The wins this quarter came in dividend products, aggressive growth and large-cap value, as recent relative performance was strong. And they raised their third MLP closed-end fund, bringing total MLP assets to approximately $4 billion.
Next is Permal, at $17.2 billion, with the decline in AUM driven by outflows in the high net worth sector, partially offset by institutional wins, market depreciation and the effect of adverse foreign exchange.
Permal continues to enjoy a valuable leadership position in the fund of hedge fund space and should continue to benefit from overall projected growth for alternative strategies.
The lumpiness of the institutional segment, now accounting for 45% of AUM, was evident this quarter. U.S. institutional continued to see inflow, while non-U.S. is more mixed. Won-but-not-funded stands at approximately $300 million, with strong July performance boding well, with a robust pipeline of other opportunities over the fiscal year.
This quarter also included a $150 million outflow, which is the previously disclosed wind-down of a subadvisory account, whose performance had been outstanding but the sponsor is closing the account for unrelated reasons. We expect the wind-down to be complete by the end of the calendar year and involving a remaining $150 million.
Traditional broker-dealer high net worth continues to be an outflow at the same pace, while the independent high net worth initiatives saw some adverse lumpiness this quarter, but future pipeline remains encouraging.
Permal's private equity team, strategic expansion in China and innovative use of customized solutions are added engines for growth where we work closely together.
Next is Brandywine, at $39 billion, driven by net inflows for the quarter. Brandywine is emerging as a formidable manager whose top-down strategies and fixed income are complementary to our overall mix. Positive flows came from both the institutional channel, including a new relationship with the global consultant as well as from continued momentum in retail funds, importantly both U.S. and cross-border.
Brandywine had $700 million in unfunded wins, including several with expected upside over the year. That would be over the next 12 months.
And performance across their funds remains in the top quartile. 
Finally, Batterymarch, at $15.6 billion, is down from last quarter. Macro events in these volatile markets continue to challenge quantitative managers, impacting short-term performance results in certain strategies. In the quarter, we worked to the launch of certain volatility management products that aim to provide investors with income and downside protection.
Slide 7 is an update on Western Asset. The chart on the upper left side shows AUM by mandate. Assets in specialized mandates are up 45%, as Western continued to see interest in strategies like emerging market, U.S. and global corporate, high yield, Australia Core and Brazil total return.
In the quarter, there were couple of specific instances in which existing institutional clients took money out of lower-yielding strategy and moved it in a higher fee, specialized mandates.
Their pipeline includes nearly $2 billion, Tier 1 and not-funded, up nearly 25% from the year-ago period. Institutional interest in Core and Core Plus has picked up, joining the retail channel's continued good momentum. 
The chart on the upper right side shows 98% of composite assets beating their benchmark over the 3-year period. That outstanding performance should help both their institutional and retail growth. And finally, the lower half of the slide shows the improvement over the last year in long-term flow trend. We've adopted the institutional brand across all of its U.S. retail products. And after fund mergers, expect to offer a streamlined fund lineup in the fall with the full range of share classes.
Overall, Western is very well-positioned across all aspects of the fixed income markets, particularly as it leverages on-the-ground global capabilities in investing and sales and client service.
Slide 8 shows investment performance both versus the benchmark and versus peers. We are pleased overall performance has held up well, even amid volatile equity markets. For the critical 3-year period, 80% of assets beat benchmarks. Of performance against peers, at certain equity managers is down compared to last quarter.
In particular, fixed income performance was strong, with both Western and Brandywine showing impressive performance.
Slide 9 shows an overview of our global distribution platform. This platform has $217 billion in long-term assets and serves retail and individual clients in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia across a number of our affiliates.
Increasingly, I see this as a compelling competitive advantage and a key component of our growth strategy going forward. Today, we have a broad suite of -- equity, fixed income and alternatives. Strong performance and an emphasis on new products will be critical to our growth. Globally, our distribution platform has been in net inflows for 7 of the past 10 quarters. And while our international team has been a key driver of that momentum in the past, this quarter, the U.S. team had their highest level of net inflows since March of '07. 
Our international of positive net flows for the past 14 quarters. Over the past year, we conducted a U.S. retail branding review to determine how best to use the respective brand recognition of our key managers backed by the financial strength of Legg Mason and to show the diversity of our offerings. We are starting with Western rebranding in the fall and will make several refinements at other affiliates targeted to be launched in the first half of calendar '13.
Slide 10 shows some of the areas in which we gained momentum in our distribution platform. It bears repeating that I think we are extremely well positioned to cause that product set to grow our AUM to the strategic asset. As you can see, the products that are driving sales come from a number of our affiliates across all of our geographies. This includes Closed-End Funds and institutional-like mandates at insurance clients and distribution partners which will vary from quarter-to-quarter. In the lower left corner, we show gross sales versus persistency rates, which speaks to the expected longevity of client assets within our platform. We've seen our gross sales trend higher in recent quarters, while at the same time maintaining strong levels of asset retention versus peers.
The right side of the chart shows an area of key strengths for Legg Mason. Closed-End Funds, in which we are now a top 5 player based on total AUM. In the bottom right chart, you can see we are tapping into the expertise of a number of our affiliates. In fact, over the last 4 years, we have averaged 20% of all Closed-End Fund market issuances, advancing our leadership ranking.
In particular, the closed-end fund structure has been a good one for the MLP market, which has had stronger equity investors seeking new sources of income. These are high seed, long-term assets. 
And with that, I would now turn it over to Pete."

As Mark noted, we've made significant progress on a number of funds in positioning the firm for long-term growth. Specifically, we had a number of positive events during our first fiscal quarter of 2013. The upfront cost of which significantly reduced our GAAP earnings per share, but the outcomes of which will contribute to future earnings momentum and growth. The first of these was the successful launch of our new capital plan, where we paid off our $1.25 billion in senior convertible notes, raised $650 million in the debt capital markets and secured a bank term loan for $500 million, along with revolver capacity for another $500 million.
But also significantly diversified our debt investor base, while reducing our outstanding debt by $350 million and lattering out our debt maturities.
Also, as part of the new capital plan, the board authorized an additional $1 billion share buyback to be deployed over the next several years. 
The P&L cost of the debt extinguishment in the current quarter was $69 million or $0.32 per diluted share, which is principally noncash.
We also raised $800 million in a ClearBridge closed-end fund and $200 million in a Western REIT IPO that together resulted in a $23 million or $0.11 per diluted share in fund launch cost this quarter. All of these transactions will be additive to GAAP earnings on a go-forward basis.
During the quarter, and related to our capital plan, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of stock at a cost of $155 million. This was the final piece remaining from the prior $1 billion share buyback authorization.
In terms of other share activity in the quarter, in addition to the $155 million in repurchases, we issued approximately 1.3 million shares of stock in May, related to our annual long-term incentive awards. Since both the share repurchase and the stock awards occurred approximately mid-quarter, only about half of those shares are reflected in this quarter's weighted average share count.
Absent any additional share repurchases, our ending in average diluted share count for the September 30 quarter would be 135.5 million shares. 
Finally, a number of other factors affected our results. These included lower revenues despite average AUM being flat on the prior period. This reflected a mix shift, with a 4% decline in higher fee equity AUM, offset by an increase in average AUM for both fixed income and, in particular, liquidity.
And as anticipated, performance fees came in below the March quarter by the Decembers. 
Now, let's turn to Slide 11 to review the financial highlights for the quarter.
As Mark noted earlier, the fiscal first quarter net loss was $9.5 million or $0.07 diluted share reflecting the impact of the debt extinguishment and the fund launch cost, which together totaled $0.43 per share. Operating revenues were down 3% compared to the prior quarter, due to low advisory fees reflecting a decline in average equity AUM and a $6 million drop in performance fees earned this quarter.
This quarter's performance fees were largely driven by Western, LM Global Equities and Brandywine. While impossible to predict with any precision, we anticipate next quarter's performance fees to be in line with this quarter's level. 
Operating expenses declined 4%, reflecting lower mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and seed investments which are offset in other nonoperating income and expenses. These were partly offset by higher fund launch cost of $23 million this quarter, compared to $9 million in the prior quarter.
Adjusted income, which excludes the debt extinguishment cost, was $89 million for the quarter or $0.64 per diluted share, with a drop from last quarter's $124 million level driven by 3 things: First, the higher fund launch cost; secondly, a mark-to-market loss on corporate seed investments of $6 million compared with gains in fiscal Q4 of $10 million; and lastly, $16 million in onetime gains recorded last quarter.
Moving onto Slide 12. The only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate which was 28% on a GAAP basis. But excluding the impact of our consolidated investment vehicles, the rate would've been 35% in line with our targeted effective tax rate.
The tax outlook for next quarter is for a lower effective rate as we expect to benefit from another U.K. tax rate reduction of 2%, which will occur in fiscal Q2 as it has the last 2 years. This will result in approximately $18 million tax credit in the second fiscal quarter, and we then expect the effective rate to return to the 34% to 36% level over the last 2 quarters of fiscal 2013.
Slide 13 is a rollforward from fiscal Q4's earnings per share of $0.54 to this quarter's EPS loss of $0.07. The fiscal Q4 items on the first red bar totaling $0.11, include onetime gains, closed-end fund launch cost, mark-to-market on seed, transition-related cost and tax adjustments. The key items for this quarter, which are on the next 3 bars, include $0.32 related to the debt extinguishment, $0.11 related to the fund launch cost and $0.03 the impact from the negative mark-to-market on seed investments. And then the final contributor is the $0.04 decline in other net revenue and operating expenses, which was largely driven by the decline in operating revenues.
Turning to Slide 14. You can see that the advisory fee yield decrease this quarter from 35 basis points to 34 bps, driven by asset mix, specifically lower average equity AUM on the quarter, combined with higher average fixed income and liquidity AUM.
On Slide 15, operating expense for the quarter decreased primarily due to lower comp expense, which I'll discuss in the next slide. Other factors impacting operating expenses were higher distribution of servicing costs, reflecting the fund launches this quarter, and totaling $21 million compared to $8 million of closed-end bars last quarter. Excluding these 2 items, distribution in servicing expenses were down 2%, reflecting the lower revenues. Communications and tech expenses decreased, reflecting lower affiliated-related technology costs. And finally, other expenses decreased due to lower fund-related costs and trading losses, offsetting compensation, which were partially offset by the impact of last quarter's FSA assessment refund.
Turning to Slide 16. Total comp and benefits were down from last quarter, reflecting lower deferred comp and seed investment expenses, offsetting nonoperating income and due to lower revenues. As you can see, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio was 58%. However, 3% of this amount relates to fund launch costs. And as additional context, this quarter's ratio also reflects lower net revenues which had a further 1% impact on a comp and benefit ratio due to the denominator impact.
Turning to Slide 17. The operating margin as adjusted declined from last quarter reflecting the impact of the 2 fund launches this quarter. These  combined for a 4% reduction in the adjusted operating margin for the quarter.
I'll wrap up on Slide 8, which covers one of the key highlights in our fiscal first quarter, which was the announcement of our plan and included several key events. We repurchased $1.25 billion in convertible senior notes, using $250 million from our bank line, the proceeds of a $600 million 7-year bond offering and $350 million in cash. This reduced our gross debt by $350 million. In addition, late in June, we refinanced our $500 million credit facility with a 5-year amortizing term loan and amended and extended our $500 million revolver that is now completely undrawn. As part of the transaction, we announced that we will buy back the remaining $155 million from the original board buyback authorization and we accomplished that, buying back  6.2 million shares. We also announced a new $1 billion authorization that we are currently deploying -- plan to deploy at a rate of up to 65% of cash generated from operations prospectively. As always, subject to market conditions.
The benefits from the debt restructuring aspect of the new capital plan include the delevering of the balance sheet, lattering out our debt maturities, as illustrated on the chart on the bottom right and diversifying our sources of capital from both the banks and bond investors. Additionally, we will reduce our GAAP interest expense by $36 million annually. As Mark mentioned earlier, these transactions greatly enhanced our financial stability going forward. And finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $800 million in cash after delevering the balance sheet and buying back 155 million of our shares. 
So thanks again for your time and attention. And now, Mark, back to you."

Slide 19 shows the diversity and scale of our business across asset classes, client domicile and revenues. As we've shown in previous quarters, from a gross revenue standpoint, Legg Mason does have a significant balance between equity, fixed income and alternatives. We want to continue to deepen and strengthen that balance across geographies, asset classes and channels. We will invest in our affiliate franchises and continue to look at selected bolt-on and lift-out acquisitions.
Slide 20 updates the metrics we've been watching closely as we've managed the business. As the chart on the upper left-hand side shows, we continue to make progress on our long-term flows. On the lower left-hand side, we recapped our successful streamlining effort that we finalized last quarter with annualized cost savings of $143 million. On the upper right-hand side, we show how we allocated a capital in the current quarter and past 2 fiscal quarters. In the current quarter, we reduced debt by $350 million, completed the remaining $155 million of our original $1 billion share repurchase, and paid out our quarterly dividend. With the completion of our debt transaction in the quarter, we have financed our financial flexibility and positioned ourselves to continue to invest in our franchise. And finally, we showed the 3-year composite performance number remains strong. It should contribute to the improving flow story and to our organic growth.
On a go-forward basis, as shown in Slide 21, we plan to allocate capital to further diversify and grow earnings, as follows: One, organic growth. This is our top priority. Institutional and retail across the firm. Accelerating where we have strong product and performance. Developing and, where necessary, seeding new products including additional closed-end fund launches. Two, fill in product gaps. We will work with our affiliates on product development, as well as on selected bolt-on and lift-out opportunities. Three, we will continue to return capital to shareholders to vote share repurchase and dividend. 
With that, we'll open the line for questions, and I thank you."

Ditto at ClearBridge. We really made some good progress there, both this quarter just completed and what we're looking at in terms of pipeline there. And then Permal, as I pointed out, there is some lumpiness there because they are now more engaged in the institutional business. But over the next several quarters, they've got a lot of attractive opportunities there and are poised subject to bring it over the goal line to make some real progress."

The key for us has been to work closely with our distribution partners in coming up with what they will innovative solutions. So going forward, we are very excited about some potential products in the alternative space with Permal and in fixed income space with some specialized capabilities of Western, and of course we'll continue to take advantage of kind of niche opportunities under that umbrella of MLP that ClearBridge has. We are actively working on some things that should happen over the next quarter or 2."

And I would like to thank everyone for joining the Legg Mason earnings call. 
Legg Mason made significant progress, positioning the firm for long-term growth, even amid valuation retrenchment across global investment markets, which led to a drop in our quarterly revenues.  In particular, we believe these kinds of conditions played at the strength of our diversified asset base and to the depth and breadth of our managers' specialized expertise. 
In a recent note to clients, Chuck Royce noted that as Europe meets its challenges, and as the U.S. begins to get its own fiscal house in order, which is not likely to happen until after the elections, we should move out of the range-bound equity market to the upside.
Isaac Suede is in China meeting with clients and financial leaders and has restated his belief that they will engineer to a soft landing. He points out that they have already cut rates twice, changed the reserve requirements 3 times, and while the Shanghai index is still lagging, he reminds us, changes are never instantaneous in China, and these equity markets should do much better and could be the harbinger for a wider September improvement.
And in a Barron's profile, ClearBridge's Hersh Cowen continued to emphasize the unprecedented risk premium that high-quality, dividend-paying stocks have relative to bonds and sees growing opportunities in these stocks.
Meanwhile, in fixed income credit markets, where both institutional and retail investors continued to add flows, Western's Steve Walsh took a more cautious tone at the Morningstar Investment Conference recently. He stated that it is nearly impossible to come to a conclusive opinion on how Europe will play out. With the market price for negative outcomes, Western has concluded that staying modestly long spread risks and staying attuned to the changing landscape seems to be the right approach.
Overall, at the corporate level, we continue to manage the business, aware of the current environment, including keeping a close eye on expenses, while investing in areas that will position us for long-term revenue and diversified earnings growth with a near-term focus on organic growth. 
Let's start with the highlights to the quarter on Slide 3.  On a GAAP basis, we announced a net loss of $9.5 million, which reflects charges related to our very successful debt restructuring and fund launches. Adjusted income was nearly $89 million. 
In May, we announced a new capital plan, which is part of our broader efforts to enhance financial flexibility and position Legg Mason for sustained growth. In doing so, we reduced our outstanding debt by $350 million and refinanced debt that was due in 2015 with longer-term maturities. This resulted in a largely noncash charge of $0.32 per share. The quarter includes $800 million raised for ClearBridge's third MLP fund and $200 million in a new Western REIT.  Our financial results reflect $0.11 per share in costs related to launching these new products. 
Our long-term flow story continues to improve, particularly in the critical area of fixed income. And in the quarter, we bought back the remaining $155 million of the original $1 billion board authorization, and we expect to continue the program under our new authorization throughout the year.  We ended the quarter with $800 million in cash. 
Slide 4 shows our assets by asset class. In the quarter, equity assets were affected by market depreciation of approximately $9 billion versus fixed income market appreciation of approximately $5 billion. Average AUM of $635 billion was in line with our prior quarter. Market valuation declines and outflows reduced equity as a percent of total AUM to 24% though [indiscernible] data. 
Finally, our liquidity number includes the disposition of $4.6 billion in assets to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. There was about $2 billion remaining from these sweep assets at quarter end, and those were transferred this month. 
Slide 5 shows our net flows. Legg Mason continues to make progress on long-term flows with improvement in each of the last 3 quarters. This was the best quarter for long-term outflows in nearly 5 years. Key contributors to this improvement were Western and Brandywine in fixed income and ClearBridge in equity.  Both Legg Mason and our affiliates continue to focus on building our momentum in fixed income and equity. Liquidity flows were positive, x the disposition of assets to Morgan Stanley.
Slide 6 shows assets by affiliate in order of their contribution to the quarter's earnings. First is Western at $445 billion, in line with last quarter. And in terms of flows, they improved to modestly positive, x $1.6 billion out in the sovereign mandate we have been referencing for some time.
We'll talk about Western in more detail in the next slide. But it does continue to see interest in specialized mandates globally. And those specialized mandates continue to reflect higher fees and mandates that terminated in the quarter.  Growth in both specialized mandates and retail fund flows will, over time, have a positive impact on the revenues as well.  As investment performance continues to be strong, we see particular opportunity for them as we relaunched the Western U.S. funds to leverage their institutional brand to promote those funds in the retail, institutional and retirement segments. 
Next is Royce at $36 billion, down primarily due to market depreciation and, to a lesser degree, an increase in outflows consistent with industry trends and small-cap equities. Royce is actively engaged with their clients and distribution partners amidst these sector headwinds. Most recent market trends are emphasizing mega caps overall and defensive stocks in small caps. And this creates pressure on their short-term performance. However, as they have done throughout their history over similar cycles, they are increasing their vigilance to make sure they are positioned well for long-term opportunities.
Next is ClearBridge at $56 billion, down slightly for the quarter. Under Terrence Murphy, the firm is making real progress with a sharpened strategic focus on 3 core competitive advantages: equity income, concentrated alpha and low volatility. ClearBridge had approximately $3 billion in new wins in the quarter, of which $1.9 billion was funded, ending the quarter with $1.1 billion in unfunded wins.  The wins this quarter came in dividend products, aggressive growth and large-cap value, as recent relative performance was strong. And they raised their third MLP closed-end fund, bringing total MLP assets to approximately $4 billion.
Next is Permal at $17.2 billion, with the decline in AUM, driven by outflows in the high net worth sector, partially offset by institutional wins, market depreciation and the effect of adverse foreign exchange.  Permal continues to enjoy a valuable leadership position in the fund of hedge fund space and should continue to benefit from overall projected growth for alternative strategies.  
The lumpiness of the institutional segment, now accounting for 45% of AUM, was evident this quarter. U.S. institutional continued to see inflow, while non-U.S. is more mixed. won-but-not-funded stands at approximately $300 million, with strong July performance boding well, with a robust pipeline of other opportunities over the fiscal year.
This quarter also included a $150 million outflow, which is the previously disclosed wind down of a sub-advisory account. The performance had been outstanding, but the sponsor is closing the account for unrelated reasons. We expect the wind down to be complete by the end of the calendar year and involving a remaining $150 million.  Traditional broker-dealer high net worth continues to be in outflows at the same pace, while the independent high net worth initiatives saw some adverse lumpiness this quarter, but future pipeline remains encouraging.  Permal's private equity team, strategic expansion in China and innovative use of customized solutions are added engines for growth, where we work closely together.
Next is Brandywine at $39 billion, driven by net inflows for the quarter. Brandywine is emerging as a formidable manager, whose top-down strategies and fixed income are complementary to our overall mix. Positive flows came from both the institutional channel, including a new relationship with the global consultant as well as from continued momentum in retail funds, importantly both U.S. and cross border.  Brandywine had $700 million in unfunded wins, including several with expected upside over the year. That would be over the next 12 months.  And performance across their funds remains in the top quartile. 
Finally, Batterymarch at $15.6 billion is down from last quarter. Macro events in these volatile markets continue to challenge quantitative managers, impacting short-term performance results in certain strategies. In the quarter, we worked with them to launch certain volatility management products that aim to provide investors with income and downside protection.
Slide 7 is an update on Western Asset. The chart on the upper-left side shows AUM by mandate. Assets in specialized mandates are up 45%, as Western continued to see interest in strategies like emerging market, U.S. and global corporate, high yield, Australia Core and Brazil total return.
In the quarter, there were a couple of specific instances, in which existing institutional clients took money out of lower-yielding strategy and moved it in a higher-fee, specialized mandates.  Their pipeline includes nearly $2 billion that are one and not funded, up nearly 25% from the year-ago period. Institutional interest in Core and Core Plus has picked up, joining the retail channel's continued good momentum. 
The chart on the upper-right side shows 98% of composite assets beating their benchmark over the 3-year period. That outstanding performance should help both their institutional and retail growth. And finally, the lower half of the slide shows the improvement over the last year in long-term flow trend. We've adopted the Western institutional brand across all of its U.S. retail products. And after-fund mergers expect to offer a streamlined fund lineup in the fall with the full range of share classes.  Overall, Western is very well positioned across all aspects of the fixed income markets, particularly as it leverages on-the-ground global capabilities in investing and sales and client service.
Slide 8 shows investment performance, both versus the benchmark and versus peers. We are pleased that overall performance has held up well, even amid volatile equity markets. For the critical 3-year period, 80% of assets beat benchmarks, but performance against peers at certain equity managers is down compared to last quarter.  In particular, fixed income performance was strong, with both Western and Brandywine showing impressive performance.
Slide 9 shows an overview of our global distribution platform. This platform has $217 billion in long-term assets and serves retail and individual clients in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia across a number of our affiliates.  Increasingly, I see this as a compelling competitive advantage and a key component of our growth strategy going forward. Today, we have a broad suite of products across equity, fixed income and alternatives. Strong performance and an emphasis on new products will be critical to our growth. 
Globally, our distribution platform has been in net inflows for 7 of the past 10 quarters. And while our international team has been a key driver of that momentum in the past, this quarter, the U.S. team had their highest level of net inflows since March of '07.  Our international [indiscernible] had positive net flows for the past 14 quarters. 
Over the past year, we conducted a U.S. retail branding review to determine how best to use the respective brand recognition of our key managers, backed by the financial strength of Legg Mason and to show the diversity of our offerings. We are starting with the Western rebranding in the fall, and we'll make similar refinements at other affiliates targeted to be launched in the first half of calendar '13.
Slide 10 shows some of the areas in which we've gained momentum in our distribution platform. It bears repeating that I think we are extremely well positioned across our product set to grow our AUM to this strategic asset. As you can see, the products that are driving sales come from a number of our affiliates across all of our geographies. This includes closed-end funds and institutional-like mandates at insurance clients and distribution partners which will vary from quarter.  
In the lower left corner, we show gross sales versus persistency rates, which speaks to the expected longevity of client assets within our platform. We have seen our gross sales trend higher in recent quarters, while at the same time maintaining strong levels of asset retention versus peers.
The right side of the chart shows an area of key strength for Legg Mason, closed-end Funds, in which we are now a top 5 player based on total AUM. In the bottom right chart, you can see we are tapping into the expertise of a number of our affiliates. In fact, over the last 4 years, we have averaged 20% of all closed-end fund market issuances, advancing our leadership ranking.  In particular, the closed-end fund structure has been a good one for the MLP market, which has had strong yield equity investors seeking new sources of income. These are high-fee, long-term assets.

As Mark noted, we made significant progress on a number of funds in positioning the firm for long-term growth. Specifically, we had a number of positive events during our first fiscal quarter of 2013. The upfront cost of which significantly",1416,"Thanks, Mark. As Mark noted, we made significant progress on a number of funds in positioning the firm for long-term growth. Specifically, we had a number of positive events during our first fiscal quarter of 2013. The upfront cost of which significantly reduced our GAAP earnings per share, but the outcomes of which will contribute to future earnings momentum and growth. 
The first of these was the successful launch of our new capital plan, where we paid off our $1.25 billion in senior convertible notes, raised $650 million in the debt capital markets and secured a bank term loan for $500 million, along with revolver capacity for another $500 million.  We also significantly diversified our debt investor base, while reducing our outstanding debt by $350 million and laddering out our debt maturities.
Also, as part of the new capital plan, the board authorized an additional $1 billion share buyback to be deployed over the next several years.  The P&L cost of the debt extinguishment in the current quarter was $69 million or $0.32 per diluted share, which is principally noncash.
We also raised $800 million in a ClearBridge closed-end fund and $200 million in a Western REIT IPO that together resulted in a $23 million or $0.11 per diluted share in fund launch cost this quarter. All of these transactions will be additive to GAAP earnings on a go-forward basis.  During the quarter, and related to our capital plan, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of stock at a cost of $155 million. This was the final piece remaining from the prior $1 billion share buyback authorization.  
In terms of other share activity in the quarter, in addition to the $155 million in repurchases, we issued approximately 1.3 million shares of stock in May, related to our annual long-term incentive awards. Since both the share repurchase and the stock awards occurred approximately mid-quarter, only about half of those shares are reflected in this quarter's weighted average share count. Absent any additional share repurchases, our ending in average diluted share count for the September 30 quarter would be 135.5 million shares. 
Finally, a number of other factors impacted our results. These included lower revenues despite average AUM being flat on the prior period. This reflected a mix shift, with a 4% decline in higher-fee equity AUM, offset by an increase in average AUM for both fixed income and, in particular, liquidity.  And as anticipated, performance fees came in below the March quarter by about  Decembers. 
Now, let's turn to Slide 11 to review the financial highlights for the quarter.  As Mark noted earlier, the fiscal first quarter net loss was $9.5 million or $0.07 diluted share, reflecting the impact of the debt extinguishment and the fund launch cost, which together totaled $0.43 per share. Operating revenues were down 3% compared to the prior quarter, due to low advisory fees, reflecting a decline in average equity AUM and a $6 million drop in performance fees earned this quarter.  This quarter's performance fees were largely driven by Western, LM Global Equities and Brandywine. While impossible to predict with any precision, we anticipate next quarter's performance fees to be in line with this quarter's level. 
Operating expenses declined 4%, reflecting lower mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and seed investments, which are offset in other nonoperating income and expenses. These were partly offset by higher fund launch cost of $23 million this quarter, compared to $9 million in the prior quarter.  Adjusted income, which excludes the debt extinguishment cost, was $89 million for the quarter or $0.64 per diluted share, with a drop from last quarter's $124 million level driven by 3 things: First, the higher fund launch cost; secondly, a mark-to-market loss on corporate seed investments of $6 million compared with gains in fiscal Q4 of  $10 million; and lastly, $16 million in onetime gains recorded last quarter.
Moving onto Slide 12. The only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate which was 28% on a GAAP basis. But excluding the impact of our consolidated investment vehicles, the rate would've been 35% in line with our targeted effective tax rate.  The tax outlook for next quarter is for a lower effective rate, as we expect to benefit from another U.K. tax rate reduction of 2%, which will occur in fiscal Q2 as it has, the last 2 years. This will result in an approximate $18 million tax credit in the second fiscal quarter, and we then expect the effective rate to return to the 34% to 36% level over the last 2 quarters of fiscal 2013.
Slide 13 is a roll forward from fiscal Q4's earnings per share of $0.54 to this quarter's EPS loss of $0.07. The fiscal Q4 items on the first red bar totaling $0.11, include onetime gains, closed-end fund launch costs, mark-to-market on seed, transition-related cost and tax adjustments. The key items for this quarter, which are on the next 3 bars, include $0.32 related to the debt extinguishment, $0.11 related to the fund launch costs and $0.03 impact from the negative mark-to-market on seed investments. And then the final contributor is the $0.04 decline in other net revenue and operating expenses, which was largely driven by the decline in operating revenues.
Turning to Slide 14. You can see that the advisory fee yield decreased this quarter from 35 basis points to 34 bps, driven by asset mix, specifically lower average equity AUM on the quarter, combined with higher average fixed income and liquidity AUM.
On Slide 15, operating expense for the quarter decreased primarily due to lower comp expense, which I'll discuss in the next slide. Other factors impacting operating expenses were higher distribution and servicing costs, reflecting the fund launches this quarter and totaling $21 million compared to $8 million of closed-end loss last quarter. Excluding these 2 items, distribution in servicing expenses were down 2%, reflecting the lower revenues. Communications and tech expenses decreased, reflecting lower affiliated-related technology costs. And finally, other expenses decreased due to lower fund-related costs and trading losses, offsetting compensation, which were partially offset by the impact of last quarter's FSA assessment refund.
Turning to Slide 16. Total comp and benefits were down from last quarter, reflecting lower deferred comp and seed investment-related expenses, offsetting nonoperating income and due to lower revenues. As you can see, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio was 58%, however, 3% of this amount relates to fund launch costs. And as additional context, this quarter's ratio also reflects lower net revenues which had a further 1% impact on a comp and benefit ratio due to the denominator impact.
Turning to Slide 17. The operating margin, as adjusted, declined from last quarter, reflecting the impact of the 2 fund launches this quarter. These  combined for a 4% reduction in the adjusted operating margin for the quarter.
I'll wrap up on Slide 8, which covers one of the key highlights in our fiscal first quarter, which was the announcement of our capital plan and included several key events. We repurchased $1.25 billion in convertible senior notes, using $250 million from our bank line, the proceeds of a $600 million 7-year bond offering and $350 million in cash. This reduced our gross debt by $350 million. 
In addition, late in June, we refinanced our $500 million credit facility with a 5-year amortizing term loan and amended and extended our $500 million revolver that is now completely undrawn. As part of the transaction, we announced that we would buy back the remaining $155 million from the original board buyback authorization and we accomplished that, buying back  6.2 million shares. We also announced a new $1 billion authorization that we are currently deploying -- plan to deploy at a rate of up to 65% of cash generated from operations prospectively.  As always, subject to market conditions.
The benefits from the debt restructuring aspect of the new capital plan include delevering of balance sheet, laddering out our debt maturities, as illustrated on the chart at the bottom right and diversifying our sources of capital from both the banks and bond investors. Additionally, we will reduce our GAAP interest expense by $36 million annually.  As Mark mentioned earlier, these transactions greatly enhanced our financial flexibility, going forward.  And finally, we end the quarter with approximately $800 million in cash after delevering the balance sheet and buying back 155 million of our shares. 
So thanks again for your time and attention. And now, Mark, back to you."

Slide 19 shows the diversity and scale of our business across asset classes, client domicile and revenues. 
As we've shown in previous quarters, from a gross revenue standpoint, Legg Mason does have a significant balance between equity, fixed income and alternatives. We want to continue to deepen and strengthen that balance across geographies, asset classes and channels. We will invest in our affiliate franchises and continue to look at selected bolt-on and lift-out acquisitions.
Slide 20 updates the metrics we've been watching closely as we managed the business. As the chart on the upper left-hand side shows, we continue to make progress on our long-term flows. On the lower left-hand side, we recapped our successful streamlining effort that we finalized last quarter, with annualized cost savings of $143 million. 
On the upper right-hand side, we show how we allocated capital in the current quarter and past 2 fiscal quarters. In the current quarter, we reduced debt by $350 million, completed the remaining $155 million of our original $1 billion share repurchase and paid out our quarterly dividend. With the completion of our debt transaction in the quarter, we have enhanced our financial flexibility and positioned ourselves to continue to invest in our franchise. And finally, we show that the 3-year composite performance number remains strong, which should contribute to our improving flow story and to our organic growth.
On a go-forward basis, as shown in Slide 21, we plan to allocate capital to further diversify and grow earnings, as follows: One, organic growth. This is our top priority: Institutional and retail across the firm; accelerating where we have strong product and performance; developing, and where necessary, seeding new products including additional closed-end fund launches. Two, filling product gaps. We will work with our affiliates on product development, as well as on selected bolt-on and lift-out opportunities. Three, we will continue to return capital to shareholders with both share repurchase and dividend. 
With that, we'll open the line for questions, and I thank you."

And over time, as we've said, the more they do in specialized, the more they do in retail, the more we'll get some fee expansion, certainly significantly greater than what we're losing in something like the global sovereign, which is a true anomaly, so that's kind of a one-off."

And I would like to thank everyone for joining the Legg Mason earnings call. 
Legg Mason made significant progress, positioning the firm for long-term growth, even amid valuation retrenchment across global investment markets, which led to a drop in our quarterly revenues.  In particular, we believe these kinds of conditions played at the strength of our diversified asset base and to the depth and breadth of our managers' specialized expertise. 
In a recent note to clients, Chuck Royce noted that as Europe meets its challenges, and as the U.S. begins to get its own fiscal house in order, which is not likely to happen until after the elections, we should move out of the range-bound equity market to the upside.
Isaac Suede is in China meeting with clients and financial leaders, and has restated his belief that they will engineer to a soft landing. He points out that they have already cut rates twice, changed the reserve requirements 3 times, and while the Shanghai index is still lagging, he reminds us, changes are never instantaneous in China, and these equity markets should do much better and could be the harbinger for a wider September improvement.
And in a Barron's profile, ClearBridge's Hersh Cowen continued to emphasize the unprecedented risk premium that high-quality, dividend-paying stocks have relative to bonds and sees growing opportunities in these stocks.
Meanwhile, in fixed income credit markets, where both institutional and retail investors continued to add flows, Western's Steve Walsh took a more cautious tone at the Morningstar Investment Conference recently. He stated that it is nearly impossible to come to a conclusive opinion on how Europe will play out. With the market price for negative outcomes, Western has concluded that staying modestly long spread risks and staying attuned to the changing landscape seems to be the right approach.
Overall, at the corporate level, we continue to manage the business, aware of the current environment, including keeping a close eye on expenses, while investing in areas that will position us for long-term revenue and diversified earnings growth with a near-term focus on organic growth. 
Let's start with the highlights to the quarter on Slide 3.  On a GAAP basis, we announced a net loss of $9.5 million, which reflects charges related to our very successful debt restructuring and fund launches. Adjusted income was nearly $89 million. 
In May, we announced a new capital plan, which is part of our broader efforts to enhance financial flexibility and position Legg Mason for sustained growth. In doing so, we reduced our outstanding debt by $350 million and refinanced debt that was due in 2015 with longer-term maturities. This resulted in a largely noncash charge of $0.32 per share. The quarter includes $800 million raised for ClearBridge's third MLP fund and $200 million in a new Western REIT.  Our financial results reflect $0.11 per share in costs related to launching these new products. 
Our long-term flow story continues to improve, particularly in the critical area of fixed income. And in the quarter, we bought back the remaining $155 million of the original $1 billion board authorization, and we expect to continue the program under our new authorization throughout the year.  We ended the quarter with $800 million in cash. 
Slide 4 shows our assets by asset class. In the quarter, equity assets were affected by market depreciation of approximately $9 billion versus fixed income market appreciation of approximately $5 billion. Average AUM of $635 billion was in line with our prior quarter. Market valuation declines and outflows reduced equity as a percent of total AUM to 24% though [indiscernible] data. 
Finally, our liquidity number includes the disposition of $4.6 billion in assets to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. There was about $2 billion remaining from these sweep assets at quarter end, and those were transferred this month. 
Slide 5 shows our net flows. Legg Mason continues to make progress on long-term flows with improvement in each of the last 3 quarters. This was the best quarter for long-term outflows in nearly 5 years. Key contributors to this improvement were Western and Brandywine in fixed income and ClearBridge in equity.  Both Legg Mason and our affiliates continue to focus on building our momentum in fixed income and equity. Liquidity flows were positive, x the disposition of assets to Morgan Stanley.
Slide 6 shows assets by affiliate in order of their contribution to the quarter's earnings. First is Western at $445 billion, in line with last quarter. And in terms of flows, they improved to modestly positive, x $1.6 billion out in the sovereign mandate we have been referencing for some time.
We'll talk about Western in more detail in the next slide. But it does continue to see interest in specialized mandates globally. And those specialized mandates continue to reflect higher fees and mandates that terminated in the quarter.  Growth in both specialized mandates and retail fund flows will, over time, have a positive impact on the revenues as well.  As investment performance continues to be strong, we see particular opportunity for them as we relaunched the Western U.S. funds to leverage their institutional brand to promote those funds in the retail, institutional and retirement segments. 
Next is Royce at $36 billion, down primarily due to market depreciation and, to a lesser degree, an increase in outflows consistent with industry trends and small-cap equities. Royce is actively engaged with their clients and distribution partners amidst these sector headwinds. Most recent market trends are emphasizing mega caps overall and defensive stocks in small caps. And this creates pressure on their short-term performance. However, as they have done throughout their history over similar cycles, they are increasing their vigilance to make sure they are positioned well for long-term opportunities.
Next is ClearBridge at $56 billion, down slightly for the quarter. Under Terrence Murphy, the firm is making real progress with a sharpened strategic focus on 3 core competitive advantages: equity income, concentrated alpha and low volatility. ClearBridge had approximately $3 billion in new wins in the quarter, of which $1.9 billion was funded, ending the quarter with $1.1 billion in unfunded wins.  The wins this quarter came in dividend products, aggressive growth and large-cap value, as recent relative performance was strong. And they raised their third MLP closed-end fund, bringing total MLP assets to approximately $4 billion.
Next is Permal at $17.2 billion, with the decline in AUM, driven by outflows in the high net worth sector, partially offset by institutional wins, market depreciation and the effect of adverse foreign exchange.  Permal continues to enjoy a valuable leadership position in the fund of hedge fund space and should continue to benefit from overall projected growth for alternative strategies.  
The lumpiness of the institutional segment, now accounting for 45% of AUM, was evident this quarter. U.S. institutional continued to see inflow, while non-U.S. is more mixed. Won-but-not-funded stands at approximately $300 million, with strong July performance boding well, with a robust pipeline of other opportunities over the fiscal year.
This quarter also included a $150 million outflow, which is the previously disclosed wind down of a sub-advisory account. The performance had been outstanding, but the sponsor is closing the account for unrelated reasons. We expect the wind down to be complete by the end of the calendar year and involving a remaining $150 million.  Traditional broker-dealer high net worth continues to be in outflows at the same pace, while the independent high net worth initiatives saw some adverse lumpiness this quarter, but future pipeline remains encouraging.  Permal's private equity team, strategic expansion in China and innovative use of customized solutions are added engines for growth, where we work closely together.
Next is Brandywine at $39 billion, driven by net inflows for the quarter. Brandywine is emerging as a formidable manager, whose top-down strategies and fixed income are complementary to our overall mix. Positive flows came from both the institutional channel, including a new relationship with the global consultant as well as from continued momentum in retail funds, importantly both U.S. and cross border.  Brandywine had $700 million in unfunded wins, including several with expected upside over the year. That would be over the next 12 months.  And performance across their funds remains in the top quartile. 
Finally, Batterymarch at $15.6 billion is down from last quarter. Macro events in these volatile markets continue to challenge quantitative managers, impacting short-term performance results in certain strategies. In the quarter, we worked with them to launch certain volatility management products that aim to provide investors with income and downside protection.
Slide 7 is an update on Western Asset. The chart on the upper-left side shows AUM by mandate. Assets in specialized mandates are up 45%, as Western continued to see interest in strategies like emerging market, U.S. and global corporate, high yield, Australia Core and Brazil total return.
In the quarter, there were a couple of specific instances, in which existing institutional clients took money out of lower-yielding strategy and moved it in a higher-fee, specialized mandates.  Their pipeline includes nearly $2 billion that are one and not funded, up nearly 25% from the year-ago period. Institutional interest in Core and Core Plus has picked up, joining the retail channel's continued good momentum. 
The chart on the upper-right side shows 98% of composite assets beating their benchmark over the 3-year period. That outstanding performance should help both their institutional and retail growth. And finally, the lower half of the slide shows the improvement over the last year in long-term flow trend. We've adopted the Western institutional brand across all of its U.S. retail products. And after-fund mergers expect to offer a streamlined fund lineup in the fall with the full range of share classes.  Overall, Western is very well positioned across all aspects of the fixed income markets, particularly as it leverages on-the-ground global capabilities in investing and sales and client service.
Slide 8 shows investment performance, both versus the benchmark and versus peers. We are pleased that overall performance has held up well, even amid volatile equity markets. For the critical 3-year period, 80% of assets beat benchmarks, but performance against peers at certain equity managers is down compared to last quarter.  In particular, fixed income performance was strong, with both Western and Brandywine showing impressive performance.
Slide 9 shows an overview of our global distribution platform. This platform has $217 billion in long-term assets and serves retail and individual clients in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia across a number of our affiliates.  Increasingly, I see this as a compelling competitive advantage and a key component of our growth strategy going forward. Today, we have a broad suite of products across equity, fixed income and alternatives. Strong performance and an emphasis on new products will be critical to our growth. 
Globally, our distribution platform has been in net inflows for 7 of the past 10 quarters. And while our international team has been a key driver of that momentum in the past, this quarter, the U.S. team had their highest level of net inflows since March of '07.  Our international [indiscernible] had positive net flows for the past 14 quarters. 
Over the past year, we conducted a U.S. retail branding review to determine how best to use the respective brand recognition of our key managers, backed by the financial strength of Legg Mason and to show the diversity of our offerings. We are starting with the Western rebranding in the fall, and we'll make similar refinements at other affiliates targeted to be launched in the first half of calendar '13.
Slide 10 shows some of the areas in which we've gained momentum in our distribution platform. It bears repeating that I think we are extremely well positioned across our product set to grow our AUM to this strategic asset. As you can see, the products that are driving sales come from a number of our affiliates across all of our geographies. This includes closed-end funds and institutional-like mandates at insurance clients and distribution partners which will vary from quarter.  
In the lower left corner, we show gross sales versus persistency rates, which speaks to the expected longevity of client assets within our platform. We have seen our gross sales trend higher in recent quarters, while at the same time maintaining strong levels of asset retention versus peers.
The right side of the chart shows an area of key strength for Legg Mason, closed-end Funds, in which we are now a top 5 player based on total AUM. In the bottom right chart, you can see we are tapping into the expertise of a number of our affiliates. In fact, over the last 4 years, we have averaged 20% of all closed-end fund market issuances, advancing our leadership ranking.  In particular, the closed-end fund structure has been a good one for the MLP market, which has had strong yield equity investors seeking new sources of income. These are high-fee, long-term assets. 
And with that, I will now turn it over to Pete."

As Mark noted, we made significant progress on a number of funds in positioning the firm for long-term growth. Specifically, we had a number of positive events during our first fiscal quarter of 2013. The upfront cost of which significantly reduced our GAAP earnings per share, but the outcomes of which will contribute to future earnings momentum and growth. 
The first of these was the successful launch of our new capital plan, where we paid off our $1.25 billion in senior convertible notes, raised $650 million in the debt capital markets and secured a bank term loan for $500 million, along with revolver capacity for another $500 million.  We also significantly diversified our debt investor base, while reducing our outstanding debt by $350 million and laddering out our debt maturities.
Also, as part of the new capital plan, the board authorized an additional $1 billion share buyback to be deployed over the next several years.  The P&L cost of the debt extinguishment in the current quarter was $69 million or $0.32 per diluted share, which is principally noncash.
We also raised $800 million in a ClearBridge closed-end fund and $200 million in a Western REIT IPO that together resulted in a $23 million or $0.11 per diluted share in fund launch cost this quarter. All of these transactions will be additive to GAAP earnings on a go-forward basis.  During the quarter, and related to our capital plan, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of stock at a cost of $155 million. This was the final piece remaining from the prior $1 billion share buyback authorization.  
In terms of other share activity in the quarter, in addition to the $155 million in repurchases, we issued approximately 1.3 million shares of stock in May, related to our annual long-term incentive awards. Since both the share repurchase and the stock awards occurred approximately mid-quarter, only about half of those shares are reflected in this quarter's weighted average share count. Absent any additional share repurchases, our ending in average diluted share count for the September 30 quarter would be 135.5 million shares. 
Finally, a number of other factors impacted our results. These included lower revenues despite average AUM being flat on the prior period. This reflected a mix shift, with a 4% decline in higher-fee equity AUM, offset by an increase in average AUM for both fixed income and, in particular, liquidity.  And as anticipated, performance fees came in below the March quarter but above  December's. 
Now, let's turn to Slide 11 to review the financial highlights for the quarter.  As Mark noted earlier, the fiscal first quarter net loss was $9.5 million or $0.07 diluted share, reflecting the impact of the debt extinguishment and the fund launch cost, which together totaled $0.43 per share. Operating revenues were down 3% compared to the prior quarter, due to lower advisory fees, reflecting a decline in average equity AUM and a $6 million drop in performance fees earned this quarter.  This quarter's performance fees were largely driven by Western, LM Global Equities and Brandywine. While impossible to predict with any precision, we anticipate next quarter's performance fees to be in line with this quarter's level. 
Operating expenses declined 4%, reflecting lower mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and seed investments, which are offset in other nonoperating income and expenses. These were partly offset by higher fund launch cost of $23 million this quarter, compared to $9 million in the prior quarter.  Adjusted income, which excludes the debt extinguishment cost, was $89 million for the quarter or $0.64 per diluted share, with a drop from last quarter's $124 million level driven by 3 things: First, the higher fund launch cost; secondly, a mark-to-market loss on corporate seed investments of $6 million compared with gains in fiscal Q4 of  $10 million; and lastly, $16 million in onetime gains recorded last quarter.
Moving onto Slide 12. The only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate which was 28% on a GAAP basis. But excluding the impact of our consolidated investment vehicles, the rate would've been 35% in line with our targeted effective tax rate.  The tax outlook for next quarter is for a lower effective rate, as we expect to benefit from another U.K. tax rate reduction of 2%, which will occur in fiscal Q2 as it has, the last 2 years. This will result in an approximate $18 million tax credit in the second fiscal quarter, and we then expect the effective rate to return to the 34% to 36% level over the last 2 quarters of fiscal 2013.
Slide 13 is a roll forward from fiscal Q4's earnings per share of $0.54 to this quarter's EPS loss of $0.07. The fiscal Q4 items on the first red bar totaling $0.11, include onetime gains, closed-end fund launch costs, mark-to-market on seed, transition-related cost and tax adjustments. The key items for this quarter, which are on the next 3 bars, include $0.32 related to the debt extinguishment, $0.11 related to the fund launch costs and $0.03 impact from the negative mark-to-market on seed investments. And then the final contributor is the $0.04 decline in other net revenue and operating expenses, which was largely driven by the decline in operating revenues.
Turning to Slide 14. You can see that the advisory fee yield decreased this quarter from 35 basis points to 34 bps, driven by asset mix, specifically lower average equity AUM on the quarter, combined with higher average fixed income and liquidity AUM.
On Slide 15, operating expense for the quarter decreased primarily due to lower comp expense, which I'll discuss in the next slide. Other factors impacting operating expenses were higher distribution and servicing costs, reflecting the fund launches this quarter and totaling $21 million compared to $8 million of closed-end loss last quarter. Excluding these 2 items, distribution in servicing expenses were down 2%, reflecting the lower revenues. Communications and tech expenses decreased, reflecting lower affiliated-related technology costs. And finally, other expenses decreased due to lower fund-related costs and trading losses, offsetting compensation, which were partially offset by the impact of last quarter's FSA assessment refund.
Turning to Slide 16. Total comp and benefits were down from last quarter, reflecting lower deferred comp and seed investment-related expenses, offsetting nonoperating income and due to lower revenues. As you can see, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio was 58%, however, 3% of this amount relates to fund launch costs. And as additional context, this quarter's ratio also reflects lower net revenues, which had a further 1% impact on a comp and benefit ratio due to the denominator impact.
Turning to Slide 17. The operating margin, as adjusted, declined from last quarter, reflecting the impact of the 2 fund launches this quarter. These  combined for a 4% reduction in the adjusted operating margin for the quarter.
I'll wrap up on Slide 18, which covers one of the key highlights in our fiscal first quarter, which was the announcement of our capital plan and included several key events. We repurchased $1.25 billion in convertible senior notes, using $250 million from our bank line, the proceeds of a $600 million 7-year bond offering and $350 million in cash. This reduced our gross debt by $350 million. 
In addition, late in June, we refinanced our $500 million credit facility with a 5-year amortizing term loan, and amended and extended our $500 million revolver that is now completely undrawn. As part of the transaction, we announced that we would buy back the remaining $155 million from the original board buyback authorization and we accomplished that, buying back  6.2 million shares. We also announced a new $1 billion authorization that we are currently deploying -- plan to deploy at a rate of up to 65% of cash generated from operations prospectively.  As always, subject to market conditions.
The benefits from the debt restructuring aspect of the new capital plan include delevering of balance sheet, laddering out our debt maturities, as illustrated on the chart at the bottom right and diversifying our sources of capital from both the banks and bond investors. Additionally, we will reduce our GAAP interest expense by $36 million annually.  As Mark mentioned earlier, these transactions greatly enhanced our financial flexibility, going forward.  And finally, we end the quarter with approximately $800 million in cash after delevering the balance sheet and buying back 155 million of our shares. 
So thanks again for your time and attention. And now, Mark, back to you."

Slide 19 shows the diversity and scale of our business across asset classes, client domicile and revenues. 
As we've shown in previous quarters, from a gross revenue standpoint, Legg Mason does have a significant balance between equity, fixed income and alternatives. We want to continue to deepen and strengthen that balance across geographies, asset classes and channels. We will invest in our affiliate franchises and continue to look at selected bolt-on and lift-out acquisitions.
Slide 20 updates the metrics we've been watching closely as we managed the business. As the chart on the upper left-hand side shows, we continue to make progress on our long-term flows. On the lower left-hand side, we recapped our successful streamlining effort that we finalized last quarter, with annualized cost savings of $143 million. 
On the upper right-hand side, we show how we allocated capital in the current quarter and past 2 fiscal quarters. In the current quarter, we reduced debt by $350 million, completed the remaining $155 million of our original $1 billion share repurchase and paid out our quarterly dividend. With the completion of our debt transaction in the quarter, we have enhanced our financial flexibility and positioned ourselves to continue to invest in our franchise. And finally, we show that the 3-year composite performance number remains strong, which should contribute to our improving flow story and to our organic growth.
On a go-forward basis, as shown in Slide 21, we plan to allocate capital to further diversify and grow earnings, as follows: One, organic growth. This is our top priority: Institutional and retail across the firm; accelerating where we have strong product and performance; developing, and where necessary, seeding new products including additional closed-end fund launches. Two, filling product gaps. We will work with our affiliates on product development, as well as on selected bolt-on and lift-out opportunities. Three, we will continue to return capital to shareholders with both share repurchase and dividend. 
With that, we'll open the line for questions, and I thank you."

One of our managers talks about kind of an end result of a structure of -- similar to kind of the United States of Europe, as a governing structure that puts in more kind of, if you will, fetters-less discipline into things. Those kinds of things sometime after the election and the market always is forward-thinking and perhaps kind of seeing it in advance, could be very encouraging, because the fundamentals particularly in U.S. market in terms of what companies are doing with lower, deleveraged housing seems to be troughing for sure and a little bit of uptick, lower energy costs, productivity, those things are clearly evident. And if we can get rid of this kind of political crisis in confidence, I think, you got something that really starts to move."

There just seemed to be a pause, but we see basically that pipeline's still quite strong. On the non-U.S. institutional, things were a little mixed. It was more of a risk-off kind of attitude there. Overall, going forward, we continue to see a lot of good opportunities for Permal. And particularly, over these next several quarters kind of we'll be clear if we can close those things and take them over the goal line, we'll have some good results.

I do appreciate your interest in Legg Mason and in taking time this morning to participate in our fiscal 2013 second quarter earnings call. I am very pleased to be serving Legg Mason and our investors as interim CEO and I want to tell you upfront what I'm committed to. Demonstrating continued and substantial progress on our turnaround that has been underway for some time; building upon our many competitive strengths; and applying the lessons that we've learned over the past few years while at the same time, being open to new and fresh ideas that target growth.
I recognize that real challenges remain. However, I also want to convey very clearly that we are moving in the right direction. Now, before we get into the results for our quarter, I thought I'd take a few minutes to delivered a bit about my background for those of you don't know me, and especially about my approach as CEO during this interim period.
I've been in the financial services industry for my entire career, more than 30 years now, holding prior executive roles in various capital markets businesses at Legg Mason, Wood Walker, Stifel, Nicolaus, Bosworth and Piper Jaffray. I rejoined Legg Mason in the fall of 2008 as chief administrative officer. And after leading organizational restructuring that we announced in May 2010, have overseen the company's global distribution efforts for the past 21 months.
I've been the interim CEO of Legg Mason for about a month now. Our nonexecutive chairman, Alan Reed, and I, have agreed that we must continue the momentum of our turnaround, even as the CEO search process takes place.
We must capitalize on the strength of Legg Mason's diversified multi-manager model, and build on the substantial progress that we've made with regards to expense reduction, balance sheet improvement and positioning the company for top line growth.
And while I am intimately familiar with the company, I am also willing to challenge the status quo and approach that I think would be critical as we take a fresh look at our strategy during this interim period. So with that, let's move onto our results for the quarter.
As we announced this morning, Legg Mason reported fiscal second quarter net income of $81 million or $0.60 per diluted share and adjusted income of $100 million or $0.75 per diluted share. This does represent an improvement in earnings, though our flow story remains mixed. And Pete will provide more color on these results in just a few minutes.
In addition, we repurchased $90 million or 3.6 million shares in the quarter, representing over 2.5% of our outstanding shares. Following that repurchase, we now have 132 million shares outstanding.
Our AUM by affiliate and in the order of their contribution to this quarter's earnings is shown on Slide 4. Let's begin with Western Asset. With $459 billion in AUM, up 3% from last quarter. AUM results were driven by both improving markets and overall inflows. While long-term outflows were $4.4 billion in total, it's really important to understand the drivers of those flows. We experienced outflows in 3 low fee mandates, including $1.7 billion related to the global sovereign mandate that we have highlighted for some time, as well as the total of $3.1 billion in liquidity-like accounts that we've previously referenced in our AUM releases.
And finally, the quarter also included a $750 million redemption related to the PPIP program. Western has successfully concluded its PPIP program in the current month, which will result in an additional redemption of $1.1 billion in the common December quarter.
As you can see, excluding those 3 low-fee outflows, and the PPIP redemption, long-term flows were positive for the quarter.
Western continues to see interest in specialized mandates globally, particularly in emerging markets, high yield and local currency denominated mandates. So specialized mandates continue to reflect higher fees than the mandates that terminated in the quarter.
In the quarter, we added retail share classes and other enhancements to the Western branded funds in the U.S. With the share class enhancements and the strength of the investment performance of those funds, we see a wonderful opportunity to more aggressively market those funds in the retail, institutional and retirement distribution channels.
We recently conducted a Sales Planning session for our U.S. distribution team with our Western colleagues that was highly productive. And our wholesalers are in the field, sourcing opportunities to both attract new cash from the sidelines and take market share from well-known fixed income competitors in the retail-oriented channels.
The pipeline and RFP activity for Western remains solid, reflecting their continued strong investment performance and strengthening consultant recommendations. One, but not yet funded mandate at quarter end were $1.8 billion, over half, of which are in higher fee, specialized mandates.
And finally, Western raised over $300 million in  a secondary offering for Western asset mortgage capital corporation, a REIT focus on agency MBS which brings the total fund AUM in the REIT to $500 million.
Though this raise was an ounce in the September quarter, the funding occurred in early October and will appear in our October AUM.
Now, let's move onto Royce with $36 billion in AUM. Assets were up slightly in the quarter due to market appreciation, partially offset by increased outflows. These outflows largely reflect the industry trends in active small-cap equities, a factor that has been under pressure recently. As is always the case, Royce is actively engaged with their clients and distribution partners amidst these sector headwinds. Recent market trends are broadly emphasizing mega caps and defensive stocks within the small-cap sector. And while Royce's 1 and 3-year numbers are challenged, the company's performance for the quarter strengthened. Royce has managed the many challenging cycles over their 35-year history and they remain vigilant to be well positioned for long-term opportunities in the sector.
Next, ClearBridge. At $59 billion in AUM, is up 5%, driven by market performance. It is important to point out that outflows at ClearBridge have moderated significantly, and September marked their second-best quarter in terms of flows, since our acquisition of them in 2005. Only last quarter, which included the third ClearBridge Energy ML-B closed-end fund, was a better quarter.
ClearBridge continues to make real progress with a sharpened focus on 3 competitive strategies: Income solutions, concentrated portfolios and low volatility.
The company ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in unfunded wins and has a meaningful increase in search activity in their institutional business.
And finally, ClearBridge also announced the promotion of Scott Glasser, the co-CIO with Hirsch Cohen. Scott and Hirsch were partners on the Four-star Appreciation Strategy for 15 years. Scott has been an important mentor to many of the firm's portfolio managers, playing a key role in building the future generation of the investment team at ClearBridge.
Next, Permal, with $17 billion of AUM have seen outflows in the global high network sector partially offset by institutional wins.
Permal continues to enjoy a valuable leadership position in the fund of hedge funds space. We see continued opportunities there and an alternatives more broadly, as the industry trends towards consolidation, customization and convergence, all of which should benefit Permal over time.
Permal is one of the larger managers in their space, and already has a robust managed account platform capable of customization. Longer term, we are working with Permal to create products that offer clients exposure to alternatives more broadly. Permal ended the quarter with $300 million in one, but not yet funded mandates in the institutional sector. As the global intermediated high net worth sector continues to be soft across the industry, Permal has seen its business mix shift towards both institution and sovereign wealth funds. 
In the U.S., both institutional and retail channels offer meaningful opportunity. And Permal is also building a pipeline of business for European and Japanese institutions and will soon open an office in Shanghai, China. Next, we see Brandywine ending the quarter with $41 billion in AUM, driven by improving markets as well as net positive flows for the quarter. Brandywine is emerging as a formidable manager whose top-down strategies in fixed income are complementary to our overall mix. Strong performance in fixed income funds drove positive flows in both the institutional channel and U.S. retail, as well as cross-border funds. Brandywine has over $400 million in unfunded wins, including several with potential additional upside over the next 12 months.
And finally, Batterymarch, at $14.6 billion in AUM, is down from last quarter. Loan-only active managers continue to be under pressure from a flow perspective. Batterymarch has experienced a handful of meaningful institutional redemptions during the quarter, a trend that has carried over into October. Looking forward, interest in Batterymarch is managed volatility capabilities remains robust, with a number of significant opportunities on the horizon.
So let's talk a little bit about investment performance as shown on Slide 5. We are quite pleased that overall investment performance remains strong amid volatile equity markets. For the critical 3-year period, 83% of strategy assets beat benchmarks, while more than 79% of strategy assets beat benchmarks over all relevant periods.
Let's move on now to look at our global distribution platform. Slide 6 shows that our global retail distribution platform services $224 billion in long-term AUM, sourced from retail and quasi-institutional clients in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia.
Retail assets are very attractive from both a margin and a persistent fee standpoint. Today, we have a broad suite of products across equity, fixed income and alternatives, and among all of our affiliates.
Continued strong investment performance and emphasis on new product development and continued improvement in productivity and market share will be important drivers of our growth in the retail space. Globally, our distribution platform has been in net inflow for 8 of the past 11 quarters. As you can see in the upper right of this chart, we enjoyed the second best quarter for flows over the past 11 quarters, even without the benefit of a closed-end fund, or other special product launch. Our international team was again a key contributor to our overall positive flows with over $2 billion of net inflow. This international results were led by our Japan team, with strong inflows into Australian bond and equity income products, as well as emerging market debt.
The U.S. team had a solid second quarter, with newly break-even flows. Inflows were led by municipal products, Brandywine's global bond funds, and several of Western's taxable products, including Core Plus, high income and total return funds.
In the U.S., we won approximately $1.1 billion [ph] specifically into Western products across our sub-advisory, DCI and wealth management channels. These results follow on the heels of the best net flows in U.S. distribution in over 5 years that we had last quarter.
Looking forward, we are working with clients and our affiliate partners to develop a strong product pipeline in the income, specialized solutions and alternative sectors. Since 2008, we have launched this new products working with our affiliates, both in the U.S. and internationally, which today represents a total of $22 billion in AUM.
The lower left corner highlights the diversity of gross sale for first half of fiscal 2013. And as you can see, our sales are diversified across our affiliate and geography where we have an established presence.
In the bottom right corner, we show gross sales versus persistency rates, which speaks to the expected longevity of client assets within our retail platform.
We have seen our gross sales trend higher in recent quarters while simultaneously maintaining strong levels of asset retention, which is exactly the kind of progress we expect to continue.
And now, I will turn it over to Pete to review this quarter's financial results. Pete?"
180481,222936256,371297,"Legg Mason Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2012",2012-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. As Joe noted, we generated GAAP earnings side to $81 million or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million or $0.75 per diluted share. This quarter, our GAAP EPS benefited from an $18 million U.K. tax adjustment, as well as",1401,"Thanks, Joe. As Joe noted, we generated GAAP earnings side to $81 million or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million or $0.75 per diluted share. This quarter, our GAAP EPS benefited from an $18 million U.K. tax adjustment, as well as the positive impacts from the capital plan we launched in the June quarter, which resulted in reduced GAAP interest expense and lowered our share count. 
Our lower share count reflects both our repurchase activity in the prior quarter, where we finalized repurchases under our May 2010 board authorization, and this quarter's repurchases under the new, $1 billion authorization. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to review the financial highlights for the quarter. Net income was $81 million or $0.60 per diluted share, adjusted income, which again excludes the U.K. tax benefit, was $100 million for the quarter or $0.75 per diluted share with the increase from last quarter's $88.6 million level, resulting from the fund launch cost which reduced last quarter's results.
Operating revenues were up 1.5% over to prior quarter, due to higher advisory fees from 1 additional day in the quarter, an increase in average AUM and a modest increase in performance fees. This quarter's performance fees were largely driven by Western, Brandywine and Permal.
While impossible to predict with precision, we anticipate next quarter's performance fees to be in the mid-$40 million range. This will be largely driven by onetime fee, as well as some seasonal and calendar year end fees. Operating expenses increased 1%, reflecting higher mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and seed investments, which increased comp expense but are offsetting other nonoperating income and expenses. These in turn, were partially offset by lower distribution in servicing expenses, and I'll provide a little bit more color on operating expenses later. 
Moving onto Slide 8. The only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 17% on a GAAP basis, reflecting the U.K. tax adjustment of $18 million in the quarter. The tax outlook for the next quarter is for our return to our normalized effective rate of 34% to 36%. 
Slide 9 is a roll forward from fiscal Q1's loss of $0.07 per share to this quarter's earnings per share of $0.60. The fiscal Q1 items totaling $0.46, including debt extinguishment cost, fund launch cost and mark-to-market losses on seed investments.
The key items this quarter included $0.02 increase from operations, $0.13 related to the U.K. tax adjustment and $0.02 related to mark-to-market gains on seed investments. The final contributor is a $0.04 benefit resulting from the new capital plan reflecting both lower GAAP interest expense and reduced average shares outstanding.
Turning to Slide 10, our assets under management increased 3% driven by market appreciation of nearly $21 billion. Given the majority of the market pickup came late in the quarter, our average AUM is up only $4 billion in the June quarter. But if markets hold, this bodes well for the December quarter. This quarter's AUM also included a disposition of $2 billion, reflecting the last of the liquidity AUM to be transferred to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.
Long-term flows on Slide 11 deteriorated from the prior quarter due in part to a pickup on equity outflows, consistent with an industry-wide acceleration in U.S. active equity outflows. Fixed income flows went from slight inflows last quarter to outflows this quarter. This was largely due to a $3.1 billion in liquidity-like low-fee accounts that we called out in our July and August AUM releases, as well as $1.7 billion in ongoing redemptions related to the low fee, global sovereign mandate. In addition, there was a $750 million redemption related to Western Asset's PPIP Program. We with see an additional $1.1 billion redemption in fiscal Q3 following the successful completion of the PPIP Program. We are also anticipating several large redemptions in our October and equity AUM totaling about $2 billion. 
Finally, we highlighted on this Slide that we have fixed income fund inflows of $1.7 billion. This marks the 13th straight quarter of fixed income fund inflows and September was the second best quarter for those inflows in the last 2 years.
Slide 12 shows the advisory fee trend with this quarter's rate basically in line with the June quarter. Operating expenses on Slide 13 increased 1%, largely due to higher comp expenses, which I will detail in a moment. You can see that the number of the other expense categories declined relative to last quarter, including distribution and servicing expenses, which were down $25 million, principally due to $23 million in fund launch cost last quarter. Communications and technology expense declined $1.8 million, reflecting renegotiated vendor contracts and lower consulting expenses. Occupancy expense declined $3 million, due to a reduction in lease reserves related to office space held for sub lease. 
And finally, other expenses increased $3 million from fiscal Q1 due to annual director fees and higher affiliate-related legal fees, both partially offset by lower D&E expenses.
Turning to Slide 14. Total comp and benefits increased 12%, primarily due to 3 items: First, higher mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed investments, with the related offset in nonoperating income. Second, net revenue increases resulting in upticks in our affiliates compensation pools. And finally, due to management fund transition costs. As you can see, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio, excluding the mark-to-market on deferred comp and management transition cost, was 55%, which is at the high end of our 54% to 55% guidance. This compares with 58% last quarter, which was impacted by fund launch costs. 
Management transition costs reflect the CEO transition and separation agreement and related executive retention awards, which were best in 18-month, although the expense will be taken ratably over this period.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which increased to 21.2%, up from last quarter's 16.9%. Recall that last quarter's expenses included the impact of the 2 fund launches. These combined to reduce last quarter's adjusted operating margin by 4%. 
On Slide 16, our cash taxes are under 10%, compared to a significantly higher GAAP tax as this slide highlights. This low cash tax rate allows for both additional investments in the business and return of capital to shareholders. This is an area we will continue to highlight as we believe it is important for investors to fully appreciate the significantly lower level of cash taxes we've had. Specifically, this lower level of cash taxes results from our NOL carryforward and our ability to amortize our goodwill and indefinite live intangibles for tax purposes. When you translate our effective tax rate into dollars, on the right side of the schedule, you see that over time, we will realize a positive cash impact of $1.5 billion.
I will wrap up on Slide 17, which reflects the key highlights of our new capital plan, which we executed in the first fiscal quarter. In the upper left side corner, you will note that we ended the quarter with a cash balance at nearly $900 million, up from $800 million last quarter. Let's remember, our first quarter is typically our annual low point due to our fiscal year bonus payments in May.
In the upper right, we've summarized our share repurchases over the last several years. In conjunction with last quarter's capital plan, we announced a new, $1 billion board stock repurchase authorization. And in the second fiscal quarter, we repurchased $90 million of stock or 3.6 million shares under that new authorization.
You should note, these share repurchases began mid-quarter, so they are not fully reflected in our average diluted share count. So the average shares would be 2.1 million lower at the end of December before any additional share repurchases this quarter.
The bottom left provides the comparison of the new debt maturity schedule versus our prior debt structure. The benefits from our debt restructuring include delevering the balance sheet, laddering out our debt maturities, diversifying our sources of debt capital from both new banks and bond investors, and locking in rates in this historically low environment. Additionally, we reduced our GAAP interest expense by $36 million annually. Overall, these transactions greatly enhanced our financial flexibility in addition to the positive impact on our financial assault, which you can see in our fiscal second quarter.
Thanks for your time and attention, and now I'll turn it back to Joe."

Before I close, I'd also like to speak to two questions that I'm sure are on the minds of many listening in today. The search for our permanent CEO and the status of our standstill agreement with Trian. As for the CEO search process, it is w",782,"Thanks, Pete. Before I close, I'd also like to speak to two questions that I'm sure are on the minds of many listening in today. The search for our permanent CEO and the status of our standstill agreement with Trian. As for the CEO search process, it is well underway. You may have read that the search committee of the board has hired Korn Ferry and they have already completed preliminary qualifications interviews with key constituencies, including board members, various of our affiliate CEOs, and members of executive team.
There's no stated timeframe for completion of the search, but realistically, it will take several months. And now, let me update you as to the status of our standstill agreement with Trian. We're now compelled the CEO and founding partner of Trian joined our board 3 years ago. We knew very little about his intentions with respect to the sizable investment that Trian and had made in Legg Mason. Therefore, we negotiated a stand still agreement in an effort to set the expectations for both Legg Mason and Trian. Now, with 3 years of experience working with him, we found Nelson to be a constructive member of the board and we're comfortable working with him and the team at Trian. The standstill is set to expire November 15. If there is an update, we'll let you know, but our goal is to continue to work with our members of our board to drive shareholder value. 
And finally, let me return to that on which I am most focused. I want to be clear that Legg Mason has a solid foundation, significant strengths that I think will sometimes under-appreciate. And we need to continue to build upon those strengths. We have a set of distinct, highly performing investment affiliates, diversified by asset class in U.S. equities, global fixed income and alternatives.
As a truly global firm, we are also well diversified with nearly 40% of our assets under management generated by non-U.S. clients. We enjoy broad client and channel diversification across both global retail distribution and our affiliate businesses, with institutional we their client mix running at approximately 70-30. We continue to have strong investment performance with over 79% of marketed strategies beating benchmarks over all relevant periods. 
Many of our affiliates have made truly remarkable improvements in their investment performance since the depths of the crisis.
We have a strong and flexible balance sheet and a robust cash position while we return the significant amount of capital to shareholders over the last few years. And with our new capital plan implemented, we will balance investing in our core business and returning capital to shareholders appropriately. The key for us now is to stay focused and build on the momentum in areas where we are making progress, while proactively addressing the issues and areas where we face challenges. 
So let me conclude by spending just a few minutes on where we must focus our attention.
First and foremost, we need to grow, both institutionally and in retail. And that means not just flowing the outflows, but turning them into consistent inflows. In retail, we will continue to evolve our sales model to capture the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, both in the U.S. and international. Our goal there is to expand our client penetration to improve our sales productivity and increased persistency in asset retention.
Our investment performance warrants more consistent institutional inflows. Our affiliate partners have made progress and we will do all that we can to support their efforts in growing our institutional business.
We are working on existing products that are underperforming or are subscale, and we are engaged with affiliates that for a variety of reasons may be challenged.
Longer term, we will ensure that the have the right mix of products and investment strategies across geographies, asset classes and distribution channels.  With a focus on improving our operating margin, we will continue to review our streamlined operating model and build upon the progress we've already made. We will continually look for opportunities to develop a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness across all business functions. Quite frankly, in an increasingly competitive environment, operating efficiency is an imperative.
So I recognize that the status quo [indiscernible] is not an option. We are reviewing and evaluating our current business strategy with our affiliate leadership and our board, and we are prepared to modify it as appropriate.
Quite simply, we are focused on additional opportunities to grow revenues, to expand margins, and to improve earnings leverage across the organization, all with the intent of increasing long-term shareholder value. And with that, let me it open it up to your questions."

But as I mentioned at the end of my comments, my view is that operating efficiency is an ongoing imperative. The business is increasingly competitive for everyone. And so if we're going to be -- if we're going to be relevant and competitive in the marketplace, we have to keep an eye on our cost structure and operating efficiencies. One of the things that I did recently in a Townhall as we were talking about the transition was, I received a question and basically asking. So we'll keep our heads down, we'll keep focused, it's business as usual. And I said no, it's got to be business better than usual. The distribution side is raising our assets and increasing our growth, but also to all of our business leaders on looking at how they do their business, how they're run the various operating units and looking for ways to be better than usual. So we're going to be -- it's got to be part of our DNA and part of our corporate culture that we constantly evolve and review our cost structure and look for opportunities to be more efficient. So I don't have anything for you today in terms of specifics, but I have challenged the organization everywhere to continue to look for additional efficiencies."

But I don't think we have to choose between margins or growth. I don't think we can. It is a balance all the time, obviously, and there are times we need to make investments that could modestly impact our margins. But again, our margins of not been acceptable and I get that, we all get that. That's really why we have this kind of increased focus on opportunities for efficiency. We've got -- and by the way, even if we're growing and when we get back to growing and when we get back to doing  better financial performance we still need to be diligent and focused on efficiency. So we make sure that we continue to push on our margins. But to also have to grow and I think Pete mentioned earlier, we have a leverageable model. And so once we get them to growth and Pete can talk about that a little bit, if you want, we do have the opportunity from our margin expansion. I think as to your other question about sort of selling or shuttering affiliates, what I would say is, at various times, some of our affiliates are struggling for a variety of reasons more than others. And over time, we have worked with them, in some cases supporting them. In other cases, we have divested where it's made sense. If our affiliates then challenged from a scale perspective or whatever. In some cases, we've divested some of the smaller managers over the last year, so we don't make a big fanfare about it and chomp at it broadly. But if it makes a sense from a strategic counsel him we've done that. We have merged affiliate so with that that a couple of years ago with one of our affiliates global currents into ClearBrdige. And so these are things that we have done in the past and we're going to be open to doing in the future. As it relates to sort of our core affiliates, we feel good about our core affiliates being into spaces that we need to be in, whether it be in equities, whether it be in global fixed, whether it be in alternatives. We do have gaps and that's why we need to focus on filling those gaps. We need to make sure that we're getting the kind of flows and sales for the core affiliates who are performing well and then we to look to add in the space is that we don't. Pete, do you want to say anything about the margins or the model?"

We put a lot more people in the field. If you remember, we did a reorganization with the distribution about just over a year ago, where we eliminated some layers of management and we really repurposed those dollars to more feet-on-the-street. We increased the number of people in client facing positions by almost 50%. And so we're starting to see the benefits of that. We also introduced a different delivery model, something we call the cross channel sales, which is really not a hybrid sales structure people want to call it a hybrid structure but it's really an enhance a structure that's a little bit more between a hybrid and your traditional external sales. And so we're getting some leverage out of that. I think there's just -- the team is settled. We put more feet on the street and we're getting the benefits of it. In the international side, we're continuing with new products, particularly in Japan, for example, where we've evolved our product lineup there and added to it an income product that are particularly -- we're having particular success with our Japanese office.

So we've got $550 million of excess cash on a balance sheet. We think of that, we need $350 million to kind of run the business, regulatory capital, et cetera.

I am very pleased to be serving Legg Mason and our investors as inter",1973,"Alan, thank you. And good morning,  everyone. I do appreciate your interest in Legg Mason and in taking time this morning to participate in our fiscal 2013 second quarter earnings call. I am very pleased to be serving Legg Mason and our investors as interim CEO, and I want to tell you upfront what I'm committed to: demonstrating continued and substantial progress on our turnaround that has been underway for some time, building upon our many competitive strengths, and applying the lessons that we've learned over the past few years, while at the same time, being open to new and fresh ideas that target growth. I recognize that real challenges remain. However, I also want to convey very clearly that we are moving in the right direction. 
Now before we get into the results for our quarter, I thought I'd take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about my background for those of you don't know me, and especially about my approach as CEO during this interim period.
I've been in the financial services industry for my entire career, more than 30 years now, holding prior executive roles in various capital markets businesses at Legg Mason Wood Walker, Stifel, Nicolaus, Dain Bosworth and Piper Jaffray. I rejoined Legg Mason in the fall of 2008 as Chief Administrative Officer, and after leading the organizational restructuring that we announced in May 2010, have overseen the company's Global Distribution efforts for the past 21 months.
I've been the interim CEO of Legg Mason for about 1 month now. Our Non-executive Chairman, Alan Reed, and I, have agreed that we must continue the momentum of our turnaround, even as the CEO search process takes place.
We must capitalize on the strength of Legg Mason's diversified multi-manager model and build on the substantial progress that we've made with regards to expense reduction, balance sheet improvement and positioning the company for top line growth.
And while I am intimately familiar with the company, I am also willing to challenge the status quo, an approach that I think would be critical as we take a fresh look at our strategy during this interim period. So with that, let's move onto our results for the quarter.
As we announced this morning, Legg Mason reported fiscal second quarter net income of $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. This does represent an improvement in earnings, though our flow story remains mixed. And Pete will provide more color on these results in just a few minutes.
In addition, we repurchased $90 million, or 3.6 million shares in the quarter, representing over 2.5% of our outstanding shares. Following that repurchase, we now have 132 million shares outstanding.
Our AUM by affiliate and in the order of their contribution to this quarter's earnings is shown on Slide 4. Let's begin with Western Asset, with $459 billion in AUM, up 3% from last quarter. AUM results were driven by both improving markets and overall inflows. While long-term outflows were $4.4 billion in total, it's really important to understand the drivers of those flows. We experienced outflows in 3 low-fee mandates, including $1.7 billion related to the global sovereign mandate that we have highlighted for some time, as well as the total of $3.1 billion in liquidity-like accounts that we've previously referenced in our AUM releases.
And finally, the quarter also included a $750 million redemption related to the PPIP program. Western has successfully concluded its PPIP program in the current month, which will result in an additional redemption of $1.1 billion in the coming December quarter. As you can see, excluding those 3 low-fee outflows, and the PPIP redemption, long-term flows were positive for the quarter.
Western continues to see interest in specialized mandates globally, particularly in emerging markets, high-yield and local-currency-denominated mandates. Those specialized mandates continue to reflect higher fees than the mandates that terminated in the quarter.
In the quarter, we added retail share classes and other enhancements to the Western branded funds in the U.S. With the share class enhancements and the strength of the investment performance of those funds, we see a wonderful opportunity to more aggressively market those funds in the retail, institutional and retirement distribution channels.
We recently conducted a sales planning session for our U.S. distribution team with our Western colleagues that was highly productive. And our wholesalers are in the field, sourcing opportunities to both attract new cash from the sidelines and take market share from well-known fixed income competitors in the retail-oriented channels.
The pipeline and RFP activity for Western remains solid, reflecting their continued strong investment performance and strengthening consultant recommendations. Won but not yet funded mandates at quarter end were $1.8 billion, over half of which are in higher-fee, specialized mandates.
And finally, Western raised over $300 million in a secondary offering for Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation, a REIT focused on agency MBS, which brings the total fund AUM in the REIT to $500 million. Though this raise was announced in the September quarter, the funding occurred in early October and will appear in our October AUM.
Now, let's move onto Royce, with $36 billion in AUM. Assets were up slightly in the quarter due to market appreciation, partially offset by increased outflows. These outflows largely reflect the industry trends in active small cap equities,  sector that has been under pressure recently. As is always the case, Royce is actively engaged with their clients and distribution partners amidst these sector headwinds. Recent market trends are broadly emphasizing mega caps and defensive stocks within the small cap sector. And while Royce's 1 and 3-year numbers are challenged, the company's performance for the quarter strengthened. Royce has managed through many challenging cycles over their 35-year history, and they remain vigilant to be well positioned for long-term opportunities in the sector.
Next, ClearBridge, at $59 billion in AUM, is up 5%, driven by market performance. It is important to point out that outflows at ClearBridge have moderated significantly, and September marked their second best quarter in terms of flows, since our acquisition of them in 2005. Only last quarter, which included the third ClearBridge Energy MLP  closed-end fund, was a better quarter.
ClearBridge continues to make real progress, with a sharpened focus on 3 competitive strategies: income solutions, concentrated portfolios and low volatility. The company ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in unfunded wins and has a meaningful increase in search activity in their institutional business.
And finally, ClearBridge also announced the promotion of Scott Glasser, the co-CIO with Hersh Cohen. Scott and Hersh were partners on the 4-star Appreciation strategy for 15 years. And Scott has been an important mentor to many of the firm's portfolio managers, playing a key role in building the future generation of the investment team at ClearBridge.
Next, Permal, with $17 billion of AUM, has seen outflows in the global high net worth sector, partially offset by institutional wins. Permal continues to enjoy a valuable leadership position in the fund of hedge funds space. We see continued opportunities there and then alternatives more broadly, as the industry trends towards consolidation, customization and convergence, all of which should benefit Permal over time. Permal is one of the larger managers in their space and already has a robust managed account platform capable of customization. Longer term, we are working with Permal to create products that offer clients exposure to alternatives more broadly. 
Permal ended the quarter with $300 million in won but not yet funded mandates in the institutional sector. As the global intermediated high net worth sector continues to be soft across the industry, Permal has seen its business mix shift towards both institution and sovereign wealth funds. 
In the U.S., both institutional and retail channels offer meaningful opportunity. And Permal is also building a pipeline of business for European and Japanese institutions and will soon open an office in Shanghai, China. 
Next, we see Brandywine ending the quarter with $41 billion in AUM, driven by improving markets as well as net positive flows for the quarter. Brandywine is emerging as a formidable manager whose top-down strategies in fixed income are complementary to our overall mix. Strong performance in fixed income funds drove positive flows in both the institutional channel and the U.S. retail, as well as cross-border funds. Brandywine has over $400 million in unfunded wins, including several with potential additional upside over the next 12 months.
And finally, Batterymarch, at $14.6 billion in AUM, is down from last quarter. Loan-only active managers continue to be under pressure from a flow perspective. Batterymarch has experienced a handful of meaningful institutional redemptions during the quarter, a trend that has carried over into October. Looking forward, interest in Batterymarch's managed volatility capabilities remains robust, with a number of significant opportunities on the horizon.
So let's talk a little bit about investment performance, as shown on Slide 5. We are quite pleased that overall investment performance remains strong amid volatile equity markets. For the critical 3-year period, 83% of strategy assets beat benchmarks, while more than 79% of strategy assets beat benchmarks over all relevant periods.
Let's move on now to look at our Global Distribution platform. Slide 6 shows that our global retail distribution platform services $224 billion in long-term AUM, sourced from retail and quasi-institutional clients in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia.  
Retail assets are very attractive from both a margin and a persistent fee standpoint. Today, we have a broad suite of products across equity, fixed income and alternatives, and among all of our affiliates.
Continued strong investment performance and emphasis on new product development and continued improvement in productivity and market share will be important drivers of our growth in the retail space. Globally, our distribution platform has been in net inflow for 8 of the past 11 quarters. As you can see in the upper right of this chart, we enjoyed the second best quarter for flows over the past 11 quarters, even without the benefit of a closed-end fund or other special product launch. Our international team was again a key contributor to our overall positive flows, with over $2 billion of net inflow. These international results were led by our Japan team, with strong inflows into Australian bond and equity income products, as well as emerging market debt.
The U.S. team had a solid second quarter, with nearly breakeven flows. Inflows were led by municipal products, Brandywine's global bond fund, and several of Western's taxable products, including Core Plus, high income and total-return funds. 
In the U.S., we won approximately $1 billion during the quarter in new mandates, specifically into Western products across our sub-advisory/DCIO and wealth management channels. These results follow on the heels of the best net flows in U.S. distribution in over 5 years that we had last quarter.
Looking forward, we are working with clients and our affiliate partners to develop a strong product pipeline in the income, specialized solutions and alternative sectors. Since 2008, we have launched new products, working with our affiliates, both in the U.S. and internationally, which today represents a total of $22 billion in AUM.
The lower left corner highlights the diversity of gross sale for first half of fiscal 2013. And as you can see, our sales are diversified across our affiliates and the geography where we have an established presence.
In the bottom right corner, we show gross sales versus persistency rates, which speaks to the expected longevity of client assets within our retail platform.
We have seen our gross sales trend higher in recent quarters while simultaneously maintaining strong levels of asset retention, which is exactly the kind of progress we expect to continue.
And now I will turn it over to Pete to review this quarter's financial results. Pete?"
180481,222936256,371637,"Legg Mason Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2012",2012-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. As Joe noted, we generated GAAP earnings of $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. This quarter, our GAAP EPS benefited from an $18 million U.K. tax adjustment, as well as the",1404,"Thanks, Joe. As Joe noted, we generated GAAP earnings of $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. This quarter, our GAAP EPS benefited from an $18 million U.K. tax adjustment, as well as the positive impacts from the capital plan we launched in the June quarter, which resulted in reduced GAAP interest expense and lowered our share count. 
Our lower share count reflects both our repurchase activity in the prior quarter, where we finalized repurchases under our May 2010 board authorization, and this quarter's repurchases under the new $1 billion authorization. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to review the financial highlights for the quarter. Net income was $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. Adjusted income, which, again, excludes the U.K. tax benefit, was $100 million for the quarter, or $0.75 per diluted share, with the increase from last quarter's $88.6 million level resulting from the fund launch costs, which reduced the last quarter's results.
Operating revenues were up 1.5% over the prior quarter due to higher advisory fees from 1 additional day in the quarter, an increase in average AUM and a modest increase in performance fees. This quarter's performance fees were largely driven by Western, Brandywine and Permal.
While impossible to predict with precision, we anticipate next quarter's performance fees to be in the mid-$40 million range. This will be largely driven by one-time fee, as well as some seasonal and calendar year-end fees. Operating expenses increased 1%, reflecting higher mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and seed investments, which increased comp expense but are offset in other non-operating income and expenses. These in turn were partially offset by lower distribution in servicing expenses, and I'll provide a little more color on operating expenses later. 
Moving onto Slide 8. The only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 17% on a GAAP basis, reflecting the U.K. tax adjustment of $18 million in the quarter. The tax outlook for the next quarter is for our return to our normalized effective rate of 34% to 36%. 
Slide 9 is a roll forward from fiscal Q1's loss of $0.07 per share to this quarter's earnings per share of $0.60. The fiscal Q1 items, totaling $0.46, included debt extinguishment cost, fund launch costs and mark-to-market losses on seed investments.
The key items this quarter include a $0.02 increase from operations, $0.13 related to the U.K. tax adjustment and $0.02 related to mark-to-market gains on seed investments. The final contributor is a $0.04 benefit resulting from the new capital plan, reflecting both lower GAAP interest expense and reduced average shares outstanding.
Turning to Slide 10, our assets under management increased 3% driven by market appreciation of nearly $21 billion. Given the majority of the market pickup came late in the quarter, our average AUM is up only $4 billion in the June quarter. But if markets hold, this bodes well for the December quarter. This quarter's AUM also included a disposition of $2 billion, reflecting the last of the liquidity AUM to be transferred to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.
Long-term flows on Slide 11 deteriorated from the prior quarter due in part to a pickup in equity outflows, consistent with an industry-wide acceleration in U.S. active equity outflows. Fixed income flows went from slight inflows last quarter to outflows this quarter. This was largely due to a $3.1 billion in liquidity-light low-fee accounts that we called out in our July and August AUM releases, as well as $1.7 billion in ongoing redemptions related to the low fee, global sovereign mandate. In addition, there was a $750 million redemption related to Western Asset's PPIP program. We will see an additional $1.1 billion redemption in fiscal Q3 following the successful completion of the PPIP program. We are also anticipating several large redemptions in October in equity AUM totaling about $2 billion. 
Finally, we highlighted on this slide that we had fixed income fund inflows of $1.7 billion. This marks the 13th straight quarter of fixed income fund inflows, and September was the second best quarter for those inflows in the last 2 years.
Slide 12 shows the advisory fee trend with this quarter's rate basically in line with the June quarter. 
Operating expenses on Slide 13 increased 1%, largely due to higher comp expenses, which I will detail in a moment. You can see that the number of the other expense categories declined relative to the last quarter, including distribution and servicing expenses, which were down $25 million, principally due to $23 million in fund launch costs last quarter. Communications and technology expense declined $1.8 million, reflecting renegotiated vendor contracts and lower consulting expenses. Occupancy expense declined $ 3 million due to a reduction in lease reserves related to office space held for sub lease. And finally, other expenses increased $3 million from fiscal Q1 due to annual director fees and higher affiliate-related legal fees, both partially offset by lower T&E expenses.
Turning to Slide 14. Total comp and benefits increased 12%, primarily due to 3 items: first, higher mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed investments, with a related offset in non-operating income; second, net revenue increases, resulting in upticks in our affiliates compensation pools; and finally, due to management transition costs. As you can see, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio, excluding the mark-to-market on deferred comp and the management transition cost, was 55%, which is at the high end of our 54% to 55% guidance. This compares with 58% last quarter, which was impacted by fund launch costs. 
Management transition costs reflect the CEO transition and separation agreement and related executive retention awards, which will vest in 18 months, although the expense will be taken ratably over this period.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which increased to 21.2%, up from last quarter's 16.9%. Recall that last quarter's expenses included the impact of the 2 fund launches. These combined to reduce last quarter's adjusted operating margin by 4%. 
On Slide 16, our cash taxes are under 10%, compared to a significantly higher GAAP tax accumulated, as this slide highlights. This low cash tax rate allows for both additional investment in the business and return of capital to shareholders. This is an area we will continue to highlight as we believe it is important for investors to fully appreciate the significantly lower level of cash taxes we've had. Specifically, this lower level of cash taxes results from our NOL carryforward and our ability to amortize our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for tax purposes. When you translate our effective tax rate into dollars, on the right side of the schedule, you see that over time, we will realize a positive cash impact of $1.5 billion.
I will wrap up on Slide 17, which reflects the key highlights of our new capital plan, which we executed in the first fiscal quarter. In the upper left side corner, you will note that we ended the quarter with a cash balance of nearly $900 million, up from $800 million last quarter. We must remember, our first quarter is typically our annual low point due to our fiscal year bonus payments in May.
In the upper right, we've summarized our share repurchases over the last several years. In conjunction with last quarter's capital plan, we announced a new $1 billion board stock repurchase authorization. And in the second fiscal quarter, we repurchased $90 million of stock or 3.6 million shares under that new authorization.
You should note, these share repurchases began mid-quarter, so they are not fully reflected in our average diluted share count. Thus, the average shares will be 2.1 million lower at the end of December before any additional share repurchases this quarter.
The bottom left provides the comparison of the new debt maturity schedule versus our prior debt structure. The benefits from our debt restructuring include delevering the balance sheet, laddering out our debt maturities, diversifying our sources of debt capital from both new banks and bond investors, and locking in rates in this historically low environment. Additionally, we reduced our GAAP interest expense by $36 million annually. Overall, these transactions greatly enhanced our financial flexibility, in addition to the positive impact on our financial assault, which you can see in our fiscal second quarter.
Thanks for your time and attention, and now I'll turn it back to Joe."
180481,222936256,371637,"Legg Mason Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2012",2012-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Pete. Before I close, I'd also like to speak to 2 questions that I'm sure are on the minds of many listening in today: the search for our permanent CEO and the status of our standstill agreement with Trian. As for the CEO search process, it is wel",777,"Thanks, Pete. Before I close, I'd also like to speak to 2 questions that I'm sure are on the minds of many listening in today: the search for our permanent CEO and the status of our standstill agreement with Trian. As for the CEO search process, it is well underway. You may have read that the search committee of the board has hired Korn/Ferry, and they have already completed preliminary qualifications interviews with key constituencies, including board members, various of our affiliate CEOs, and members of the Executive team. There is no stated timeframe for completion of the search, but realistically, it could take several months. 
And now let me update you as to the status of our standstill agreement with Trian. When Nelson Peltz, the CEO and founding partner of Trian, joined our board 3 years ago, we knew very little about his intentions with respect to the sizable investment that Trian had made in Legg Mason. Therefore, we negotiated a standstill agreement in an effort to set expectations for both Legg Mason and Trian. Now with 3 years of experience working with him, we found Nelson to be a constructive member of the board and we're comfortable working with him and the team at Trian. The standstill is set to expire on November 15. If there is an update, we'll let you know, but our goal is to continue to work with all members of our board to drive shareholder value. 
And finally, let me return to that on which I am most focused. I want to be clear that Legg Mason has a solid foundation, significant strengths that I think we sometimes under-appreciate. And we need to continue to build upon those strengths. We have a set of distinct, highly-performing investment affiliates, diversified by asset class in U.S. equities, global fixed income and alternatives.
As a truly global firm, we are also well diversified, with nearly 40% of our assets under management generated by non-U.S. clients. We enjoy broad client and channel diversification across both global retail distribution and our affiliate businesses, with the institutional retail client mix running at approximately 70-30. We continue to have strong investment performance, with over 79% of marketed strategies beating benchmarks over all relevant periods. 
Many of our affiliates have made truly remarkable improvements in their investment performance since the depths of the crisis.
We have a strong and flexible balance sheet and a robust cash position while we return a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the last few years. And with our new capital plan implemented, we will balance investing in our core business and returning capital to shareholders appropriately. The key for us now is to stay focused and build on the momentum in areas where we are making progress while proactively addressing the issues and areas where we face challenges. 
So let me conclude by spending just a few minutes on where we must focus our attention. First and foremost, we need to grow, both institutionally and in retail. And that means not just flowing the outflows, but turning them into consistent inflows. In retail, we will continue to evolve our sales model to capture the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, both in the U.S. and international. Our goal there is to expand our client penetration to improve our sales productivity and increase persistency in asset retention.
Our investment performance warrants more consistent institutional inflows. Our affiliate partners have made progress, and we will do all that we can to support their efforts in growing our institutional business.
We are working on existing products that are underperforming or are subscale, and we are engaged with affiliates that for a variety of reasons may be challenged.
Longer term, we will ensure that the have the right mix of products and investment strategies across geographies, asset classes and distribution channels. With our focus on improving our operating margin, we will continue to review our streamlined operating model and build upon the progress we've already made. We will continually look for opportunities to develop a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness across all business functions. Quite frankly, in an increasingly competitive environment, operating efficiency is an imperative.
So I recognize that the status quo is not an option. We are reviewing and evaluating our current business strategy with our affiliate leadership and our board, and we are prepared to modify it as appropriate. Quite simply, we are focused on additional opportunities to grow revenues, to expand margins, to improve earnings leverage across the organization, all with the intent of increasing long-term shareholder value. 
And with that, let me open it up to your questions."

And so if we're going to be -- if we're going to be relevant and competitive in the marketplace, we have to keep an eye on our cost structure and operating efficiencies. One of the things that I did recently in a Townhall, as we were talking about the transition, was I received a question basically asking, ""So we'll keep our heads down. We'll keep focused. It's business as usual."" And I said no, it's got to be business better than usual. And that means both on the distribution side and raising assets and increasing our growth, but also to all of our business leaders on looking at how they do their business, how they run their various operating units and looking for ways to be better than usual. So we're going to be -- it's got to be part of our DNA and part of our corporate culture that we constantly evolve and review our cost structure and look for opportunities to be more efficient.

But I don't think we have to choose between margins or growth. I don't think we can. It is a balance all the time, obviously, and there are times when we need to make investments that could modestly impact our margins. But again, our margins have not been acceptable, and I get that. We all get that. And that's really why we have this kind of increased focus on opportunities for efficiency. We've got -- and by the way, even if we're growing and when we get back to growing and when we get back to doing  better from a financial performance, we still need to be diligent and focused on efficiency. So we make sure that we continue to push on our margins. But to also have to grow. And I think Pete mentioned earlier, we have a leveragable model. And so once we get into growth, and Pete can talk about that a little bit, if he wants, we do have the opportunity from margin expansion. I think as to your other question about sort of selling or shuttering affiliates, what I would say is, at various times, some of our affiliates are struggling for a variety of reasons more than others. And over time, we have worked with them, in some cases supporting them. In other cases, we have divested, where it's made sense, if our affiliates have been challenged from a scale perspective or whatever. In some cases, we've divested some of the smaller managers over the last year, too. We don't make a lot of big fanfare about it and trumpet it broadly. But if it makes a sense from a strategic standpoint for us and for the affiliate, we've done that. In other cases, we have merged affiliates, so with that a couple of years ago with one of our affiliates, Global Currents, into ClearBrdige. And so these are things that we have done in the past and we're going to be open to doing in the future. As it relates to sort of our core affiliates, we feel good about our core affiliates being in the spaces that we need to be in, whether it be in equities, whether it be in global fixed, whether it be in alternatives. We do have gaps, and that's why we need to focus on filling those gaps. We need to make sure that we're getting the kind of flows and sales for the core affiliates that are performing well, and then we need to look to add in the spaces where we don't.

We also introduced a different delivery model, something we call the cross-channel sales, which is really not a hybrid sales structure. People like to call it a hybrid sales structure, but it's really an enhanced structure that's a little bit more between a hybrid and your traditional external sales.

Well, if we're going to win, we're going to have to beat an army with an army. And so I don't want to suggest a huge ramp up in cost there, but I think we will have a bias towards increasing our sales people and our sales resources as opposed to the other way around."

And our affiliate leadership needs to be a key part of that and will be a key part of that, and we'll do it in conjunction, obviously, with the board. And that is the major focus. Now some of it is what can we do with them in terms of supporting them and helping them and working better together with them and them having input on where we're taking this company going forward. And then what else do we need to add? I think it's clear. We've been talking about it. I kind of hate to talk about the notion of acquisitions and all that because we've talked about it. We haven't really don't it. But the reality is, and we've talked with the board about this even this week, that we have gaps. Where we have gaps that our existing affiliates can fill in terms of introducing new products and new strategies, we'll do that. But where we don't have the capabilities, we need to add those. And so we clearly have a gap in international and global equity, and we need to fill that, and likely we need to fill it through acquisitions. So the key is working and partnering with our affiliates and really affirming, crafting, kind of modifying as necessary our strategy going forward, where we're all aligned and we're all in the same page."

And clearly, flows are going in those areas, and we have some capacity. So I don't want to suggest that we don't have any on that end of the barbel; we don't. If you look at what Western has done over the last few years in really evolving their business to more of the specialized mandate, I mean that's consistent, I think, with this barbel approach that you suggest. So we have at Western, at other of our affiliates, Brandywine, and I would say even ClearBridge to a certain extent, all of our affiliates are evolving, and that's one of the things that I think is most comforting or most -- that I feel best about is that our affiliates have not stood still. They have evolved their model to where the business is going. That said, there are gaps that we just can't fill without an acquisition, so we have to do both."

Maybe I'll take the first part of that, which is kind of the cash we have on the balance sheet and our cash projections going forward. And then Sully can weigh in, in terms of how we think about deploying that from a business standpoint. But keep in mind, you'll see in the Q that we've -- our balance sheet cash has gotten back up to $900 million. That's despite buying back $90 million of stock over the last quarter. And as we talked about often, our cash low point is -- second quarter every year because that's when we pay bonuses. So we'll ramp up from the $900 million going forward, assuming the market stay roughly in line with our recent trajectory. So we've got $550 million of excess cash on a balance sheet. We think of that, we need $350 million to kind of run the business, regulatory capital, et cetera. So $550 million cash on the balance sheet, and then EBITDA, that's approaching $600 million. We're generating a lot more cash on a go-forward basis. So we think we've got plenty of resources to be able to both invest with our affiliates across the various kind of growth options that are day-to-day.

I do appreciate your interest in Legg Mason and in taking time this morning to participate in our fiscal 2013 second quarter earnings call. I am very pleased to be serving Legg Mason and our investors as interim CEO, and I want to tell you upfront what I'm committed to: demonstrating continued and substantial progress on our turnaround that has been underway for some time, building upon our many competitive strengths, and applying the lessons that we've learned over the past few years, while at the same time, being open to new and fresh ideas that target growth. I recognize that real challenges remain. However, I also want to convey very clearly that we are moving in the right direction. 
Now before we get into our results for our quarter, I thought I'd take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about my background for those of you who don't know me, and especially about my approach as CEO during this interim period.
I've been in the financial services industry for my entire career, more than 30 years now, holding prior executive roles in various capital markets businesses at Legg Mason Wood Walker, Stifel, Nicolaus, Dain Bosworth and Piper Jaffray. I rejoined Legg Mason in the fall of 2008 as Chief Administrative Officer, and after leading the organizational restructuring that we announced in May 2010, have overseen the company's Global Distribution efforts for the past 21 months.
I've been the interim CEO of Legg Mason for about 1 month now. Our Non-executive Chairman, Alan Reed, and I, have agreed that we must continue the momentum of our turnaround, even as the CEO search process takes place.
We must capitalize on the strengths of Legg Mason's diversified multi-manager model and build on the substantial progress that we've made with regards to expense reduction, balance sheet improvement and positioning the company for top line growth.
And while I am intimately familiar with the company, I am also willing to challenge the status quo, an approach that I think will be critical as we take a fresh look at our strategy during this interim period. So with that, let's move onto our results for the quarter.
As we announced this morning, Legg Mason reported fiscal second quarter net income of $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. This does represent an improvement in earnings, though our flow story remains mixed. And Pete will provide more color on these results in just a few minutes.
In addition, we repurchased $90 million, or 3.6 million shares in the quarter, representing over 2.5% of our outstanding shares. Following that repurchase, we now have 132 million shares outstanding.
Our AUM by affiliate and in the order of their contribution to this quarter's earnings is shown on Slide 4. Let's begin with Western Asset, with $459 billion in AUM, up 3% from last quarter. AUM results were driven by both improving markets and overall inflows. While long-term outflows were $4.4 billion in total, it's really important to understand the drivers of those flows. We experienced outflows in 3 low-fee mandates, including $1.7 billion related to the global sovereign mandate that we have highlighted for some time, as well as the total of $3.1 billion in liquidity-like accounts that we've previously referenced in our AUM releases.
And finally, the quarter also included a $750 million redemption related to the PPIP program. Western has successfully concluded its PPIP program in the current month, which will result in an additional redemption of $1.1 billion in the coming December quarter. As you can see, excluding those 3 low-fee outflows, and the PPIP redemption, long-term flows were positive for the quarter.
Western continues to see interest in specialized mandates globally, particularly in emerging markets, high-yield and local-currency-denominated mandates. Those specialized mandates continue to reflect higher fees than the mandates that terminated in the quarter.
In the quarter, we added retail share classes and other enhancements to the Western branded funds in the U.S. With the share class enhancements and the strength of the investment performance of those funds, we see a wonderful opportunity to more aggressively market those funds in the retail, institutional and retirement distribution channels.
We recently conducted a sales planning session for our U.S. distribution team with our Western colleagues that was highly productive. And our wholesalers are in the field, sourcing opportunities to both attract new cash from the sidelines and take market share from well-known fixed income competitors in the retail-oriented channels.
The pipeline and RFP activity for Western remains solid, reflecting their continued strong investment performance and strengthening consultant recommendations. Won but not yet funded mandates at quarter end were $1.8 billion, over half of which are in higher-fee, specialized mandates.
And finally, Western raised over $300 million in a secondary offering for Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation, a REIT focused on agency MBS, which brings the total fund AUM in the REIT to $500 million. Though this raise was announced in the September quarter, the funding occurred in early October and will appear in our October AUM.
Now, let's move onto Royce, with $36 billion in AUM. Assets were up slightly in the quarter due to market appreciation, partially offset by increased outflows. These outflows largely reflect the industry trends in active small cap equities, a  sector that has been under pressure recently. As is always the case, Royce is actively engaged with their clients and distribution partners amidst these sector headwinds. Recent market trends are broadly emphasizing mega caps and defensive stocks within the small cap sector. And while Royce's 1 and 3-year numbers are challenged, the company's performance for the quarter strengthened. Royce has managed through many challenging cycles over their 35-year history, and they remain vigilant to be well positioned for long-term opportunities in the sector.
Next, ClearBridge, at $59 billion in AUM, is up 5%, driven by market performance. It is important to point out that outflows at ClearBridge have moderated significantly, and September marked their second best quarter in terms of flows, since our acquisition of them in 2005. Only last quarter, which included the third ClearBridge Energy MLP  closed-end fund, was a better quarter.
ClearBridge continues to make real progress, with a sharpened focus on 3 competitive strategies: income solutions, concentrated portfolios and low volatility. The company ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in unfunded wins and has a meaningful increase in search activity in their institutional business.
And finally, ClearBridge also announced the promotion of Scott Glasser, the co-CIO with Hersh Cohen. Scott and Hersh were partners on the 4-star Appreciation strategy for 15 years. Scott has been an important mentor to many of the firm's portfolio managers, playing a key role in building the future generation of the investment team at ClearBridge.
Next, Permal, with $17 billion of AUM, has seen outflows in the global high net worth sector, partially offset by institutional wins. Permal continues to enjoy a valuable leadership position in the fund of hedge funds space. We see continued opportunities there and in alternatives more broadly, as the industry trends towards consolidation, customization and convergence, all of which should benefit Permal over time. Permal is one of the larger managers in their space and already has a robust managed account platform capable of customization. Longer term, we are working with Permal to create products that offer clients exposure to alternatives more broadly. 
Permal ended the quarter with $300 million in won but not yet funded mandates in the institutional sector. As the global intermediated high net worth sector continues to be soft across the industry, Permal has seen its business mix shift towards both institution and sovereign wealth funds. 
In the U.S., both institutional and retail channels offer meaningful opportunity. And Permal is also building a pipeline of business for European and Japanese institutions and will soon open an office in Shanghai, China. 
Next, we see Brandywine ending the quarter with $41 billion in AUM, driven by improving markets as well as net positive flows for the quarter. Brandywine is emerging as a formidable manager whose top-down strategies in fixed income are complementary to our overall mix. Strong performance in fixed income funds drove positive flows in both the institutional channel and the U.S. retail, as well as cross-border funds. Brandywine has over $400 million in unfunded wins, including several with potential additional upside over the next 12 months.
And finally, Batterymarch, at $14.6 billion in AUM, is down from last quarter. Long-only active managers continue to be under pressure from a flow perspective. Batterymarch has experienced a handful of meaningful institutional redemptions during the quarter, a trend that has carried over into October. Looking forward, interest in Batterymarch's managed volatility capabilities remains robust, with a number of significant opportunities on the horizon.
So let's talk a little bit about investment performance, as shown on Slide 5. We are quite pleased that overall investment performance remains strong amid volatile equity markets. For the critical 3-year period, 83% of strategy assets beat benchmarks, while more than 79% of strategy assets beat benchmarks over all relevant periods.
Let's move on now to look at our Global Distribution platform. Slide 6 shows that our global retail distribution platform services $224 billion in long-term AUM, sourced from retail and quasi-institutional clients in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia.  
Retail assets are very attractive from both a margin and a persistent fee standpoint. Today, we have a broad suite of products across equity, fixed income and alternatives, and among all of our affiliates.
Continued strong investment performance and emphasis on new product development and continued improvement in productivity and market share will be important drivers of our growth in the retail space. Globally, our distribution platform has been in net inflows for 8 of the past 11 quarters. As you can see in the upper right of this chart, we enjoyed the second best quarter for flows over the past 11 quarters, even without the benefit of a closed-end fund or other special product launch. Our international team was again a key contributor to our overall positive flows, with over $2 billion of net inflow. These international results were led by our Japan team, with strong inflows into Australian bond and equity income products, as well as emerging market debt.
The U.S. team had a solid second quarter, with nearly breakeven flows. Inflows were led by municipal products, Brandywine's global bond fund, and several of Western's taxable products, including Core Plus, high income and total-return funds. 
In the U.S., we won approximately $1 billion during the quarter in new mandates, specifically into Western products across our sub-advisory/DCIO and wealth management channels. These results follow on the heels of the best net flows in U.S. distribution in over 5 years that we had last quarter.
Looking forward, we are working with clients and our affiliate partners to develop a strong product pipeline in the income, specialized solutions and alternative sectors. Since 2008, we have launched new products, working with our affiliates, both in the U.S. and internationally, which today represent a total of $22 billion in AUM.
The lower left corner highlights the diversity of gross sales for first half of fiscal 2013. And as you can see, our sales are diversified across our affiliates and the geographies where we have an established presence.
In the bottom right corner, we show gross sales versus persistency rates, which speaks to the expected longevity of client assets within our retail platform.
We have seen our gross sales trend higher in recent quarters while simultaneously maintaining strong levels of asset retention, which is exactly the kind of progress we expect to continue.
And now I will turn it over to Pete to review this quarter's financial results. Pete?"
180481,222936256,371930,"Legg Mason Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2012",2012-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. As Joe noted, we generated GAAP earnings of $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. This quarter, our GAAP EPS benefited from an $18 million U.K. tax adjustment, as well as the",1403,"Thanks, Joe. As Joe noted, we generated GAAP earnings of $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. This quarter, our GAAP EPS benefited from an $18 million U.K. tax adjustment, as well as the positive impacts from the capital plan we launched in the June quarter, which resulted in reduced GAAP interest expense and lowered our share count. 
Our lower share count reflects both our repurchase activity in the prior quarter, where we finalized repurchases under our May 2010 board authorization, and this quarter's repurchases under the new $1 billion authorization. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to review the financial highlights for the quarter. Net income was $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. Adjusted income, which, again, excludes the U.K. tax benefit, was $100 million for the quarter, or $0.75 per diluted share, with the increase from last quarter's $88.6 million level resulting from the fund launch costs, which reduced last quarter's results.
Operating revenues were up 1.5% over the prior quarter due to higher advisory fees from 1 additional day in the quarter, an increase in average AUM and a modest increase in performance fees. This quarter's performance fees were largely driven by Western, Brandywine and Permal.
While impossible to predict with precision, we anticipate next quarter's performance fees to be in the mid-$40 million range. This will be largely driven by a one-time fee, as well as some seasonal and calendar year-end fees. Operating expenses increased 1%, reflecting higher mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and seed investments, which increased comp expense but are offset in other non-operating income and expenses. These in turn were partly offset by lower distribution and servicing expenses, and I'll provide a little more color on operating expenses later. 
Moving onto Slide 8. The only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 17% on a GAAP basis, reflecting the U.K. tax adjustment of $18 million in the quarter. The tax outlook for the next quarter is for a return to our normalized effective rate of 34% to 36%. 
Slide 9 is a roll forward from fiscal Q1's loss of $0.07 per share to this quarter's earnings per share of $0.60. The fiscal Q1 items, totaling $0.46, include debt extinguishment cost, fund launch costs and mark-to-market losses on seed investments.
The key items this quarter include a $0.02 increase from operations, $0.13 related to the U.K. tax adjustment and $0.02 related to mark-to-market gains on seed investments. The final contributor is a $0.04 benefit resulting from the new capital plan, reflecting both lower GAAP interest expense and reduced average shares outstanding.
Turning to Slide 10, our assets under management increased 3%, driven by market appreciation of nearly $21 billion. Given the majority of the market pickup came late in the quarter, our average AUM is up only $4 billion from the June quarter. But if markets hold, this bodes well for the December quarter. This quarter's AUM also included a disposition of $2 billion, reflecting the last of the liquidity AUM to be transferred to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.
Long-term flows on Slide 11 deteriorated from the prior quarter due in part to a pickup in equity outflows, consistent with an industry-wide acceleration in U.S. active equity outflows. Fixed income flows went from slight inflows last quarter to outflows this quarter. This was largely due to a $3.1 billion in liquidity-like low-fee accounts that we called out in our July and August AUM releases, as well as $1.7 billion in ongoing redemptions related to the low fee, global sovereign mandate. In addition, there was a $750 million redemption related to Western Asset's PPIP program. We will see an additional $1.1 billion redemption in fiscal Q3 following the successful completion of the PPIP program. We are also anticipating several large redemptions in October in equity AUM totaling about $2 billion. 
Finally, we highlighted on this slide that we had fixed income fund inflows of $1.7 billion. This marks the 13th straight quarter of fixed income fund inflows, and September was the second best quarter for those inflows from the last 2 years.
Slide 12 shows the advisory fee trend with this quarter's rate basically in line with the June quarter. 
Operating expenses on Slide 13 increased 1%, largely due to higher comp expenses, which I will detail in a moment. You can see that a number of the other expense categories declined relative to the last quarter, including distribution and servicing expenses, which were down $25 million, principally due to $23 million in fund launch costs last quarter. Communications and technology expense declined $1.8 million, reflecting renegotiated vendor contracts and lower consulting expenses. Occupancy expense declined $3 million due to a reduction in lease reserves related to office space held for sub lease. And finally, other expenses increased $3 million from fiscal Q1 due to annual director fees and higher affiliate-related legal fees, both partially offset by lower T&E expenses.
Turning to Slide 14. Total comp and benefits increased 12%, primarily due to 3 items: first, higher mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed investments, with a related offset in non-operating income; second, net revenue increases, resulting in upticks in our affiliates compensation pools; and finally, due to management transition costs. As you can see, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio, excluding the mark-to-market on deferred comp and the management transition cost, was 55%, which is at the high end of our 54% to 55% guidance. This compares with 58% last quarter, which was impacted by fund launch costs. 
Management transition costs reflect the CEO transition and separation agreement and related executive retention awards, which will vest in 18 months, although the expense will be taken ratably over this period.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which increased to 21.2%, up from last quarter's 16.9%. Recall that last quarter's expenses included the impact of the 2 fund launches. These combined to reduce last quarter's adjusted operating margin by 4%. 
On Slide 16, our cash taxes are under 10%, compared to a significantly higher GAAP tax rate, as this slide highlights. This low cash tax rate allows for both additional investment in the business and return of capital to shareholders. This is an area we will continue to highlight as we believe it is important for investors to fully appreciate the significantly lower level of cash taxes we pay. Specifically, this lower level of cash taxes results from our NOL carryforward and our ability to amortize our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for tax purposes. When you translate our effective tax rate into dollars, on the right side of the schedule, you see that over time, we will realize a positive cash impact of $1.5 billion.
I will wrap up on Slide 17, which reflects the key highlights of our new capital plan, which we executed in the first fiscal quarter. In the upper left side corner, you will note that we ended the quarter with a cash balance of nearly $900 million, up from $800 million last quarter. We must remember, our first quarter is typically our annual low point due to our fiscal year bonus payments in May.
In the upper right, we've summarized our share repurchases over the last several years. In conjunction with last quarter's capital plan, we announced a new $1 billion board stock repurchase authorization. And in the second fiscal quarter, we repurchased $90 million of stock or 3.6 million shares under that new authorization.
You should note, these share repurchases began mid-quarter, so they are not fully reflected in our average diluted share count. Thus, the average shares will be 2.1 million lower at the end of December before any additional share repurchases this quarter.
The bottom left provides a comparison of the new debt maturity schedule versus our prior debt structure. The benefits from our debt restructuring include delevering the balance sheet, laddering out our debt maturities, diversifying our sources of debt capital from both new banks and bond investors, and locking in rates in this historically low environment. Additionally, we reduced our GAAP interest expense by $36 million annually. Overall, these transactions greatly enhance our financial flexibility, in addition to the positive impact on our financial results, which you can see in our fiscal second quarter.
Thanks for your time and attention, and now I'll turn it back to Joe."

As for the CEO search process, it is wel",778,"Thanks, Pete. Before I close, I'd also like to speak to 2 questions that I'm sure are on the minds of many listening in today: the search for our permanent CEO and the status of our standstill agreement with Trian. As for the CEO search process, it is well underway. You may have read that the search committee of the board has hired Korn/Ferry, and they have already completed preliminary qualifications interviews with key constituencies, including board members, various of our affiliate CEOs, and members of the Executive team. There is no stated timeframe for completion of the search, but realistically, it could take several months. 
And now let me update you as to the status of our standstill agreement with Trian. When Nelson Peltz, the CEO and founding partner of Trian, joined our board 3 years ago, we knew very little about his intentions with respect to the sizable investment that Trian had made in Legg Mason. Therefore, we negotiated a standstill agreement in an effort to set expectations for both Legg Mason and Trian. Now, with 3 years of experience working with him, we found Nelson to be a constructive member of the board and we're comfortable working with him and the team at Trian. The standstill is set to expire on November 15. If there is an update, we'll let you know, but our goal is to continue to work with all members of our board to drive shareholder value. 
And finally, let me return to that on which I am most focused. I want to be clear that Legg Mason has a solid foundation, significant strengths that I think we sometimes under-appreciate. And we need to continue to build upon those strengths. We have a set of distinct, highly-performing investment affiliates, diversified by asset class in U.S. equities, global fixed income and alternatives.
As a truly global firm, we are also well diversified, with nearly 40% of our assets under management generated by non-U.S. clients. We enjoy broad client and channel diversification across both global retail distribution and our affiliate businesses, with the institutional retail client mix running at approximately 70-30. We continue to have strong investment performance, with over 79% of marketed strategies beating benchmarks over all relevant periods. 
Many of our affiliates have made truly remarkable improvements in their investment performance since the depths of the crisis.
We have a strong and flexible balance sheet and a robust cash position while we returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the last few years. And with our new capital plan implemented, we will balance investing in our core business and returning capital to shareholders appropriately. The key for us now is to stay focused and build on the momentum in areas where we are making progress while proactively addressing the issues and areas where we face challenges. 
So let me conclude by spending just a few minutes on where we must focus our attention. First and foremost, we need to grow, both institutionally and in retail. And that means not just flowing the outflows, but turning them into consistent inflows. In retail, we will continue to evolve our sales model to capture the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, both in the U.S. and international. Our goal there is to expand our client penetration to improve our sales productivity and increase persistency in asset retention.
Our investment performance warrants more consistent institutional inflows. Our affiliate partners have made progress, and we will do all that we can to support their efforts in growing our institutional business.
We are working on existing products that are underperforming or are subscale, and we are engaged with affiliates that for a variety of reasons may be challenged.
Longer term, we will ensure that the have the right mix of products and investment strategies across geographies, asset classes and distribution channels. With a focus on improving our operating margin, we will continue to review our streamlined operating model and build upon the progress we've already made. We will continually look for opportunities to develop a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness across all business functions. Quite frankly, in an increasingly competitive environment, operating efficiency is an imperative.
So I recognize that the status quo is not an option. We are reviewing and evaluating our current business strategy with our affiliate leadership and our board, and we are prepared to modify it as appropriate. Quite simply, we are focused on additional opportunities to grow revenues, to expand margins, and to improve earnings leverage across the organization, all with the intent of increasing long-term shareholder value. 
And with that, let me open it up to your questions."

And so if we're going to be -- if we're going to be relevant and competitive in the marketplace, we have to keep an eye on our cost structure and operating efficiencies. One of the things that I did recently in a Townhall, as we were talking about the transition, was I received a question basically asking, ""So we'll keep our heads down. We'll keep focused. It's business as usual."" And I said no, it's got to be business better than usual. And that means both on the distribution side and raising assets and increasing our growth, but also to all of our business leaders on looking at how they do their business, how they run their various operating units and looking for ways to be better than usual. So we're going to be -- it's got to be part of our DNA and part of our corporate culture that we constantly evolve and review our cost structure and look for opportunities to be more efficient. So I don't have anything for you today in terms of specifics, but I have challenged the organization everywhere to continue to look for additional efficiencies."

But I don't think we have to choose between margins or growth. I don't think we can. It is a balance all the time, obviously, and there are times when we need to make investments that could modestly impact our margins. But again, our margins have not been acceptable, and I get that. We all get that. And that's really why we have this kind of increased focus on opportunities for efficiency. We've got -- and by the way, even if we're growing and when we get back to growing and when we get back to doing  better from a financial performance, we still need to be diligent and focused on efficiency. So we make sure that we continue to push on our margins. But we also have to grow. And I think Pete mentioned earlier, we have a leveragable model. And so once we get into growth, and Pete can talk about that a little bit, if he wants, we do have the opportunity from margin expansion. I think as to your other question about sort of selling or shuttering affiliates, what I would say is, at various times, some of our affiliates are struggling for a variety of reasons more than others. And over time, we have worked with them, in some cases supporting them. In other cases, we have divested, where it's made sense, if an affiliate's been challenged from a scale perspective or whatever. In some cases, we've divested some of the smaller managers over the last year or 2. We don't make a lot of big fanfare about it and trumpet it broadly. But if it makes sense from a strategic standpoint for us and for the affiliate, we've done that. In other cases, we have merged affiliates, so with that a couple of years ago with one of our affiliates, Global Currents, into ClearBridge. And so these are things that we have done in the past and we're going to be open to doing in the future. As it relates to sort of our core affiliates, we feel good about our core affiliates being in the spaces that we need to be in, whether it be in equities, whether it be in global fixed, whether it be in alternatives. We do have gaps, and that's where we need to focus on filling those gaps. We need to make sure that we're getting the kind of flows and sales for the core affiliates that are performing well, and then we need to look to add in the spaces where we don't. Pete, do you want to say anything about margins or the leveragability of the model?"

We've put a lot more people in the field. If you remember, we did a reorganization within distribution about just over a year ago, where we eliminated some layers of management and we really repurposed those dollars to more feet on the street. We increased the number of people in client-facing positions by almost 50%. And so we're starting to see the benefits of that. We also introduced a different delivery model, something we call the cross-channel sales, which is really not a hybrid sales structure. People like to call it a hybrid sales structure, but it's really an enhanced structure that's a little bit more between a hybrid and your traditional external sales. And so we're getting some leverage out of that. So I think there's just -- the team has settled. We've put more feet on the street, and we're getting -- realizing the benefits of it.

And then what else do we need to add? I think it's clear. We've been talking about it. I kind of hate to talk about the notion of acquisitions and all that because we've talked about it and haven't really done it. But the reality is, and we've talked with the board about this even this week, that we have gaps. Where we have gaps that our existing affiliates can fill in terms of introducing new products and new strategies, we'll do that. But where we don't have the capabilities, we need to add those. And so we clearly have a gap in international and global equity, and we need to fill that, and likely we need to fill it through acquisition.

If you look at what Western has done over the last few years in really evolving their business to more of the specialized mandate, I mean that's consistent, I think, with this barbel approach that you suggest. So we have at Western, at other of our affiliates, Brandywine, and I would say even ClearBridge to a certain extent, all of our affiliates are evolving, and that's one of the things that I think is most comforting or most -- that I feel best about is that our affiliates have not stood still. They have evolved their model to where the business is going. That said, there are gaps that we just can't fill without an acquisition, so we have to do both."

Given that, and in the face of obviously 3 -- I would say 3 of your 6 core affiliates are struggling in their equity managers, and right now you are getting a tailwind with the stock market, it almost seems like the money would be better spent hoarding and trying to identify an opportunity to improve the flows, which I think is -- I think that the long-term key to this turnaround is you guys improving the flows and having the cash ready to roll and even if it's a big acquisition.

Maybe I'll take the first part of that, which is kind of the cash we have on the balance sheet and our cash projections going forward. And then Sully can weigh in, in terms of how we think about deploying that from a business standpoint. But keep in mind, you'll see in the Q that we've -- our balance sheet cash has gotten back up to $900 million. That's despite buying back $90 million of stock over the last quarter. And as we talk about often, our cash low point is June -- second quarter every year because that's when we pay bonuses. So we'll ramp up from the $900 million going forward, assuming the market stay roughly in line with our recent trajectory. So we've got $550 million of excess cash on the balance sheet. We think of that, we need $350 million to kind of run the business, regulatory capital, et cetera. So $550 million cash on the balance sheet, and then EBITDA that's approaching $600 million. We're generating a lot more cash on a go-forward basis. So we think we've got plenty of resources to be able to both invest with our affiliates across the various kind of growth options that are day-to-day. And then acquisitions, as we've said, if there was a real good acquisition opportunity on the horizon, then we might slow down the buyback. But I think, bottom line is we can do both here. So, Joe."

I do appreciate your interest in Legg Mason and in taking time this morning to participate in our fiscal 2013 second quarter earnings call. I am very pleased to be serving Legg Mason and our investors as interim CEO, and I want to tell you upfront what I'm committed to: demonstrating continued and substantial progress on our turnaround that has been underway for some time, building upon our many competitive strengths, and applying the lessons that we've learned over the past few years, while at the same time, being open to new and fresh ideas that target growth. I recognize that real challenges remain. However, I also want to convey very clearly that we are moving in the right direction. 
Now before we get into our results for our quarter, I thought I'd take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about my background for those of you who don't know me, and especially about my approach as CEO during this interim period.
I've been in the financial services industry for my entire career, more than 30 years now, holding prior executive roles in various capital markets businesses at Legg Mason Wood Walker, Stifel, Nicolaus, Dain Bosworth and Piper Jaffray. I rejoined Legg Mason in the fall of 2008 as Chief Administrative Officer, and after leading the organizational restructuring that we announced in May 2010, have overseen the company's Global Distribution efforts for the past 21 months.
I've been the interim CEO of Legg Mason for about 1 month now. Our Non-executive Chairman, Alan Reed, and I, have agreed that we must continue the momentum of our turnaround, even as the CEO search process takes place.
We must capitalize on the strengths of Legg Mason's diversified multi-manager model and build on the substantial progress that we've made with regards to expense reduction, balance sheet improvement and positioning the company for top line growth.
And while I am intimately familiar with the company, I am also willing to challenge the status quo, an approach that I think will be critical as we take a fresh look at our strategy during this interim period. So with that, let's move onto our results for the quarter.
As we announced this morning, Legg Mason reported fiscal second quarter net income of $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. This does represent an improvement in earnings, though our flow story remains mixed. And Pete will provide more color on these results in just a few minutes.
In addition, we repurchased $90 million, or 3.6 million shares in the quarter, representing over 2.5% of our outstanding shares. Following that repurchase, we now have 132 million shares outstanding.
Our AUM by affiliate and in the order of their contribution to this quarter's earnings is shown on Slide 4. Let's begin with Western Asset, with $459 billion in AUM, up 3% from last quarter. AUM results were driven by both improving markets and overall inflows. While long-term outflows were $4.4 billion in total, it's really important to understand the drivers of those flows. We experienced outflows in 3 low-fee mandates, including $1.7 billion related to the global sovereign mandate that we have highlighted for some time, as well as the total of $3.1 billion in liquidity-like accounts that we've previously referenced in our AUM releases.
And finally, the quarter also included a $750 million redemption related to the PPIP program. Western has successfully concluded its PPIP program in the current month, which will result in an additional redemption of $1.1 billion in the coming December quarter. As you can see, excluding those 3 low-fee outflows, and the PPIP redemption, long-term flows were positive for the quarter.
Western continues to see interest in specialized mandates globally, particularly in emerging markets, high-yield and local-currency-denominated mandates. Those specialized mandates continue to reflect higher fees than the mandates that terminated in the quarter.
In the quarter, we added retail share classes and other enhancements to the Western branded funds in the U.S. With the share class enhancements and the strength of the investment performance of those funds, we see a wonderful opportunity to more aggressively market those funds in the retail, institutional and retirement distribution channels.
We recently conducted a sales planning session for our U.S. distribution team with our Western colleagues that was highly productive. And our wholesalers are in the field, sourcing opportunities to both attract new cash from the sidelines and take market share from well-known fixed income competitors in the retail-oriented channels.
The pipeline and RFP activity for Western remains solid, reflecting their continued strong investment performance and strengthening consultant recommendations. Won but not yet funded mandates at quarter end were $1.8 billion, over half of which are in higher-fee, specialized mandates.
And finally, Western raised over $300 million in a secondary offering for Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation, a REIT focused on agency MBS, which brings the total fund AUM in the REIT to $500 million. Though this raise was announced in the September quarter, the funding occurred in early October and will appear in our October AUM.
Now, let's move onto Royce, with $36 billion in AUM. Assets were up slightly in the quarter due to market appreciation, partially offset by increased outflows. These outflows largely reflect the industry trends in active small cap equities, a  sector that has been under pressure recently. As is always the case, Royce is actively engaged with their clients and distribution partners amidst these sector headwinds. Recent market trends are broadly emphasizing mega caps and defensive stocks within the small cap sector. And while Royce's 1 and 3-year numbers are challenged, the company's performance for the quarter strengthened. Royce has managed through many challenging cycles over their 35-year history, and they remain vigilant to be well positioned for long-term opportunities in the sector.
Next, ClearBridge, at $59 billion in AUM, is up 5%, driven by market performance. It is important to point out that outflows at ClearBridge have moderated significantly, and September marked their second best quarter in terms of flows, since our acquisition of them in 2005. Only last quarter, which included the third ClearBridge Energy MLP  closed-end fund, was a better quarter.
ClearBridge continues to make real progress, with a sharpened focus on 3 competitive strategies: income solutions, concentrated portfolios and low volatility. The company ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in unfunded wins and has a meaningful increase in search activity in their institutional business.
And finally, ClearBridge also announced the promotion of Scott Glasser, the co-CIO with Hersh Cohen. Scott and Hersh were partners on the 4-star Appreciation strategy for 15 years. Scott has been an important mentor to many of the firm's portfolio managers, playing a key role in building the future generation of the investment team at ClearBridge.
Next, Permal, with $17 billion of AUM, has seen outflows in the global high net worth sector, partially offset by institutional wins. Permal continues to enjoy a valuable leadership position in the fund of hedge funds space. We see continued opportunities there and in alternatives more broadly, as the industry trends towards consolidation, customization and convergence, all of which should benefit Permal over time. Permal is one of the larger managers in their space and already has a robust managed account platform capable of customization. Longer term, we are working with Permal to create products that offer clients exposure to alternatives more broadly. 
Permal ended the quarter with $300 million in won but not yet funded mandates in the institutional sector. As the global intermediated high net worth sector continues to be soft across the industry, Permal has seen its business mix shift towards both institution and sovereign wealth funds. 
In the U.S., both institutional and retail channels offer meaningful opportunity. And Permal is also building a pipeline of business for European and Japanese institutions and will soon open an office in Shanghai, China. 
Next, we see Brandywine ending the quarter with $41 billion in AUM, driven by improving markets as well as net positive flows for the quarter. Brandywine is emerging as a formidable manager whose top-down strategies in fixed income are complementary to our overall mix. Strong performance in fixed income funds drove positive flows in both the institutional channel and the U.S. retail, as well as cross-border funds. Brandywine has over $400 million in unfunded wins, including several with potential additional upside over the next 12 months.
And finally, Batterymarch, at $14.6 billion in AUM, is down from last quarter. Long-only active managers continue to be under pressure from a flow perspective. Batterymarch has experienced a handful of meaningful institutional redemptions during the quarter, a trend that has carried over into October. Looking forward, interest in Batterymarch's managed volatility capabilities remains robust, with a number of significant opportunities on the horizon.
So let's talk a little bit about investment performance, as shown on Slide 5. We are quite pleased that overall investment performance remains strong amid volatile equity markets. For the critical 3-year period, 83% of strategy assets beat benchmarks, while more than 79% of strategy assets beat benchmarks over all relevant periods.
Let's move on now to look at our Global Distribution platform. Slide 6 shows that our global retail distribution platform services $224 billion in long-term AUM, sourced from retail and quasi-institutional clients in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia.  
Retail assets are very attractive from both a margin and a persistent fee standpoint. Today, we have a broad suite of products across equity, fixed income and alternatives, and among all of our affiliates.
Continued strong investment performance and emphasis on new product development and continued improvement in productivity and market share will be important drivers of our growth in the retail space. Globally, our distribution platform has been in net inflows for 8 of the past 11 quarters. As you can see in the upper right of this chart, we enjoyed the second best quarter for flows over the past 11 quarters, even without the benefit of a closed-end fund or other special product launch. Our international team was again a key contributor to our overall positive flows, with over $2 billion of net inflow. These international results were led by our Japan team, with strong inflows into Australian bond and equity income products, as well as emerging market debt.
The U.S. team had a solid second quarter, with nearly breakeven flows. Inflows were led by municipal products, Brandywine's global bond fund, and several of Western's taxable products, including Core Plus, high income and total-return funds. 
In the U.S., we won approximately $1 billion during the quarter in new mandates, specifically into Western products across our sub-advisory/DCIO and wealth management channels. These results follow on the heels of the best net flows in U.S. distribution in over 5 years that we had last quarter.
Looking forward, we are working with clients and our affiliate partners to develop a strong product pipeline in the income, specialized solutions and alternative sectors. Since 2008, we have launched new products, working with our affiliates, both in the U.S. and internationally, which today represent a total of $22 billion in AUM.
The lower left corner highlights the diversity of gross sales for first half of fiscal 2013. And as you can see, our sales are diversified across our affiliates and the geographies where we have an established presence.
In the bottom right corner, we show gross sales versus persistency rates, which speaks to the expected longevity of client assets within our retail platform.
We have seen our gross sales trend higher in recent quarters while simultaneously maintaining strong levels of asset retention, which is exactly the kind of progress we expect to continue.
And now I will turn it over to Pete to review this quarter's financial results. Pete?"
180481,222936256,372949,"Legg Mason Inc., Q2 2013 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2012",2012-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Legg Mason, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe. As Joe noted, we generated GAAP earnings of $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. This quarter, our GAAP EPS benefited from an $18 million U.K. tax adjustment, as well as the",1403,"Thanks, Joe. As Joe noted, we generated GAAP earnings of $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and adjusted income of $100 million, or $0.75 per diluted share. This quarter, our GAAP EPS benefited from an $18 million U.K. tax adjustment, as well as the positive impacts from the capital plan we launched in the June quarter, which resulted in reduced GAAP interest expense and lowered our share count. 
Our lower share count reflects both our repurchase activity in the prior quarter, where we finalized repurchases under our May 2010 board authorization, and this quarter's repurchases under the new $1 billion authorization. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to review the financial highlights for the quarter. Net income was $81 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. Adjusted income, which, again, excludes the U.K. tax benefit, was $100 million for the quarter, or $0.75 per diluted share, with the increase from last quarter's $88.6 million level resulting from the fund launch costs, which reduced last quarter's results.
Operating revenues were up 1.5% over the prior quarter due to higher advisory fees from 1 additional day in the quarter, an increase in average AUM and a modest increase in performance fees. This quarter's performance fees were largely driven by Western, Brandywine and Permal.
While impossible to predict with precision, we anticipate next quarter's performance fees to be in the mid-$40 million range. This will be largely driven by a one-time fee, as well as some seasonal and calendar year-end fees. Operating expenses increased 1%, reflecting higher mark-to-market gains on deferred comp and seed investments, which increased comp expense but are offset in other non-operating income and expenses. These in turn were partly offset by lower distribution and servicing expenses, and I'll provide a little more color on operating expenses later. 
Moving onto Slide 8. The only other item to highlight here is our effective income tax rate, which was 17% on a GAAP basis, reflecting the U.K. tax adjustment of $18 million in the quarter. The tax outlook for the next quarter is for a return to our normalized effective rate of 34% to 36%. 
Slide 9 is a roll forward from fiscal Q1's loss of $0.07 per share to this quarter's earnings per share of $0.60. The fiscal Q1 items, totaling $0.46, include debt extinguishment cost, fund launch costs and mark-to-market losses on seed investments.
The key items this quarter include a $0.02 increase from operations, $0.13 related to the U.K. tax adjustment and $0.02 related to mark-to-market gains on seed investments. The final contributor is a $0.04 benefit resulting from the new capital plan, reflecting both lower GAAP interest expense and reduced average shares outstanding.
Turning to Slide 10, our assets under management increased 3%, driven by market appreciation of nearly $21 billion. Given the majority of the market pickup came late in the quarter, our average AUM is up only $4 billion from the June quarter. But if markets hold, this bodes well for the December quarter. This quarter's AUM also included a disposition of $2 billion, reflecting the last of the liquidity AUM to be transferred to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.
Long-term flows on Slide 11 deteriorated from the prior quarter due in part to a pickup in equity outflows, consistent with an industry-wide acceleration in U.S. active equity outflows. Fixed income flows went from slight inflows last quarter to outflows this quarter. This was largely due to a $3.1 billion in liquidity-like low-fee accounts that we called out in our July and August AUM releases, as well as $1.7 billion in ongoing redemptions related to the low fee, global sovereign mandate. In addition, there was a $750 million redemption related to Western Asset's PPIP program. We will see an additional $1.1 billion redemption in fiscal Q3 following the successful completion of the PPIP program. We are also anticipating several large redemptions in October in equity AUM totaling about $2 billion. 
Finally, we highlighted on this slide that we had fixed income fund inflows of $1.7 billion. This marks the 13th straight quarter of fixed income fund inflows, and September was the second best quarter for those inflows from the last 2 years.
Slide 12 shows the advisory fee trend with this quarter's rate basically in line with the June quarter. 
Operating expenses on Slide 13 increased 1%, largely due to higher comp expenses, which I will detail in a moment. You can see that a number of the other expense categories declined relative to the last quarter, including distribution and servicing expenses, which were down $25 million, principally due to $23 million in fund launch costs last quarter. Communications and technology expense declined $1.8 million, reflecting renegotiated vendor contracts and lower consulting expenses. Occupancy expense declined $3 million due to a reduction in lease reserves related to office space held for sub lease. And finally, other expenses increased $3 million from fiscal Q1 due to annual director fees and higher affiliate-related legal fees, both partially offset by lower T&E expenses.
Turning to Slide 14. Total comp and benefits increased 12%, primarily due to 3 items: first, higher mark-to-market on deferred comp and seed investments, with a related offset in non-operating income; second, net revenue increases, resulting in upticks in our affiliates compensation pools; and finally, due to management transition costs. As you can see, the comp and benefit to net revenue ratio, excluding the mark-to-market on deferred comp and the management transition cost, was 55%, which is at the high end of our 54% to 55% guidance. This compares with 58% last quarter, which was impacted by fund launch costs. 
Management transition costs reflect the CEO transition and separation agreement and related executive retention awards, which will vest in 18 months, although the expense will be taken ratably over this period.
Slide 15 highlights the operating margin as adjusted, which increased to 21.2%, up from last quarter's 16.9%. Recall that last quarter's expenses included the impact of the 2 fund launches. These combined to reduce last quarter's adjusted operating margin by 4%. 
On Slide 16, our cash taxes are under 10%, compared to a significantly higher GAAP tax rate, as this slide highlights. This low cash tax rate allows for both additional investment in the business and return of capital to shareholders. This is an area we will continue to highlight as we believe it is important for investors to fully appreciate the significantly lower level of cash taxes we pay. Specifically, this lower level of cash taxes results from our NOL carryforward and our ability to amortize our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for tax purposes. When you translate our effective tax rate into dollars, on the right side of the schedule, you see that over time, we will realize a positive cash impact of $1.5 billion.
I will wrap up on Slide 17, which reflects the key highlights of our new capital plan, which we executed in the first fiscal quarter. In the upper left side corner, you will note that we ended the quarter with a cash balance of nearly $900 million, up from $800 million last quarter. We must remember, our first quarter is typically our annual low point due to our fiscal year bonus payments in May.
In the upper right, we've summarized our share repurchases over the last several years. In conjunction with last quarter's capital plan, we announced a new $1 billion board stock repurchase authorization. And in the second fiscal quarter, we repurchased $90 million of stock or 3.6 million shares under that new authorization.
You should note, these share repurchases began mid-quarter, so they are not fully reflected in our average diluted share count. Thus, the average shares will be 2.1 million lower at the end of December before any additional share repurchases this quarter.
The bottom left provides a comparison of the new debt maturity schedule versus our prior debt structure. The benefits from our debt restructuring include delevering the balance sheet, laddering out our debt maturities, diversifying our sources of debt capital from both new banks and bond investors, and locking in rates in this historically low environment. Additionally, we reduced our GAAP interest expense by $36 million annually. Overall, these transactions greatly enhance our financial flexibility, in addition to the positive impact on our financial results, which you can see in our fiscal second quarter.
Thanks for your time and attention, and now I'll turn it back to Joe."

Before I close, I'd also like to speak to 2 questions that I'm sure are on the minds of many listening in today: the search for our permanent CEO and the status of our standstill agreement with Trian. As for the CEO search process, it is well underway. You may have read that the search committee of the board has hired Korn/Ferry, and they have already completed preliminary qualifications interviews with key constituencies, including board members, various of our affiliate CEOs, and members of the Executive team. There is no stated timeframe for completion of the search, but realistically, it could take several months. 
And now let me update you as to the status of our standstill agreement with Trian. When Nelson Peltz, the CEO and founding partner of Trian, joined our board 3 years ago, we knew very little about his intentions with respect to the sizable investment that Trian had made in Legg Mason. Therefore, we negotiated a standstill agreement in an effort to set expectations for both Legg Mason and Trian. Now, with 3 years of experience working with him, we found Nelson to be a constructive member of the board and we're comfortable working with him and the team at Trian. The standstill is set to expire on November 15. If there is an update, we'll let you know, but our goal is to continue to work with all members of our board to drive shareholder value. 
And finally, let me return to that on which I am most focused. I want to be clear that Legg Mason has a solid foundation, significant strengths that I think we sometimes under-appreciate. And we need to continue to build upon those strengths. We have a set of distinct, highly-performing investment affiliates, diversified by asset class in U.S. equities, global fixed income and alternatives.
As a truly global firm, we are also well diversified, with nearly 40% of our assets under management generated by non-U.S. clients. We enjoy broad client and channel diversification across both global retail distribution and our affiliate businesses, with the institutional retail client mix running at approximately 70-30. We continue to have strong investment performance, with over 79% of marketed strategies beating benchmarks over all relevant periods. 
Many of our affiliates have made truly remarkable improvements in their investment performance since the depths of the crisis.
We have a strong and flexible balance sheet and a robust cash position while we returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the last few years. And with our new capital plan implemented, we will balance investing in our core business and returning capital to shareholders appropriately. The key for us now is to stay focused and build on the momentum in areas where we are making progress while proactively addressing the issues and areas where we face challenges. 
So let me conclude by spending just a few minutes on where we must focus our attention. First and foremost, we need to grow, both institutionally and in retail. And that means not just flowing the outflows, but turning them into consistent inflows. In retail, we will continue to evolve our sales model to capture the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, both in the U.S. and international. Our goal there is to expand our client penetration to improve our sales productivity and increase persistency in asset retention.
Our investment performance warrants more consistent institutional inflows. Our affiliate partners have made progress, and we will do all that we can to support their efforts in growing our institutional business.
We are working on existing products that are underperforming or are subscale, and we are engaged with affiliates that for a variety of reasons may be challenged.
Longer term, we will ensure that we have the right mix of products and investment strategies across geographies, asset classes and distribution channels. With a focus on improving our operating margin, we will continue to review our streamlined operating model and build upon the progress we've already made. We will continually look for opportunities to develop a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness across all business functions. Quite frankly, in an increasingly competitive environment, operating efficiency is an imperative.
So I recognize that the status quo is not an option. We are reviewing and evaluating our current business strategy with our affiliate leadership and our board, and we are prepared to modify it as appropriate. Quite simply, we are focused on additional opportunities to grow revenues, to expand margins, and to improve earnings leverage across the organization, all with the intent of increasing long-term shareholder value. 
And with that, let me open it up to your questions."

And so if we're going to be -- if we're going to be relevant and competitive in the marketplace, we have to keep an eye on our cost structure and operating efficiencies. One of the things that I did recently in a Townhall, as we were talking about the transition, was I received a question basically asking, ""So we'll keep our heads down. We'll keep focused. It's business as usual."" And I said no, it's got to be business better than usual. And that means both on the distribution side and raising assets and increasing our growth, but also to all of our business leaders on looking at how they do their business, how they run their various operating units and looking for ways to be better than usual. So we're going to be -- it's got to be part of our DNA and part of our corporate culture that we constantly evolve and review our cost structure and look for opportunities to be more efficient. So I don't have anything for you today in terms of specifics, but I have challenged the organization everywhere to continue to look for additional efficiencies."

But I don't think we have to choose between margins or growth. I don't think we can. It is a balance all the time, obviously, and there are times when we need to make investments that could modestly impact our margins. But again, our margins have not been acceptable, and I get that. We all get that. And that's really why we have this kind of increased focus on opportunities for efficiency. We've got -- and by the way, even if we're growing and when we get back to growing and when we get back to doing  better from a financial performance, we still need to be diligent and focused on efficiency. So we make sure that we continue to push on our margins. But we also have to grow. And I think Pete mentioned earlier, we have a leveragable model. And so once we get into growth, and Pete can talk about that a little bit, if he wants, we do have the opportunity from margin expansion. I think as to your other question about sort of selling or shuttering affiliates, what I would say is, at various times, some of our affiliates are struggling for a variety of reasons more than others. And over time, we have worked with them, in some cases supporting them. In other cases, we have divested, where it's made sense, if an affiliate's been challenged from a scale perspective or whatever. In some cases, we've divested some of the smaller managers over the last year or 2. We don't make a lot of big fanfare about it and trumpet it broadly. But if it makes sense from a strategic standpoint for us and for the affiliate, we've done that. In other cases, we have merged affiliates, so with that a couple of years ago with one of our affiliates, Global Currents, into ClearBridge. And so these are things that we have done in the past and we're going to be open to doing in the future. As it relates to sort of our core affiliates, we feel good about our core affiliates being in the spaces that we need to be in, whether it be in equities, whether it be in global fixed, whether it be in alternatives. We do have gaps, and that's where we need to focus on filling those gaps. We need to make sure that we're getting the kind of flows and sales for the core affiliates that are performing well, and then we need to look to add in the spaces where we don't.

So Bill, you're spot on to point out there's tension between the 2. However, we do think we can do both. And as Sully said, we're taking a really hard look constantly at the cost structure and seeing what we can do to free up dollars to invest for future growth."

We've put a lot more people in the field. If you remember, we did a reorganization within distribution about just over a year ago, where we eliminated some layers of management and we really repurposed those dollars to more feet on the street. We increased the number of people in client-facing positions by almost 50%. And so we're starting to see the benefits of that. We also introduced a different delivery model, something we call the cross-channel sales, which is really not a hybrid sales structure. People like to call it a hybrid sales structure, but it's really an enhanced structure that's a little bit more between a hybrid and your traditional external sales. And so we're getting some leverage out of that. So I think there's just -- the team has settled. We've put more feet on the street, and we're getting -- realizing the benefits of it. In the international side, we're continuing with new products, particularly in Japan, for example, where we've evolved our product lineup there and added to it in income products that are particularly -- we're having particular success with our Japanese office.

So we've got a lot of products. We've had enhancements with Western share class. We expect to grow our market share and our productivity with existing sales resources and our sales force. At the same time, we need to expand and increase our penetration. And I think to do that in some respects, we may need to look at increasing. And a lot of our competitors are. As you know, there are some that -- almost all of our major competitors are expanding their sales forces. I think one of the large competitors who recently did a combination referred to have -- putting an army out in the field. Well, if we're going to win, we're going to have to beat an army with an army. And so I don't want to suggest a huge ramp up in cost there, but I think we will have a bias towards increasing our sales people and our sales resources as opposed to the other way around."

So you're right, I have met on more than one occasion with all of our major affiliates. I think we all see this as an opportunity to come together and really focus on either affirming or modifying our strategy for growth. And our affiliate leadership needs to be a key part of that and will be a key part of that, and we'll do it in conjunction, obviously, with the board. And that is the major focus. Now some of it is what can we do with them in terms of supporting them and helping them and working better together with them and them having input on where we're taking this company going forward. And then what else do we need to add? I think it's clear. We've been talking about it. I kind of hate to talk about the notion of acquisitions and all that because we've talked about it and haven't really done it. But the reality is, and we've talked with the board about this even this week, that we have gaps. Where we have gaps that our existing affiliates can fill in terms of introducing new products and new strategies, we'll do that. But where we don't have the capabilities, we need to add those. And so we clearly have a gap in international and global equity, and we need to fill that, and likely we need to fill it through acquisition. So the key is working and partnering with our affiliates in really affirming, crafting, kind of modifying as necessary our strategy going forward, where we're all aligned and we're all on the same page."

If you look at what Western has done over the last few years in really evolving their business to more of the specialized mandate, I mean that's consistent, I think, with this barbell approach that you suggest. So we have at Western, at other of our affiliates, Brandywine, and I would say even ClearBridge to a certain extent, all of our affiliates are evolving, and that's one of the things that I think is most comforting or most -- that I feel best about is that our affiliates have not stood still.

And as we talk about often, our cash low point is June -- second quarter every year because that's when we pay bonuses. So we'll ramp up from the $900 million going forward, assuming the market stay roughly in line with our recent trajectory. So we've got $550 million of excess cash on the balance sheet. We think of that, we need $350 million to kind of run the business, regulatory capital, et cetera. So $550 million cash on the balance sheet, and then EBITDA that's approaching $600 million. We're generating a lot more cash on a go-forward basis. So we think we've got plenty of resources to be able to both invest with our affiliates across the various kind of growth options that are day-to-day.
