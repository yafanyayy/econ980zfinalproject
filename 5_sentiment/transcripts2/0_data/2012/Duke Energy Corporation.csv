Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2011 earnings Review. Leading our discussion today are Jim Rogers, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lynn Good, Group Executive and Chief Financial Officer. 
Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. This forward-looking information is based on Duke Energy as a stand-alone company, as regulatory approvals for our merger with Progress Energy are still pending. You should refer to the information in our 2010 10-K and other SEC filings concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from this forward-looking information. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website and in today's materials. Note that the appendix to today's presentation materials include additional disclosures to help you analyze the company's performance, as well as our 2012 earnings guidance assumptions. 
In today's call, Jim and Lynn will review our fourth quarter and year end earnings, and provide you with our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions. We will also update you on our strategic initiatives, including our pending merger with Progress Energy. Additionally, we will highlight recent regulatory outcomes and our key priorities for 2012. After the prepared comments, Jim and Lynn will take your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Rogers."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We're extremely pleased with our financial and operational performance during 2011. Even though we faced some chall",736,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We're extremely pleased with our financial and operational performance during 2011. Even though we faced some challenges, it was the year in which we continued to deliver on our commitments. Let me highlight a few of our accomplishments. 
From a financial perspective, we grew earnings, ending the year with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.46, which is $0.03 higher than our 2010 results. Considering that extremely favorable weather contributed about $0.13 to the prior year, our 2011 performance is truly exceptional. These results exceeded both our original and revised guidance range. For the year, earnings from our ongoing modernization program and strong performance from our International business helped offset less favorable weather, significant storm restoration costs and the annualized effect of customer switching in Ohio. Continuing our commitment to increase the dividends, we grew our quarterly dividend by about 2%. Our dividend is supported by strong regulated earnings base and we target a long-term payout ratio of 65% to 70% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continued to finance our major construction projects at low interest rates and completed a new Master Credit Facility supporting our liquidity. 
In addition to solid financial results, we also had strong operational performance. Safety is a top priority for us. I'm pleased to report that our safety record last year was the best in the company's history, and it represented the sixth consecutive year we have improved our safety performance. Our nuclear fleet performed very well, achieving a capacity factor of about 93% for the year. This marks the 12th straight year the fleet has been above a 90% capacity factor. Our nuclear fleet also established some quarterly records during the year. During the third quarter, we achieved a capacity factor of around 99.3% and set an all-time record by dispatching more than 15 million megawatt hours. Our fourth quarter capacity factor, at just over 95%, was also a record for fourth quarter performance. And for the fourth consecutive year, our nuclear fleet was ranked number 1 among all other nuclear fleets in the nation, for the lowest total operating cost per megawatt hour, as reported by the Electric Utility Cost Group. 
From a strategic perspective, our regulatory teams executed well during the year, advancing our strategy to obtain regulatory clarity in Ohio, as well as recover the cost of our modernization projects in the Carolinas. Our team in Ohio worked very hard to complete the move of Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky to PJM, and obtain approval of an Electric Security Plan on our ESP that balances the interests of customers, the state and our investors. I'm pleased the Ohio Commission approved our settlement with intervening parties in late November and new rates are now in effect. The terms of the ESP provide Duke Energy Ohio with 9 bypassable stability charges of $330 million over 3 years. This gives customers the benefit of today's low market prices and allows us to transfer the generation assets to an affiliate. We have begun this work and expect to make a FERC filing in the near future. This move, which we have committed to complete no later than 2014, will provide greater clarity for our generation business. 
In the Carolinas, we reached constructive settlement and gained approval of customer rate increases. We also spent the year focused on advancing approvals related to our pending merger with Progress Energy, as well as planning our integration efforts, leveraging best practices across both companies. I want to thank each and every Duke Energy employee for their contributions to a very successful year. Despite the pending merger transaction, regulatory activity on many fronts and an aggressive construction program, our employees maintain their focus on execution and cost control. Their achievements and dedication to excellence are very commendable. Despite important challenges ahead of us in 2012, we are well-positioned to continue delivering value for our customers, investors and communities. For 2012, we are targeting an adjusted diluted EPS outlook range of $1.40 to $1.45 on a stand-alone basis. Our earnings projections continue to support our long-term 4% to 6% growth rate, based off our 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
At this time, I'll turn it over to Lynn for a more in-depth discussion of the year and our 2012 earnings outlook."

Today, I'll start with an overview of our annual results for 2011 before discussing our financial projections and related assumptions for 2012. For reference purposes, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year var",2607,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll start with an overview of our annual results for 2011 before discussing our financial projections and related assumptions for 2012. For reference purposes, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year variance disclosures are included in the appendix. As you recall, our original outlook for 2011 assumed adjusted diluted earnings per share would fall within a range of $1.35 to $1.40. We increased this range to $1.40 to $1.45 after the third quarter, primarily due to the favorable weather and stronger-than-expected results at our Commercial Power and International segment. We ended the year with adjusted earnings of $1.46 per share, slightly above our revised guidance range and $0.03 higher than the prior year. To put this performance into perspective, it's important to remember that 2010 results included around $0.13 of favorable weather. That's compared to around $0.05 of favorable weather in 2011. 
Let me briefly discuss the primary drivers for each of our business segments during the year. At FE&G, less favorable weather and significant storm restoration costs contributed to lower earnings for the year. However, the negative impact was mitigated through strong operational performance, cost controls and increased earnings from the continuation of our major construction projects. Strong results at our that international were supported by those entire contract prices and favorable average foreign exchange rates in Brazil, and improved earnings from National Methanol. Our fossil fleet in Central America dispatched more frequently due to lower hydrology and stronger results in Peru, included a favorable arbitration award. Our Commercial Power results for the year were down due to the net effects of annualized customer switching in Ohio and exit fees related to our transfer from to PJM. However, this segment performed significantly better than our original EBIT forecast. For example, our Midwest Gas fleet produced better-than-anticipated earnings as a result of strong energy margins and another record year of generation volumes. Other significant earnings drivers for the year included interest expense and taxes. First, interest expense was higher as we continued to finance our major construction projects. We took advantage of historically low interest rates and issued $2.5 billion of fixed-rate debt, at a weighted average rate of 3.3%. Finally, the adjusted effective tax rate for the year was approximately 31%, slightly favorable to our expectations of 32%. 
In summary, we had a strong year and are well-positioned to continue achieving our financial projections and objectives in 2012. Our results demonstrate the positive benefits and the diversification in our businesses. 
Turning to Slide 7, let me provide an update on the economic conditions and related customer load trends within our regulated service territory. For 2011, we finished the year with an increase of about 0.2% and weather normalized volumes slightly below our expectations. Continued economic volatility kept commercial and Residential volumes relatively flat but industrial volumes grew by about 1%, with strong results from the automotive sector. With continued expansion of the manufacturing sector, our major industrial customers are feeling more confident about 2012. And given the increasing levels of consumer confidence, we are cautiously optimistic. Because the economy hasn't quite recovered from high unemployment, challenging housing markets and Europe's fiscal uncertainties, however, we expect growth to be modest. 
From an economic development perspective, our service territories continue to attract new jobs and new capital investment. For example, BMW has announced it will add 300 jobs this year and invest nearly $900 million to expand its South Carolina plant, and Daimler has announced it will hire 1,200 workers at its Freightliner plants in North Carolina. For 2012, we are projecting overall load growth of approximately 0.7%, led by a 1% growth in both industrial and commercial. 
Now let me move on to a discussion of our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions. As Jim mentioned today, we are initiating our 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range of $1.40 to $1.45. Slide 8 contains a waterfall chart, with the significant drivers expected from each of our segments, as compared to our actual results in 2011. But first, I want to highlight that we will no longer report adjusted EBIT for each of our segments. Instead, beginning with the first quarter of this year, we will report adjusted net income. This new reporting measure will involve an allocation of interest and taxes, as well as corporate governance to each of the segments. Our other category will primarily include captive insurance results and interest expense on our holding company debt. For your reference, net income projections for each of our segments for 2012, as well as comparable amounts for the prior year, are included in the appendix. Let's start with a discussion of FE&G, which is expected to contribute approximately 75% of our consolidated net income for the year. In 2012, we expect segment results to increase by around $0.12. This is supported by the investments to complete our fleet modernization program and our most recent rate cases in the Carolinas. These base rate increases, effective earlier this month, along with other rate riders, are expected to generate increased earnings for the year. As I previously outlined, we expect modest weather normalized retail load growth for the coming year. For sensitivity purposes, a 1% change to our retail load growth impacts earnings by approximately $0.03, assuming the change is evenly distributed among our customer classes. Partially offsetting these positive drivers are increases in depreciation expense and a reduction in debt and equity AFUDC, both resulting from the expected 2012 in-service dates for our remaining major construction projects and the impact of the Carolinas rate cases. In addition, we removed the $0.05 effect of the favorable weather from our 2011 results, as our projections for 2012 assume normal weather. Also note that we are targeting O&M to be relatively consistent with 2011, as inflationary impacts are offset by less anticipated storm restoration costs. 
Next, let me move on to our Commercial Power segments, which contains our nonregulated Midwest generation, as well as our renewables business. This segment is expected to contribute less than 5% of our consolidated earnings for the year. Segment results in 2012 are expected to decline as we begin to recognize the financial impacts of the new ESP in Ohio, which was effective January 1. Historically, our coal-fired generation in Ohio was dedicated to serving our native load customers and for customers that had not switched, we received negotiated ESP rates that were above market. In our new market-based ESP, our coal-fired generation will dispatch into PJM and will receive an energy margin, as well as PJM capacity revenues. Currently, these amounts are less than what we collected under our prior ESP. However, the decline is partially offset by an annual $110 million non-bypassable stability charge, which Duke Energy Ohio will collect for 2014. Within the fully competitive environment in Ohio, we expect to continue pursuing opportunities to capture margins both inside and outside of our service territory. Duke Energy Retail is expected to contribute about $0.02 of earnings, a reduction of around $0.03 from the prior year. Finally, contributions from our Midwest gas-fired fleet are expected to decline slightly, primarily due to lower PJM capacity run rate. 
Next, our international businesses delivered record earnings in 2011, and we expect strong operational performance this year as well. The segment is projected to contribute about 20% of our consolidated results for 2012. For the year, we expect an approximate $0.04 decrease in earnings contribution, largely driven by 3 factors. First, during 2011, we had a favorable $20 million arbitration award in Peru that will not recur. Also, we expect the average Brazilian foreign exchange rate and our O&M expenses for the year to be slightly unfavorable. 
Now, let me briefly mention some of our consolidated expense items. These are included in the projected net income for each segment as outlined in the appendix to our presentation. Our overall interest expense is expected to increase around $0.04 as compared to the prior year. Of this amount, about $0.01 relates to holding company interest, which is included in other. Even though we expect a low interest-rate environment in 2012, the full year effect of our 2011 financings is expected to result in an increase to our consolidated interest expense. 
Finally, our consolidated effective tax rate for the year is projected to be around 31%, which is consistent with 2011. 
Turning to Slide 9, I'll now discuss our expectations for capital expenditures. In 2011, we spent approximately $4.5 billion and we expect 2012 CapEx to be fairly consistent, at $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. In 2013, CapEx is expected to trend down slightly as we complete our remaining modernization projects and a significant number of renewable projects later this year. Over the 3-year period from 2012 to 2014, we expect to deploy about 80% of our forecasted CapEx into our regulated businesses, consistent with our overall business mix. Overall, annual capital expenditures at FE&G are expected to range between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion. Of this, approximately $2 billion is related to ongoing maintenance capital and nuclear fuel for our regulated fleet. The remaining $1 billion to $1.5 billion is targeted towards growth investments, such as completing our major construction projects, our grid modernization program and our environmental compliance spending. Our nuclear fleet is also performing a series of upgrades, which will add additional net capacity of around 100 megawatts when completed in 2014. These upgrades are expected to be completed at a cost of less than $2 million per megawatt. As we enter 2013 and 2014, we expect to begin increasing our environmental spending. After the recent finalization of the utility mercury rules, we refined our CapEx estimates. To comply with the new regulations, as well as potential rules, which have not yet been finalized, including air emissions, coal ash and water intake, we could spend around $5 billion over the next 10 years. This is at the low end of our previous $5 billion to $6 billion range. Over the next 3 years, we expect to spend about $1 billion for environmental compliance. 
In our nonregulated businesses, we expect to deploy ongoing maintenance capital of $100 million to $200 million, as well as make investments to strategically grow our renewables portfolio. In anticipation of expiring wind to tax incentives at the end of the year, we expect to spend around $500 million to complete 770 megawatts of contracted renewable projects by year end. Finally, we continue to maintain a level of discretionary capital for both our nonregulated and regulated businesses, giving us future flexibility to pursue projects. The significant capital investments we anticipate making in our regulated businesses lead to rate-based growth over time. This rate base expansion is one of the more significant drivers in achieving our targeted 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth rate. 
Slide 10 gives you a view of the growth potential in the regulated businesses. As outlined on the previous slide, we expect to invest capital of approximately $10 billion over a 3-year period from 2012 to 2014. Of this amount, about $5 billion is maintenance capital, which substantially offsets our depreciation expense. The remaining $5 billion is expected to add a future rate-based growth. From these investments, rate base can expand from the current level of $25 billion to around $30 billion by the end of 2014, principally in the Carolinas. This represents a compounded annual growth rate of about 6%. 
As the result of our significant investments in the regulated business, we expect to file a rate case to update customer rates for these costs. A regulatory calendar with our current rate case timing assumptions is included in the appendix. Another driver for potential rate-based growth is investments in new nuclear, and we anticipate receiving our COL for the Lee Nuclear Station in South Carolina in 2013. We expect to invest a total of $100 million between 2012 and 2013 as we continue to pursue this option. Also, we continue analyzing our option to acquire a 5% to 10% interest in the new nuclear reactors of DC Summer but we have not yet made any firm commitments related to this project. 
Let me move on to a discussion of our 2012 cash flow assumptions and financing plan, which are contained on Slide 11. As we entered the year, we are well-positioned with stable outlooks on our investment-grade credit ratings, along with strong liquidity, which was around $4.5 billion at the end of 2011. Our liquidity is supported by our recent $4 billion 5-year credit facility, involving 30 financial institutions from around the world. This facility supports the company's commercial paper programs and replaces Duke's previous $3.14 billion credit facility, which was set to expire in June of this year. Another $2 billion of credit under the facility will become available upon the successful closing of the pending merger with Progress Energy. As outlined on this slide, we have around $1.9 billion of debt maturing in 2012, principally focused in the Carolinas and Ohio. In order to fund these maturities and our cash flow requirements, we expect to issue around $2.2 billion in financings during the year. These financings will mostly occur at the operating utility levels, as well as in our international and renewable portfolios. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate making about $200 million of voluntary contributions to our pension plan. Our plans are currently fully funded based upon pension protection asset requirement. We remain committed to maintain the strength of our credit ratings and our current business plans do not require any incremental equity issuances through 2014. Details on our projected credit metrics for 2012 can be found in the appendix. 
Before I close, let me discuss the primary drivers supporting our ability to achieve our long-term 4% to 6% growth rate. As you see on Slide 12, investments in the regulated business and resulting rate-based increases are expected to drive earnings growth over time. Next, we expect to see long-term average weather normalized load growth of about 1%. As I mentioned previously, each 1% change in customer load results in an EPS impact of around $0.03 or approximately 2% earnings growth. Increased wholesale transactions are another growth area for our regulated businesses. We enjoy a strong base of existing customers for whom we offer competitive power supply options. We have recently extended several existing full requirements contracts and have attracted new set of customers. For example, in 2009, we partnered with South Carolina's largest electric cooperative to provide power under a long-term contract beginning 2013. Peak demand for this contract is projected to grow annually to around 900 megawatts by 2019 . Our wholesale agreements involve creditworthy counterparties, stable returns and formula rates that true up annually, thus eliminating any regulatory lag. Based upon our current plans and rate case timing assumptions, our entire wholesale origination business is expected to add incremental margins of around $0.02 to $0.03 annually through 2016. In our nonregulated Midwest generation, growth will be supported by margin expansion and increases in future PJM capacity prices. We also expect to realize contributions from investments in our renewables business, our International business and from strong economic conditions in Brazil. And of course, as we demonstrated during the recent weak economic environment, cost discipline is an available lever to help us achieve our long-term growth rate. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our historical financial performance and how we have delivered on our commitments. For 2012, our focus will be on achieving our earnings guidance range of $1.40 to $1.45, maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and continuing to increase the dividend. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

I'm going to spend a few minutes updating you on our strategic initiatives, including our pending merger with Progress and our recent regulatory outcomes. Slide 13 contains an updated scorecard related to our pending merger with Progress",1154,"Thank you, Lynn. I'm going to spend a few minutes updating you on our strategic initiatives, including our pending merger with Progress and our recent regulatory outcomes. Slide 13 contains an updated scorecard related to our pending merger with Progress Energy. Recently, Duke and Progress jointly extended the initial merger termination date to July 8. We still have merger-related proceedings opened with FERC and with both the North and South Carolina Commissions. As you may remember, in December, the FERC rejected our proposed mitigation plan because of market power concerns. We were disappointed by this action. As we continue to finalize our analysis of the FERC order and the development of our revised mitigation plan, it is important that this plan balances FERC's market power concerns with the ability to retain the benefits of the transaction for our customers and our investors. We are considering both short-term and long-term mitigation provisions. Our longer-term solution will likely involve building new and upgrading existing transmission to improve the import capability of power into the control areas. On a short-term basis, until the transmission upgrades can be completed, we would offer firm sales of capacity and energy into the wholesale markets. Before we file with FERC, we are required to make a 30-day notification filing with the North Carolina Commission. We expect that a filing could be made next week. On a parallel track, we will also be seeking clarification on certain state rate making issues. The potential merger closing date will ultimately depend on the regulatory approval process. 
Now, let me turn to the status of our major construction projects. As you see on Slide 14, 2012 will mark a milestone year in our modernization program. We expect to bring more than 2,000 megawatts online, with the completion of our remaining major projects, Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River. In November, we brought the 620-megawatt combined cycle Buck plant online and we expect it to be completed under budget. Because of load natural gas prices, Buck has been running like a baseload generating unit. It is currently dispatching just after the nuclear units in the Carolinas, ahead of even our most efficient coal units. Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River are anticipated to be in service by the end of this year. Cliffside had a successful first fire on oil in January and its first fire on coal is targeted for the second quarter. At Edwardsport, construction is essentially finished and the startup phase is more than 60% complete. The plant is undergoing an extensive testing process, with first fire for both gas turbines expected later in the first quarter. 
Let me bring you up-to-date on the regulatory proceedings related to the proposed cost increase for Edwardsport. In January, we completed extensive hearings on both Phase I and Phase II of the project before the Indiana Commission. We presented a strong case, including extensive testimony from independent, respected experts. After thorough analysis and review, these experts testified that the company's decisions and management of the project were prudent, except for around $12 million in costs related to pursuing a deep well injection system. Post-hearing filings are scheduled to be complete by mid-July. Therefore, a commission order is not expected before the end of the third quarter. We continue to believe the costs at Edwardsport project were reasonable, prudent and necessary. 
Before moving on, let me give you a quick update of the growth we expect in Duke Energy renewables through 2012. We have 5 major wind projects currently under construction, which will nearly double the company's existing wind generation capacity by the end of the year. The projects will add almost 800 megawatts of wind power into operation, increasing our total wind generation fleet to around 1,800 megawatts. 
Turning now to Slide 15, we recently received commission approvals to increase our customer base rates in both North and South Carolina. Revised rates became effective in early February. In North Carolina, customer base rates increased by about $309 million or an average of 7.2% for each customer class. In South Carolina, the commission approved an increase in base rates of approximately $93 million, an approximate 6% average customer rate increase. In both states, the increase is based upon a return on equity of 10.5% and a 53% equity component of the cap structure. To help mitigate the impact of this rate increase to customers in North Carolina, we had deferred cash recovery of Cliffside CWIP about $1 billion until the next rate case. We're pleased the commission's approved the constructive settlements we've reached in both North and South Carolina. Along with the settling parties, we were able to strike a balance between the economic challenges facing our customers and the company's need to recover its capital investments. These projects will ensure our customers in the Carolinas have access to reliable, cleaner and affordable energy well into the future. 
Moving to Slide 16, I want to highlight our total shareholder return metrics. One of the company's key objectives is to deliver competitive returns for our shareholders. We monitor our success by comparing our stock price and dividend return performance against our peers, as well as the broad markets. We performed exceptionally well in 2011. Our dividend payment and growth objectives appealed to investors, especially with the overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Our current dividend yield is about 4.8%, which is very attractive in today's market. For the year, Duke's total shareholder return was 30.3%, which exceeded both the 19.3% return on the Philadelphia Utility Index, as well as the 2.1% for the S&P 500. Additionally, as outlined on this slide, our shareholder returns over the past 3 and 5-year periods significantly exceeded both indices. We remain focused on continuing to position the company for long-term shareholder value. A highly regulated business mix and our expectations to continued growth in the dividend offer opportunities for attractive shareholder returns. 
Before we take your questions, I'll quickly highlight our key priorities for 2012 and forward. For the remainder of the year, we will stay focused on the day-to-day business of serving our customers and delivering strong operational performance. We will work toward constructive regulatory outcomes in the merger with Progress Energy, in cost recovery for Edwardsport and our planned rate cases. For the longer term, we will continue to work to advance our legislative and regulatory priorities. We plan to complete the remaining 3 major capital projects, Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River, as well as bring 800 megawatts of wind power into operation by the end of the year. The strength of our balance sheet will support our ability to grow earnings and increase the quarterly dividend. Our standalone 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook range of $1.40 to $1.45 positions us very well to achieve our long-term targeted 4% to 6% earnings growth. We've covered a lot of information today, so let's open up the phone lines for your questions."

This has proved to be a very complex analysis and we've really worked to try to address the concerns of the FERC and at the same time, address the concerns of our state commissions. In many sense of the word, we're really trying to thread the needle between federal and state policy. In terms of how to play out, I'm almost reluctant to predict the timeline, given what has happened in the past. But I think a best case scenario is that the North Carolina Commission will review for 30 days and maybe it will take them a shorter period of time to review it. Then we will file with the FERC, and then the FERC will take 30 days for comment from the various parties and then they will deliberate roughly 30 days. And then issue our order approving the merger, along with a joint approval of our joint dispatch agreement, as well as our tariff. So you can see that the timeline plays out by late May, June.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We are extremely pleased with our financial and operational performance during 2011. Even though we faced some chal",735,"Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We are extremely pleased with our financial and operational performance during 2011. Even though we faced some challenges, it was the year in which we continued to deliver on our commitments. Let me highlight a few of our accomplishments. 
From a financial perspective, we grew earnings, ending the year with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.46, which is $0.03 higher than our 2010 results. Considering that extremely favorable weather contributed about $0.13 to the prior year, our 2011 performance is truly exceptional. These results exceeded both our original and revised guidance range. For the year, earnings from our ongoing modernization program and strong performance from our international business helped offset less favorable weather, significant storm restoration costs and the annualized effect of customer switching in Ohio. Continuing our commitment to increase the dividend, we grew our quarterly dividend by about 2%. Our dividend is supported by strong regulated earnings base and we target a long-term payout ratio of 65% to 70% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continued to finance our major construction projects at low interest rates and completed a new Master Credit Facility supporting our liquidity. 
In addition to solid financial results, we also had strong operational performance. Safety is a top priority for us. I'm pleased to report that our safety record last year was the best in the company's history, and it represented the sixth consecutive year we have improved our safety performance. Our nuclear fleet performed very well, achieving a capacity factor of about 93% for the year. This marks the 12th straight year the fleet has been above a 90% capacity factor. Our nuclear fleet also established some quarterly records during the year. During the third quarter, we achieved a capacity factor of around 99.3% and set an all-time record by dispatching more than 15 million megawatt hours. Our fourth quarter capacity factor, at just over 95%, was also a record for fourth quarter performance. And for the fourth consecutive year, our nuclear fleet was ranked #1 among all other nuclear fleets in the nation with the lowest total operating cost per megawatt hour, as reported by the Electric Utility Cost Group. 
From a strategic perspective, our regulatory teams executed well during the year, advancing our strategy to obtain regulatory clarity in Ohio, as well as recover the cost of our modernization projects in the Carolinas. Our team in Ohio worked very hard to complete the move of Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky to PJM, and obtain approval of an Electric Security Plan or ESP that balances the interests of customers, the state, and our investors. I'm pleased the Ohio Commission approved our settlement with intervening parties in late November and new rates are now in effect. The terms of the ESP provide Duke Energy Ohio with 9 bypassable stability charges of $330 million over 3 years. This gives customers the benefit of today's low market prices and allows us to transfer the generation assets to an affiliate. We have begun this work and expect to make a FERC filing in the near future. This move, which we have committed to complete no later than 2014, will provide greater clarity for our generation business. 
In the Carolinas, we reached constructive settlements and gained approval of customer rate increases. We also spent the year focused on advancing approvals related to our pending merger with Progress Energy, as well as planning our integration efforts, leveraging best practices across both companies. I want to thank each and every Duke Energy employee for their contributions to a very successful year. Despite a pending merger transaction, regulatory activity on many fronts and an aggressive construction program, our employees maintain their focus on execution and cost control. Their achievements and dedication to excellence are very commendable. Despite important challenges ahead of us in 2012, we are well-positioned to continue delivering value for our customers, investors and communities. For 2012, we are targeting an adjusted diluted EPS outlook range of $1.40 to $1.45 on a stand-alone basis. Our earnings projections continue to support our long-term 4% to 6% growth rate, based off our 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
At this time, I'll turn it over to Lynn for a more in-depth discussion of the year and our 2012 earnings outlook."
267850,146126015,258925,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2012",2012-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.

Today, I'll start with an overview of our annual results for 2011 before discussing our financial projections and related assumptions for 2012. For reference purposes, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year variance disclosures are included in the appendix. As you recall, our original outlook for 2011 assumed adjusted diluted earnings per share would fall within a range of $1.35 to $1.40. We increased this range to $1.40 to $1.45 after the third quarter, primarily due to favorable weather and stronger-than-expected results at our Commercial Power and International segments. We ended the year with adjusted earnings of $1.46 per share, slightly above our revised guidance range and $0.03 higher than the prior year. To put this performance into perspective, it's important to remember that 2010 results included around $0.13 of favorable weather as compared to around $0.05 of favorable weather in 2011. 
Let me briefly discuss the primary drivers for each of our business segments during the year. At FE&G, less favorable weather and significant storm restoration costs continued -- contributed to lower earnings for the year. However, the negative impact was mitigated through strong operational performance, cost control and increased earnings from the continuation of our major construction projects. Strong results at International were supported by both higher contract prices and favorable average foreign exchange rates in Brazil, and improved earnings from National Methanol. Our fossil fleet in Central America dispatched more frequently due to lower hydrology and stronger results in Peru included a favorable arbitration award. At Commercial Power, results for the year were down due to the net effect of annualized customer switching in Ohio and exit fees related to our transfer from MISO to PJM. However, this segment performed significantly better than our original EBIT forecast. For example, our Midwest Gas fleet produced better-than-anticipated earnings as a result of strong energy margins and another record year of generation volumes. Other significant earnings drivers for the year included interest expense and taxes. First, interest expense was higher as we continued to finance our major construction projects. We took advantage of historically low interest rates and issued $2.5 billion of fixed-rate debt, at a weighted average rate of 3.3%. Finally, the adjusted effective tax rate for the year was approximately 31%, slightly favorable to our expectations of 32%. 
In summary, we had a strong year and are well-positioned to continue achieving our financial projections and objectives in 2012. Our results demonstrate the positive benefits and the diversification in our businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12 -- turning to Slide 7. Let me just not jump ahead here. Let me provide an update on the economic conditions and related customer load trends within our regulated service territories. For 2011, we finished the year with an increase of about 0.2% and weather-normalized volumes slightly below our expectations. Continued economic volatility kept commercial and residential volumes relatively flat but industrial volumes grew by about 1%, with strong results from the automotive sector. With continued expansion of the manufacturing sector, our major industrial customers are feeling more confident about 2012. And given the increasing levels of consumer confidence, we are cautiously optimistic. Because the economy hasn't quite recovered from high unemployment, challenging housing markets and Europe's fiscal uncertainties, however, we expect growth to be modest. 
From an economic development perspective, our service territories continue to attract new jobs and new capital investment. For example, BMW has announced it will add 300 jobs this year and invest nearly $900 million to expand its South Carolina plant, and Daimler has announced it will hire 1,200 workers at its freightliner plants in North Carolina. For 2012, we are projecting overall load growth of approximately 0.7%, led by a 1% growth in both Industrial and Commercial. 
Now let me move on to a discussion of our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions. As Jim mentioned, today, we are initiating our 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range of $1.40 to $1.45. Slide 8 contains a waterfall chart with the significant drivers expected from each of our segments, as compared to our actual results in 2011. But first, I want to highlight that we will no longer report adjusted EBIT for each of our segments. Instead, beginning with the first quarter of this year, we will report adjusted net income. This new reporting measure will involve an allocation of interest and taxes, as well as corporate governance to each of the segments. Our other category will primarily include captive insurance results and interest expense on our holding company debt. For your reference, net income projections for each of our segments for 2012, as well as comparable amounts for the prior year are included in the appendix. 
Let's start with a discussion of FE&G, which is expected to contribute approximately 75% of our consolidated net income for the year. In 2012, we expect segment results to increase by around $0.12. This is supported by the investments to complete our fleet modernization program in our most recent rate cases in the Carolinas. These base rate increases, effective earlier this month, along with other rate riders, are expected to generate increased earnings for the year. As I previously outlined, we expect modest weather-normalized retail load growth for the coming year. For sensitivity purposes, a 1% change to our retail load growth impacts earnings by approximately $0.03, assuming the change is evenly distributed among our customer classes. Partially offsetting these positive drivers are increases in depreciation expense and a reduction in debt and equity AFUDC, both resulting from the expected 2012 in-service dates for our remaining major construction projects and the impact of the Carolinas rate cases. In addition, we removed the $0.05 effect of the favorable weather from our 2011 results, as our projections for 2012 assume normal weather. Also note that we are targeting O&M to be relatively consistent with 2011, as inflationary impacts are offset by less anticipated storm restoration costs. 
Next, let me move on to our Commercial Power segment, which contains our nonregulated Midwest generation, as well as our Renewables business. This segment is expected to contribute less than 5% of our consolidated earnings for the year. Segment results in 2012 are expected to decline as we begin to recognize the financial impacts of the new ESP in Ohio, which was effective January 1. Historically, our coal-fired generation in Ohio was dedicated to serving our native load customers and for customers that had not switched, we received negotiated ESP rates that were above market. In our new market-based ESP, our coal-fired generation will dispatch into PJM and will receive an energy margin, as well as PJM capacity revenues. Currently, these amounts are less than what we collected under our prior ESP. However, the decline is partially offset by an annual $110 million non-bypassable stability charge, which Duke Energy Ohio will collect for 2014. Within the fully competitive environment in Ohio, we expect to continue pursuing opportunities to capture margins, both inside and outside of our service territory. Duke Energy Retail is expected to contribute about $0.02 of earnings, a reduction of around $0.03 from the prior year. Finally, contributions from our Midwest gas-fired fleet are expected to decline slightly, primarily due to lower PJM capacity revenues. 
Next, our international businesses delivered record earnings in 2011, and we expect strong operational performance this year as well. The segment is projected to contribute about 20% of our consolidated results for 2012. For the year, we expect an approximate $0.04 decrease in earnings contribution, largely driven by 3 factors. First, during 2011, we had a favorable $20 million arbitration award in Peru that will not recur. Also we expect the average Brazilian foreign exchange rate and our O&M expenses for the year to be slightly unfavorable. 
Now let me briefly mention some of our consolidated expense items. These are included in the projected net income for each segment as outlined in the appendix to our presentation. Our overall interest expense is expected to increase around $0.04 as compared to the prior year. Of this amount, about $0.01 relates to holding company interest, which is included in other. Even though we expect a low interest rate environment in 2012, the full year effect of our 2011 financings is expected to result in an increase to our consolidated interest expense. 
Finally, our consolidated effective tax rate for the year is projected to be around 31%, which is consistent with 2011. 
Turning to Slide 9. I'll now discuss our expectations for capital expenditures. In 2011, we spent approximately $4.5 billion and we expect 2012 CapEx to be fairly consistent, at $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. In 2013, CapEx is expected to trend down slightly as we complete our remaining modernization projects and a significant number of renewable projects later this year. Over the 3-year period, from 2012 to 2014, we expect to deploy about 80% of our forecasted CapEx into our regulated businesses, consistent with our overall business mix. Overall, annual capital expenditures at FE&G are expected to range between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion. Of this, approximately $2 billion is related to ongoing maintenance capital and nuclear fuel for our regulated fleet. The remaining $1 billion to $1.5 billion is targeted toward growth investments, such as completing our major construction projects, our grid modernization program and environmental compliance spending. Our nuclear fleet is also performing a series of upgrades, which will add additional net capacity of around 100 megawatts when completed in 2014. These upgrades are expected to be completed at a cost of less than $2 million per megawatt. As we enter 2013 and 2014, we expect to begin increasing our environmental spending. After the recent finalization of the utility mercury rules, we refined our CapEx estimates. To comply with the new regulations, as well as potential rules, which have not yet been finalized, including air emissions, coal ash and water intake, we could spend around $5 billion over the next 10 years. This is at the low end of our previous $5 billion to $6 billion range. Over the next 3 years, we expect to spend about $1 billion for environmental compliance. 
In our nonregulated businesses, we expect to deploy ongoing maintenance capital of $100 million to $200 million, as well as make investments to strategically grow our renewables portfolio. In anticipation of expiring wind tax incentives at the end of the year, we expect to spend around $500 million to complete 770 megawatts of contracted renewable projects by year end. Finally, we continue to maintain a level of discretionary capital for both our nonregulated and regulated businesses, giving us future flexibility to pursue projects. The significant capital investments we anticipate making in our regulated businesses lead to rate-based growth over time. This rate base expansion is one of the more significant drivers in achieving our targeted 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth rate. 
Slide 10 gives you a view of the growth potential in the regulated businesses. As outlined on the previous slide, we expect to invest capital of approximately $10 billion over the 3-year period from 2012 to 2014. Of this amount, about $5 billion is maintenance capital, which substantially offsets our depreciation expense. The remaining $5 billion is expected to add a future rate-based growth. From these investments, rate base could expand from the current level of $25 billion to around $30 billion by the end of 2014, principally in the Carolinas. This represents a compounded annual growth rate of about 6%. 
As the result of our significant investments in the regulated business, we expect to file rate cases to update customer rates for these costs. A regulatory calendar with our current rate case timing assumptions is included in the appendix. Another driver for potential rate-based growth is investment in new nuclear, and we anticipate receiving our COL for the Lee Nuclear Station in South Carolina in 2013. We expect to invest a total of $100 million between 2012 and 2013, as we continue to pursue this option. Also we continue analyzing our option to acquire a 5% to 10% interest in the new nuclear reactors at DC Summer, but we have not yet made any firm commitments related to this project. 
Let me move on to a discussion of our 2012 cash flow assumptions and financing plan, which are contained on Slide 11. As we enter the year, we are well-positioned with stable outlooks on our investment-grade credit ratings, along with strong liquidity, which was around $4.5 billion at the end of 2011. Our liquidity is supported by our recent $4 billion 5-year credit facility, involving 30 financial institutions from around the world. This facility supports the company's commercial paper programs and replaces Duke's previous $3.14 billion credit facility, which was set to expire June of this year. Another $2 billion of credit under the facility will become available upon the successful closing of the pending merger with Progress Energy. As outlined on this slide, we have around $1.9 billion of debt maturing in 2012, principally focused in the Carolinas and Ohio. In order to fund these maturities and our cash flow requirements, we expect to issue around $2.2 billion in financings during the year. These financings will mostly occur at the operating utility level, as well as in our international and renewable portfolios. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate making about $200 million of voluntary contributions to our pension plan. Our plans are currently fully funded based upon Pension Protection Act requirements. We remain committed to maintain the strength of our credit ratings and our current business plans do not require any incremental equity issuances through 2014. Details on our projected credit metrics for 2012 can be found in the appendix. 
Before I close, let me discuss the primary drivers supporting our ability to achieve our long-term 4% to 6% growth rate. As you see on Slide 12, investments in the regulated business and resulting rate-based increases are expected to drive earnings growth over time. Next, we expect to see long-term average weather-normalized load growth of about 1%. As I mentioned previously, each 1% change in customer load results in an EPS impact of around $0.03 or approximately 2% earnings growth. Increased wholesale transactions are another growth area for our regulated businesses. We enjoy a strong base of existing customers for whom we offer competitive power supply options. We have recently extended several existing full requirements contracts and have attracted new wholesale customers. For example, in 2009, we partnered with South Carolina's largest electric cooperative to provide power under a long-term contract beginning in 2013. Peak demand for this contract is projected to grow annually to around 900 megawatts by 2019 . Our wholesale agreements involve creditworthy counterparties, stable returns and formula rates that true up annually, thus eliminating any regulatory lag. Based upon our current plans and rate case timing assumptions, our entire wholesale origination business is expected to add incremental margins of around $0.02 to $0.03 annually through 2016. In our nonregulated Midwest generation, growth will be supported by margin expansion and increases in future PJM capacity prices. We also expect to realize contributions from investments in our Renewables business, our International business and from strong economic conditions in Brazil. And of course, as we demonstrated during the recent weak economic environment, cost discipline is an available lever to help us achieve our long-term growth rate. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our historical financial performance and how we have delivered on our commitments. For 2012, our focus will be on achieving our earnings guidance range of $1.40 to $1.45, maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and continuing to increase the dividend. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

I'm going to spend a few minutes updating you on our strategic initiatives, including our pending merger with Progress and our recent regulatory outcomes. Slide 13 contains an updated scorecard related to our pending merger with Progress",1152,"Thank you, Lynn. I'm going to spend a few minutes updating you on our strategic initiatives, including our pending merger with Progress and our recent regulatory outcomes. Slide 13 contains an updated scorecard related to our pending merger with Progress Energy. Recently, Duke and Progress jointly extended the initial merger termination date to July 8. We still have merger-related proceedings open with FERC, and with both the North and South Carolina Commissions. As you may remember, in December, the FERC rejected our proposed mitigation plan because of market power concerns. We were disappointed by this action. As we continue to finalize our analysis of the FERC order and the development of our revised mitigation plan, it is important that this plan balances FERC's market power concerns with the ability to retain the benefits of the transaction for our customers and our investors. We are considering both short-term and long-term mitigation provisions. Our longer-term solution will likely involve building new and upgrading existing transmission to improve the import capability of power into the control areas. On a short-term basis, until the transmission upgrades can be completed, we would offer firm sales of capacity and energy into the wholesale markets. Before we file with FERC, we are required to make a 30-day notification filing with the North Carolina Commission. We expect that a filing could be made next week. On a parallel track, we will also be seeking clarification on certain state rate making issues. A potential merger closing date will ultimately depend on the regulatory approval process. 
Now let me turn to the status of our major construction projects. As you see on Slide 14, 2012 will mark a milestone year in our modernization program. We expect to bring more than 2,000 megawatts online, with the completion of our remaining major projects, Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River. In November, we brought the 620-megawatt combined-cycle Buck plant online and we expect it to be completed under budget. Because of low natural gas prices, Buck has been running like a baseload generating unit. It is currently dispatching just after the nuclear units in the Carolinas, ahead of even our most efficient coal units. Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River are anticipated to be in service by the end of this year. Cliffside had a successful first fire on oil in January, and its first fire on coal is targeted for the second quarter. At Edwardsport, construction is essentially finished and the startup phase is more than 60% complete. The plant is undergoing an extensive testing process, with first fire for both gas turbines expected later in the first quarter. 
Let me bring you up-to-date on the regulatory proceedings related to the proposed cost increase for Edwardsport. In January, we completed extensive hearings on both Phase I and Phase II of the project before the Indiana Commission. We presented a strong case, including extensive testimony from independent, respected experts. After thorough analysis and review, these experts testified that the company's decisions and management of the project were prudent, except for around $12 million in costs related to pursuing deep well injection system. Post-hearing filings are scheduled to be complete by mid-July. Therefore, a commission order is not expected before the end of the third quarter. We continue to believe the cost of Edwardsport project were reasonable, prudent and necessary. 
Before moving on, let me give you a quick update of the growth we expect in Duke Energy renewables through 2012. We have 5 major wind projects currently under construction, which will nearly double the company's existing wind generation capacity by the end of the year. The projects will add almost 800 megawatts of wind power into operation, increasing our total wind generation fleet to around 1,800 megawatts. 
Turning now to Slide 15, we recently received commission approvals to increase our customer base rates in both North and South Carolina. Revised rates became effective in early February. In North Carolina, customer base rates increased by about $309 million or an average of 7.2% for each customer class. In South Carolina, the Commission approved an increase in base rates of approximately $93 million, an approximate 6% average customer rate increase. In both states, the increase is based upon a return on equity of 10.5% and a 53% equity component of the cap structure. To help mitigate the impact of this rate increase to customers in North Carolina, we had deferred cash recovery of Cliffside CWIP about $1 billion until the next rate case. We're pleased the Commission's approved the constructive settlements we've reached in both North and South Carolina. Along with the settling parties, we were able to strike a balance between the economic challenges facing our customers and the company's need to recover its capital investments. These projects will ensure our customers in the Carolinas have access to reliable, cleaner and affordable energy well into the future. 
Moving to Slide 16. I want to highlight our total shareholder return metrics. One of the company's key objectives is to deliver competitive returns for our shareholders. We monitor our success by comparing our stock price and dividend return performance against our peers, as well as the broad markets. We performed exceptionally well in 2011. Our dividend payment and growth objectives appealed to investors, especially with the overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Our current dividend yield is about 4.8%, which is very attractive in today's market. For the year, Duke's total shareholder return was 30.3%, which exceeded both the 19.3% return on the Philadelphia Utility Index, as well as the 2.1% for the S&P 500. Additionally, as outlined on this slide, our shareholder returns over the past 3 and 5-year periods significantly exceeded both indices. We remain focused on continuing to position the company for long-term shareholder value.  Our highly regulated business mix and our expectations to continued growth in the dividend offer opportunities for attractive shareholder returns. 
Before we take your questions, I'll quickly highlight our key priorities for 2012 and forward. For the remainder of the year, we will stay focused on the day-to-day business of serving our customers and delivering strong operational performance. We will work toward constructive regulatory outcomes in the merger with Progress Energy, in cost recovery for Edwardsport and our planned rate cases. For the longer term, we will continue to work to advance our legislative and regulatory priorities. We plan to complete the remaining 3 major capital projects, Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River, as well as bring 800 megawatts of wind power into operation by the end of the year. The strength of our balance sheet will support our ability to grow earnings and increase the quarterly dividend. Our standalone 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook range of $1.40 to $1.45 positions us very well to achieve our long-term targeted 4% to 6% earnings growth. 
We've covered a lot of information today, so let's open up the phone lines for your questions."

This has proved to be a very complex analysis and we've really worked to try to address the concerns of the FERC and at the same time, address the concerns of our State Commissions. And in many sense of the word, we're really trying to thread the needle between federal and state policy. In terms of how to play out, I'm almost reluctant to predict the timeline, given what has happened in the past. But I think a best case scenario is that the North Carolina Commission will review for 30 days and maybe it will take them a shorter period of time to review it. Then we will file with the FERC, and then the FERC will take 30 days for comment from the various parties and then they will deliberate roughly 30 days. And then issue our order approving the merger, along with a joint approval of our joint dispatch agreement, as well as our tariff. So you can see that the timeline plays out by late May, June. I'd say mid-to-late May, we in all likelihood, have an order from the FERC. And then we expect orders from the state commissions, both North and South Carolina after they've had an opportunity to review the FERC order and the issues that are pending before them."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We are extremely pleased with our financial and operational performance during 2011. Even though we faced some challenges, it was a year in which we continued to deliver on our commitments. Let me highlight a few of our accomplishments. 
From a financial perspective, we grew earnings, ending the year with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.46, which is $0.03 higher than our 2010 results. Considering that extremely favorable weather contributed about $0.13 to the prior year, our 2011 performance is truly exceptional. These results exceeded both our original and revised guidance range. For the year, earnings from our ongoing modernization programs and strong performance from our international business helped offset less favorable weather, significant storm restoration costs and the annualized effect of customers switching in Ohio. Continuing our commitment to increase the dividend, we grew our quarterly dividend by about 2%. Our dividend is supported by a strong, regulated earnings base and we target a long-term payout ratio of 65% to 70% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continued to finance our major construction projects at low interest rates and completed a new Master Credit Facility, supporting our liquidity. 
In addition to solid financial results, we also had strong operational performance. Safety is a top priority for us. I'm pleased to report that our safety record last year was the best in the company's history, and it represented the sixth consecutive year we have improved our safety performance. Our nuclear fleet performed very well, achieving a capacity factor of about 93% for the year. This marks the 12th straight year the fleet has been above a 90% capacity factor. Our nuclear fleet also established some quarterly records during the year. During the third quarter, we achieved a capacity factor of around 99.3% and set an all-time record by dispatching more than 15 million megawatt hours. Our fourth quarter capacity factor, at just over 95%, was also a record for fourth quarter performance. And for the fourth consecutive year, our nuclear fleet was ranked #1 among all other nuclear fleets in the nation with the lowest total operating cost per megawatt hour, as reported by the Electric Utility Cost Group. 
From a strategic perspective, our regulatory teams executed well during the year, advancing our strategy to obtain regulatory clarity in Ohio, as well as recover the cost of our modernization projects in the Carolinas. Our team in Ohio worked very hard to complete the move of Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky to PJM and obtain approval of an Electric Security Plan or ESP that balances the interests of customers, the state, and our investors. I'm pleased the Ohio Commission approved our settlement with intervening parties in late November, and new rates are now in effect. The terms of the ESP provide Duke Energy Ohio with 9 bypassable stability charges of $330 million over 3 years. This gives customers the benefit of today's low market prices and allows us to transfer the generation assets to an affiliate. We have begun this work and expect to make a FERC filing in the near future. This move, which we have committed to complete no later than 2014, will provide greater clarity for our generation business. 
In the Carolinas, we reached constructive settlements and gained approval of customer rate increases. We also spent the year focused on advancing approvals related to our pending merger with Progress Energy, as well as planning our integration efforts, leveraging best practices across both companies. I want to thank each and every Duke Energy employee for their contributions to a very successful year. Despite a pending merger transaction, regulatory activity on many fronts and an aggressive construction program, our employees maintain their focus on execution and cost control. Their achievements and dedication to excellence are very commendable. Despite important challenges ahead of us in 2012, we are well-positioned to continue delivering value for our customers, investors and communities. For 2012, we are targeting an adjusted diluted EPS outlook range of $1.40 to $1.45 on a stand-alone basis. Our earnings projections continue to support our long-term 4% to 6% growth rate, based off our 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
At this time, I'll turn it over to Lynn for a more in-depth discussion of the year and our 2012 earnings outlook."

Today, I'll start with an overview of our annual results for 2011 before discussing our financial projections and related assumptions for 2012. For reference purposes, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year variance disclosures are included in the appendix. As you recall, our original outlook for 2011 assumed adjusted diluted earnings per share would fall within a range of $1.35 to $1.40. We increased this range to $1.40 to $1.45 after the third quarter, primarily due to favorable weather and stronger-than-expected results at our Commercial Power and International segments. We ended the year with adjusted earnings of $1.46 per share, slightly above our revised guidance range and $0.03 higher than the prior year. To put this performance into perspective, it's important to remember that 2010 results included around $0.13 of favorable weather as compared to around $0.05 of favorable weather in 2011. 
Let me briefly discuss the primary drivers for each of our business segments during the year. At FE&G, less favorable weather and significant storm restoration costs continued -- contributed to lower earnings for the year. However, the negative impact was mitigated through strong operational performance, cost control and increased earnings from the continuation of our major construction projects. Strong results at International were supported by both higher contract prices and favorable average foreign exchange rates in Brazil and improved earnings from National Methanol. Our fossil fleet in Central America dispatched more frequently due to lower hydrology and stronger results in Peru included a favorable arbitration award. At Commercial Power, results for the year were down due to the net effect of annualized customer switching in Ohio and exit fees related to our transfer from MISO to PJM. However, this segment performed significantly better than our original EBIT forecast. For example, our Midwest Gas fleet produced better-than-anticipated earnings as a result of strong energy margins and another record year of generation volumes. Other significant earnings drivers for the year included interest expense and taxes. First, interest expense was higher as we continued to finance our major construction projects. We took advantage of historically low interest rates and issued $2.5 billion of fixed-rate debt at a weighted average rate of 3.3%. Finally, the adjusted effective tax rate for the year was approximately 31%, slightly favorable to our expectations of 32%. 
In summary, we had a strong year and are well-positioned to continue achieving our financial projections and objectives in 2012. Our results demonstrate the positive benefits and the diversification in our businesses. 
Turning to Slide 12 -- turning to Slide 7. Let me just not jump ahead here. Let me provide an update on the economic conditions and related customer load trends within our regulated service territories. For 2011, we finished the year with an increase of about 0.2% and weather-normalized volumes slightly below our expectations. Continued economic volatility kept commercial and residential volumes relatively flat, but industrial volumes grew by about 1%, with strong results from the automotive sector. With continued expansion of the manufacturing sector, our major industrial customers are feeling more confident about 2012. And given the increasing levels of consumer confidence, we are cautiously optimistic. Because the economy hasn't quite recovered from high unemployment, challenging housing markets and Europe's fiscal uncertainties, however, we expect growth to be modest. 
From an economic development perspective, our service territories continue to attract new jobs and new capital investment. For example, BMW has announced it will add 300 jobs this year and invest nearly $900 million to expand its South Carolina plant, and Daimler has announced it will hire 1,200 workers at its freightliner plants in North Carolina. For 2012, we are projecting overall load growth of approximately 0.7%, led by a 1% growth in both Industrial and Commercial. 
Now let me move on to a discussion of our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions. As Jim mentioned, today, we are initiating our 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range of $1.40 to $1.45. Slide 8 contains a waterfall chart with the significant drivers expected from each of our segments, as compared to our actual results in 2011. But first, I want to highlight that we will no longer report adjusted EBIT for each of our segments. Instead, beginning with the first quarter of this year, we will report adjusted net income. This new reporting measure will involve an allocation of interest and taxes, as well as corporate governance to each of the segments. Our other category will primarily include captive insurance results and interest expense on our holding company debt. For your reference, net income projections for each of our segments for 2012, as well as comparable amounts for the prior year, are included in the appendix. 
Let's start with a discussion of FE&G, which is expected to contribute approximately 75% of our consolidated net income for the year. In 2012, we expect segment results to increase by around $0.12. This is supported by the investments to complete our fleet modernization program in our most recent rate cases in the Carolinas. These base rate increases, effective earlier this month, along with other rate riders, are expected to generate increased earnings for the year. As I previously outlined, we expect modest weather-normalized retail load growth for the coming year. For sensitivity purposes, a 1% change to our retail load growth impacts earnings by approximately $0.03, assuming the change is evenly distributed among our customer classes. Partially offsetting these positive drivers are increases in depreciation expense and a reduction in debt and equity AFUDC, both resulting from the expected 2012 in-service dates for our remaining major construction projects and the impact of the Carolinas rate cases. In addition, we removed the $0.05 effect of the favorable weather from our 2011 results, as our projections for 2012 assume normal weather. Also note that we are targeting O&M to be relatively consistent with 2011, as inflationary impacts are offset by less anticipated storm restoration costs. 
Next, let me move on to our Commercial Power segment, which contains our nonregulated Midwest generation, as well as our Renewables business. This segment is expected to contribute less than 5% of our consolidated earnings for the year. Segment results in 2012 are expected to decline as we begin to recognize the financial impact of the new ESP in Ohio, which was effective January 1. Historically, our coal-fired generation in Ohio was dedicated to serving our native load customers, and for customers that had not switched, we received negotiated ESP rates that were above market. In our new market-based ESP, our coal-fired generation will dispatch into PJM and will receive an energy margin, as well as PJM capacity revenues. Currently, these amounts are less than what we collected under our prior ESP. However, the decline is partially offset by an annual $110 million non-bypassable stability charge, which Duke Energy Ohio will collect for 2014. Within the fully competitive environment in Ohio, we expect to continue pursuing opportunities to capture margins, both inside and outside of our service territory. Duke Energy Retail is expected to contribute about $0.02 of earnings, a reduction of around $0.03 from the prior year. Finally, contributions from our Midwest gas-fired fleet are expected to decline slightly, primarily due to lower PJM capacity revenues. 
Next, our international businesses delivered record earnings in 2011, and we expect strong operational performance this year as well. The segment is projected to contribute about 20% of our consolidated results for 2012. For the year, we expect an approximate $0.04 decrease in earnings contribution, largely driven by 3 factors. First, during 2011, we had a favorable $20 million arbitration award in Peru that will not recur. Also we expect the average Brazilian foreign exchange rate and our O&M expenses for the year to be slightly unfavorable. 
Now let me briefly mention some of our consolidated expense items. These are included in the projected net income for each segment as outlined in the appendix to our presentation. Our overall interest expense is expected to increase around $0.04 as compared to the prior year. Of this amount, about $0.01 relates to holding company interest, which is included in other. Even though we expect a low interest rate environment in 2012, the full year effect of our 2011 financings is expected to result in an increase to our consolidated interest expense. 
Finally, our consolidated effective tax rate for the year is projected to be around 31%, which is consistent with 2011. 
Turning to Slide 9. I'll now discuss our expectations for capital expenditures. In 2011, we spent approximately $4.5 billion, and we expect 2012 CapEx to be fairly consistent, at $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. In 2013, CapEx is expected to trend down slightly as we complete our remaining modernization projects and a significant number of renewable projects later this year. Over the 3-year period, from 2012 to 2014, we expect to deploy about 80% of our forecasted CapEx into our regulated businesses, consistent with our overall business mix. Overall, annual capital expenditures at FE&G are expected to range between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion. Of this, approximately $2 billion is related to ongoing maintenance capital and nuclear fuel for our regulated fleet. The remaining $1 billion to $1.5 billion is targeted toward growth investments, such as completing our major construction projects, our grid modernization program and environmental compliance spending. Our nuclear fleet is also performing a series of upgrades, which will add additional net capacity of around 100 megawatts when completed in 2014. These upgrades are expected to be completed at a cost of less than $2 million per megawatt. As we enter 2013 and 2014, we expect to begin increasing our environmental spending. After the recent finalization of the utility mercury rules, we refined our CapEx estimates. To comply with the new regulations, as well as potential rules, which have not yet been finalized, including air emissions, coal ash and water intake, we could spend around $5 billion over the next 10 years. This is at the low end of our previous $5 billion to $6 billion range. Over the next 3 years, we expect to spend about $1 billion for environmental compliance. 
In our nonregulated businesses, we expect to deploy ongoing maintenance capital of $100 million to $200 million, as well as make investments to strategically grow our renewables portfolio. In anticipation of expiring wind tax incentives at the end of the year, we expect to spend around $500 million to complete 770 megawatts of contracted renewable projects by year end. Finally, we continue to maintain a level of discretionary capital for both our nonregulated and regulated businesses, giving us future flexibility to pursue projects. The significant capital investments we anticipate making in our regulated businesses lead to rate-based growth over time. This rate-based expansion is one of the more significant drivers in achieving our targeted 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth rate. 
Slide 10 gives you a view of the growth potential in the regulated businesses. As outlined on the previous slide, we expect to invest capital of approximately $10 billion over the 3-year period from 2012 to 2014. Of this amount, about $5 billion is maintenance capital, which substantially offsets our depreciation expense. The remaining $5 billion is expected to add to future rate-based growth. From these investments, rate base could expand from the current level of $25 billion to around $30 billion by the end of 2014, principally in the Carolinas. This represents a compounded annual growth rate of about 6%. 
As the result of our significant investments in the regulated business, we expect to file rate cases to update customer rates for these costs. A regulatory calendar with our current rate case timing assumptions is included in the appendix. Another driver for potential rate-based growth is investment in new nuclear, and we anticipate receiving our COL for the Lee Nuclear Station in South Carolina in 2013. We expect to invest a total of $100 million between 2012 and 2013 as we continue to pursue this option. Also we continue analyzing our option to acquire a 5% to 10% interest in the new nuclear reactors at DC Summer [ph], but we have not yet made any firm commitments related to this project. 
Let me move on to a discussion of our 2012 cash flow assumptions and financing plan, which are contained on Slide 11. As we enter the year, we are well-positioned with stable outlooks on our investment-grade credit ratings, along with strong liquidity, which was around $4.5 billion at the end of 2011. Our liquidity is supported by our recent $4 billion 5-year credit facility, involving 30 financial institutions from around the world. This facility supports the company's commercial paper programs and replaces Duke's previous $3.14 billion credit facility, which was set to expire in June of this year. Another $2 billion of credit under the facility will become available upon the successful closing of the pending merger with Progress Energy. As outlined on this slide, we have around $1.9 billion of debt maturing in 2012, principally focused in the Carolinas and Ohio. In order to fund these maturities and our cash flow requirements, we expect to issue around $2.2 billion in financings during the year. These financings will mostly occur at the operating utility level, as well as in our international and renewable portfolios. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate making about $200 million of voluntary contributions to our pension plan. Our plans are currently fully funded based upon Pension Protection Act requirements. We remain committed to maintain the strength of our credit ratings, and our current business plans do not require any incremental equity issuances through 2014. Details on our projected credit metrics for 2012 can be found in the appendix. 
Before I close, let me discuss the primary drivers supporting our ability to achieve our long-term 4% to 6% growth rate. As you see on Slide 12, investments in the regulated business and resulting rate-based increases are expected to drive earnings growth over time. Next, we expect to see long-term, average, weather-normalized load growth of about 1%. As I mentioned previously, each 1% change in customer load results in an EPS impact of around $0.03, or approximately 2% earnings growth. Increased wholesale transactions are another growth area for our regulated businesses. We enjoy a strong base of existing customers for whom we offer competitive power supply options. We have recently extended several existing full requirements contracts and have attracted new wholesale customers. For example, in 2009, we partnered with South Carolina's largest electric cooperative to provide power under a long-term contract beginning in 2013. Peak demand for this contract is projected to grow annually to around 900 megawatts by 2019. Our wholesale agreements involve creditworthy counterparties, stable returns and formula rates that true up annually, thus eliminating any regulatory lag. Based upon our current plans and rate case timing assumptions, our entire wholesale origination business is expected to add incremental margins of around $0.02 to $0.03 annually through 2016. In our nonregulated Midwest generation, growth will be supported by margin expansion and increases in future PJM capacity prices. We also expect to realize contributions from investments in our Renewables business, our International business and from strong economic conditions in Brazil. And of course, as we demonstrated during the recent weak economic environment, cost discipline is an available lever to help us achieve our long-term growth rate. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our historical financial performance and how we have delivered on our commitments. For 2012, our focus will be on achieving our earnings guidance range of $1.40 to $1.45, maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and continuing to increase the dividend. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

I'm going to spend a few minutes updating you on our strategic initiatives, including our pending merger with Progress and our recent regulatory outcomes. Slide 13 contains an updated scorecard related to our pending merger with Progress",1152,"Thank you, Lynn. I'm going to spend a few minutes updating you on our strategic initiatives, including our pending merger with Progress and our recent regulatory outcomes. Slide 13 contains an updated scorecard related to our pending merger with Progress Energy. Recently, Duke and Progress jointly extended the initial merger termination date to July 8. We still have merger-related proceedings open with FERC, and with both the North and South Carolina Commissions. As you may remember, in December, the FERC rejected our proposed mitigation plan because of market power concerns. We were disappointed by this action. As we continue to finalize our analysis of the FERC order and the development of our revised mitigation plan, it is important that this plan balances FERC's market power concerns with the ability to retain the benefits of the transaction for our customers and our investors. We are considering both short-term and long-term mitigation provisions. Our longer-term solution will likely involve building new and upgrading existing transmission to improve the import capability of power into the control areas. On a short-term basis, until the transmission upgrades can be completed, we would offer firm sales of capacity and energy into the wholesale markets. Before we file with FERC, we are required to make a 30-day notification filing with the North Carolina Commission. We expect that a filing could be made next week. On a parallel track, we will also be seeking clarification on certain state rate making issues. A potential merger closing date will ultimately depend on the regulatory approval process. 
Now let me turn to the status of our major construction projects. As you see on Slide 14, 2012 will mark a milestone year in our modernization program. We expect to bring more than 2,000 megawatts online with the completion of our remaining major projects, Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River. In November, we brought the 620-megawatt combined-cycle Buck plant online, and we expect it to be completed under budget. Because of low natural gas prices, Buck has been running like a baseload generating unit. It is currently dispatching just after the nuclear units in the Carolinas, ahead of even our most efficient coal units. Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River are anticipated to be in service by the end of this year. Cliffside had a successful first fire on oil in January, and its first fire on coal is targeted for the second quarter. At Edwardsport, construction is essentially finished, and the startup phase is more than 60% complete. The plant is undergoing an extensive testing process, with first fire for both gas turbines expected later in the first quarter. 
Let me bring you up-to-date on the regulatory proceedings related to the proposed cost increase for Edwardsport. In January, we completed extensive hearings on both Phase I and Phase II of the project before the Indiana Commission. We presented a strong case, including extensive testimony from independent, respected experts. After thorough analysis and review, these experts testified that the company's decisions and management of the project were prudent, except for around $12 million in costs related to pursuing deep well injection system. Post-hearing filings are scheduled to be complete by mid-July. Therefore, a commission order is not expected before the end of the third quarter. We continue to believe the cost of Edwardsport project were reasonable, prudent and necessary. 
Before moving on, let me give you a quick update of the growth we expect in Duke Energy renewables through 2012. We have 5 major wind projects currently under construction, which will nearly double the company's existing wind generation capacity by the end of the year. The projects will add almost 800 megawatts of wind power into operation, increasing our total wind generation fleet to around 1,800 megawatts. 
Turning now to Slide 15, we recently received commission approvals to increase our customer base rates in both North and South Carolina. Revised rates became effective in early February. In North Carolina, customer base rates increased by about $309 million or an average of 7.2% for each customer class. In South Carolina, the Commission approved an increase in base rates of approximately $93 million, an approximate 6% average customer rate increase. In both states, the increase is based upon a return on equity of 10.5% and a 53% equity component of the cap structure. To help mitigate the impact of this rate increase to customers in North Carolina, we had deferred cash recovery of Cliffside CWIP about $1 billion until the next rate case. We're pleased the Commission's approved the constructive settlements we've reached in both North and South Carolina. Along with the settling parties, we were able to strike a balance between the economic challenges facing our customers and the company's need to recover its capital investments. These projects will ensure our customers in the Carolinas have access to reliable, cleaner and affordable energy well into the future. 
Moving to Slide 16. I want to highlight our total shareholder return metrics. One of the company's key objectives is to deliver competitive returns for our shareholders. We monitor our success by comparing our stock price and dividend return performance against our peers, as well as the broad markets. We performed exceptionally well in 2011. Our dividend payment and growth objectives appealed to investors, especially with the overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Our current dividend yield is about 4.8%, which is very attractive in today's market. For the year, Duke's total shareholder return was 30.3%, which exceeded both the 19.3% return on the Philadelphia Utility Index as well as the 2.1% for the S&P 500. Additionally, as outlined on this slide, our shareholder returns over the past 3 and 5-year periods significantly exceeded both indices. We remain focused on continuing to position the company for long-term shareholder value. Our highly regulated business mix and our expectations to continued growth in the dividend offer opportunities for attractive shareholder returns. 
Before we take your questions, I'll quickly highlight our key priorities for 2012 and forward. For the remainder of the year, we will stay focused on the day-to-day business of serving our customers and delivering strong operational performance. We will work toward constructive regulatory outcomes in the merger with Progress Energy, in cost recovery for Edwardsport and our planned rate cases. For the longer term, we will continue to work to advance our legislative and regulatory priorities. We plan to complete the remaining 3 major capital projects, Cliffside, Edwardsport and Dan River, as well as bring 800 megawatts of wind power into operation by the end of the year. The strength of our balance sheet will support our ability to grow earnings and increase the quarterly dividend. Our standalone 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook range of $1.40 to $1.45 positions us very well to achieve our long-term targeted 4% to 6% earnings growth. 
We've covered a lot of information today, so let's open up the phone lines for your questions."

This has proven to be a very complex analysis, and we've really worked to try to address the concerns of the FERC and at the same time address the concerns of our State Commissions. And in many senses of the word, we're really trying to thread the needle between federal and state policy. In terms of how it'll play out, I'm almost reluctant to predict the timeline, given what has happened in the past. But I think a best-case scenario is that the North Carolina Commission will review for 30 days, and maybe it will take them a shorter period of time to review it. Then we will file with the FERC, and then the FERC will take 30 days for comment from the various parties, and then they will deliberate roughly 30 days and then issue our order approving the merger, along with a joint approval of our joint dispatch agreement, as well as our tariff. So you can see that the timeline plays out by late May, June. I'd say mid-to-late May, we will, in all likelihood, have an order from the FERC. And then we expect orders from the state commissions, both North and South Carolina, after they've had an opportunity to review the FERC order and the issues that are pending before them."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. Today, we will review our quarterly earnings results, provide an update on economic activity and customer loan growth trends, as well as summarize what we are experiencing with coal-to-gas switching. We will also review the status of our combination with Progress Energy and to discuss the settlement agreement we announced earlier this week with respect to the Edwardsport project in Indiana. this settlement agreement resolves uncertainty regarding the cost recovery of this important investment. I will review the terms of the settlement later in my remarks, and let me begin with an overview of the quarter. 
Today, we announced first quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.38. That compares to $0.39 in the first quarter of 2011. Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.22 as compared to $0.38 in the prior year. Current quarter reported results reflect $0.20 of charges related to the settlement agreement on the Edwardsport IGCC project in Indiana. This charge has been treated as a special item for the quarter. Consequently, it has been included from our adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
The quarter was characterized by unusually mild weather across all of our service territories. In fact, this past winter was the fourth warmest winter season on record for the entire U.S. I am pleased with our employees' efforts to effectively manage costs during the quarter. This helped offset some of the impact from the weather. We also benefited from increases in customer prices in the Carolinas as a result of our rate case request last year. 
In our commercial businesses, international operations continue to deliver strong results, mitigating the reduced earnings we expected from our new ESP agreement in Ohio. In addition to cost control, our operational performance during the quarter was impressive. The regulated nuclear fleet delivered a capacity factor of 99.7%. Meanwhile, our nonregulated gas fleet in the Midwest continue to operate at record-generating levels, benefiting from low gas prices. 
I am pleased with where we stand at the end of the first quarter. While we cannot control the weather, I commend our employees for focusing on what we can control, specifically, our fleet and grid performance, as well as our expenses. Based upon our first quarter results, we are on track to achieve our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS guided range of $1.40 to $1.45. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn for a more in-depth discussion of our financial performance for the quarter."

Slide 6 outlines the significant adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business segments for the quarter. As a reminder, we are now evaluating our business performance on the basis of segment income, rather than on our previous segment",1576,"Thank you, Jim. Slide 6 outlines the significant adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business segments for the quarter. As a reminder, we are now evaluating our business performance on the basis of segment income, rather than on our previous segment EBIT basis. As a result, earnings for each segment includes interest in income tax expense. In addition, corporate governance costs, which were previously reflected in the category labeled other, are now allocated to each segment. 
First, let's review earnings for our regulated utilities, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas. Quarterly adjusted segment income was relatively flat with the prior year quarter. Revised customer rates in the Carolinas and lower operation and maintenance expense helped offset the impact of unfavorable weather. 
Let me give you some perspective on the mild weather which affected earnings per share by about $0.04. In the Carolinas, we have the lowest level of heating degree days on record for the first quarter. Heating degree days were below normal by around 25% in the Carolinas and 28% in the Midwest. We were able to offset about $0.01 per share of the weather impact with reductions in our O&M costs during the quarter. Due to the unfavorable weather and the low natural gas price environment, we are generating fewer megawatt hours from our coal plants. We've examined our operations for opportunities to reduce cost. From a labor perspective, we have displaced contractors, reduced overtime and have not filled open positions. Additionally, we will defer certain scheduled outages if the plants are not running at the levels we originally anticipated. 
Assuming normal weather and storm activity, we expect our 2012 O&M to be down about 2% in 2011 as a result of the actions identified in the first quarter. We will maintain our focus on costs while also ensuring the continued safety of our employees and reliability of our systems. 
Also, during the quarter, FE&G began to realize the benefit of recent rate case outcomes in both North and South Carolina, which increased earnings per share by about $0.03. These revised rates primarily reflect recovery of investments in our fleet modernization program. 
Now let me move on to Duke Energy International, which continued to provide strong financial results. This segment's adjusted income increased principally due to higher volumes and pricing in Brazil, as well as at NMC, more than offsetting the impact of the prior-year favorable arbitration award in Peru. 
Finally, I'll briefly discuss the results for our nonregulated Commercial Power segment. As expected, Commercial Power's adjusted segment income was lower than the prior-year quarter primarily due to the impact of the new Electric Security Plan in Ohio. That plan resulted in a reduction to earnings per share of about $0.02. As you'll recall, under our new market-based ESP, our coal-fired generation dispatches into PJM. That generation receives an energy margin, as well as capacity revenues based upon PJM clearing prices. 
Duke Energy Ohio is also collecting an annual $110 million non-bypassable stability charge through the end of 2014 adding $0.01 to the first quarter results. 
Our nonregulated Midwest gas fleet continued its strong performance, contributing around $0.01 more than in the first quarter of 2011. The gas fleet's earnings were supported by higher volumes and margins resulting from low gas prices. Our Midwest gas fleet dispatched about 1,900 gigawatt hours more in the prior year quarter, nearly a 70% increase. As expected, PJM capacity revenue received by the Midwest gas fleet was lower in first quarter 2012 as the capacity price fell from the $174 per megawatt day in the prior year to $110 per megawatt day. 
As a result of the reset of our ESP in Ohio to market-based rates, volumes and margins realized by our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail were lower than in the prior year quarter. This reduced earnings by around $0.01 per share. Despite a challenging environment, the Commercial Power team continues to work to control costs and optimize the performance of the nonregulated generating fleet. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'll spend a few minutes on our volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service territories. This slide presents our quarterly volume trends by customer class based on calculations that exclude weather impact. As a reminder, our 2012 guidance assumes we'll experience weather-normalized volume increases of about 0.7%, driven by expected growth of approximately 1% in both the industrial and commercial customer classes. On a weather normal basis, quarterly volumes are around 1% higher than the prior-year period. However, most of the favorable trends was due to an extra day in first quarter 2012 resulting from leap year. This increase continues to be largely supported by industrial activity, which remains strong across both the Carolinas and Midwest. Weather-normalized industrial volumes were 2.6% higher in the prior-year quarter. This persists across several of our major industrial classes, particularly the automotive, chemical and heavy equipment sectors. However, weakness continues in housing-related sectors and among our textile customers in the Carolinas. 
Economic development activities continue to remain strong in our service territories, bringing new investment and jobs. For example, car manufacturer, Michelin, announced last month that it will invest $750 million for a new plant and a factory expansion in South Carolina and combined are expected to create 500 new jobs. 
Let me move on to trends in the residential customer class. For the quarter, weather-normalized residential volumes were essentially flat, an increase of about 0.3%, visibly supported by the Carolinas. We are seeing positive trends in the number of residential customers being added in the Carolinas and Midwest. We've added approximately 20,000 more electric and gas customers from the prior year quarter, an average growth of around 0.5%. Even though this level of growth is below what we were experiencing before the recession, it is significantly higher than the 5,000 customers we added at the same time last year. We continue, however, to experience the reduction in our residential customers' average kilowatt hour usage. The sluggish economic recovery, high gasoline prices and energy efficiency initiatives will all be influencing these usage patterns. 
Finally, weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were around 0.6% higher than the prior year. This customer class continues to be weighed down by high office and retail vacancy rates and lower construction activity. The economy within our service territories maintains its slow recovery. Industrial activity remained strong, yet consumers continue to be cautious. And employment rates have improved and remain at historically high levels. Further, last week's announcement of first quarter U.S. GDP and a slowing from the fourth quarter of last year. All of these factors leave us cautious and vertically optimistic on the overall economic recovery. 
If we forecast the remainder of the year, we're seeing some challenges our ability to achieve the 0.7% weather-normal volume growth assumed in our 2012 guidance. We will continue to monitor customer volume trends as we progress throughout the year. 
Finally, let me discuss the issue of coal-to-gas switching, which is resulting from the low natural gas price environment. The charts on Slide 8 show our generation fuel mix over the last 2 years and our current projection for 2012, both in the regulated businesses and in our nonregulated Midwest generation business. As demonstrated by these charts, the commodity price environment has significantly changed the mix of generation, resulting in less coal and more natural gas. For example, in the Carolinas, our Buck combined cycle gas plant, which became operational this past November, has been dispatching like a baseload generating. In fact, it is currently dispatching just after our nuclear units in the Carolinas, ahead of even our most sufficient coal units. 
Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, our nonregulated Midwest gas-fired generation continue to run at high levels. In fact, 2011 was the third straight year this fleet achieved record generation levels, and as low gas prices persist, 2012 is looking like another record year. As a result of reduced coal burns expected in 2012, from mild weather and low natural gas prices, our coal inventory levels have increased. Inventory levels are currently above our target of about 40 days in the Carolinas and about 45 days in Indiana. In 2009, the impacts of the economic recession put us in a similar situation where we were able to work with our coal suppliers to effectively manage inventory levels. They are doing the same this year. 
We've had extensive discussions with our coal suppliers and we're evaluating contract deferrals or buyouts, as well as additional coal storage options, both on and off-site. In February, we implemented a coal price decrement in Indiana, increasing the dispatch of our coal units. To the extent the units are dispatched, coal coming to the stations is consumed and other higher potential costs are avoided. Overall, customers benefit. We continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action as needed. 
In summary, for the remainder of the year, we'll continue to monitor customer load growth trends or focus on effective cost control and operational performance that will drive our financial results. We remain on track to achieve $1.40 to $1.45 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range for 2012. However, actual results for the year will be largely dependent upon the third quarter, historically, our most significant. Additionally, we remain well positioned to achieve our target of 4% to 6% long-term growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share on a stand-alone basis. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jim."

Let me start with our pending merger with Progress. On March 26, Duke and Progress jointly filed a revised mitigation plan with the FERC to address their market power concerns. This slide summarizes the components of our revised mitigation p",1313,"Thanks, Lynn. Let me start with our pending merger with Progress. On March 26, Duke and Progress jointly filed a revised mitigation plan with the FERC to address their market power concerns. This slide summarizes the components of our revised mitigation plan. The filing features both interim and permanent mitigation components. The permanent mitigation solution involves the building and upgrading of transmission and the estimated cost of about $110 million. The transmission projects are designed to significantly increase power import capabilities and enhance competitive power supply options in the Progress and Duke Carolinas service territories. 
The proposal also features a 2- to 3-year interim mitigation plan with firm power purchase agreements already signed with 3 third parties. The agreements will be in place from the date the merger closes and until the transmission projects are operational, at which time the interim mitigation will terminate. The cost of this interim mitigation, which we're able to currently estimate, are included on this slide. 
Our regulatory and legal teams have spent considerable effort investigating solutions to address FERC's concerns about market power in the Carolinas. FERC's comment period on our mitigation plan ended last week and we responded to intervenor comments earlier this week. We believe that our revised mitigation plan addresses the FERC's good terms and it's a protest to the plan or without merit. We've requested that FERC issue orders approving the mitigation plan, the joint dispatch agreement and the joint open access transmission tariff no later than June 8. After satisfactory FERC approval, we will continue to seek final merger-related approvals from the North Carolina and South Carolina commissions. 
Over the past several weeks, we have had constructive discussions with the North Carolina public staff. These discussions have centered on how the cost of the proposed FERC mitigation plan will be handled for rate-making purposes, as well as some clarifications, including the timing of the $650 million guarantee of fuel and joint dispatch savings. We hope to have a revised settlement in place soon that balances the interests of consumers and shareholders. 
We have restarted our integration planning on a limited basis, focusing on those areas that are critical to day 1 operations of a combined Duke Progress. We will continue to keep you informed on developments regarding the merger in the weeks ahead. 
Next, let me review the Edwardsport settlement, an important milestone in achieving clarity on the cost recovery of this investment. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel Indiana related to recovery of construction costs for the project. This settlement is subject to the approval of the Indiana Commission. 
Let me highlight a few provisions of the agreement. First, the settlement includes a capital and construction cost, including financing costs to be reflected in customer rates of approximately $2.59 billion as of June 30. This amount includes approximately $2.32 billion of estimated direct costs, as well as estimated financing costs. To the extent we do not have a final commission order by June 30, Duke Energy Indiana will be able to recover additional financing costs until our customer rates are revised. 
Second, Duke Energy Indiana will not request a retail electric base rate increase prior to March 2013, with the rates in effect not earlier than April 1, 2014. 
And finally, Duke Energy Indiana will incur approximately $20 million to reimburse to settling parties for attorney fees and litigation expenses, as well as make other funding commitments for low income heating assistance in Indiana. The agreement also includes certain measures which help mitigate the customer rate impact to the project. For example, we agreed to implement revised depreciation rates to the benefit of customers. 
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, customer rate impacts to this project are to be implemented as follows. First, recovery of project financing costs up to the hard cap amounts will be reflected in customer rates as soon as practical, upon commission approval and will result in an average increase in customer rates of 3.2%. And second, recovery of posted service costs such as O&M costs and depreciation is estimated to start mid-2013 based on our rider request to be filed after the expected in-service date of the plan, will result in the average increase in customer rates of 6.4%. Until such recovery is obtained, these posted service costs will be deferred following the in-service date of the project. 
The provisions of the settlement agreement resulted in the approximate $420 million pretax charge or roughly $0.20 EPS impact in the first quarter 2012. This impairment reduces the annual earnings contribution from this project by approximately $0.02 on an ongoing basis. 
I am pleased that the parties were able to reach this agreement. The agreement is balanced and reasonable and achieves 2 important objectives. First, it mitigates the cost impact of this project to our Indiana customers; and second, it resolves the regulatory uncertainty regarding construction cost recovery. We have requested the commission to establish a procedural schedule to address the settlement and expect the final commission decision at the summer or fall of this year. 
Our current focus is on bringing the Edwardsport facility to full operation later this year, allowing us to provide Indiana customers with cleaner power to meet increasingly strict federal environmental regulations, as well as utilize a readily available local resource, Indiana coal. 
Let me discuss the status of the Edwardsport construction project and our Carolina projects outlined on Slide 11. Construction of the Edwardsport IGCC project is essentially finished and the startup phase is well underway. The plant is undergoing an extensive testing process, with first fire gas turbines successfully completed in March. Edwardsport is scheduled to go online this fall. 
Cliffside is 97% complete with construction. Commissioning, startup and testing our plant equipment are currently underway. The plant's first fire on coal remains targeted for later in the second quarter. We plan to bring the plan online fiscal fall on-time and on budget. 
The 620-megawatt combined cycle Dan River gas plant is also on-time and on budget, with construction 85% complete and commercial operations scheduled for the fourth quarter. 
Finally, let me give you an update on our growing renewables business. Last week, we closed on a 50-50 joint venture partnership with, the 2 large-scale wind farms that Duke Energy renewables is building in Kansas, the 131-megawatt Summa 1, 2 project and the 168-megawatt project. Both projects are scheduled to go online later this year. In addition, we have 3 other wind projects currently under construction. 
We also continue to grow our renewable solar business, turning the addition of around 25 to 50 megawatts in new capacity this year. By the end of 2012, our total owned renewable capacity is expected to grow to almost 1,700 megawatts, an increase of about 60% since the end of last year. 
In closing, let me say I am very pleased with where we stand through the first quarter of 2012. We remain on track with our earnings objectives and have entered into constructive agreement on our Edwardsport project in Indiana. 
Slide 12 summarizes the key short-term and long-term parties we discussed during our year-end earnings call in February. For the rest of the year, we remain focused on our primary strategic objectives: first, obtaining the remaining regulatory approvals related to our merger with Progress; second, completing the remaining major construction projects; third, obtaining reasonable regulatory outcomes in the Edwardsport proceeding and our upcoming rate cases in the Carolinas and Ohio which we will likely file with regulators around midyear; and finally, achieving our earnings guidance range for the year. 
Our employees' hard work continues to support Duke Energy's ongoing mission of delivering affordable, reliable and clean energy, benefiting our customers, investors and the communities we serve.

We've had detailed conversations with the public staff in North Carolina. Our discussions are focused on what is the appropriate treatment for the $110 million investment in transmission. It has been focused on some additional flexibility with respect to our guarantee of $650 million in a joint dispatch in fuel blending. It's also been focused on other items such as our sale of electricity during the interim period. So we are very close to reaching agreement with the public staff, have not reached agreement with other parties with respect to this in North Carolina. And so more to come there and we hope to have a settlement soon. With respect to South Carolina, we're also working very closely with Duke Scott and his team so that we can satisfy his requirements.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. Today, we will review our quarterly earnings results, provide an update on economic activity and customer load growth trends, as well as summarize what we are experiencing with coal-to-gas switching. We will also review the status of our culmination with Progress Energy and discuss the settlement agreement we announced earlier this week with respect to the Edwardsport project in Indiana. This settlement agreement resolves uncertainty regarding the cost recovery of this important investment. I will review the terms of this settlement later in my remarks, and let me begin with an overview of the quarter. 
Today, we announced first quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.38. That compares to $0.39 in the first quarter of 2011. Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.22 as compared to $0.38 in the prior year. Current quarter reported results reflect $0.20 of charges related to the settlement agreement on the Edwardsport IGCC project in Indiana. This charge has been treated as a special item for the quarter. Consequently, it has been excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
The quarter was characterized by unusually mild weather across all of our service territories. In fact, this past winter was the fourth warmest winter season on record for the entire U.S. I am pleased with our employees' efforts to effectively manage costs during the quarter. This helped offset some of the impact from the weather. We also benefited from increases in customer prices in the Carolinas as a result of our rate case request last year. 
In our commercial businesses, international operations continue to deliver strong results, mitigating the reduced earnings we expected from our new ESP agreement in Ohio. In addition to cost control, our operational performance during the quarter was impressive. The regulated nuclear fleet delivered a capacity factor of 99.7%. Meanwhile, our nonregulated gas fleet in the Midwest continue to operate at record-generating levels, benefiting from low gas prices. 
I am pleased with where we stand at the end of the first quarter. While we cannot control the weather, I commend our employees for focusing on what we can control, specifically, our fleet and grid performance, as well as our expenses. Based upon our first quarter results, we are on track to achieve our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS guided range of $1.40 to $1.45. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn for more in-depth discussion of our financial performance for the quarter."

Slide 6 outlines the significant adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business segments for the quarter. As a reminder, we are now evaluating our business performance on the basis of segment income, rather than on our previous segment",1573,"Thank you, Jim. Slide 6 outlines the significant adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business segments for the quarter. As a reminder, we are now evaluating our business performance on the basis of segment income, rather than on our previous segment EBIT basis. As a result, earnings for each segment include interest and income tax expense. In addition, corporate governance costs, which were previously reflected in the category labeled other, are now allocated to each segment. 
First, let's review earnings for our regulated utilities, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas. Quarterly adjusted segment income was relatively flat with the prior year quarter. Revised customer rates in the Carolinas and lower operation and maintenance expense helped to offset the impact of unfavorable weather. 
Let me give you some perspective on the mild weather which affected earnings per share by about $0.04. In the Carolinas, we have the lowest level of heating degree days on record for the first quarter. Heating degree days were below normal by around 25% in the Carolinas and 28% in the Midwest. We were able to offset about $0.01 per share of the weather impact with reductions in our O&M costs during the quarter. Due to the unfavorable weather and the low natural gas price environment, we are generating fewer megawatt hours from our coal plants. 
We've examined our operations for opportunities to reduce cost. From a labor perspective, we have displaced contractors, reduced overtime and have not filled open positions. Additionally, we will defer certain scheduled outages if the plants are not running at the levels we originally anticipated. 
Assuming normal weather and storm activity, we expect our 2012 O&M to be down about 2% in 2011 as a result of the actions identified in the first quarter. We will maintain our focus on costs while also ensuring the continued safety of our employees and reliability of our systems. 
Also, during the quarter, FE&G began to realize the benefit of recent rate case outcomes in both North and South Carolina, which increased earnings per share by about $0.03. These revised rates primarily reflect recovery of investments in our fleet modernization program. 
Now let me move on to Duke Energy International, which continued to provide strong financial results. This segment's adjusted income increased principally due to higher volumes and pricing in Brazil, as well as at NMC, more than offsetting the impact of the prior-year favorable arbitration award in Peru. 
Finally, I'll briefly discuss the results for our nonregulated Commercial Power segment. As expected, Commercial Power's adjusted segment income was lower than the prior-year quarter primarily due to the impact of the new Electric Security Plan in Ohio. That plan resulted in a reduction to earnings per share of about $0.02. As you'll recall, under our new market-based ESP, our coal-fired generation dispatches into PJM. That generation receives an energy margin, as well as capacity revenues based upon PJM-clearing prices. Duke Energy Ohio is also collecting an annual $110 million non-bypassable stability charge through the end of 2014, adding $0.01 to the first quarter results. 
Our nonregulated Midwest gas fleet continued its strong performance, contributing around $0.01 more than in the first quarter of 2011. The gas fleet's earnings were supported by higher volumes and margins resulting from low gas prices. Our Midwest gas fleet dispatched about 1,900 gigawatt hours more than the prior year quarter, nearly a 70% increase. 
As expected, PJM capacity revenue received by the Midwest gas fleet was lower in first quarter 2012 as the capacity price fell from the $174 per megawatt day in the prior year to $110 per megawatt day. 
As a result of the reset of our ESP in Ohio to market-based rates, volumes and margins realized by our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail were lower than in the prior year quarter. This reduced earnings by around $0.01 per share. Despite a challenging environment, the Commercial Power team continues to work to control costs and optimize the performance of the nonregulated generating fleet. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'll spend a few minutes on our volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service territories. This slide presents our quarterly volume trends by customer class based on calculations that exclude weather impact. As a reminder, our 2012 guidance assumes we'll experience weather-normalized volume increases of about 0.7%, driven by expected growth of approximately 1% in both the industrial and commercial customer classes. 
On a weather-normal basis, quarterly volumes are around 1% higher than the prior-year period. However, most of the favorable trends was due to an extra day in first quarter 2012 resulting from leap year. This increase continues to be largely supported by industrial activity, which remains strong across both the Carolinas and Midwest. Weather-normalized industrial volumes were 2.6% higher in the prior-year quarter. This persists across several of our major industrial classes, specifically the automotive, chemical and heavy-equipment sectors. However, weakness continues in housing-related sectors and among our textile customers in the Carolinas. 
Economic development activities continue to remain strong in our service territories, bringing new investments and jobs. For example, car manufacturer, Michelin, announced last month that it will invest $750 million for a new plant and a factory expansion in South Carolina, when combined, are expected to create 500 new jobs. 
Let me move on to trends in the residential customer class. For the quarter, weather-normalized residential volumes were essentially flat, an increase of about 0.3%, visibly supported by the Carolinas. We are seeing positive trends in the number of residential customers being added in the Carolinas and Midwest. We've added approximately 20,000 more electric and gas customers from the prior-year quarter, an average growth of around 0.5%. Even though this level of growth is below what we were experiencing before the recession, it is significantly higher than the 5,000 customers we added at this same time last year. We continue, however, to experience a reduction in our residential customers' average kilowatt hour usage. Sluggish economic recovery, high gasoline prices and energy efficiency initiatives will all be influencing these usage patterns. 
Finally, weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were around 0.6% higher than the prior year. This customer class continues to be weighed down by high office and retail vacancy rates and low construction activity. The economy within our service territories maintains its slow recovery. Industrial activity remained strong, yet consumers continue to be cautious. And employment rates have improved but remain at historically high levels. Further, last week's announcement of first quarter U.S. GDP showed a slowing from the fourth quarter of last year. All of these factors leave us cautious and guardedly optimistic on the overall economic recovery. 
As we forecast the remainder of the year, we are seeing some challenges in our ability to achieve the 0.7% weather-normal volume growth assumed in our 2012 guidance. We will continue to monitor customer volume trends as we progress throughout the year. 
Finally, let me discuss the issue of coal-to-gas switching, which is resulting from the low natural gas price environment. The charts on Slide 8 show our generation fuel mix over the last 2 years and our current projection for 2012, both in the regulated businesses and in our nonregulated Midwest generation business. As demonstrated by these charts, the commodity price environment has significantly changed the mix of generation, resulting in less coal and more natural gas. For example, in the Carolinas, our Buck combined cycle gas plant, which became operational this past November, has been dispatching like a baseload-generating unit. In fact, it is currently dispatching just after our nuclear units in the Carolinas, ahead of even our most efficient coal unit. 
Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, our nonregulated Midwest gas-fired generation continues to run at high levels. In fact, 2011 was the third straight year this fleet achieved record-generation levels. And if low gas prices persist, 2012 is looking like another record year. As a result of reduced coal burns expected in 2012 from mild weather and low natural gas prices, our coal inventory levels have increased. 
Inventory levels are currently above our target of about 40 days in the Carolinas and about 45 days in Indiana. In 2009, the impacts of the economic recession put us in a similar situation. But we were able to work with our coal suppliers to effectively manage inventory levels. We are doing the same this year. 
We've had extensive discussions with our coal suppliers, and we're evaluating contract deferrals or buyouts, as well as additional coal storage options, both on and off-site. In February, we implemented a coal price decrement in Indiana, increasing the dispatch of our coal units. To the extent the units are dispatched, coal coming to the stations is consumed and other higher potential costs are avoided. Overall, customers benefit. We'll continue to monitor this situation and take appropriate action as needed. 
In summary, for the remainder of the year, we'll continue to monitor customer load growth trends, and our focus on effective cost control and operational performance to help drive our financial results. We remain on track to achieve $1.40 to $1.45 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range for 2012. However, actual results for the year will be largely dependent upon the third quarter, historically, our most significant. Additionally, we remain well positioned to achieve our target, 4% to 6% long-term growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share on a stand-alone basis. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jim."

Let me start with our pending merger with Progress. On March 26, Duke and Progress jointly filed a revised mitigation plan with the FERC to address their market power concerns. This slide summarizes the components of our revised mitigation p",1316,"Thanks, Lynn. Let me start with our pending merger with Progress. On March 26, Duke and Progress jointly filed a revised mitigation plan with the FERC to address their market power concerns. This slide summarizes the components of our revised mitigation plan. The filing features both interim and permanent mitigation components. 
The permanent mitigation solution involves the building and upgrading of transmission and an estimated cost of about $110 million. The transmission projects are designed to significantly increase power import capabilities and enhance competitive power supply options in the Progress and Duke Carolinas service territories. 
The proposal also features a 2- to 3-year interim mitigation plan with firm power purchase agreements already signed with 3 third parties. The agreements will be in place from the date the merger closes, until the transmission project's operational, at which time, the interim mitigation will terminate. The cost of this interim mitigation, which we're able to currently estimate, are included on this slide. 
Our regulatory and legal teams have spent considerable effort investigating solutions to address FERC's concerns about market power in the Carolinas. FERC's common period on our mitigation plan ended last week, and we responded to intervenor comments earlier this week. We believe that our revised mitigation plan addresses the FERC's concerns and that the  protest to the plan are without merit. We've requested that FERC issue orders approving the mitigation plan, the joint dispatch agreement and the joint open access transmission tariff no later than June 8. After satisfactory FERC approval, we will continue to seek final merger-related approvals from the North Carolina and South Carolina commissions. 
Over the past several weeks, we have had constructive discussions with the North Carolina public staff. These discussions have centered on how the cost of the proposed FERC mitigation plan will be handled for rate-making purposes, as well as some clarifications, including the timing on the $650 million guarantee of fuel and joint dispatch savings. We hope to have a revised settlement in place soon that balances the interests of consumers and shareholders. 
We have restarted our integration planning on a limited basis, focusing on those areas that are critical to day 1 operations of a combined Duke Progress. We will continue to keep you informed on developments regarding the merger in the weeks ahead. 
Next, let me review the Edwardsport settlement, an important milestone in achieving clarity on the cost recovery of this investment. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel Indiana related to recovery of construction costs for the project. This settlement is subject to the approval of the Indiana commission.
Let me highlight a few provisions of the agreement. First, the settlement includes a capital and construction cost, including financing costs to be reflected in customer rates of approximately $2.59 billion as of June 30. This amount includes approximately $2.32 billion of estimated direct costs, as well as estimated financing costs. To the extent we do not have a final commission order by June 30, Duke Energy Indiana will be able to recover additional financing costs until our customer rates are revised. 
Second, Duke Energy Indiana will not request a retail electric base rate increase prior to March 2013, with the rates in effect no earlier than April 1, 2014. 
And finally, Duke Energy Indiana will incur approximately $20 million to reimburse to settling parties for attorney fees and litigation expenses, as well as make other funding commitments for low-income heating assistance in Indiana. The agreement also includes certain measures which help mitigate the customer rate impact of the project. For example, we agreed to implement revised depreciation rates to the benefit of customers. 
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, customer rate impacts of this project are to be implemented as follows: First, recovery of project financing costs up to the hard cap amounts will be reflected in customer rates as soon as practical, upon commission approval and will result in an average increase in customer rates of 3.2%; and second, recovery of posted service costs such as O&M costs and depreciation is estimated to start mid-2013 based on our rider request to be filed after the expected in-service date of the plan, will result in the average increase in customer rates of 6.4%. Until such recovery is obtained, these posted service costs will be deferred following the in-service date of the project. 
Provisions of the settlement agreement resulted in an approximate $420 million pretax charge or roughly a $0.20 EPS impact in the first quarter 2012. This impairment reduces the annual earnings contribution from this project by approximately $0.02 on an ongoing basis. I am pleased that the parties were able to reach this agreement. 
The agreement is balanced and reasonable and achieves 2 important objectives: First, it mitigates the cost impact of this project to our Indiana customers; and second, it resolves the regulatory uncertainty regarding construction cost recovery. We have requested the commission to establish a procedural schedule to address the settlement and expect the final commission decision at the summer or fall of this year. 
Our current focus is on bringing the Edwardsport facility to full operation later this year, allowing us to provide Indiana customers with cleaner power to meet increasingly strict federal environmental regulations, as well as utilize a readily available local resource, Indiana coal. 
Let me discuss the status of the Edwardsport construction project and our Carolina projects outlined on Slide 11. Construction of the Edwardsport IGCC project is essentially finished and the start-up phase is well underway. The plant is undergoing an extensive testing process, with first fire for both gas turbines successfully completed in March. Edwardsport is on schedule to go online this fall. 
Cliffside is 97% complete with construction. Commissioning, start-up and testing of plant equipment are currently underway. The plant's first fire on coal remains targeted for later in the second quarter. We plan to bring the plant online this fall on-time and on budget. 
The 620-megawatt combined cycle Dan River gas plant is also on time and on budget, with construction 85% complete and commercial operations scheduled for the fourth quarter. 
Finally, let me give you an update on our growing Renewables business. Last week, we closed on a 50-50 joint venture partnership with, Sumitomo for 2 large-scale wind farms that Duke Energy Renewables is building in Kansas, the 131-megawatt Cimarron II project and the 168-megawatt Ironwood project. Both projects are scheduled to go online later this year. In addition, we have 3 other wind projects currently under construction. 
We also continue to grow our renewable solar business, targeting the addition of around 25 to 50 megawatts in new capacity this year. By the end of 2012, our total owned renewable capacity is expected to grow to almost 1,700 megawatts, an increase of about 60% since the end of last year. 
In closing, let me say I am very pleased with where we stand through the first quarter of 2012. We remain on track with our earnings objectives and have entered into constructive agreement on our Edwardsport project in Indiana. 
Slide 12 summarizes the key short-term and long-term priorities we discussed during our year-end earnings call in February. For the rest of the year, we remain focused on our primary strategic objectives: First, obtaining the remaining regulatory approvals related to our merger with Progress; second, completing the remaining major construction projects; third, obtaining reasonable regulatory outcomes in the Edwardsport proceeding and our upcoming rate cases in the Carolinas and Ohio which we will likely file with regulators around mid-year; and finally, achieving our earnings guidance range for the year. 
Our employees' hard work continues to support Duke Energy's ongoing mission of delivering affordable, reliable and clean energy, benefiting our customers, investors and the communities we serve.

In the interim period, we're working with the public staff in North Carolina, as well as the consumer council in South Carolina to reach settlement agreements that we can present to the state commissions for their approval. We've had detailed conversations with the public staff in North Carolina. Our discussions have focused on what is the appropriate treatment for the $110 million investment in transmission. It has been focused on some additional flexibility with respect to our guarantee of $650 million in a joint dispatch in fuel blending. It's also been focused on other items such as our sale of electricity during the interim period. So we are very close to reaching agreement with the public staff, have not reached agreement with other parties with respect to this in North Carolina. And so more to come there, and we hope to have a settlement soon. With respect to South Carolina, we're also working very closely with Dukes Scott and his team so that we can satisfy his requirements. And I think an important part of the relationship between North and South Carolina is that Dukes Scott negotiated early on a Most Favored Nation's Clause, which really allows them to track whatever agreement is reached between us and the public staff in North Carolina."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. Today, we will review our quarterly earnings results, provide an update on economic activity and customer load growth trends, as well as summarize what we are experiencing with coal-to-gas switching. We will also review the status of our combination with Progress Energy and discuss the settlement agreement we announced earlier this week with respect to the Edwardsport project in Indiana. This settlement agreement resolves uncertainty regarding the cost recovery of this important investment. I will review the terms of this settlement later in my remarks, but let me begin with an overview of the quarter. 
Today, we announced first quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.38. That compares to $0.39 in the first quarter of 2011. Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.22 as compared to $0.38 in the prior year. Current quarter reported results reflect $0.20 of charges related to the settlement agreement on the Edwardsport IGCC project in Indiana. This charge has been treated as a special item for the quarter. Consequently, it has been excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
The quarter was characterized by unusually mild weather across all of our service territories. In fact, this past winter was the fourth warmest winter season on record for the entire U.S. I am pleased with our employees' efforts to effectively manage costs during the quarter. This helped offset some of the impact from the weather. We also benefited from increases in customer prices in the Carolinas as a result of our rate case request last year. 
In our commercial businesses, international operations continue to deliver strong results, mitigating the reduced earnings we expected from our new ESP agreement in Ohio. In addition to cost control, our operational performance during the quarter was impressive. The regulated nuclear fleet delivered a capacity factor of 99.7%. Meanwhile, our nonregulated gas fleet in the Midwest continued to operate at record-generating levels, benefiting from low gas prices. 
I am pleased with where we stand at the end of the first quarter. While we cannot control the weather, I commend our employees for focusing on what we can control, specifically our fleet and grid performance, as well as our expenses. Based upon our first quarter results, we are on track to achieve our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS guided range of $1.40 to $1.45. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn for a more in-depth discussion of our financial performance for the quarter."

Slide 6 outlines the significant adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business segments for the quarter. As a reminder, we are now evaluating our business performance on the basis of segment income, rather than on our previous segment",1572,"Thank you, Jim. Slide 6 outlines the significant adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business segments for the quarter. As a reminder, we are now evaluating our business performance on the basis of segment income, rather than on our previous segment EBIT basis. As a result, earnings for each segment include interest and income tax expense. In addition, corporate governance costs, which were previously reflected in the category labeled Other, are now allocated to each segment. 
First, let's review earnings for our regulated utilities, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas. Quarterly adjusted segment income was relatively flat with the prior year quarter. Revised customer rates in the Carolinas and lower operation and maintenance expense helped to offset the impact of unfavorable weather. 
Let me give you some perspective on the mild weather, which affected earnings per share by about $0.04. In the Carolinas, we had the lowest level of heating degree days on record for the first quarter. Heating degree days were below normal by around 25% in the Carolinas and 28% in the Midwest. We were able to offset about $0.01 per share of the weather impact with reductions in our O&M costs during the quarter. Due to the unfavorable weather and the low natural gas price environment, we are generating fewer megawatt hours from our coal plants. 
We've examined our operations for opportunities to reduce cost. From a labor perspective, we have displaced contractors, reduced overtime and have not filled open positions. Additionally, we will defer certain scheduled outages since the plants are not running at the levels we originally anticipated. Assuming normal weather and storm activity, we expect our 2012 O&M to be down about 2% from 2011 as a result of the actions identified in the first quarter. We will maintain our focus on costs while also ensuring the continued safety of our employees and reliability of our systems. 
Also during the quarter, FE&G began to realize the benefit of recent rate case outcomes in both North and South Carolina, which increased earnings per share by about $0.03. These revised rates primarily reflect recovery of investments in our fleet modernization program. 
Now let me move on to Duke Energy International, which continued to provide strong financial results. This segment's adjusted income increased principally due to higher volumes and pricing in Brazil, as well as at NMC, more than offsetting the impact of the prior year favorable arbitration award in Peru. 
Finally, I'll briefly discuss the results for our nonregulated Commercial Power segment. As expected, Commercial Power's adjusted segment income was lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to the impact of the new Electric Security Plan in Ohio. That plan resulted in a reduction to earnings per share of about $0.02. As you'll recall, under our new market-based ESP, our coal-fired generation dispatches into PJM. That generation receives an energy margin, as well as capacity revenues based upon PJM clearing prices. Duke Energy Ohio is also collecting an annual $110-million non-bypassable stability charge through the end of 2014, adding $0.01 to the first quarter results. 
Our nonregulated Midwest gas fleet continued its strong performance, contributing around $0.01 more than in the first quarter of 2011. The gas fleet's earnings were supported by higher volumes and margins resulting from low gas prices. Our Midwest gas fleet dispatched about 1,900 gigawatt-hours more than the prior year quarter, nearly a 70% increase. As expected, PJM capacity revenue received by the Midwest gas fleet was lower in first quarter 2012 as the capacity price fell from the $174 per megawatt-day in the prior year to $110 per megawatt-day. 
As a result of the reset of our ESP in Ohio to market-based rates, volumes and margins realized by our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail, were lower than in the prior year quarter. This reduced earnings by around $0.01 per share. Despite a challenging environment, the Commercial Power team continues to work to control costs and optimize the performance of the nonregulated generating fleet. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'll spend a few minutes on our volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service territories. This slide presents our quarterly volume trends by customer class based on calculations that exclude weather impact. As a reminder, our 2012 guidance assumes we'll experience weather-normalized volume increases of about 0.7%, driven by expected growth of approximately 1% in both the industrial and commercial customer classes. 
On a weather-normal basis, quarterly volumes were around 1% higher than the prior year period. However, most of this favorable trend was due to an extra day in first quarter 2012 resulting from leap year. This increase continues to be largely supported by industrial activity, which remains strong across both the Carolinas and Midwest. Weather-normalized industrial volumes were 2.6% higher than the prior-year quarter. Growth persists across several major industrial classes, specifically the automotive, chemical and heavy-equipment sectors. However, weakness continues in housing-related sectors and among our textile customers in the Carolinas. 
Economic development activities continue to remain strong in our service territories, bringing new investments and jobs. For example, tire manufacturer Michelin announced last month that it will invest $750 million for a new plant and a factory expansion in South Carolina, that combined are expected to create 500 new jobs. 
Let me move on to trends in the residential customer class. For the quarter, weather-normalized residential volumes were essentially flat, an increase of about 0.3%, principally supported by the Carolinas. We are seeing positive trends in the number of residential customers being added in the Carolinas and Midwest. We've added approximately 20,000 more electric and gas customers from the prior year quarter, an average growth of around 0.5%. Even though this level of growth is below what we were experiencing before the recession, it is significantly higher than the 5,000 customers we added at the same time last year. We continue, however, to experience a reduction in our residential customers' average kilowatt-hour usage. A sluggish economic recovery, high gasoline prices and energy efficiency initiatives may all be influencing these usage patterns. 
Finally, weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were around 0.6% higher than the prior year. This customer class continues to be weighed down by high office and retail vacancy rates and low construction activity.
The economy within our service territories maintains its slow recovery. Industrial activity remained strong, yet consumers continue to be cautious. Unemployment rates have improved but remain at historically high levels. Further, last week's announcement of first quarter U.S. GDP showed a slowing from the fourth quarter of last year. All of these factors leave us cautious and guardedly optimistic on the overall economic recovery. 
As we forecast the remainder of the year, we are seeing some challenges in our ability to achieve the 0.7% weather-normal volume growth assumed in our 2012 guidance. We will continue to monitor customer volume trends as we progress throughout the year. 
Finally, let me discuss the issue of coal-to-gas switching, which is resulting from the low natural gas price environment. The charts on Slide 8 show our generation fuel mix over the last 2 years and our current projection for 2012, both in the regulated businesses and in our nonregulated Midwest generation business. As demonstrated by these charts, the commodity price environment has significantly changed the mix of generation, resulting in less coal and more natural gas. For example, in the Carolinas, our Buck combined cycle gas plant, which became operational this past November, has been dispatching like a baseload-generating unit. In fact, it is currently dispatching just after our nuclear units in the Carolinas, ahead of even our most efficient coal units. 
Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, our nonregulated Midwest gas-fired generation continues to run at high levels. In fact, 2011 was the third straight year this fleet achieved record generation levels. And if low gas prices persist, 2012 is looking like another record year.
As a result of reduced coal burns expected in 2012 from mild weather and low natural gas prices, our coal inventory levels have increased. Inventory levels are currently above our target of about 40 days in the Carolinas and about 45 days in Indiana. In 2009, the impacts of the economic recession put us in a similar situation, but we were able to work with our coal suppliers to effectively manage inventory levels. We are doing the same this year. 
We've had extensive discussions with our coal suppliers, and we're evaluating contract deferrals or buyouts, as well as additional coal storage options, both on and off-site. In February, we implemented a coal price decrement in Indiana, increasing the dispatch of our coal units. To the extent the units are dispatched, coal coming to the stations is consumed and other higher potential costs are avoided. Overall, customers benefit. We'll continue to monitor this situation and take appropriate action as needed. 
In summary, for the remainder of the year, we'll continue to monitor customer load growth trends, and our focus on effective cost control and operational performance to help drive our financial results. We remain on track to achieve $1.40 to $1.45 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range for 2012. However, actual results for the year will be largely dependent upon the third quarter, historically our most significant. Additionally, we remain well positioned to achieve our targeted 4% to 6% long-term growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share on a stand-alone basis. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jim."

Let me start with our pending merger with Progress. On March 26, Duke and Progress jointly filed a revised mitigation plan with the FERC to address their market power concerns. This slide summarizes the components of our revised mitigation p",1314,"Thanks, Lynn. Let me start with our pending merger with Progress. On March 26, Duke and Progress jointly filed a revised mitigation plan with the FERC to address their market power concerns. This slide summarizes the components of our revised mitigation plan. The filing features both interim and permanent mitigation components. 
The permanent mitigation solution involves the building and upgrading of transmission and an estimated cost of about $110 million. The transmission projects are designed to significantly increase power import capabilities and enhance competitive power supply options in the Progress and Duke Carolinas service territories. 
The proposal also features a 2- to 3-year interim mitigation plan with firm power purchase agreements already signed with 3 third parties. The agreements will be in place from the date the merger closes until the transmission projects are operational, at which time the interim mitigation will terminate. The costs of this interim mitigation, which we're able to currently estimate, are included on this slide. 
Our regulatory and legal teams have spent considerable effort investigating solutions to address FERC's concerns about market power in the Carolinas. FERC's common period on our mitigation plan ended last week, and we responded to intervenor comments earlier this week. We believe that our revised mitigation plan addresses the FERC's concerns and that the protests to the plan are without merit. We've requested that FERC issue orders approving the mitigation plan, the joint dispatch agreement and the joint open access transmission tariff no later than June 8. After satisfactory FERC approval, we will continue to seek final merger-related approvals from the North Carolina and South Carolina commissions. 
Over the past several weeks, we have had constructive discussions with the North Carolina public staff. These discussions have centered on how the cost of the proposed FERC mitigation plan will be handled for rate-making purposes, as well as some clarifications, including the timing on the $650-million guarantee of fuel and joint dispatch savings. We hope to have a revised settlement in place soon that balances the interests of consumers and shareholders. 
We have restarted our integration planning on a limited basis, focusing on those areas that are critical to day 1 operations of a combined Duke Progress. We will continue to keep you informed on developments regarding the merger in the weeks ahead. 
Next, let me review the Edwardsport settlement, an important milestone in achieving clarity on the cost recovery of this investment. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel-Indiana related to recovery of construction costs for the project. This settlement is subject to the approval of the Indiana commission.
Let me highlight a few provisions of the agreement. First, the settlement includes a cap a construction costs, including financing costs, to be reflected in customer rates of approximately $2.59 billion as of June 30. This amount includes approximately $2.32 billion of estimated direct costs, as well as estimated financing costs. To the extent we do not have a final commission order by June 30, Duke Energy Indiana will be able to recover additional financing costs until customer rates are revised. 
Second, Duke Energy Indiana will not request a retail electric base rate increase prior to March 2013, with the rates in effect no earlier than April 1, 2014. 
And finally, Duke Energy Indiana will incur approximately $20 million to reimburse to settling parties for attorney fees and litigation expenses, as well as make other funding commitments for low-income heating assistance in Indiana. The agreement also includes certain measures which help mitigate the customer rate impact of the project. For example, we agreed to implement revised depreciation rates to the benefit of customers. 
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, customer rate impacts of this project are to be implemented as follows: first, recovery of project financing costs up to the hard cap amounts will be reflected in customer rates as soon as practical, upon commission approval, and will result in an average increase in customer rates of 3.2%; and second, recovery of posted service costs such as O&M costs and depreciation is estimated to start mid-2013 based on our rider request to be filed after the expected in-service date of the plan, will result in the average increase in customer rates of 6.4%. Until such recovery is obtained, these posted service costs will be deferred following the in-service date of the project. 
Provisions of the settlement agreement resulted in an approximate $420-million pretax charge or roughly a $0.20 EPS impact in the first quarter 2012. This impairment reduces the annual earnings contribution from this project by approximately $0.02 on an ongoing basis. I am pleased that the parties were able to reach this agreement. 
The agreement is balanced and reasonable and achieves 2 important objectives: first, it mitigates the cost impact of this project to our Indiana customers; and second, it resolves the regulatory uncertainty regarding construction cost recovery. We have requested the commission to establish a procedural schedule to address the settlement and expect a final commission decision at the summer or fall of this year. 
Our current focus is on bringing the Edwardsport facility to full operation later this year, allowing us to provide Indiana customers with cleaner power to meet increasingly strict federal environmental regulations, as well as utilize a readily available local resource, Indiana coal. 
Let me discuss the status of the Edwardsport construction project and our Carolina projects outlined on Slide 11. Construction of the Edwardsport IGCC project is essentially finished and the start-up phase is well underway. The plant is undergoing an extensive testing process, with first fire for both gas turbines successfully completed in March. Edwardsport is on schedule to go online this fall. 
Cliffside is 97% complete with construction. Commissioning, start-up and testing of plant equipment are currently underway. The plant's first fire on coal remains targeted for later in the second quarter. We plan to bring the plant online this fall on time and on budget. 
The 620-megawatt combined cycle Dan River gas plant is also on time and on budget, with construction 85% complete and commercial operations scheduled for the fourth quarter. 
Finally, let me give you an update on our growing renewables business. Last week, we closed on a 50-50 joint venture partnership with Sumitomo for 2 large-scale wind farms that Duke Energy Renewables is building in Kansas: the 131-megawatt Cimarron II project and the 168-megawatt Ironwood project. Both projects are scheduled to go online later this year. In addition, we have 3 other wind projects currently under construction. 
We also continue to grow our renewable solar business, targeting the addition of around 25 to 50 megawatts in new capacity this year. By the end of 2012, our total owned renewable capacity is expected to grow to almost 1,700 megawatts, an increase of about 60% since the end of last year. 
In closing, let me say I am very pleased with where we stand through the first quarter of 2012. We remain on track with our earnings objectives and have entered into constructive agreement on our Edwardsport project in Indiana. 
Slide 12 summarizes the key short-term and long-term priorities we discussed during our year-end earnings call in February. For the rest of the year, we remain focused on our primary strategic objectives: first, obtaining the remaining regulatory approvals related to our merger with Progress; second, completing the remaining major construction projects; third, obtaining reasonable regulatory outcomes in the Edwardsport proceeding and our upcoming rate cases in the Carolinas and Ohio, which we will likely file with regulators around mid-year; and finally, achieving our earnings guidance range for the year. 
Our employees' hard work continues to support Duke Energy's ongoing mission of delivering affordable, reliable and clean energy, benefiting our customers, investors and the communities we serve.

And so more to come there, and we hope to have a settlement soon. With respect to South Carolina, we're also working very closely with Dukes Scott and his team so that we can satisfy his requirements.

Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.22 as compared to $0.38 in the prior year. Current quarter reported results reflect $0.20 of charges related to the settlement agreement on the Edwardsport IGCC project in Indiana. This charge has been treated as a special item for the quarter. Consequently, it has been excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
The quarter was characterized by unusually mild weather across all of our service territories. In fact, this past winter was the fourth warmest winter season on record for the entire U.S. I am pleased with our employees' efforts to effectively manage costs during the quarter. This helped offset some of the impact from the weather. We also benefited from increases in customer prices in the Carolinas as a result of our rate case request last year. 
In our commercial businesses, international operations continue to deliver strong results, mitigating the reduced earnings we expected from our new ESP agreement in Ohio. In addition to cost control, our operational performance during the quarter was impressive. The regulated nuclear fleet delivered a capacity factor of 99.7%. Meanwhile, our nonregulated gas fleet in the Midwest continued to operate at record-generating levels, benefiting from low gas prices. 
I am pleased with where we stand at the end of the first quarter. While we cannot control the weather, I commend our employees for focusing on what we can control, specifically our fleet and grid performance, as well as our expenses. Based upon our first quarter results, we are on track to achieve our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS guided range of $1.40 to $1.45. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn for a more in-depth discussion of our financial performance for the quarter."

Slide 6 outlines the significant adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business segments for the quarter. As a reminder, we are now evaluating our business performance on the basis of segment income, rather than on our previous segment EBIT basis. As a result, earnings for each segment include interest and income tax expense. In addition, corporate governance costs, which were previously reflected in the category labeled other, are now allocated to each segment. 
First, let's review earnings for our regulated utilities, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas. Quarterly adjusted segment income was relatively flat with the prior year quarter. Revised customer rates in the Carolinas and lower operation and maintenance expense helped to offset the impact of unfavorable weather. 
Let me give you some perspective on the mild weather, which affected earnings per share by about $0.04. In the Carolinas, we had the lowest level of heating degree days on record for the first quarter. Heating degree days were below normal by around 25% in the Carolinas and 28% in the Midwest. We were able to offset about $0.01 per share of the weather impact with reductions in our O&M costs during the quarter. Due to the unfavorable weather and the low natural gas price environment, we are generating fewer megawatt hours from our coal plants. 
We've examined our operations for opportunities to reduce cost. From a labor perspective, we have displaced contractors, reduced overtime and have not filled open positions. Additionally, we will defer certain scheduled outages since the plants are not running at the levels we originally anticipated. Assuming normal weather and storm activity, we expect our 2012 O&M to be down about 2% from 2011 as a result of the actions identified in the first quarter. We will maintain our focus on costs while also ensuring the continued safety of our employees and reliability of our systems. 
Also during the quarter, FE&G began to realize the benefit of recent rate case outcomes in both North and South Carolina, which increased earnings per share by about $0.03. These revised rates primarily reflect recovery of investments in our fleet modernization program. 
Now let me move on to Duke Energy International, which continued to provide strong financial results. This segment's adjusted income increased principally due to higher volumes and pricing in Brazil, as well as at NMC, more than offsetting the impact of the prior year favorable arbitration award in Peru. 
Finally, I'll briefly discuss the results for our nonregulated Commercial Power segment. As expected, Commercial Power's adjusted segment income was lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to the impact of the new Electric Security Plan in Ohio. That plan resulted in a reduction to earnings per share of about $0.02. As you'll recall, under our new market-based ESP, our coal-fired generation dispatches into PJM. That generation receives an energy margin, as well as capacity revenues based upon PJM clearing prices. Duke Energy Ohio is also collecting an annual $110 million non-bypassable stability charge through the end of 2014, adding $0.01 to the first quarter results. 
Our nonregulated Midwest gas fleet continued its strong performance, contributing around $0.01 more than in the first quarter of 2011. The gas fleet's earnings were supported by higher volumes and margins resulting from low gas prices. Our Midwest gas fleet dispatched about 1,900 gigawatt hours more than the prior year quarter, nearly a 70% increase. As expected, PJM capacity revenue received by the Midwest gas fleet was lower in first quarter 2012 as the capacity price fell from the $174 per megawatt day in the prior year to $110 per megawatt day. 
As a result of the reset of our ESP in Ohio to market-based rates, volumes and margins realized by our competitive retail arm, Duke Energy Retail, were lower than in the prior year quarter. This reduced earnings by around $0.01 per share. Despite a challenging environment, the Commercial Power team continues to work to control costs and optimize the performance of the nonregulated generating fleet. 
Turning to Slide 7, I'll spend a few minutes on our volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service territories. This slide presents our quarterly volume trends by customer class based on calculations that exclude weather impact. As a reminder, our 2012 guidance assumes we'll experience weather-normalized volume increases of about 0.7%, driven by expected growth of approximately 1% in both the industrial and commercial customer classes. 
On a weather-normal basis, quarterly volumes were around 1% higher than the prior year period. However, most of this favorable trend was due to an extra day in first quarter 2012 resulting from leap year. This increase continues to be largely supported by industrial activity, which remains strong across both the Carolinas and Midwest. Weather-normalized industrial volumes were 2.6% higher than the prior year quarter. Growth persists across several major industrial classes, specifically the automotive, chemical and heavy-equipment sectors. However, weakness continues in housing-related sectors and among our textile customers in the Carolinas. 
Economic development activities continue to remain strong in our service territories, bringing new investments and jobs. For example, tire manufacturer Michelin announced last month that it will invest $750 million for a new plant and a factory expansion in South Carolina, that combined are expected to create 500 new jobs. 
Let me move on to trends in the residential customer class. For the quarter, weather-normalized residential volumes were essentially flat, an increase of about 0.3%, principally supported by the Carolinas. We are seeing positive trends in the number of residential customers being added in the Carolinas and Midwest. We've added approximately 20,000 more electric and gas customers from the prior year quarter, an average growth of around 0.5%. Even though this level of growth is below what we were experiencing before the recession, it is significantly higher than the 5,000 customers we added at the same time last year. We continue, however, to experience a reduction in our residential customers' average kilowatt hour usage. A sluggish economic recovery, high gasoline prices and energy efficiency initiatives may all be influencing these usage patterns. 
Finally, weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were around 0.6% higher than the prior year. This customer class continues to be weighed down by high office and retail vacancy rates and low construction activity.
The economy within our service territories maintains its slow recovery. Industrial activity remained strong, yet consumers continue to be cautious. Unemployment rates have improved but remain at historically high levels. Further, last week's announcement of first quarter U.S. GDP showed a slowing from the fourth quarter of last year. All of these factors leave us cautious and guardedly optimistic on the overall economic recovery. 
As we forecast the remainder of the year, we are seeing some challenges in our ability to achieve the 0.7% weather-normal volume growth assumed in our 2012 guidance. We will continue to monitor customer volume trends as we progress throughout the year. 
Finally, let me discuss the issue of coal-to-gas switching, which is resulting from the low natural gas price environment. The charts on Slide 8 show our generation fuel mix over the last 2 years and our current projection for 2012, both in the regulated businesses and in our nonregulated Midwest generation business. As demonstrated by these charts, the commodity price environment has significantly changed the mix of generation, resulting in less coal and more natural gas. For example, in the Carolinas, our Buck combined cycle gas plant, which became operational this past November, has been dispatching like a baseload generating unit. In fact, it is currently dispatching just after our nuclear units in the Carolinas, ahead of even our most efficient coal units. 
Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, our nonregulated Midwest gas-fired generation continues to run at high levels. In fact, 2011 was the third straight year this fleet achieved record generation levels. And if low gas prices persist, 2012 is looking like another record year.
As a result of reduced coal burns expected in 2012 from mild weather and low natural gas prices, our coal inventory levels have increased. Inventory levels are currently above our target of about 40 days in the Carolinas and about 45 days in Indiana. In 2009, the impacts of the economic recession put us in a similar situation, but we were able to work with our coal suppliers to effectively manage inventory levels. We are doing the same this year. 
We've had extensive discussions with our coal suppliers, and we're evaluating contract deferrals or buyouts, as well as additional coal storage options, both on and off-site. In February, we implemented a coal price decrement in Indiana, increasing the dispatch of our coal units. To the extent the units are dispatched, coal coming to the stations is consumed and other higher potential costs are avoided. Overall, customers benefit. We'll continue to monitor this situation and take appropriate action as needed. 
In summary, for the remainder of the year, we'll continue to monitor customer load growth trends, and our focus on effective cost control and operational performance to help drive our financial results. We remain on track to achieve $1.40 to $1.45 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range for 2012. However, actual results for the year will be largely dependent upon the third quarter, historically our most significant. Additionally, we remain well positioned to achieve our targeted 4% to 6% long-term growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share on a stand-alone basis. 
Now I'll turn it back over to Jim."

Let me start with our pending merger with Progress. On March 26, Duke and Progress jointly filed a revised mitigation plan with the FERC to address their market power concerns. This slide summarizes the components of our revised mitigation p",1316,"Thanks, Lynn. Let me start with our pending merger with Progress. On March 26, Duke and Progress jointly filed a revised mitigation plan with the FERC to address their market power concerns. This slide summarizes the components of our revised mitigation plan. The filing features both interim and permanent mitigation components. 
The permanent mitigation solution involves the building and upgrading of transmission and an estimated cost of about $110 million. The transmission projects are designed to significantly increase power import capabilities and enhance competitive power supply options in the Progress and Duke Carolinas service territories. 
The proposal also features a 2- to 3-year interim mitigation plan with firm power purchase agreements already signed with 3 third parties. The agreements will be in place from the date the merger closes until the transmission projects are operational, at which time the interim mitigation will terminate. The costs of this interim mitigation, which we're able to currently estimate, are included on this slide. 
Our regulatory and legal teams have spent considerable effort investigating solutions to address FERC's concerns about market power in the Carolinas. FERC's common period on our mitigation plan ended last week, and we responded to intervenor comments earlier this week. We believe that our revised mitigation plan addresses the FERC's concerns and that the protests to the plan are without merit. We've requested that FERC issue orders approving the mitigation plan, the joint dispatch agreement and the joint open access transmission tariff no later than June 8. After satisfactory FERC approval, we will continue to seek final merger-related approvals from the North Carolina and South Carolina commissions. 
Over the past several weeks, we have had constructive discussions with the North Carolina public staff. These discussions have centered on how the cost of the proposed FERC mitigation plan will be handled for rate-making purposes, as well as some clarifications, including the timing on the $650 million guarantee of fuel and joint dispatch savings. We hope to have a revised settlement in place soon that balances the interests of consumers and shareholders. 
We have restarted our integration planning on a limited basis, focusing on those areas that are critical to day 1 operations of a combined Duke Progress. We will continue to keep you informed on developments regarding the merger in the weeks ahead. 
Next, let me review the Edwardsport settlement, an important milestone in achieving clarity on the cost recovery of this investment. Earlier this week, we announced an agreement with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the Duke Energy Indiana Industrial Group and Nucor Steel-Indiana related to recovery of construction costs for the project. This settlement is subject to the approval of the Indiana commission.
Let me highlight a few provisions of the agreement. First, the settlement includes a cap of construction costs, including financing costs, to be reflected in customer rates of approximately $2.59 billion as of June 30. This amount includes approximately $2.32 billion of estimated direct costs, as well as estimated financing costs. To the extent we do not have a final commission order by June 30, Duke Energy Indiana will be able to recover additional financing costs until customer rates are revised. 
Second, Duke Energy Indiana will not request a retail electric base rate increase prior to March 2013, with the rates in effect no earlier than April 1, 2014. 
And finally, Duke Energy Indiana will incur approximately $20 million to reimburse to settling parties for attorney fees and litigation expenses, as well as make other funding commitments for low-income heating assistance in Indiana. The agreement also includes certain measures which help mitigate the customer rate impact of the project. For example, we agreed to implement revised depreciation rates to the benefit of customers. 
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, customer rate impacts of this project are to be implemented as follows: first, recovery of project financing costs up to the hard cap amounts will be reflected in customer rates as soon as practical, upon commission approval, and will result in an average increase in customer rates of 3.2%; and second, recovery of posted service costs such as O&M costs and depreciation is estimated to start mid-2013 based on our rider request to be filed after the expected in-service date of the plan, will result in the average increase in customer rates of 6.4%. Until such recovery is obtained, these posted service costs will be deferred following the in-service date of the project. 
Provisions of the settlement agreement resulted in an approximate $420 million pretax charge or roughly a $0.20 EPS impact in the first quarter 2012. This impairment reduces the annual earnings contribution from this project by approximately $0.02 on an ongoing basis. I am pleased that the parties were able to reach this agreement. 
The agreement is balanced and reasonable and achieves 2 important objectives: first, it mitigates the cost impact of this project to our Indiana customers; and second, it resolves the regulatory uncertainty regarding construction cost recovery. We have requested the commission to establish a procedural schedule to address the settlement and expect a final commission decision at the summer or fall of this year. 
Our current focus is on bringing the Edwardsport facility to full operation later this year, allowing us to provide Indiana customers with cleaner power to meet increasingly strict federal environmental regulations, as well as utilize a readily available local resource, Indiana coal. 
Let me discuss the status of the Edwardsport construction project and our Carolina projects outlined on Slide 11. Construction of the Edwardsport IGCC project is essentially finished and the start-up phase is well underway. The plant is undergoing an extensive testing process, with first fire for both gas turbines successfully completed in March. Edwardsport is on schedule to go online this fall. 
Cliffside is 97% complete with construction. Commissioning, start-up and testing of plant equipment are currently underway. The plant's first fire on coal remains targeted for later in the second quarter. We plan to bring the plant online this fall on time and on budget. 
The 620-megawatt combined cycle Dan River gas plant is also on time and on budget, with construction 85% complete and commercial operations scheduled for the fourth quarter. 
Finally, let me give you an update on our growing renewables business. Last week, we closed on a 50-50 joint venture partnership with Sumitomo for 2 large-scale wind farms that Duke Energy Renewables is building in Kansas: the 131-megawatt Cimarron II project and the 168-megawatt Ironwood project. Both projects are scheduled to go online later this year. In addition, we have 3 other wind projects currently under construction. 
We also continue to grow our renewable solar business, targeting the addition of around 25 to 50 megawatts in new capacity this year. By the end of 2012, our total owned renewable capacity is expected to grow to almost 1,700 megawatts, an increase of about 60% since the end of last year. 
In closing, let me say I am very pleased with where we stand through the first quarter of 2012. We remain on track with our earnings objectives and have entered into constructive agreement on our Edwardsport project in Indiana. 
Slide 12 summarizes the key short-term and long-term priorities we discussed during our year-end earnings call in February. For the rest of the year, we remain focused on our primary strategic objectives: first, obtaining the remaining regulatory approvals related to our merger with Progress; second, completing the remaining major construction projects; third, obtaining reasonable regulatory outcomes in the Edwardsport proceeding and our upcoming rate cases in the Carolinas and Ohio, which we will likely file with regulators around mid-year; and finally, achieving our earnings guidance range for the year. 
Our employees' hard work continues to support Duke Energy's ongoing mission of delivering affordable, reliable and clean energy, benefiting our customers, investors and the communities we serve.

You expected it to be up year-over-year about $0.12. Nowhere in there is there any bullet points for O&M cost reductions. And yet, based on the commentary and what I'm seeing in the abbreviated data at the back of your release, it seems like you've actually managed O&M down a bit in the first quarter. Can you comment on that? Can you comment on expectations for O&M for the rest of the year relative to last year, both at USF&G and maybe at Commercial Power?"

We have taken some actions that now put us in a position to forecast that O&M will be down 2% year-over-year. This gives us some flexibility in FE&G as a result of the start to the year. So that's the way I would think about it. In commercial, a lot of the O&M in commercial can actually be tied to generation, specifically in Latin America.

Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us on the call this morning. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. As you saw in our release from earlier today, Duke Energy announced adjusted diluted EPS of $1.02 for the second quarter of 2012, $0.03 higher than our prior year quarterly results of $0.99. These results exceeded consensus estimates and we continue to be on track to achieve our guidance range for 2012 of $4.20 to $4.35 per share. This range represents 6 months of Duke on a stand-alone basis and 6 months as a combined company with Progress. 
After 18 months of hard work, we closed our merger on July 2. The strategic value of this transaction remains unchanged. The combination creates a new Duke with unmatched financial and operational scale and scope. A highly regulated business mix of the combined company supports the strength and growth of our dividend. We have a strong balance sheet that will allow us to manage through a time of transition in the utility industry. 
Slide 4 illustrates our clear focus as a combined company. Our goals have not changed. We will continue our strong track record of meeting our financial commitments. We will complete our major construction projects to provide clean and reliable energy to our customers. We will continue to focus on the efficient, safe and excellent performance of our fleet in our electric grid. And finally, we will work constructively with regulators in each of our jurisdictions. 
Let me highlight North Carolina and Florida. As many of you know, the sequence of events following the merger closing prompted the North Carolina Utilities Commission to schedule hearings about the unanticipated change in executive leadership. We presented testimony explaining the reasons behind the change. At the close of the hearing before the North Carolina Utilities Commission, we mentioned the prospects for settlement, we are exploring the potential for an acceptable resolution. 
We are also working as a team to resolve Crystal River 3 in a way that meets the needs of our Florida customers, regulators and our investors. I've been asked to appear in front of the Florida Commission on August 13th to discuss the merger impacts our customers in Florida. I look forward to reaffirming our commitment to our customers in Florida. 
We have much work to do. Our deep bench of experience and talented leaders will keep us focused on the success of the new company. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent appointments as I turn to Slide 5. 
Keith Trent has assumed the role of Executive VP of our Regulated Utilities. This is a familiar role for Keith because he previously led Duke's Regulated Utility business from '06 to 2009. Keith and his team, including our state presidents, will be focused on our regulatory relationships in each of our 6 regulated jurisdictions, as well as on the federal level. 
Chuck Whitlock has stepped in to lead our commercial businesses. Chuck has served as President of our Midwest generation fleet since 2009 and has over 12 years of service to Duke Energy or its predecessors. He and his team's significant experience in commercial markets will provide strong leadership of this business. 
Also, Lee Mazzocchi has been named to lead our integration efforts and will report directly to me. Lee has demonstrated strong execution skills and leadership abilities and previously served as Progress's Chief Procurement Officer. Lee and his team will ensure the organization is keenly focused on achieving the merger benefits. 
The IT and supply chains functions will now report to Lynn Good and other administrative functions will report to our Chief Human Resources Officer, Jennifer Weber. 
Delivering the benefits of this merger for our customers and our investors is a key focus of our employees and our leadership team. Merger integration planning has been underway since we announced the merger in January 2011. Integration planning teams worked hard and put us in a great position for day 1 of the combined company. These processes and systems were in place and up and running on July 2 and will allow us to operate as one company. 
The integration teams have identified more than 600 savings opportunities. Accountability of these initiatives has been assigned to each of our Executive Vice Presidents and their respective organization. The integration team, led by Lee, is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the status on these initiatives. 
The merger savings opportunities fall into 2 broad categories: first, is nonfuel O&M savings, which, over time, will benefit all customers and investors. The second is fuel and joint dispatch savings, which will immediately benefit our Carolinas customers. 
Let me update you on our nonfuel O&M savings opportunities before discussing our fuel and joint dispatch savings. When we announced the merger, we targeted a savings run rate in the range of 5% to 7% of total nonfuel O&M. This level of savings continues to be within our overall planning assumptions of combined O&M of around $6 billion. Consistent with our plans, we expect to achieve the full run rate of savings by 2014. 
Slide 6 includes a pie chart bringing the broad categories of O&M savings opportunities we are projecting. Around 70% relate to consolidation of redundant functions, including labor savings and consolidation of IT systems. We're well on our way in both of these areas. 
Around 1,100 employees across the organization have accepted our Voluntary Severance Program. Depending on their job function, these employees will transition their roles and lead the companies at varying points within the next 15 months. We expect over 1/2 of these employees will leave the company by the end of 2012 as we began consolidating corporate functions. We expect to achieve the remaining targeted labor reductions in 2014 by not filling some of our current vacancies and through normal attrition. 
We expect to consolidate duplicate IT systems into single platforms, leveraging investments made by Duke Energy to build scalable IT systems. 19 projects were completed in connection with legal day 1 and 55 more will be underway by the end of 2012. The remaining savings will come from implementing operational best practices such as common operating models, neutralized support organizations and standardized work practices. In addition, we expect supply chain and purchasing benefits to account for increased size and scale. One of these have already been put in place. 
Slide 7 shows you our progress in realizing fuel and joint dispatch savings. Beginning on day 1 of the merger, we are jointly dispatching generating fleets in the Carolinas. In fact, yesterday, we filed a request with the Carolinas commissions to reduce customers' rates by around $89 million over the next 12 months. This will allow our Carolinas customers to begin receiving benefits in their payrolls as early as this fall. We would guarantee the minimum of $650 million in joint dispatch and fuel savings over the first 5 years after merger close. We also had an additional 18 months of timing flexibility if we determine we're unable to achieve the savings within 5 years due to the impact of low natural gas prices on gas consumption. We are confident in our ability to achieve this level of savings. 
Fuel savings are expected to be achieved primarily through coal blending and coal purchasing efficiencies, which resulted in an enhanced buying power and reduced coal transportation costs. That's over 60% of the projected fuel savings are already under contract. And his team have been closely monitoring the joint dispatch savings. On a typical day, we move more than 1,000 megawatts between Duke Energy-Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas. Every megawatt hour that flows between these systems represents savings for our customers. This success results from outstanding teamwork and is happening without sacrificing reliability during some of the recent hot weather. 
We feel good about where we are from an integration perspective and will work hard to deliver on the level of savings we expected to result from this transaction. 
I want to recognize our employees, nearly 30,000 strong, who have remained dedicated to their work and to achieving quick results. I am pleased with how our people are working together. We look to finalize the remainder of the organization very shortly. We're operating as 1 team, 1 company, united in our mission to deliver value and benefits to our customers, investors and the communities we serve. 
Turning to Slide 8, I want to take a few minutes to discuss where we are were with Crystal River 3. Many of you recall that in late 2009, Crystal River 3 experienced a delamination of its containment structure and has remained out of service since that time. The delamination was repaired. Then in March 2011, a second delamination occurred during retention of the structure. Throughout 2011 and 2012, work has been underway to refine and advance engineering on a potential repair solution. 
We are also pursuing insurance recovery from NEIL, the mutual insurance company that provides coverage to the nuclear industry. In February 2012, a settlement agreement was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission which outlines a framework for regulatory treatment of either a decision to repair our retire the unit. 
Let me give you an update on 3 critical items: one, the status of the technical repair option; two, the status of ongoing discussions with NEIL; and finally, our decision process on the best way to move forward with Crystal River 3. 
Work continues on the technical repair option, which involves removing and replacing concrete in substantial portions of the structure. Over the last year, progress has been made on the engineering and vendor selection required for repair option. Refinement of the engineering and the associated risk assessment for the repair option continues, including completion of an independent technical review initiated by the Duke board. Based on the preliminary results of this independent review, the repair plan appears to be technically feasible but issues remain that need to be resolved as the engineering and risk assessment continues. 
As of June 2011, repair costs were estimated at between $900 million to $1.3 billion based upon preliminary engineering. These estimates are under continuing review, and while this process has not yet been finalized, the cost estimate is trending higher. 
Let me move to insurance coverage. Insurance coverage related to repair costs and incremental cost of replacement power is held through NEIL. There are a few important points to note. First, this is the largest claim that NEIL has received in its history. NEIL has established a special committee to carefully evaluate the claim. Second, related to the first delamination, NEIL has made payments, has withheld a payment of approximately $7 million, the majority of which related to replacement power cost. We expect these costs will be recoverable through the fuel clause in Florida. 
Further, NEIL has not made any payments on the second delamination. NEIL has also not yet provided a  final written coverage decision for either delamination. We continue to meet with NEIL representatives. In order to attempt to resolve differences between the parties, we have entered into a nonbinding aviation process with Neil. The mediation is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. 
Let me highlight key next steps in our evaluation. We continue to analyze both repair and retire scenarios. Our final economic analysis and our decisions will be informed by the following factors: engineering, vendor selection, contract negotiations, risk assessments, insurance availability, insurance recovery and customer impacts. Although we recognize the importance of making a repair or retire decision by the end of 2012 under the Florida settlement agreement, we are not prepared at this time to set a date certain by which such decision will be made. We will continue to update you on key decisions and milestones related to our assessment as they occur. Our decisions will be made within the context of the existing and very important regulatory settlement provisions in Florida. Crystal River is a high priority for Duke, our customers and the communities that we serve. 
Turning now to Slide 11, let me give you an update on Edwardsport in Indiana and other major construction projects in the Carolinas. The target date for placing Edwardsport IGCC plant in service has been moved from early September 12 to early 2013. This is due to testing and startup taking longer than originally expected as we work through this large complex project. The new target date gives us more time for the remaining testing and startup procedures to ensure that we have identified and corrected all issues prior to the in-service date. The startup delays which have occurred today have impacted the level of contingency related to this project. As a result, we're continuing to evaluate the estimated cost to complete the project and will provide updates as appropriate. We presently do not expect additional costs to be material in the overall cost of the project. 
We've achieved major milestones, including operation of the plant's turbines, we put power into the electric grid during testing and we expect the plant to produce power using natural gas ahead of commercial operations. More than 1/2 of all the operating systems of the plant are under the care, custody and control of the operations group. Meaning, it was successfully constructed, tested and ready for service. 
General Electric's new product introduction validation process is well underway with both gas turbines having cleared GE's stringent process using natural gas. Validation of the gasification system is the next critical step. Related to the settlement agreement we reached with certain intervening parties in late April, earnings were completed in mid-July. The next steps include the settling parties filing proposed order on August 17th and reply briefs to the intervener exceptions on September 14th. We expect the commission decision in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In the Carolinas, the Cliffside clean coal project in 3 combined cycle gas projects Dan River, Lee are all on schedule and on budget. We intend to file rate cases at Duke Carolinas and Progress Carolinas later this year requesting the recovery of Cliffside, Dan River and Lee plant. Construction of all 3 plants were authorized by the North Carolina Utility Commission. 
We also expect to retire 3 of Progress Energy's Carolinas coal plants later this year. The HF Lee plant and Robinson Unit 1. These plants represent total capacity of approximately 900 megawatts which is in addition to the approximate 1,700 megawatts of capacity Duke Energy-Carolinas has already announced that it will retire. 
In our business, we just completed the 130 megawatt Cimarron wind project. We have remaining projects of 640 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2012. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn, who will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance for the quarter, as well as some perspective on Progress's second quarter results. She will also provide additional financial updates."
267850,214304734,337830,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2012",2012-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. This morning, I'll begin with an overview of Duke Energy's stand-alone second quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends in economic conditions, our financial objectives for 2012, in",1575,"Thanks, Jim. This morning, I'll begin with an overview of Duke Energy's stand-alone second quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends in economic conditions, our financial objectives for 2012, including our earnings per share guidance range for the combined company, our financial objectives going forward and, finally, a few comments on Progress's quarterly results. 
It's important to highlight that our quarterly results do not include Progress Energy's results as the merger closed on July 2. However, Progress will be included in our consolidated results beginning in the third quarter. 
As highlighted on Slide 10, Duke reported second quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.02. This compares to $0.99 per share for the prior quarter. At current year and prior year, earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-3 reverse stock split which was completed immediately prior to closing the merger with Progress in early July. 
Our regulated U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas segment recognized quarterly adjusted segment income was $0.09 higher than the second quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily due to revised customer rates in the Carolinas implemented in February of this year. We also have lower O&M costs as a result of fewer major storms. We continue to closely manage our O&M costs, particularly in our fossil fleet, given the lower natural gas price environment and lower generation from our coal plants. These favorable results were partially offset by less favorable weather for the quarter as compared to the prior year. Even our cooling degree days were 18% higher than normal which is lower than the approximate 25% variance to normal in the prior quarter. 
Let's move on to international, which, as expected, had segment income $0.05 per share lower than the prior year quarter. International's results were negatively impacted by unfavorable pricing in Central America, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Partially offsetting these results were favorable results in Brazil and Peru with the higher average prices. 
Turning our attention now to our nonregulated Commercial Power segment, adjusted segment income was fairly consistent with the prior-year quarter. However, there were a few key drivers to highlight. Due largely to the implementation of our new market-based Electric Security Plan in Ohio, we entered 2012 anticipating lower results from Commercial Power. As expected, our coal generation margins were down $0.07 per share. This was largely offset by the nonbypassable stability charge which we are collecting through the end of 2014 which added $0.05 per share. 
Our nonregulated Midwest gas fleets continued to generate record volumes as quarterly generation was around 80% higher than the prior-year quarter. However, the prior volumes were offset by lower PJM capacity revenues. 
Let me close with a few comments about our Ohio operations. Ohio has recently approved a state compensation mechanism for FRR entities authorizing the recovery of the cost for capacity. As you know, Duke Energy Ohio is an FRR entities through May 2015, receiving market-based payments for capacity. We are reviewing the applicability of this recent decision to Duke Energy Ohio. 
We have also heard recent market rumors about the potential sale of our Midwest generation assets. It is not our practice to comment on market rumors of this nature, and as we have shared with you, we are evaluating strategic options for this asset portfolio, but no decisions have been made. We will continue to update you as our plans develop. 
Slide 11 contains our quarterly volume trends by customer class for the Carolinas, Midwest and in total based on calculations that exclude weather impacts. In the second quarter, our overall weather normal volumes were around 1.3% higher than the prior-year period. A similar increase is seen in both the Carolinas and Midwest. This increase continues to be largely supported by industrial activity, which was 2.8% higher than the prior year quarter. 
In the Carolinas, the automotive sectors showed strength, while textiles continued their recent weakness. Midwest experienced strength in the heavy equipment and automotive sectors while softness was seen in the primary and fabricated metals sectors. 
The residential customer class continues to grow at a modest level. For the quarter, weather-normalized residential volumes were higher by around 0.3%, visibly supported by the Carolinas. This level of growth is mostly due to an increase of approximately 20,000 or 0.5% average residential customers in the Carolinas and Midwest. Average residential kilowatt usage has remained fairly consistent to the prior year. 
Finally, weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were around 0.8% higher than the prior year quarter. Continued volatility in retail sales trends and higher office vacancy rates keeps growth in this sector at modest levels. 
Consistent with our outlook during the first quarter earnings call, we remain cautious on the overall economic recovery. As a result, we are currently expecting fairly flat weather-normalized load for 2012 compared with 2011. 
Before we move on to the financial impacts of the merger, let me briefly discussed Progress's results for the quarter. Progress recognized second quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.71 in the prior year quarter. And the largest contributing factors to these lower results was higher O&M costs of $0.23 per share primarily due to an additional planned nuclear outage in the Carolinas. In addition, quarterly results were unfavorably impacted by weather in the Carolinas and Florida, a $0.09 per share impact. Finally, lower costs of renewable amortization in Florida reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. 
We have included several earnings related slides that you are accustomed to seeing for Progress in the appendix to today's presentation. 
Let's turn now to the financial impacts of the merger. In the third quarter, we expect to recognize incremental goodwill of approximately $12 billion related to the Progress transaction. Additionally, we expect accounting charges resulting from the merger of between $450 million and $550 million to be recognized primarily in the last half of this year. These charges will be treated as special items and primarily consist of employee severance costs, costs related to the interim and permanent FERC mitigation plans, concessions agreed to with that correlate is commissions in order to receive merger approval and merger transaction costs. 
The combined company we continue to target 2012 or earnings guidance in the range of $4.20 and $4.35 per share adjusted for the 1-for-3 reverse stock split. As outlined on this slide, we expect the contribution from Progress in the last half of the year to be largely offset by the dilution from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger. 
Let me also highlight a few highlights of our financing plan. We have a busy financing calendar for the remainder of the year focused on funding our capital expenditures and debt maturities. In addition to about $1.3 billion of long-term financings at our Carolinas and Florida utilities, we have more than $2 billion of funding requirements planned at our holding company. Our holding company plan includes almost $1 billion of debt issued to reduce leverage at Duke Energy Ohio in connection with the pending transfer of generation assets out of the utility. These holding company needs will be met primarily with long-term taxable and tax-exempted, may also include issuance of commercial paper. We will also complete nonrecourse financings internationally and in our renewable energy business. 
Our current business plan continues to support no equity issuances through 2013. We have included further details on our assumed 2012 cash flows and financing plan in the appendix to today's presentation. 
I will close with Slide 13 which addresses our main financial objectives. We continue to target our long-term earnings growth range of 4% to 6% and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the combined company. The earnings growth potential of the company will continue to be anchored by investments in the regulated businesses, achieving reasonable regulatory outcomes, achieving merger integration benefits, managing our costs and continued contributions from our commercial businesses. We expect to provide more specifics on our earnings growth opportunities by early 2013. At that time, we will have completed our normal 3-year financial planning process with the new management team and Board of Directors. We also expect to have greater clarity around the timing and expected financial impacts of our rate case filings in the Carolinas by early next year. 
We continue to focus on growing the dividend on an annual basis with the targeted dividend payout ratio of 65% to 70% based upon adjusted diluted earnings per share. In fact, in June, we announced an approximate 2% increase to our quarterly dividend payable in September. 
Before I close, I would like to briefly address S&P's decision to downgrade our credit ratings last week. Rating agencies cited lack of transparency and heightened regulatory risk around the CEO transition. While we were disappointed and disagree with S&P's rating action and its assessment of the company's risk profile and governance practices, we remain committed to maintaining high credit quality and constructive relationships with our rating agencies. 
Our balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics continue to be strong and both Moody's and Fitch have maintained stable outlooks for Duke Energy following the close of our merger. 
In summary, the size, scale and higher regulated business mix of the combined company gives us a solid base upon which to build. We expect to deliver on our commitment in order to achieve our financial objective. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

Before I open up the phone lines for your questions, let me correct one thing that I've said earlier. In talking about the first delamination, I said that NEIL has made payments that has withheld payment of approximately $70 million. I said $7 million, maybe that was just wishful thinking, but they withheld payment of approximately $70 million, the majority of which relate to replacement power costs.

Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us on the call this morning. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. As you saw in our release from earlier today, Duke Energy announced adjusted diluted EPS of $1.02 for the second quarter of 2012, $0.03 higher than our prior-year quarterly results of $0.99. These results exceeded consensus estimates and we continue to be on track to achieve our guidance range for 2012 of $4.20 to $4.35 per share. This range represents 6 months of Duke on a stand-alone basis and 6 months as a combined company with Progress. 
After 18 months of hard work, we closed our merger on July 2. The strategic value of this transaction remains unchanged. The combination creates a new Duke, with unmatched financial and operational scale and scope. A highly regulated business mix of the combined company supports the strength and growth of our dividend. We have a strong balance sheet that will allow us to manage through a time of transition in the utility industry. 
Slide 4 illustrates our clear focus as a combined company. Our goals have not changed. We will continue our strong track record of meeting our financial commitments. We will complete our major construction projects to provide clean and reliable energy to our customers. We will continue to focus on the efficient, safe and excellent performance of our fleet and our electric grid. And finally, we will work constructively with regulators in each of our jurisdictions. 
Let me highlight North Carolina and Florida. As many of you know, the sequence of events following the merger closing prompted the North Carolina Utilities Commission to schedule hearings about the unanticipated change in executive leadership. We presented testimony explaining the reasons behind the change. At the close of the hearing, before the North Carolina Utilities Commission, [indiscernible] mentioned the prospects for settlement, we are exploring the potential for an acceptable resolution. 
We are also working as a team to resolve Crystal River 3, in a way that meets the needs of our Florida customers, regulators and our investors. I've been asked to appear in front of the Florida Commission on August 13 to discuss of the merger impacts our customers in Florida. I look forward to reaffirming our commitment to our customers in Florida. 
We have much work to do. Our deep bench of experience and talented leaders will keep us focused on the success of the new company. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent appointments as I turn to Slide 5. 
Keith Trent has assumed the role of Executive VP of our Regulated Utilities. This is a familiar role for Keith because he previously led Duke's Regulated Utility business from '06 to 2009. Keith and his team, including our state presidents, will be focused on our regulatory relationships in each of our 6 regulated jurisdictions, as well as on the federal level. 
Chuck Whitlock has stepped in to lead our Commercial Businesses. Chuck has served as President of our Midwest generation fleet since 2009 and has over 12 years of service to Duke Energy or its predecessors. He and his team's significant experience in commercial markets will provide strong leadership of this business. 
Also, Lee Mazzocchi has been named to lead our integration efforts and will report directly to me. Lee has demonstrated strong execution skills and leadership abilities, and previously served as Progress's Chief Procurement Officer. Lee and his team will ensure the organization is keenly focused on achieving the merger benefits. 
The IT and supply chain's functions will now report to Lynn Good, and other administrative functions will report to our Chief Human Resources Officer, Jennifer Weber. 
Delivering the benefits of this merger for our customers and our investors is a key focus of our employees and our leadership team. Merger integration planning has been underway since we announced the merger in January 2011. Integration planning teams worked hard and put us in a great position for day 1 of the combined company. These processes and systems were in place and up and running on July 2 and will allow us to operate as one company. 
The integration teams have identified more than 600 savings opportunities. Accountability of these initiatives has been assigned to each of our Executive Vice Presidents and their respective organization. The integration team, led by Lee, is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the status on these initiatives. 
The merger savings opportunities fall into 2 broad categories: first, is non-fuel O&M savings, which, over time, will benefit all customers and investors. The second is fuel and joint dispatch savings, which will immediately benefit our Carolinas customers. 
Let me update you on our non-fuel O&M savings opportunities before discussing our fuel and joint dispatch savings. When we announced the merger, we targeted a savings run rate in the range of 5% to 7% of total non-fuel O&M. This level of savings continues to be within our overall planning assumptions of combined O&M of around $6 billion. Consistent with our plans, we expect to achieve the full run-rate of savings by 2014. 
Slide 6 includes a pie chart displaying the broad categories of O&M savings opportunities we are projecting. Around 70% relate to consolidation of redundant functions, including labor savings and consolidation of IT systems. We're well on our way in both of these areas. 
Around 1,100 employees across the organization have accepted our Voluntary Severance Program. Depending on their job function, these employees will transition their roles and leave the companies at varying points within the next 15 months. We expect over half of these employees will leave the company by the end of 2012 as we begin consolidating corporate functions. We expect to achieve the remaining targeted labor reductions in 2014 by not filling some of our current vacancies and through normal attrition. 
We expect to consolidate duplicate IT systems into single platforms, leveraging investments made by Duke Energy to build scalable IT systems. 19 projects were completed in connection with legal day 1 and 55 more will be underway by the end of 2012. The remaining savings will come from implementing operational best practices, such as common operating models, neutralized support organizations and standardized work practices. In addition, we expect supply chain and purchasing benefits to account for increased size and scale. Some of these have already been put in place. 
Slide 7 shows you our progress in realizing fuel and joint dispatch savings. Beginning on day 1 of the merger, we are jointly dispatching generating fleets to the Carolinas. In fact, yesterday, we filed a request with the Carolinas commissions to reduce customers' rates by around $89 million over the next 12 months. This will allow our Carolinas customers to begin receiving benefits in their bills as early as this fall. We would guarantee the minimum of $650 million in joint dispatch and fuel savings over the first 5 years after merger close. We also had an additional 18 months of timing flexibility if we determine we're unable to achieve the savings within 5 years due to the impact of low natural gas prices on gas consumption. We are confident in our ability to achieve this level of savings. 
Fuel savings are expected to be achieved primarily through coal blending and coal purchasing efficiencies, which result in enhanced buying power and reduced coal transportation costs. Just over 60% of the projected fuel savings are already under contract. [indiscernible] and his team have been closely monitoring the joint dispatch savings. On a typical day, we move more than 1,000 megawatts between Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas. Every megawatt hour that flows between these systems represent savings for our customers. This success results from outstanding teamwork and is happening without sacrificing reliability during some of the recent hot weather. 
We feel good about where we are from an integration perspective and will work hard to deliver on the level of savings we expected to result from this transaction. 
I want to recognize our employees, nearly 30,000 strong, who have remained dedicated to their work and to achieving quick results. I am pleased with how our people are working together. We look to finalize the remainder of the organization very shortly. We're operating as one team, one company, united in our mission to deliver value and benefits to our customers, investors and the communities we serve. 
Turning to Slide 8, I want to take a few minutes to discuss where we are were with Crystal River 3. Many of you recall that in late 2009, Crystal River 3 experienced a delamination of its containment structure and has remained out of service since that time. The delamination was repaired. Then in March 2011, a second delamination occurred during re-tensioning of the structure. Throughout 2011 and 2012, work has been underway to refine and advance engineering on a potential repair solution. 
We are also pursuing insurance recovery from NEIL, the mutual insurance company that provides coverage to the nuclear industry. In February 2012, a settlement agreement was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission which outlines a framework for regulatory treatment of either a decision to repair or retire the unit. 
Let me give you an update on 3 critical items: one, the status of the technical repair option; two, the status of ongoing discussions with NEIL; and finally, our decision process on the best way to move forward with Crystal River 3. 
Work continues on the technical repair option, which involves removing and replacing concrete in substantial portions of the structure. Over the last year, progress has been made on the engineering and vendor selection required for the repair option. Refinement of the engineering and the associated risk assessment for the repair option continues, including completion of an independent technical review initiated by the Duke board. Based on the preliminary results of this independent review, the repair plan appears to be technically feasible but issues remain that need to be resolved as the engineering and risk assessment continues. 
As of June 2011, repair costs were estimated at between $900 million to $1.3 billion based upon preliminary engineering. These estimates are under continuing review, and while this process has not yet been finalized, the cost estimate is trending higher. 
Let me move to insurance coverage. Insurance coverage related to repair costs and incremental cost of replacement power is held through NEIL. There are a few important points to note. First, this is the largest claim that NEIL has received in its history. NEIL has established a special committee to carefully evaluate the claim. Second, related to the first delamination, NEIL has made payments, but has withheld a payment of approximately $7 million, the majority of which related to replacement power cost. We expect these costs will be recoverable through the fuel clause in Florida. 
Further, NEIL has not made any payments on the second delamination. NEIL has also not yet provided a final written coverage decision for either delamination. We continue to meet with NEIL representatives. In order to attempt to resolve differences between the parties, we have entered into a non-binding mediation process with NEIL. The mediation is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. 
Let me highlight key next steps in our evaluation. We continue to analyze both repair and retire scenarios. Our final economic analysis and our decisions will be informed by the following factors: engineering, vendor selection, contract negotiations, risk assessments, insurance availability, insurance recovery and customer impacts. Although we recognize the importance of making a repair or retire decision by the end of 2012 under the Florida settlement agreement, we are not prepared, at this time, to set a date certain by which such decision will be made. We will continue to update you on key decisions and milestones related to our assessment as they occur. Our decisions will be made within the context of the existing and very important regulatory settlement provisions in Florida. Crystal River is a high priority for Duke, our customers and the communities that we serve. 
Turning now to Slide 11, let me give you an update on Edwardsport in Indiana and other major construction projects in the Carolinas. The target date for placing Edwardsport IGCC plant in service has been moved from early September 12 to early 2013. This is due to testing and startup taking longer than originally expected as we work through this large complex project. The new target date gives us more time for the remaining testing and startup procedures to ensure that we have identified and corrected all issues prior to the in-service date. The startup delays which have occurred today have impacted the level of contingency related to this project. As a result, we'll continue to evaluate the estimated cost to complete the project and we'll provide updates as appropriate. We presently do not expect additional costs to be material in the overall cost of the project. 
We've achieved major milestones, including operation of the plant's turbines, we put power into the electric grid during testing and we expect the plant to produce power using natural gas ahead of commercial operations. More than half of all the operating systems of the plant are under the care, custody and control of the operations group. Meaning, it was successfully constructed, tested and ready for service. 
General Electric's new product introduction validation process is well underway with both gas turbines having cleared GE's stringent process using natural gas. Validation of the gasification system is the next critical step. Related to the settlement agreement we reached with certain intervening parties in late April, earnings were completed in mid-July. The next steps include the settling parties filing a proposed order on August 17 and reply briefs to the intervenor exceptions on September 14. We expect the commission decision in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In the Carolinas, the Cliffside clean coal project and 3 combined cycle gas projects, Dan River, Lee and Sutton are all on schedule and on budget. We intend to file rate cases at Duke Carolinas and Progress Carolinas later this year, requesting the recovery of Cliffside, Dan River and Lee plant. Construction of all 3 plants were authorized by the North Carolina Utility Commission. 
We also expect to retire 3 of Progress Energy's Carolinas coal plants later this year. The HF Lee plant, the Cape Fear plant and Robinson Unit 1. These plants represent total capacity of approximately 900 megawatts which is in addition to the approximate 1,700 megawatts of capacity Duke Energy-Carolinas has already announced that it will retire. 
In our [indiscernible] business, we just completed the 130 megawatt Cimarron wind project. We have remaining projects of 640 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2012. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn, who will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance for the quarter, as well as some perspective on Progress's second quarter results. She will also provide additional financial updates."
267850,214304734,338062,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2012",2012-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. This morning, I'll begin with an overview of Duke Energy's stand-alone second quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends and economic conditions, our financial objectives for 2012, i",1576,"Thanks, Jim. This morning, I'll begin with an overview of Duke Energy's stand-alone second quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends and economic conditions, our financial objectives for 2012, including our earnings per share guidance range for the combined company, our financial objectives going forward and, finally, a few comments on Progress's quarterly results. 
It's important to highlight that our quarterly results do not include Progress Energy's results as the merger closed on July 2. However, Progress will be included in our consolidated results beginning with the third quarter. 
As highlighted on Slide 10, Duke reported second quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.02. This compares to $0.99 per share for the prior quarter. At current year and prior year, earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-3 reverse stock split which was completed immediately prior to closing the merger with Progress in early July. 
Our regulated U.S. Franchise Electric and Gas segment recognized quarterly adjusted segment income was $0.09 higher than the second quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily due to revised customer rates in the Carolinas implemented in February of this year. We also have lower O&M costs as a result of fewer major storms. We continue to closely manage our O&M costs, particularly in our fossil fleet, given the lower natural gas price environment and lower generation from our coal plants. These favorable results were partially offset by less favorable weather for the quarter as compared to the prior year. Even our cooling degree days were 18% higher than normal which is lower than the approximate 25% variance to normal in the prior quarter. 
Let's move on to international which, as expected, had segment income $0.05 per share lower than the prior-year quarter. International's results were negatively impacted by unfavorable pricing in Central America, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Partially offsetting these results were favorable results in Brazil and Peru with the higher average prices. 
Turning our attention now to our non-regulated Commercial Power segment, adjusted segment income was fairly consistent with the prior-year quarter. However, there were a few key drivers to highlight. Due largely to the implementation of our new market-based Electric Security Plan in Ohio, we entered 2012 anticipating lower results from Commercial Power. As expected, our coal generation margins were down $0.07 per share. This was largely offset by the non-bypassable stability charge which we are collecting through the end of 2014, which added $0.05 per share. 
Our non-regulated Midwest gas fleets continued to generate record volumes as quarterly generation was around 80% higher than the prior-year quarter. However, the prior volumes were offset by lower PJM capacity revenues. 
Let me close with a few comments about our Ohio operations. Ohio has recently approved a state compensation mechanism for FRR entities authorizing the recovery of their cost for capacity. As you know, Duke Energy Ohio is an FRR entity through May 2015, receiving market-based payments for capacity. We are reviewing the applicability of this recent decision to Duke Energy Ohio. 
There have also been recent market rumors about a potential sale of our Midwest generation assets. It is not our practice to comment on market rumors of this nature. And as we have shared with you, we are evaluating strategic options for this asset portfolio, but no decisions have been made. We will continue to update you as our plans develop. 
Slide 11 contains our quarterly volume trends by customer class for the Carolinas, the Midwest and in total, based on calculations that exclude weather impacts. In the second quarter, our overall weather normal volumes were around 1.3% higher than the prior-year period. A similar increase is seen in both the Carolinas and Midwest. This increase continues to be largely supported by industrial activity, which was 2.8% higher than the prior year quarter. 
In the Carolinas, the automotive sectors showed strength, while textiles continued their recent weakness. Midwest experienced strength in the heavy equipment and automotive sectors while softness was seen in the primary and fabricated metals sectors. 
The residential customer class continues to grow at a modest level. For the quarter, weather-normalized residential volumes were higher by around 0.3%, visibly supported by the Carolinas. This level of growth is mostly due to an increase of approximately 20,000, or 0.5%, average residential customers in the Carolinas and Midwest. Average residential kilowatt usage has remained fairly consistent to the prior year. 
Finally, weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were around 0.8% higher than the prior-year quarter. Continued volatility in retail sales trends and higher office vacancy rates keeps growth in this sector at modest levels. 
Consistent with our outlook during the first quarter earnings call, we remain cautious on the overall economic recovery. As a result, we are currently expecting fairly flat weather-normalized load for 2012 compared with 2011. 
Before we move on to the financial impacts of the merger, let me briefly discussed Progress' results for the quarter. Progress recognized second quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.71 in the prior-year quarter. One of the largest contributing factors to these lower results was higher O&M costs of $0.23 per share, primarily due to an additional planned nuclear outage in the Carolinas. In addition, quarterly results were unfavorably impacted by weather in the Carolinas and Florida, a $0.09 per share impact. Finally, lower costs of renewable amortization in Florida reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. 
We have included several earnings-related slides that you are accustomed to seeing for Progress in the appendix to today's presentation.
Let's turn now to the financial impacts of the merger. In the third quarter, we expect to recognize incremental goodwill of approximately $12 billion related to the Progress transaction. Additionally, we expect accounting charges resulting from the merger of between $450 million and $550 million to be recognized primarily in the last half of this year. These charges will be treated as special items and primarily consist of employee severance costs, costs related to the interim and permanent FERC mitigation plans, concessions agreed to with that the Carolina commissions, in order to receive merger approval, and merger transaction costs. 
 
In the combined company, we continue to target 2012 or earnings guidance in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share, adjusted for the 1-for-3 reverse stock split. As outlined on this slide, we expect the contribution from Progress in the last half of the year to be largely offset by the dilution from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger. 
Let me also highlight a few highlights of our financing plan. We have a busy financing calendar for the remainder of the year focused on funding our capital expenditures and debt maturities. In addition to about $1.3 billion of long-term financings at our Carolinas and Florida utilities, we have more than $2 billion of funding requirements planned at our holding company. Our holding company plan includes almost $1 billion of debt issued to reduce leverage at Duke Energy Ohio in connection with the pending transfer of generation assets out of the utility. These holding company needs will be met primarily with long-term taxable and tax-exempt [indiscernible]. It may also include issuance of commercial paper. We will also complete non-recourse financings internationally and in our renewable energy business. 
Our current business plan continues to support no equity issuances through 2013. We have included further details on our assumed 2012 cash flows and financing plan in the appendix to today's presentation. 
I will close with Slide 13 which addresses our main financial objectives. We continue to target a long-term earnings growth range of 4% to 6% in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the combined company. The earnings growth potential of the company will continue to be anchored by investments in the regulated businesses, achieving reasonable regulatory outcomes, achieving merger integration benefits, managing our costs and continued contributions from our commercial businesses. We expect to provide more specifics on our earnings growth opportunities by early 2013. At that time, we will have completed our normal 3-year financial planning process with the new management team and Board of Directors. We also expect to have greater clarity around the timing and expected financial impacts of our rate case filings in the Carolinas by early next year. 
We continue to focus on growing the dividend on an annual basis with the targeted dividend payout ratio of 65% to 70% based upon adjusted diluted earnings per share. In fact, in June, we announced an approximate 2% increase to our quarterly dividend payable in September. 
Before I close, I would like to briefly address S&P's decision to downgrade our credit ratings last week. Rating agencies cited lack of transparency and heightened deregulatory risk around the CEO transition. While we were disappointed and disagree with S&P's rating action and its assessment of the company's risk profile and governance practices, we remain committed to maintaining high credit quality and constructive relationships with our rating agencies. 
Our balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics continue to be strong, and both Moody's and Fitch have maintained stable outlooks for Duke Energy following the close of our merger. 
In summary, the size, scale and higher regulated business mix of the combined company gives us a solid base upon which to build. We expect to deliver on our commitment in order to achieve our financial objective. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

Before I open up the phone lines for your questions, let me correct one thing that I've said earlier. In talking about the first delamination, I said that NEIL has made payments but has withheld payment of approximately $70 million.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. As you saw in our release from earlier today, Duke Energy announced adjusted diluted EPS of $1.02 for the second quarter of 2012, $0.03 higher than our prior year quarterly results of $0.99. These results exceeded consensus estimates and we continue to be on track to achieve our guidance range for 2012 of $4.20 to $4.35 per share. This range represents 6 months of Duke on a stand-alone basis and 6 months as a combined company with Progress. 
After 18 months of hard work, we closed our merger on July 2. The strategic value of this transaction remains unchanged. The combination creates a new Duke with unmatched financial and operational scale and scope. The highly regulated business mix of the combined company supports the strength and growth of our dividend. We have a strong balance sheet that will allow us to manage through a time of transition in the utility industry. 
Slide 4 illustrates our clear focus as a combined company. Our goals have not changed. We will continue our strong track record of meeting our financial commitments. We will complete our major construction projects to provide clean, reliable energy to our customers. We will continue to focus on the efficient, safe and excellent performance of our fleet and our electric grid. And finally, we will work constructively with regulators in each of our jurisdictions. 
Let me highlight North Carolina and Florida. As many of you know, the sequence of events following the merger closing prompted the North Carolina Utilities Commission to schedule hearings about the unanticipated change in executive leadership. We presented testimony explaining the reasons behind the change. At the close of the hearing, before the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Chairman Finley mentioned the prospects for settlement. We are exploring the potential for an acceptable resolution. 
We are also working as a team to resolve Crystal River 3 in a way that meets the needs of our Florida customers, regulators and our investors. I've been asked to appear in front of the Florida commission on August 13 to discuss how the merger impacts our customers in Florida. I look forward to reaffirming our commitment to our customers in Florida. 
We have much work to do. Our deep bench of experience and talented leaders will keep us focused on the success of the new company. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent appointments as I turn to Slide 5. 
Keith Trent has assumed the role of Executive VP of our regulated utilities. This is a familiar role for Keith, as he previously led Duke's regulated utility business from '06 to 2009. Keith and his team, including our state presidents, will be focused on our regulatory relationships in each of our 6 regulated jurisdictions, as well as on the federal level. 
Chuck Whitlock has stepped in to lead our commercial businesses. Chuck has served as President of our Midwest generation fleet since 2009 and has over 12 years of service to Duke Energy or its predecessors. He and his team's significant experience in commercial markets will provide strong leadership for this business. 
Also, Lee Mazzocchi has been named to lead our integration efforts and will report directly to me. Lee has demonstrated strong execution skills and leadership abilities, and previously served as Progress's Chief Procurement Officer. Lee and his team will ensure the organization is keenly focused on achieving the merger benefits. 
The IT and supply chain's functions will now report to Lynn Good, and other administrative functions will report to our Chief Human Resources Officer, Jennifer Weber. 
Delivering the benefits of this merger for our customers and our investors is a key focus of our employees and our leadership team. Merger integration planning has been underway since we announced the merger in January 2011. Integration planning teams worked hard and put us in a great position for day 1 of the combined company. Key processes and systems were in place and up and running on July 2 to will allow us to operate as one company. 
The integration teams have identified more than 600 savings opportunities. Accountability for these initiatives has been assigned to each of our Executive Vice Presidents and their respective organization. The integration team, led by Lee, is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the status on these initiatives. 
Our merger savings opportunities fall into 2 broad categories. The first is non-fuel O&M savings, which over time will benefit all customers and investors. The second is fuel and joint dispatch savings, which will immediately benefit our Carolinas customers. 
Let me update you on our non-fuel O&M savings opportunities before discussing our fuel and joint dispatch savings. When we announced the merger, we targeted a savings run rate in the range of 5% to 7% of total non-fuel O&M. This level of savings continues to be within our overall planning assumptions of combined O&M of around $6 billion. Consistent with our plans, we expect to achieve the full run rate of savings by 2014. 
Slide 6 includes a pie chart showing the broad categories of O&M savings opportunities we are projecting. Around 70% relate to consolidation of redundant functions, including labor savings and consolidation of IT systems. We are well on our way in both of these areas. 
Around 1,100 employees across the organization have accepted our Voluntary Severance Program. Depending on their job function, these employees will transition their roles and leave the companies at varying points within the next 15 months. We expect over half of these employees will leave the company by the end of 2012 as we begin consolidating corporate functions. We expect to achieve the remaining targeted labor reductions by 2014 by not filling some of our current vacancies and through normal attrition. 
We expect to consolidate duplicate IT systems into single platforms, leveraging investments made by Duke Energy to build scalable IT systems. 19 projects were completed in connection with legal day 1 and 55 more will be underway by the end of 2012. The remaining savings will come from implementing operational best practices, such as common operating models, centralized support organizations and standardized work practices. In addition, we expect supply chain and purchasing benefits that come from increased size and scale. Some of these have already been put in place. 
Slide 7 shows you our progress in realizing fuel and joint dispatch savings. Beginning on day 1 of the merger, we are jointly dispatching generating fleets to the Carolinas. In fact, yesterday, we filed a request with the Carolinas commissions to reduce customers' rates by around $89 million over the next 12 months. This will allow our Carolinas customers to begin receiving benefits in their bills as early as this fall.
We have guaranteed a minimum of $650 million in joint dispatch and fuel savings over the first 5 years after merger close. We also have an additional 18 months of timing flexibility if we determine we're unable to achieve the savings within 5 years due to the impact of low natural gas prices on gas consumption. We are confident in our ability to achieve this level of savings. 
Fuel savings are expected to be achieved primarily through coal blending and coal purchasing efficiencies, which result in enhanced buying power and reduced coal transportation costs. Just over 60% of the projected fuel savings are already under contract.
Jeff Lyash and his team have been closely monitoring the joint dispatch savings. On a typical day, we move more than 1,000 megawatts between Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas. Every megawatt-hour that flows between these systems represents savings for our customers. This success results from outstanding teamwork and is happening without sacrificing reliability during some of the recent hot weather. 
We feel good about where we are from an integration perspective and will work hard to deliver on the level of savings we expected to result from this transaction. 
I want to recognize our employees, nearly 30,000 strong, who have remained dedicated to their work and to achieving quick results. I am pleased with how our people are working together. We look to finalize the remainder of the organization very shortly. We're operating as one team, one company, united in our mission to deliver value and benefits to our customers, investors and the communities we serve. 
Turning to Slide 8, I want to take a few minutes to discuss where we are with Crystal River 3. Many of you recall that in late 2009, Crystal River 3 experienced a delamination of its containment structure and has remained out of service since that time. The delamination was repaired. Then in March 2011, a second delamination occurred during re-tensioning of the structure. Throughout 2011 and 2012, work has been underway to refine and advance engineering on a potential repair solution. 
We are also pursuing insurance recovery from NEIL, a mutual insurance company that provides coverage to the nuclear industry. In February 2012, a settlement agreement was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission which outlines a framework for regulatory treatment of either a decision to repair or retire the unit. 
Let me give you an update on 3 critical items: one, the status of the technical repair option; two, the status of ongoing discussions with NEIL; and finally, our decision process on the best way to move forward with Crystal River 3. 
Work continues on the technical repair option, which involves removing and replacing concrete in substantial portions of the structure. Over the last year, progress has been made on the engineering and vendor selection required for the repair option. Refinement of the engineering and the associated risk assessment for the repair option continues, including completion of an independent technical review initiated by the Duke board. Based on the preliminary results of this independent review, the repair plan appears to be technically feasible, but issues remain that need to be resolved as the engineering and risk assessment continues. 
As of June 2011, repair costs were estimated at between $900 million to $1.3 billion based upon preliminary engineering. These estimates are under continuing review, and while this process has not yet been finalized, the cost estimate is trending higher. 
Let me move to insurance coverage. Insurance coverage related to repair costs and incremental costs of replacement power is held through NEIL. There are a few important points to note. First, this is the largest claim that NEIL has received in its history. NEIL has established a special committee to carefully evaluate the claim. Second, related to the first delamination, NEIL has made payments, but has withheld a payment of approximately $7 million, the majority of which related to replacement power cost. We expect these costs will be recoverable through the fuel clause in Florida. 
Further, NEIL has not made any payments on the second delamination. NEIL has also not yet provided a final written coverage decision for either delamination. We continue to meet with NEIL representatives. In order to attempt to resolve differences between the parties, we have entered into a non-binding mediation process with NEIL. The mediation is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. 
Let me highlight key next steps in our evaluation. We continue to analyze both repair and retire scenarios. Our final economic analysis and our decisions will be informed by the following factors: engineering, vendor selection, contract negotiations, risk assessments, insurance availability, insurance recovery and customer impacts. Although we recognize the importance of making a repair or retire decision by the end of 2012 under the Florida settlement agreement, we are not prepared, at this time, to set a date certain by which such decision will be made. We will continue to update you on key decisions and milestones related to our assessment as they occur. Our decisions will be made within the context of the existing and very important regulatory settlement provisions in Florida. Crystal River is a high priority for Duke, our customers and the communities that we serve. 
Turning now to Slide 11 (sic) [Slide 9], let me give you an update on Edwardsport in Indiana and other major construction projects in the Carolinas. The target date for placing Edwardsport IGCC plant in service has moved from early September 12 to early 2013. This is due to testing and start-up taking longer than originally expected as we work through this large, complex project. The new target date gives us more time for the remaining testing and start-up procedures to ensure that we have identified and corrected all issues prior to the in-service date. The start-up delays which have occurred today have impacted the level of contingencies related to this project. As a result, we're continuing to evaluate the estimated cost to complete the project and we'll provide updates as appropriate. We presently do not expect additional costs to be material in the overall cost of the project. 
We've achieved major milestones, including operation of the plant's turbines. We put power into the electric grid during testing and we expect the plant to produce power using natural gas ahead of commercial operations. More than half of all the operating systems of the plant are under the care, custody and control of the operations group, meaning they were successfully constructed, tested and ready for service. 
General Electric's new product introduction validation process is well underway, with both gas turbines having cleared GE's stringent process using natural gas. Validation of the gasification system is the next critical step. Related to the settlement agreement we reached with certain intervening parties in late April, hearings were completed in mid-July. The next steps include the settling parties filing a proposed order on August 17 and reply briefs to the intervenor exceptions on September 14. We expect a commission decision in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In the Carolinas, the Cliffside clean coal project and 3 combined cycle gas projects, Dan River, Lee and Sutton, are all on schedule and on budget. We intend to file rate cases at Duke Carolinas and Progress Carolinas later this year, requesting the recovery of Cliffside, Dan River and Lee plant. The construction of all 3 plants were authorized by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. 
We also expect to retire 3 of Progress Energy's Carolinas coal plants later this year: the H.F. Lee Plant, the Cape Fear plant and Robinson Unit 1. These plants represent total capacity of approximately 900 megawatts, which is in addition to the approximate 1,700 megawatts of capacity Duke Energy Carolinas has already announced that it will retire. 
In our renewables business, we just completed the 130 megawatt Cimarron wind project. We have remaining projects of 640 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2012. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn, who will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance for the quarter, as well as some perspective on Progress's second quarter results. She will also provide additional financial updates."
267850,214304734,338551,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2012",2012-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. This morning, I'll begin with an overview of Duke Energy's stand-alone second quarter earnings results for each of its business segments; an update on retail customer volume trends and economic conditions; our financial objectives for 2012, i",1579,"Thanks, Jim. This morning, I'll begin with an overview of Duke Energy's stand-alone second quarter earnings results for each of its business segments; an update on retail customer volume trends and economic conditions; our financial objectives for 2012, including our earnings per share guidance range for the combined company; our financial objectives going forward; and finally, a few comments on Progress's quarterly results. 
It's important to highlight that our quarterly results do not include Progress Energy's results, as the merger closed on July 2. However, Progress will be included in our consolidated results beginning with the third quarter. 
As highlighted on Slide 10, Duke reported second quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.02. This compares to $0.99 per share for the prior quarter. At current year and prior year earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-3 reverse stock split which was completed immediately prior to closing the merger with Progress in early July. 
Our regulated U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas segment recognized quarterly adjusted segment income that was $0.09 higher than the second quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily due to revised customer rates in the Carolinas implemented in February of this year. We also had lower O&M costs as a result of fewer major storms. We continue to closely manage our O&M costs, particularly in our fossil fleet, given the lower natural gas price environment and lower generation from our coal plants. These favorable results were partially offset by less favorable weather for the quarter as compared to the prior year. Even though cooling degree days were 18% higher than normal, this was lower than the approximate 25% variance to normal in the prior quarter. 
Let's move on to international, which as expected, had segment income $0.05 per share lower than the prior year quarter. International's results were negatively impacted by unfavorable pricing in Central America, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Partially offsetting these results were favorable results in Brazil and Peru due to higher average prices. 
Turning our attention now to our non-regulated Commercial Power segment, adjusted segment income was fairly consistent with the prior year quarter. However, there were a few key drivers to highlight. Due largely to the implementation of our new market-based Electric Security Plan in Ohio, we entered 2012 anticipating lower results from Commercial Power. As expected, our coal generation margins were down $0.07 per share. This was largely offset by the non-bypass-able stability charge which we are collecting through the end of 2014, which added $0.05 per share. 
Our non-regulated Midwest gas fleet continued to generate at record volumes, as quarterly generation was around 80% higher than the prior year quarter. However, these higher volumes were offset by lower PJM capacity revenues. 
Let me close with a few comments about our Ohio operations. Ohio has recently approved a state compensation mechanism for FRR entities, authorizing the recovery of their cost for capacity. As you know, Duke Energy Ohio is an FRR entity through May 2015, receiving market-based payments for capacity. We are reviewing the applicability of this recent decision to Duke Energy Ohio. 
There have also been recent market rumors about a potential sale of our Midwest generation assets. It is not our practice to comment on market rumors of this nature. But as we have shared with you, we are evaluating strategic options for this asset portfolio, but no decisions have been made. We will continue to update you as our plans develop. 
Slide 11 contains our quarterly volume trends by customer class for the Carolinas, Midwest and in total, based on calculations that exclude weather impacts. For the second quarter, our overall weather-normal volumes were around 1.3% higher than the prior year period, with similar increases seen in both the Carolinas and Midwest. This increase continues to be largely supported by industrial activity, which was 2.8% higher than the prior year quarter. 
In the Carolinas, the automotive sectors showed strength, while textiles continued their recent weakness. The Midwest experienced strength in the heavy equipment and automotive sectors, while softness was seen in the primary and fabricated metals sectors. 
Our residential customer class continues to grow at a modest level. For the quarter, weather-normalized residential volumes were higher by around 0.3%, principally supported by the Carolinas. This level of growth is mostly due to an increase of approximately 20,000, or 0.5%, average residential customers in the Carolinas and Midwest. Average residential kilowatt-hour usage has remained fairly consistent to the prior year. 
Finally, weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were around 0.8% higher than the prior year quarter. Continued volatility in retail sales trends and high office vacancy rates keep growth in this sector at modest levels. 
Consistent with our outlook during the first quarter earnings call, we remain cautious on the overall economic recovery. As a result, we are currently expecting fairly flat weather-normalized load for 2012 compared with 2011. 
Before we move on to the financial impacts of the merger, let me briefly discussed Progress' results for the quarter. Progress recognized second quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.71 in the prior year quarter. One of the largest contributing factors to these lower results was higher O&M costs of $0.23 per share, primarily due to an additional planned nuclear outage in the Carolinas. In addition, quarterly results were unfavorably impacted by weather in the Carolinas and Florida, a $0.09-per-share impact. Finally, lower costs of renewable amortization in Florida reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. 
We have included several earnings-related slides that you are accustomed to seeing for Progress in the appendix to today's presentation.
Let's turn now to the financial impacts of the merger. In the third quarter, we expect to recognize incremental goodwill of approximately $12 billion related to the Progress transaction. Additionally, we expect accounting charges resulting from the merger of between $450 million and $550 million to be recognized primarily in the last half of this year. These charges will be treated as special items and primarily consist of employee severance costs, costs related to the interim and permanent FERC mitigation plans, concessions agreed to with the Carolina commissions in order to receive merger approval and merger transaction costs. 
 
For the combined company, we continue to target 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share, adjusted for the 1-for-3 reverse stock split. As outlined on this slide, we expect the contribution from Progress in the last half of the year will be largely offset by the dilution from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger. 
Let me also highlight a few highlights of our financing plan. We have a busy financing calendar for the remainder of the year focused on funding our capital expenditures and debt maturities. In addition to about $1.3 billion of long-term financings at our Carolinas and Florida utilities, we have more than $2 billion of funding requirements planned at our holding company. Our holding company plan includes almost $1 billion of debt issued to reduce leverage at Duke Energy Ohio in connection with the pending transfer of generation assets out of the utility. These holding company needs will be met primarily with long-term taxable and tax-exempt debt, but may also include issuance of commercial paper. We will also complete non-recourse financings internationally and in our renewable energy business. 
Our current business plan continues to support no equity issuances through 2014. We have included further details on our assumed 2012 cash flows and financing plan in the appendix to today's presentation. 
I will close with Slide 13, which addresses our main financial objectives. We continue to target a long-term earnings growth range of 4% to 6% in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the combined company. The earnings growth potential of the company will continue to be anchored by investments in the regulated businesses, achieving reasonable regulatory outcomes, achieving merger integration benefits, managing our costs and continued contributions from our commercial businesses.
We expect to provide more specifics on our earnings growth opportunities by early 2013. At that time, we will have completed our normal 3-year financial planning process with the new management team and Board of Directors. We also expect to have greater clarity around the timing and expected financial impacts of our rate case filings in the Carolinas by early next year. 
We continue to focus on growing the dividend on an annual basis with a targeted dividend payout ratio of 65% to 70% based upon adjusted diluted earnings per share. In fact, in June, we announced an approximate 2% increase to our quarterly dividend payable in September. 
Before I close, I would like to briefly address S&P's decision to downgrade our credit ratings last week. The rating agency cited lack of transparency and heightened regulatory risk around the CEO transition. While we were disappointed and disagree with S&P's rating action and its assessment of the company's risk profile and governance practices, we remain committed to maintaining high credit quality and constructive relationships with our rating agencies. Our balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics continue to be strong, and both Moody's and Fitch have maintained stable outlooks for Duke Energy following the close of our merger. 
In summary, the size, scale and higher regulated business mix of the combined company gives us a solid base upon which to build. We expect to deliver on our commitment in order to achieve our financial objectives.

Before I open up the phone lines for your questions, let me correct one thing that I've said earlier. In talking about the first delamination, I said that NEIL has made payments but has withheld payment of approximately $70 million. I said $7 million. Maybe that was just wishful thinking, but they withheld payment of approximately $70 million, the majority of which relate to replacement power costs. 
With that, let's open up the phone lines for your questions."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. As you saw in our release from earlier today, Duke Energy announced adjusted diluted EPS of $1.02 for the second quarter of 2012, $0.03 higher than our prior-year quarterly results of $0.99. These results exceeded consensus estimates and we continue to be on track to achieve our guidance range for 2012 of $4.20 to $4.35 per share. This range represents 6 months of Duke on a stand-alone basis and 6 months as a combined company with Progress. 
After 18 months of hard work, we closed our merger on July 2. The strategic value of this transaction remains unchanged. The combination creates a new Duke with unmatched financial and operational scale and scope. The highly regulated business mix of the combined company supports the strength and growth of our dividend. We have a strong balance sheet that will allow us to manage through a time of transition in the utility industry. 
Slide 4 illustrates our clear focus as a combined company. Our goals have not changed. We will continue our strong track record of meeting our financial commitments. We will complete our major construction projects to provide clean, reliable energy to our customers. We will continue to focus on the efficient, safe and excellent performance of our fleet and our electric grid. And finally, we will work constructively with regulators in each of our jurisdictions. 
Let me highlight North Carolina and Florida. As many of you know, the sequence of events following the merger closing prompted the North Carolina Utilities Commission to schedule hearings about the unanticipated change in executive leadership. We presented testimony explaining the reasons behind the change. At the close of the hearing, before the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Chairman Finley mentioned the prospects for settlement. We are exploring the potential for an acceptable resolution. 
We are also working as a team to resolve Crystal River 3 in a way that meets the needs of our Florida customers, regulators and our investors. I've been asked to appear in front of the Florida commission on August 13 to discuss how the merger impacts our customers in Florida. I look forward to reaffirming our commitment to our customers in Florida. 
We have much work to do. Our deep bench of experience and talented leaders will keep us focused on the success of the new company. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent appointments as I turn to Slide 5. 
Keith Trent has assumed the role of Executive VP of our regulated utilities. This is a familiar role for Keith, as he previously led Duke's regulated utility business from '06 to 2009. Keith and his team, including our state presidents, will be focused on our regulatory relationships in each of our 6 regulated jurisdictions, as well as on the federal level. 
Chuck Whitlock has stepped in to lead our commercial businesses. Chuck has served as President of our Midwest generation fleet since 2009 and has over 12 years of service to Duke Energy or its predecessors. He and his team's significant experience in commercial markets will provide strong leadership for this business. 
Also, Lee Mazzocchi has been named to lead our integration efforts and will report directly to me. Lee has demonstrated strong execution skills and leadership abilities, and previously served as Progress's Chief Procurement Officer. Lee and his team will ensure the organization is keenly focused on achieving the merger benefits. 
The IT and supply chain's functions will now report to Lynn Good, and other administrative functions will report to our Chief Human Resources Officer, Jennifer Weber. 
Delivering the benefits of this merger for our customers and our investors is a key focus of our employees and our leadership team. Merger integration planning has been underway since we announced the merger in January 2011. Integration planning teams worked hard and put us in a great position for day 1 of the combined company. Key processes and systems were in place and up and running on July 2 to allow us to operate as one company. 
The integration teams have identified more than 600 savings opportunities. Accountability for these initiatives has been assigned to each of our Executive Vice Presidents and their respective organization. The integration team, led by Lee, is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the status on these initiatives. 
Our merger savings opportunities fall into 2 broad categories. The first is non-fuel O&M savings, which over time will benefit all customers and investors. The second is fuel and joint dispatch savings, which will immediately benefit our Carolinas customers. 
Let me update you on our non-fuel O&M savings opportunities before discussing our fuel and joint dispatch savings. When we announced the merger, we targeted a savings run rate in the range of 5% to 7% of total non-fuel O&M. This level of savings continues to be within our overall planning assumptions of combined O&M of around $6 billion. Consistent with our plans, we expect to achieve the full run rate of savings by 2014. 
Slide 6 includes a pie chart showing the broad categories of O&M savings opportunities we are projecting. Around 70% relate to consolidation of redundant functions, including labor savings and consolidation of IT systems. We are well on our way in both of these areas. 
Around 1,100 employees across the organization have accepted our Voluntary Severance Program. Depending on their job function, these employees will transition their roles and leave the companies at varying points within the next 15 months. We expect over half of these employees will leave the company by the end of 2012 as we begin consolidating corporate functions. We expect to achieve the remaining targeted labor reductions by 2014 by not filling some of our current vacancies and through normal attrition. 
We expect to consolidate duplicate IT systems into single platforms, leveraging investments made by Duke Energy to build scalable IT systems. 19 projects were completed in connection with legal day 1 and 55 more will be underway by the end of 2012. The remaining savings will come from implementing operational best practices, such as common operating models, centralized support organizations and standardized work practices. In addition, we expect supply chain and purchasing benefits that come from increased size and scale. Some of these have already been put in place. 
Slide 7 shows you our progress in realizing fuel and joint dispatch savings. Beginning on day 1 of the merger, we are jointly dispatching generating fleets to the Carolinas. In fact, yesterday, we filed a request with the Carolinas commissions to reduce customers' rates by around $89 million over the next 12 months. This will allow our Carolinas customers to begin receiving benefits in their bills as early as this fall.
We have guaranteed a minimum of $650 million in joint dispatch and fuel savings over the first 5 years after merger close. We also have an additional 18 months of timing flexibility if we determine we're unable to achieve the savings within 5 years due to the impact of low natural gas prices on gas consumption. We are confident in our ability to achieve this level of savings. 
Fuel savings are expected to be achieved primarily through coal blending and coal purchasing efficiencies, which result in enhanced buying power and reduced coal transportation costs. Just over 60% of the projected fuel savings are already under contract.
Jeff Lyash and his team have been closely monitoring the joint dispatch savings. On a typical day, we move more than 1,000 megawatts between Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas. Every megawatt-hour that flows between these systems represents savings for our customers. This success results from outstanding teamwork and is happening without sacrificing reliability during some of the recent hot weather. 
We feel good about where we are from an integration perspective and will work hard to deliver on the level of savings we expected to result from this transaction. 
I want to recognize our employees, nearly 30,000 strong, who have remained dedicated to their work and to achieving quick results. I am pleased with how our people are working together. We look to finalize the remainder of the organization very shortly. We're operating as one team, one company, united in our mission to deliver value and benefits to our customers, investors and the communities we serve. 
Turning to Slide 8, I want to take a few minutes to discuss where we are with Crystal River 3. Many of you recall that in late 2009, Crystal River 3 experienced a delamination of its containment structure and has remained out of service since that time. The delamination was repaired. Then in March 2011, a second delamination occurred during re-tensioning of the structure. Throughout 2011 and 2012, work has been underway to refine and advance engineering on a potential repair solution. 
We are also pursuing insurance recovery from NEIL, a mutual insurance company that provides coverage to the nuclear industry. In February 2012, a settlement agreement was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission which outlines a framework for regulatory treatment of either a decision to repair or retire the unit. 
Let me give you an update on 3 critical items: one, the status of the technical repair option; two, the status of ongoing discussions with NEIL; and finally, our decision process on the best way to move forward with Crystal River 3. 
Work continues on the technical repair option, which involves removing and replacing concrete in substantial portions of the structure. Over the last year, progress has been made on the engineering and vendor selection required for the repair option. Refinement of the engineering and the associated risk assessment for the repair option continues, including completion of an independent technical review initiated by the Duke board. Based on the preliminary results of this independent review, the repair plan appears to be technically feasible, but issues remain that need to be resolved as the engineering and risk assessment continues. 
As of June 2011, repair costs were estimated at between $900 million to $1.3 billion based upon preliminary engineering. These estimates are under continuing review, and while this process has not yet been finalized, the cost estimate is trending higher. 
Let me move to insurance coverage. Insurance coverage related to repair costs and incremental costs of replacement power is held through NEIL. There are a few important points to note. First, this is the largest claim that NEIL has received in its history. NEIL has established a special committee to carefully evaluate the claim. Second, related to the first delamination, NEIL has made payments, but has withheld a payment of approximately $7 million, the majority of which related to replacement power cost. We expect these costs will be recoverable through the fuel clause in Florida. 
Further, NEIL has not made any payments on the second delamination. NEIL has also not yet provided a final written coverage decision for either delamination. We continue to meet with NEIL representatives. In order to attempt to resolve differences between the parties, we have entered into a non-binding mediation process with NEIL. The mediation is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. 
Let me highlight key next steps in our evaluation. We continue to analyze both repair and retire scenarios. Our final economic analysis and our decisions will be informed by the following factors: engineering, vendor selection, contract negotiations, risk assessments, insurance availability, insurance recovery and customer impacts. Although we recognize the importance of making a repair or retire decision by the end of 2012 under the Florida settlement agreement, we are not prepared, at this time, to set a date certain by which such decision will be made. We will continue to update you on key decisions and milestones related to our assessment as they occur. Our decisions will be made within the context of the existing and very important regulatory settlement provisions in Florida. Crystal River is a high priority for Duke, our customers and the communities that we serve. 
Turning now to Slide 11 (sic) [Slide 9], let me give you an update on Edwardsport in Indiana and other major construction projects in the Carolinas. The target date for placing Edwardsport IGCC plant in service has moved from early September 12 to early 2013. This is due to testing and start-up taking longer than originally expected as we work through this large, complex project. The new target date gives us more time for the remaining testing and start-up procedures to ensure that we have identified and corrected all issues prior to the in-service date. The start-up delays which have occurred today have impacted the level of contingencies related to this project. As a result, we're continuing to evaluate the estimated cost to complete the project and we'll provide updates as appropriate. We presently do not expect additional costs to be material in the overall cost of the project. 
We've achieved major milestones, including operation of the plant's turbines. We put power into the electric grid during testing and we expect the plant to produce power using natural gas ahead of commercial operations. More than half of all the operating systems of the plant are under the care, custody and control of the operations group, meaning they were successfully constructed, tested and ready for service. 
General Electric's new product introduction validation process is well underway, with both gas turbines having cleared GE's stringent process using natural gas. Validation of the gasification system is the next critical step. Related to the settlement agreement we reached with certain intervening parties in late April, hearings were completed in mid-July. The next steps include the settling parties filing a proposed order on August 17 and reply briefs to the intervenor exceptions on September 14. We expect a commission decision in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In the Carolinas, the Cliffside clean coal project and 3 combined cycle gas projects, Dan River, Lee and Sutton, are all on schedule and on budget. We intend to file rate cases at Duke Carolinas and Progress Carolinas later this year, requesting the recovery of Cliffside, Dan River and Lee plant. The construction of all 3 plants were authorized by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. 
We also expect to retire 3 of Progress Energy's Carolinas coal plants later this year: the H.F. Lee Plant, the Cape Fear Plant and Robinson Unit 1. These plants represent total capacity of approximately 900 megawatts, which is in addition to the approximate 1,700 megawatts of capacity Duke Energy Carolinas has already announced that it will retire. 
In our renewables business, we just completed the 130 megawatt Cimarron wind project. We have remaining projects of 640 megawatts expected to come online by the end of 2012. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn, who will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance for the quarter, as well as some perspective on Progress's second quarter results. She will also provide additional financial updates."
267850,214304734,340185,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2012",2012-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. This morning, I'll begin with an overview of Duke Energy's stand-alone second quarter earnings results for each of its business segments; an update on retail customer volume trends and economic conditions; our financial objectives for 2012, i",1579,"Thanks, Jim. This morning, I'll begin with an overview of Duke Energy's stand-alone second quarter earnings results for each of its business segments; an update on retail customer volume trends and economic conditions; our financial objectives for 2012, including our earnings per share guidance range for the combined company; our financial objectives going forward; and finally, a few comments on Progress's quarterly results. 
It's important to highlight that our quarterly results do not include Progress Energy's results, as the merger closed on July 2. However, Progress will be included in our consolidated results beginning with the third quarter. 
As highlighted on Slide 10, Duke reported second quarter 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.02. This compares to $0.99 per share for the prior quarter. At current year and prior year earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-3 reverse stock split which was completed immediately prior to closing the merger with Progress in early July. 
Our regulated U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas segment recognized quarterly adjusted segment income that was $0.09 higher than the second quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily due to revised customer rates in the Carolinas implemented in February of this year. We also had lower O&M costs as a result of fewer major storms. We continue to closely manage our O&M costs, particularly in our fossil fleet, given the lower natural gas price environment and lower generation from our coal plants. These favorable results were partially offset by less favorable weather for the quarter as compared to the prior year. Even though cooling degree days were 18% higher than normal, this was lower than the approximate 25% variance to normal in the prior quarter. 
Let's move on to international, which as expected, had segment income $0.05 per share lower than the prior year quarter. International's results were negatively impacted by unfavorable pricing in Central America, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Partially offsetting these results were favorable results in Brazil and Peru due to higher average prices. 
Turning our attention now to our non-regulated Commercial Power segment, adjusted segment income was fairly consistent with the prior year quarter. However, there were a few key drivers to highlight. Due largely to the implementation of our new market-based Electric Security Plan in Ohio, we entered 2012 anticipating lower results from Commercial Power. As expected, our coal generation margins were down $0.07 per share. This was largely offset by the non-bypass-able stability charge which we are collecting through the end of 2014, which added $0.05 per share. 
Our non-regulated Midwest gas fleet continued to generate at record volumes, as quarterly generation was around 80% higher than the prior year quarter. However, these higher volumes were offset by lower PJM capacity revenues. 
Let me close with a few comments about our Ohio operations. Ohio has recently approved a state compensation mechanism for FRR entities, authorizing the recovery of their cost for capacity. As you know, Duke Energy Ohio is an FRR entity through May 2015, receiving market-based payments for capacity. We are reviewing the applicability of this recent decision to Duke Energy Ohio. 
There have also been recent market rumors about a potential sale of our Midwest generation assets. It is not our practice to comment on market rumors of this nature. But as we have shared with you, we are evaluating strategic options for this asset portfolio, but no decisions have been made. We will continue to update you as our plans develop. 
Slide 11 contains our quarterly volume trends by customer class for the Carolinas, Midwest and in total, based on calculations that exclude weather impacts. For the second quarter, our overall weather-normal volumes were around 1.3% higher than the prior year period, with similar increases seen in both the Carolinas and Midwest. This increase continues to be largely supported by industrial activity, which was 2.8% higher than the prior year quarter. 
In the Carolinas, the automotive sectors showed strength, while textiles continued their recent weakness. The Midwest experienced strength in the heavy equipment and automotive sectors, while softness was seen in the primary and fabricated metals sectors. 
Our residential customer class continues to grow at a modest level. For the quarter, weather-normalized residential volumes were higher by around 0.3%, principally supported by the Carolinas. This level of growth is mostly due to an increase of approximately 20,000, or 0.5%, average residential customers in the Carolinas and Midwest. Average residential kilowatt-hour usage has remained fairly consistent to the prior year. 
Finally, weather-normalized volumes for our commercial customers were around 0.8% higher than the prior year quarter. Continued volatility in retail sales trends and high office vacancy rates keep growth in this sector at modest levels. 
Consistent with our outlook during the first quarter earnings call, we remain cautious on the overall economic recovery. As a result, we are currently expecting fairly flat weather-normalized load for 2012 compared with 2011. 
Before we move on to the financial impacts of the merger, let me briefly discussed Progress' results for the quarter. Progress recognized second quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.71 in the prior year quarter. One of the largest contributing factors to these lower results was higher O&M costs of $0.23 per share, primarily due to an additional planned nuclear outage in the Carolinas. In addition, quarterly results were unfavorably impacted by weather in the Carolinas and Florida, a $0.09-per-share impact. Finally, lower costs of renewable amortization in Florida reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. 
We have included several earnings-related slides that you are accustomed to seeing for Progress in the appendix to today's presentation.
Let's turn now to the financial impacts of the merger. In the third quarter, we expect to recognize incremental goodwill of approximately $12 billion related to the Progress transaction. Additionally, we expect accounting charges resulting from the merger of between $450 million and $550 million to be recognized primarily in the last half of this year. These charges will be treated as special items and primarily consist of employee severance costs, costs related to the interim and permanent FERC mitigation plans, concessions agreed to with the Carolina commissions in order to receive merger approval and merger transaction costs. 
 
For the combined company, we continue to target 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share, adjusted for the 1-for-3 reverse stock split. As outlined on this slide, we expect the contribution from Progress in the last half of the year will be largely offset by the dilution from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger. 
Let me also highlight a few highlights of our financing plan. We have a busy financing calendar for the remainder of the year focused on funding our capital expenditures and debt maturities. In addition to about $1.3 billion of long-term financings at our Carolinas and Florida utilities, we have more than $2 billion of funding requirements planned at our holding company. Our holding company plan includes almost $1 billion of debt issued to reduce leverage at Duke Energy Ohio in connection with the pending transfer of generation assets out of the utility. This holding company needs will be met primarily with long-term taxable and tax-exempt debt, but may also include issuance of commercial paper. We will also complete non-recourse financings internationally and in our renewable energy business. 
Our current business plan continues to support no equity issuances through 2014. We have included further details on our assumed 2012 cash flows and financing plan in the appendix to today's presentation. 
I will close with Slide 13, which addresses our main financial objectives. We continue to target a long-term earnings growth range of 4% to 6% in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the combined company. The earnings growth potential of the company will continue to be anchored by investments in the regulated businesses, achieving reasonable regulatory outcomes, achieving merger integration benefits, managing our costs and continued contributions from our commercial businesses.
We expect to provide more specifics on our earnings growth opportunities by early 2013. At that time, we will have completed our normal 3-year financial planning process with the new management team and Board of Directors. We also expect to have greater clarity around the timing and expected financial impacts of our rate case filings in the Carolinas by early next year. 
We continue to focus on growing the dividend on an annual basis with a targeted dividend payout ratio of 65% to 70% based upon adjusted diluted earnings per share. In fact, in June, we announced an approximate 2% increase to our quarterly dividend payable in September. 
Before I close, I would like to briefly address S&P's decision to downgrade our credit ratings last week. The rating agency cited lack of transparency and heightened regulatory risk around the CEO transition. While we were disappointed and disagree with S&P's rating action and its assessment of the company's risk profile and governance practices, we remain committed to maintaining high credit quality and constructive relationships with our rating agencies. Our balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics continue to be strong, and both Moody's and Fitch have maintained stable outlooks for Duke Energy following the close of our merger. 
In summary, the size, scale and higher regulated business mix of the combined company gives us a solid base upon which to build. We expect to deliver on our commitment in order to achieve our financial objectives. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim."

Before I open up the phone lines for your questions, let me correct one thing that I've said earlier. In talking about the first delamination, I said that NEIL has made payments but has withheld payment of approximately $70 million. I said $7 million. Maybe that was just wishful thinking, but they withheld payment of approximately $70 million, the majority of which relate to replacement power costs. 
With that, let's open up the phone lines for your questions."

As a combined company, we're off to a great start. The third quarter results reflect our efforts. We are pleased with what we've already accomplished and the positive momentum we've created. 
The work of our employees has been outstanding. As the 2 companies come together, we continue to focus on our mission for customers, and that is providing affordable, reliable and increasingly clean electricity on a 24/7 basis. We are focused and will continue to meet our merger commitments, achieving synergies and savings for both customers and investors. 
Today, Duke Energy announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47 for the third quarter. This compares to prior year quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share. Once again, we exceeded Wall Street consensus estimates. In the quarter, we continue to realize the benefits from our fleet modernization program despite less favorable weather and more results in our nonregulated commercial businesses. We are positioned to finish the year within our targeted adjusted diluted earnings guidance range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share. 
Before going further, I'd like to say a word about Sandy. We were saddened by the loss of life and enormous damage caused by this storm. We were very fortunate that our service areas were spared the brunt of it. We have quickly deployed contractors and employees to assist other utilities with restoration. In total, we sent over 2,900 workers to help in 8 states from Virginia to Connecticut. I deeply appreciate the commitment and dedication of these workers, most of whom are still working to restore service in New York and New Jersey. It is an example of how our new scale and geographic scope have made our storm response capabilities even stronger. 
Since merger closed, we've been focused on 5 key near-term priorities: first, resolving the North Carolina Utilities Commission's investigation into the post merger change in leadership and achieving successful outcomes in our rate cases in the Carolinas; second, achieving merger savings and efficiencies and successfully integrating the new company into a stronger, more efficient organization; third, completing the work necessary to determine the way forward for the Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida; fourth, putting the Edwardsport IGCC plant into service and receiving approval of the associated regulatory settlement in Indiana; and fifth, our ongoing effort to optimize the performance of our nuclear generating fleet. 
Over the next 9 to 12 months, we expect to resolve many of these priorities while making substantial progress on the others. For example, successful merger integration and optimizing nuclear performance will be ongoing priorities beyond this period. 
A word on the status of the North Carolina Utilities Commission investigation. This investigation is ongoing and we are maintaining open communications with the commission. We will continue to keep you informed on this ongoing matter. 
Next, let me turn to Slide 5. We are nearing completion of our $9 billion fleet modernization program. This will position the company to comply with more stringent environmental rules, and it will increase the efficiency and fuel diversity of our generation sources. This program allows us to ultimately retire up to 6,800 megawatts of our older, less efficient coal-fired generation. In order to recover these important investments, we have rate cases planned in the Carolinas. 
The first of these rate cases is the one progress energy Carolinas filed in North Carolina last month. This marks its first base rate inquiries request in North Carolina in 25 years. We have requested a net increase in annualized customer rates of $359 million. This is based upon an ROE of 11.25%, a 55.4% equity component of the cap structure and a retail rate base of about $6.9 billion for the estimated date of the hearings. Around 70% of the requested rate increase is due to capital investments. This includes the 600-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Smith energy complex, which went into service in June of 2011. It includes the 920 megawatts Lee energy complex scheduled for commercial operation by year-end. The filing also includes the quip associated with the 625-megawatt Sutton combined cycle gas plant expected to be in service in late 2013, although these plants were approved by the commission through its certification process. 
The commission has established a procedural schedule and evidentiary hearings will be held beginning on March 18, 2013. We expect revised rates to be in effect by mid-2013. 
We are also finalizing our rate case filings for Duke Energy-Carolinas. These petitions are expected to be the last in a series of 3 rate cases for Duke Energy-Carolinas to recover capital investments made to modernize the generation fleet. This includes the 825-megawatt pulverized coal unit at Cliffside, the 620 megawatt combined cycle natural gas plant at Dan River and certain upgrades made via Cody nuclear station. After discussions with the North Carolina Public staff, we have shifted the filing of the cases for Duke Energy-Carolinas until the first quarter of 2013. Our North Carolina filing will be made around 1 month before our South Carolina filing. In connection with this shift in timing, we will request approval to defer depreciation, O&M expense and a return on Cliffside and Dan River until new customer rates are in effect. The public staff will not oppose this deferral request. 
Next, I'll provide an update on our progress with the merger integration as outlined on Slide 6. I'm very pleased with how our 2 companies have come together. We are well on our way to achieving the benefits expected from this transaction. Over the last 4 months, we have essentially completed staffing the organization. As you all may recall, about 1,100 employees applied for our Voluntary Severance Program. More than 1/2 of this group are expected to leave by year end, with the rest leaving over the next 12 months or so. We remain on track to achieve the guaranteed $650 million in fuel and joint dispatch savings over the first 5 years. We are dispatching the generating fleets in the Carolinas as one combined fleet. 
Joint dispatch, along with fuel savings, produce significant and immediate cost efficiencies that directly benefit our customers in the Carolinas. Effective September 1, we implemented a $70 million rate decrement in the Carolinas to begin passing on the expected first year savings to customers. These efficiencies will extend beyond the 5-year regulatory period and will help us mitigate the impact of future customer rate increases. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7, which outlines our ongoing evaluation of whether to repair or retire the Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida. On October 1, we provided the Florida Public Service Commission with an independent engineering report commissioned by the Duke Energy Board of Directors in March 2012. This report evaluated 3 things: first, the technical feasibility and risk of the current repair option;  Two, the estimated costs to repair the unit; and finally, the timeline needed to repair the unit. Zapata Inc. is the engineering firm that produced the report. They found that although the current repair plan appears technically feasible, a number of risk and technical issues remain that need to be resolved, including the ultimate scope of any repair. We have formed the technical review team to analyze the issues raised in the independent report. The team will continue to refine and evaluate the risk, scope, cost estimates and schedule if the unit is repaired. Because of the ongoing review of the scope and cost, it is unlikely we will begin any repair before year end. Therefore, as outlined in the settlement agreement, we're subject to a total $100 million customer refund for replacement power cost in 2015 and '16. This liability was recognized in the third quarter with an offsetting increase to goodwill. 
We continue to have conversations with NEIL, the nuclear insurance company, regarding the level of insurance coverage for the repairs. NEIL has not yet finalized its coverage positions. We expect to hold nonbinding mediation discussions with NEIL later in the fourth quarter. If we do not reach a mediated settlement, the next step is binding arbitration. The company has not made a final decision either to repair or to retire Crystal River 3. However, the regulatory settlement approved by the Florida Commission earlier this year provides a framework for either path forward. We expect the decision could be made either by the end of this year or by summer 2013. We will proceed with preparing the unit only if there is a high degree of confidence that the repair can be completed within our estimated cost and schedule. Any final decision will be made in the best interest of our customers, joint owners and investors. 
In Indiana, we are focused on bringing the Edwardsport plant online and receiving approval of the regulatory settlement for cost recovery. This has been a challenging project but an important one, not only for our company, but also for the state of Indiana. Edwardsport will use local Indiana coal in an environmentally responsible manner. We are currently in the testing and start of phase and about halfway through General Electric's new product introduction testing process. We have achieved important milestones: first, construction is complete; second, we have operated both the combustion and steam turbines on natural gas; third, in late October, we achieved syngas production from coal on one of the gasifiers and began testing the combustion turbines on syngas. Additional testing will continue over the next several months. 
This testing and startup phase is identified and correcting issues prior to startup. Issues discovered during the equipment testing and commissioning of the project have required an extension of the project timeline, the in-service date is now scheduled for mid-2013. Based on lower-than-projected revenues and additional costs resulting from the delayed in-service date, our updated cost estimate for the plant is $3.154 billion, excluding AFUDC of approximately $400 million. The estimated cost increase results and the recognition of a pretax charge of about $180 million in the third quarter of 2012. This charge has been treated as a special item and excluded from Duke Energy's adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
As for the Edwardsport regulatory settlement, the hearings wrapped up in July. We are optimistic the Indiana commission will rule on this matter by year-end. 
Turning to Slide 9, let me update you on our other major new plants under construction. Cliffside Unit 6 is now undergoing an intensive testing and commissioning process. We expect Cliffside to become commercially available by the end of the year, with the current approved budget. Our combined cycle natural gas projects in the Carolinas, Dan River, Lee and Sutton, are all on budget and on schedule. Both River and Lee are expected to be commercially available before year end. 
Before moving on to our commercial businesses, let me briefly discuss our nuclear fleet. Our combined nuclear organization has enormous experience in depth of talent. Today, we operate a nuclear fleet of around 11,000 megawatts with all of our plans in the Carolinas, except one. During the third quarter, our operational performance for the combined nuclear fleet was strong. We performed at an approximate 98% capacity factor, excluding Crystal River 3. This exceptional performance gave our customers the benefit of efficient and reliable nuclear generation during the hot summer months when they need it most. We continue to push for improvement and overall consistency and fleet performance. Safety is always first. We also focus closely on reliability and efficiency metrics such as capacity factors and operating costs per megawatt hour. We are leveraging best practices and making additional investments in our nuclear fleet to optimize safety, reliability and efficiency. 
I want to take a moment to provide a few updates on our Commercial Power and International Operations. In late August, Duke Energy Ohio filed a request with the Ohio Commission to establish a charge for its cost to providing capacity services in PJM, consistent with the new state compensation mechanism. This filing also included a request for deferral treatment of the differences between our cost base capacity charge and the PJM market prices from August 2012 through May 2015. This filing does not seek to alter the Electric Security Plan under which Duke Energy Ohio is currently operating. A procedural schedule has been established for the capacity filing. It currently includes a hearing date of April 2, 2013. We have filed a motion with the Ohio Commission requesting an expedited schedule. Our current focus is on obtaining approval of this cost base capacity compensation mechanism, gaining necessary clarity on this capacity filing will inform any long-term strategic decisions related to this asset portfolio. 
The renewable portion of our Commercial Power portfolio continues to grow. We project a total renewable capacity of around 2,000 megawatts in service by the end of this year. Earlier this year, we finalized a joint venture agreement with Sumitomo on 2 of our Kansas renewable wind projects, Cimarron II and Ironwood. Both are already in service. 
As for our International business, it continues to perform very well. This business has provided reliable earnings over time. You may recall that Brazil represents 1/2 of the earnings from our International business. In September, the President of Brazil proposed a program to reduce electricity tariffs by an average of around 20%. This is tied to concessions scheduled to expire in 2015 and 2017. We anticipate this program will be finalized in early 2013. The program, if approved, is not expected to impact our Brazilian assets in the short term because our concession agreements expire in 2029 and 2033. Additionally, our assets are almost fully contracted through 2014 and around 60% committed in 2015 and 2016. We will continue to monitor this development and potential impact on market prices as we pursue additional contracting for our generation fleet. 
In summary, we're off to a great start as a combined company. It shows in our financial performance, it shows in the savings we've delivered to our customers from day 1 and it shows in the way our employees have focused on performing their work. I appreciate and am thankful for their laser focus on excellence in all they do. 
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn who will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance with the third quarter and going forward."

I will begin with an overview of Duke Energy's third quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends in economic conditions, as well as our financial objectives going forward. As sum",1305,"Thank you, Jim. I will begin with an overview of Duke Energy's third quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends in economic conditions, as well as our financial objectives going forward. 
As summarized on Slide 11, for the third quarter of 2012, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47, slightly lower than the $1.50 for third quarter 2011. However, it's important to remember that our prior year results included $0.12 of favorable weather. Even though weather was favorable this year, it was not at the same level we experienced in 2011. This quarter is also the first period that reflects Progress Energy's results in our financial statements. Also remember that last year's results have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-3 reverse stock split that occurred just prior to the merger closing. 
On a reported basis, our earnings for the quarter were $0.85 per share as compared to $1.06 per share for the prior year quarter. These reported results for the third quarter 2012 include $0.17 of impairment charges related to the estimated cost increases at Edwardsport and merger-related costs of around $0.42. These charges are considered special items and, therefore, have been excluded from our quarterly adjusted EPS. The merger-related costs consists of employee severance costs, costs related to the interim and permanent FERC mitigation plan, concessions agreed to with the Carolinas commissions in order to receive merger approval and merger transaction costs. 
Let me briefly discuss the primary adjusted earnings per share drivers for each of our business segments. Adjusted earnings at our Regulated Business, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, were $0.62 higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the addition of the former Progress Energy regulated utility operations in the Carolinas and Florida. Updated customer pricing, including the implementation of revised customer rates at Duke Energy-Carolinas, also contributed to USFE&G's increase in quarterly results by $0.12 per share. These favorable drivers were partially offset by less favorable weather. 
Duke Energy International's results for the quarter were $0.02 lower due primarily to unfavorable exchange rates in Brazil. As expected, Commercial Power's results were $0.06 lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to implementation of the new market-based Electric Security Plan in Ohio. Our nonregulated Midwest gas generating fleet realized the lower PJM capacity revenues as the market-based price fell from $110 for megawatt day in the prior year quarter to $16 for megawatt day in the current quarter. Due to continued low natural gas prices, this gas-fired fleet continued operating at record generating levels. Actual generation for the quarter was around 35% higher than the prior year quarter. 
Other financial drivers for the quarter included dilution of $0.54 for the quarter-over-quarter impact on EPS resulting from the issuance of additional shares in connection with the merger and $0.05 of additional interest expense on Progress Energy holding company. As you will recall, we issued around 258 million shares to former holders of Progress Energy common stock and now have around 700 million shares of Duke Energy outstanding. 
An important consideration as you evaluate our year-to-date EPS results is that the weighted average number of shares outstanding will increase from the current year-to-date average of 531 million to 575 million shares for full year 2012. 
Slide 12 presents one our quarter-over-quarter weather-normalized customer usage trends, as well as what we are experiencing on a rolling 12-month basis for our Regulated Business. This chart includes trends for the Progress Energy utilities compared to what they experienced last year. Trends for the third quarter show residential and industrial demand down from the prior year quarter. Since volume trends in any single quarter can be difficult to evaluate, we have also included 12-month rolling average volume trends as a point of comparison. Over the 12-month horizon, total weather-normalized load is slightly higher with growth seen in all major customer classes. 
For residential customers, we continue to experience growth in the number of customers in each of our service territories. In fact, the average number of residential customers has increased by around 50,000 or 0.7% over last year's quarter. This growth is around double what we experienced at this time last year. However, average usage for residential customer continues to trend modestly lower as a result of the challenging economy and energy efficiency efforts. Industrial demand reflects recent weakness in primary metals in the Midwest, the chemicals sector and textile customers in the Carolinas. The automotive sector remains strong. 
We entered the year expecting overall load growth to be less than 1% over the prior year. Our actual experience to date has generally met expectations although customer usage patterns continue to be hampered by the economic uncertainty. Despite improvements in national unemployment, home sales and retail sales, U.S. fiscal policy and the European situation leave us cautious about the strength of future growth. We believe our service territories are well positioned and remain attractive for the long term. However, we are planning our business for an environment of very modest load growth until we see greater economic stability. 
As Bob highlighted during his opening comments, we will hold our analyst meeting in late February in New York. During that meeting, we will discuss our overall business strategy, our 2013 earnings guidance range, CapEx and financing assumptions. You will also have the opportunity here from our executive team on focus areas and their businesses. During this meeting, we will discuss our long-term earnings growth objectives for the new combined company. We continue to target a long-term earnings growth range of 4% to 6% and adjusted diluted earnings per share and have determined that 2013, the first full year for the combined company, represents an appropriate base for future growth. 
Our long-term earnings growth potential remains strong and will continue to be anchored by investments in the Regulated Businesses, weather-normalized load growth, reaching reasonable regulatory outcomes, particularly in the Carolinas and Ohio, achieving merger integration benefits and synergies, managing our costs, including emergent work related to our nuclear fleet and the addition of new resources, and continued contributions from our commercial businesses. 
We have included on Slide 13 an overview of the primary earnings drivers we expect in each of these areas for 2013. Continued growth in the Regulated Businesses and our ability to harvest merger synergies will help us mitigate the decline in PJM capacity revenues impacting our nonregulated Midwest generation. Our detailed planning for 2013 and beyond continues and we look forward to discussing our strategic plan in further detail during our analyst meeting in late February. 
I will close with Slide 14 which references our main financial objectives. We remain on track to achieve our 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share, adjusted for the 1-for-3 reverse stock split. In addition to growth in our long-term earnings per share, continued growth in the dividend remained central to our investor value proposition. We are targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% based on adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our current dividend yield of 4.9% remains attractive compared to the S&P and the current low interest rate environment. 
The strength of our balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics support our ability to grow the business, as well as the dividend. We remain committed to maintaining this financial strength, which allows us to finance our growth in a cost-effective manner, directly benefiting our customers. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our quarterly financial performance and how we hit the ground running as the new Duke Energy. We have a strong growth platform as efficiencies from the merger allow us to pass along savings to our customers and shareholders. From a financial perspective, we remain very well positioned for the future. 
Now let me turn the call back over to Jim for closing comments."

Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 in the presentation package presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. You should also refer to the information on our 2011 10-K and other SEC filings concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from these forward-looking information.

Slide 3 details the topics for today's call. First, Jim will provide an update on our key priorities, and Lynn will review our quarterly financial results. After these prepared remarks, we will take your questions.
The management team of Duke Energy will host an analyst meeting in New York City in late February. During that meeting, we will update you on our strategic goals and our progress in resolving our near-term priorities. At that time, we will provide our 2013 earnings guidance range and related assumptions, including our long-term earnings growth rate and expectations.

As a combined company, we're off to a great start. The third quarter results reflect our efforts. We are pleased with what were already accomplished in the positive momentum we've created.
The work of our employees has been outstanding. As the 2 companies come together, we continue to focus on our mission for customers, and that is providing affordable, reliable and increasingly clean electricity on a 24/7 basis. We are focused and will continue to meet our merger commitments, achieving synergies and savings for both customers and investors.
Today, Duke Energy announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47 for the third quarter. This compares to prior year quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share. Once again, we exceeded Wall Street consensus estimates.
In the quarter, we continue to realize the benefits from our fleet modernization program despite less favorable weather and more results in our nonregulated commercial businesses. We are positioned to finish the year within our targeted adjusted diluted earnings guidance range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share.
Before going further, I'd like to say a word about Sandy. We were saddened by the loss of life and enormous damage caused by this storm. We were very fortunate that our service areas were spared the brunt of it. We have quickly deployed contractors and employees to assist other utilities with restoration. In total, we sent over 2,900 workers to help in 8 states from Virginia to Connecticut. I deeply appreciate the commitment and dedication of these workers, most of whom are still working to restore service in New York and New Jersey. It is an example of how our new scale and geographic scope have made our storm response capabilities even stronger.
Since merger closed, we've been focused on 5 key near-term priorities: first, resolving the North Carolina Utilities Commission's investigation into the post-merger change in leadership and achieving successful outcomes in our rate cases in the Carolinas; second, achieving merger savings and efficiencies and successfully integrating the new company into a stronger, more efficient organization; third, completing the work necessary to determine the way forward for the Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida; fourth, putting the Edwardsport IGCC plant into service and receiving approval of the associated regulatory settlement in Indiana; and fifth, our ongoing effort to optimize the performance of our nuclear generating fleet.
Over the next 9 to 12 months, we expect to resolve many of these priorities while making substantial progress on the others. For example, successful merger integration and optimizing nuclear performance will be ongoing priorities beyond this period.
A word on the status of the North Carolina Utilities Commission investigation. This investigation is ongoing, and we are maintaining open communications with the commission. We will continue to keep you informed on this ongoing matter.
Next, let me turn to Slide 5. We are nearing completion of our $9 billion fleet modernization program. This will position the company to comply with more stringent environmental rules, and it will increase the efficiency and fuel diversity of our generation sources. This program allows us to ultimately retire up to 6,800 megawatts of our older, less efficient coal-fired generation. In order to recover these important investments, we have rate cases planned in the Carolinas.
The first of these rate cases is the one Progress Energy Carolinas filed in North Carolina last month. This marks its first base rate inquiries request in North Carolina in 25 years. We have requested a net increase in annualized customer rates of $359 million. This is based upon an ROE of 11.25%, a 55.4% equity component of the cap structure and a retail rate base of about $6.9 billion for the estimated date of the hearings. Around 70% of the requested rate increase is due to capital investments. This includes the 600-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Smith Energy Complex, which went into service in June of 2011; it includes the 920-megawatt Lee Energy Complex scheduled for commercial operation by year end. The filing also includes the quip associated with the 625-megawatt Sutton combined cycle gas plant expected to be in service in late 2013. All of these plants were approved by the commission through its certification process.
The commission has established a procedural schedule, and evidentiary hearings will be held beginning on March 18, 2013. We expect revised rates to be in effect by mid-2013.
We are also finalizing our rate case filings for Duke Energy Carolinas. These petitions are expected to be the last in a series of 3 rate cases for Duke Energy Carolinas to recover capital investments made to modernize the generation fleet. This includes the 825-megawatt pulverized coal unit at Cliffside, the 620-megawatt combined cycle natural gas plant at Dan River and certain upgrades made at the Oconee nuclear station.
After discussions with the North Carolina Public Staff, we have shifted the filing of the cases for Duke Energy Carolinas until the first quarter of 2013. Our North Carolina filing will be made around 1 month before our South Carolina filing. In connection with this shift in timing, we will request approval to defer depreciation, O&M expense and the return on Cliffside and Dan River until new customer rates are in effect. The Public Staff will not oppose this deferral request.
Next, I'll provide an update on our progress with merger integration as outlined on Slide 6. I'm very pleased with how our 2 companies have come together. We are well on our way to achieving the benefits expected from this transaction. Over the last 4 months, we have essentially completed staffing the organization. As you all may recall, about 1,100 employees applied for our Voluntary Severance Program. More than half of this group are expected to leave by year end, with the rest leaving over the next 12 months or so. We remain on track to achieve the guaranteed $650 million in fuel and joint dispatch savings over the first 5 years. We are dispatching the generating fleets in the Carolinas as one combined fleet.
Joint dispatch, along with fuel savings, produce significant and immediate cost efficiencies that directly benefit our customers in the Carolinas. Effective September 1, we implemented a $70 million rate decrement in the Carolinas to begin passing on the expected first year savings to customers. These efficiencies will extend beyond the 5-year regulatory period and will help us mitigate the impact of future customer rate increases.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, which outlines our ongoing evaluation of whether to repair or retire the Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida. On October 1, we provided the Florida Public Service Commission with an independent engineering report commissioned by the Duke Energy Board of Directors in March 2012.
This report evaluated 3 things: first, the technical feasibility and risk of the current repair option;  two, the estimated costs to repair the unit; and finally, the timeline needed to repair the unit. Zapata Inc. is the engineering firm that produced the report. They found that although the current repair plan appears technically feasible, a number of risks and technical issues remain that need to be resolved, including the ultimate scope of any repair. We have formed a technical review team to analyze the issues raised in the independent report. The team will continue to refine and evaluate the risk, scope, cost estimates and schedule if the unit is repaired. Because of the ongoing review of the scope and cost, it is unlikely we will begin any repair before year end. Therefore, as outlined in the settlement agreement, we're subject to a total $100 million customer refund for replacement power cost in 2015 and '16. This liability was recognized in the third quarter with an offsetting increase to goodwill.
We continue to have conversations with NEIL, the nuclear insurance company, regarding the level of insurance coverage for the repairs. NEIL has not yet finalized its coverage decisions. We expect to hold nonbinding mediation discussions with NEIL later in the fourth quarter. If we do not reach a mediated settlement, the next step is binding arbitration.
The company has not made a final decision either to repair or to retire Crystal River 3. However, the regulatory settlement approved by the Florida Commission earlier this year provides a framework for either paths forward. We expect the decision could be made either by the end of this year or by summer 2013. We will proceed with repairing the unit only if there is a high degree of confidence that the repair can be completed within our estimated cost and schedule. Any final decision will be made in the best interest of our customers, joint owners and investors.
In Indiana, we are focused on bringing the Edwardsport plant online and receiving approval of the regulatory settlement for cost recovery. This has been a challenging project but an important one, not only for our company, but also for the state of Indiana. Edwardsport will use local Indiana coal in an environmentally responsible manner.
We are currently in the testing and startup phase and are about halfway through General Electric's new product introduction testing process. We have achieved important milestones: first, construction is complete; second, we have operated both the combustion and steam turbines on natural gas; third, in late October, we achieved syngas production from coal on one of the gasifiers and began testing the combustion turbines on syngas. Additional testing will continue over the next several months.
This testing and startup phase is identifying and correcting issues prior to startup. Issues discovered during the equipment testing and commissioning of the project have required an extension of the project timeline. The in-service date is now scheduled for mid-2013. Based on lower-than-projected revenues and additional costs resulting from the delayed in-service date, our updated cost estimate for the plant is $3.154 billion, excluding AFUDC of approximately $400 million. The estimated cost increase results in the recognition of a pretax charge of about $180 million in the third quarter of 2012. This charge has been treated as a special item and excluded from Duke Energy's adjusted diluted earnings per share.
As for the Edwardsport regulatory settlement, a hearing is wrapped up in July. We are optimistic the Indiana Commission will rule on this matter by year end.
Turning to Slide 9, let me update you on our other major new plants under construction. Cliffside Unit 6 is now undergoing an intensive testing and commissioning process. We expect Cliffside to become commercially available by the end of the year with the current approved budget. Our combined cycle natural gas projects in the Carolinas, Dan River, Lee and Sutton are all on budget and on schedule. Both Dan River and Lee are expected to be commercially available before year end.
Before moving on to our commercial businesses, let me briefly discuss our nuclear fleet. Our combined nuclear organization has enormous experience and depth of talent. Today, we operate a nuclear fleet of around 11,000 megawatts with all of our plants in the Carolinas, except one. During the third quarter, our operational performance for the combined nuclear fleet was strong. We performed at an approximate 98% capacity factor, excluding Crystal River 3. This exceptional performance gave our customers the benefit of efficient and reliable nuclear generation during the hot summer months when they need it most. We continue to push for improvement and overall consistency in fleet performance. Safety is always first. We also focus closely on reliability and efficiency metrics such as capacity factors and operating costs per megawatt hour. We are leveraging best practices and making additional investments in our nuclear fleet to optimize safety, reliability and efficiency.
I want to take a moment to provide a few updates on our Commercial Power and International Operations. In late August, Duke Energy Ohio filed a request with the Ohio Commission to establish a charge for its cost to providing capacity services in PJM, consistent with the new state compensation mechanism. This filing also included a request for deferral treatment of the differences between our cost base capacity charge and the PJM market prices from August 2012 through May 2015. This filing does not seek to alter the Electric Security Plan under which Duke Energy Ohio is currently operating. A procedural schedule has been established for the capacity filing. It currently includes a hearing date of April 2, 2013. We will the motion with the Ohio Commission requesting an expedited schedule. Our current focus is on obtaining approval of this cost base capacity compensation mechanism. Gaining necessary clarity on this capacity filing will inform any long-term strategic decisions related to this asset portfolio.
The renewable portion of our Commercial Power portfolio continues to grow. We project a total renewable capacity of around 2,000 megawatts in service by the end of this year. Earlier this year, we finalized a joint venture agreement with Sumitomo on 2 of our Kansas renewable wind projects, Cimarron II and Ironwood. Both are already in service.
As for our International business, it continues to perform very well. This business has provided reliable earnings over time. You may recall that Brazil represents half of the earnings from our International business. In September, the President of Brazil proposed a program to reduce electricity tariffs by an average of around 20%. This is tied to concessions scheduled to expire in 2015 and 2017. We anticipate this program will be finalized in early 2013. The program, if approved, is not expected to impact our Brazilian assets in the short term because our concession agreements expire in 2029 and 2033. Additionally, our assets are almost fully contracted through 2014 and around 60% committed in 2015 and 2016. We will continue to monitor this development and potential impact on market prices as we pursue additional contracting for our generation fleet.
In summary, we're off to a great start as a combined company. It shows in our financial performance, it shows in the savings we've delivered to our customers from day 1 and it shows in the way our employees have focused on performing their work. I appreciate and am thankful for their laser focus on excellence in all they do.
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn who will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance with the third quarter and going forward."
267850,222392111,381812,"Duke Energy Corporation, Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2012",2012-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Duke Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim. I will begin with an overview of Duke Energy's third quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends in economic conditions, as well as our financial objectives going forward.As summ",1309,"Thank you, Jim. I will begin with an overview of Duke Energy's third quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends in economic conditions, as well as our financial objectives going forward.
As summarized on Slide 11, for the third quarter of 2012, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47, slightly lower than the $1.50 for third quarter 2011. However, it's important to remember that our prior year results included $0.12 of favorable weather. Even though weather was favorable this year, it was not at the same level we experienced in 2011.
This quarter is also the first period that reflects Progress Energy's results in our financial statements. Also remember that last year's results have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-3 reverse stock split that occurred just prior to the merger closing.
On a reported basis, our earnings for the quarter were $0.85 per share as compared to $1.06 per share for the prior year quarter. These reported results for the third quarter 2012 include $0.17 of impairment charges related to the estimated cost increases at Edwardsport and merger-related costs of around $0.42. These charges are considered special items and, therefore, have been excluded from our quarterly adjusted EPS. The merger-related costs consists of employee severance costs, costs related to the interim and permanent FERC mitigation plan, concessions agreed to with the Carolinas commissions in order to receive merger approval and merger transaction costs.
Let me briefly discuss the primary adjusted earnings per share drivers for each of our business segments. Adjusted earnings at our regulated business, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, were $0.62 higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the addition of the former Progress Energy regulated utility operations in the Carolinas and Florida. Updated customer pricing, including the implementation of revised customer rates at Duke Energy Carolinas, also contributed to USFE&G's increase in quarterly results by $0.12 per share. These favorable drivers were partially offset by less favorable weather.
Duke Energy International's results for the quarter were $0.02 lower due primarily to unfavorable exchange rates in Brazil. As expected, Commercial Power's results were $0.06 lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to implementation of the new market-based Electric Security Plan in Ohio. Our nonregulated Midwest gas generating fleet realized the lower PJM capacity revenues as the market-based price fell from $110 per megawatt day in the prior year quarter to $16 per megawatt day in the current quarter. Due to continued low natural gas prices, this gas-fired fleet continued operating at record generating levels. Actual generation for the quarter was around 35% higher than the prior year quarter.
Other financial drivers for the quarter included dilution of $0.54 for the quarter-over-quarter impact on EPS resulting from the issuance of additional shares in connection with the merger and $0.05 of additional interest expense on Progress Energy holding company debt. As you will recall, we issued around 258 million shares to former holders of Progress Energy common stock and now have around 700 million shares of Duke Energy outstanding.
An important consideration as you evaluate our year-to-date EPS results is that the weighted average number of shares outstanding will increase from the current year-to-date average of 531 million to 575 million shares for full year 2012.
Slide 12 presents both our quarter-over-quarter weather-normalized customer usage trends as well as what we are experiencing on a rolling 12-month basis for our regulated business. This chart includes trends for the Progress Energy utilities compared to what they experienced last year. Trends for the third quarter show residential and industrial demand down from the prior year quarter. Since volume trends in any single quarter can be difficult to evaluate, we have also included 12-month rolling average volume trends as a point of comparison. Over the 12-month horizon, total weather-normalized load is slightly higher, with growth seen in all major customer classes.
For residential customers, we continue to experience growth in the number of customers in each of our service territories. In fact, the average number of residential customers has increased by around 50,000 or 0.7% over last year's quarter. This growth is around double what we experienced at this time last year. However, average usage for residential customer continues to trend modestly lower as a result of the challenging economy and energy efficiency efforts. Industrial demand reflects recent weakness in primary metals in the Midwest, the chemicals sector and textile customers in the Carolinas. The automotive sector remains strong.
We entered the year expecting overall load growth to be less than 1% over the prior year. Our actual experience to date has generally met expectations, although customer usage patterns continue to be hampered by the economic uncertainty. Despite improvements in national unemployment, home sales and retail sales, U.S. fiscal policy and the European situation leave us cautious about the strength of future growth. We believe our service territories are well positioned and remain attractive for the long term. However, we are planning our business for an environment of very modest load growth until we see greater economic stability.
As Bob highlighted during his opening comments, we will hold our analyst meeting in late February in New York. During that meeting, we will discuss our overall business strategy, our 2013 earnings guidance range, CapEx and financing assumptions. You will also have the opportunity to hear from our executive team on focus areas and their businesses. During this meeting, we will discuss our long-term earnings growth objectives for the new combined company. We continue to target a long-term earnings growth range of 4% to 6% in adjusted diluted earnings per share and have determined that 2013, the first full year for the combined company, represents an appropriate base for future growth.
Our long-term earnings growth potential remains strong and will continue to be anchored by investments in the regulated businesses; weather-normalized load growth; reaching reasonable regulatory outcomes, particularly in the Carolinas and in Ohio; achieving merger integration benefits and synergies; managing our costs, including emergent work related to our nuclear fleet and the addition of new resources; and continued contributions from our commercial businesses.
We have included on Slide 13 an overview of the primary earnings drivers we expect in each of these areas for 2013. Continued growth in the regulated businesses and our ability to harvest merger synergies will help us mitigate the decline in PJM capacity revenues impacting our nonregulated Midwest generation. Our detailed planning for 2013 and beyond continues, and we look forward to discussing our strategic plan in further detail during our analyst meeting in late February.
I will close with Slide 14 which addresses our main financial objectives. We remain on track to achieve our 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share, adjusted for the 1-for-3 reverse stock split. In addition to growth in our long-term earnings per share, continued growth in the dividend remained central to our investor value proposition. We are targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% based on adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our current dividend yield of 4.9% remains attractive compared to the S&P and the current low interest rate environment.
The strength of our balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics support our ability to grow the business as well as the dividend. We remain committed to maintaining this financial strength, which allows us to finance our growth in a cost-effective manner, directly benefiting our customers.
In summary, I'm pleased with our quarterly financial performance and how we hit the ground running as the new Duke Energy. We have a strong growth platform as efficiencies from the merger allow us to pass along savings to our customers and shareholders. From a financial perspective, we remain very well positioned for the future.
Now let me turn the call back over to Jim for closing comments."

I believe that if you look in all the states that we operate in, moving toward more of a formula rate approach, very similar to what they have in Alabama, for instance, and a formula rate approach is the right direction to go in over the next decade for a variety of reasons. One is, is to really deal with the modernization of T&D and continued modernization of our fleet to also address the issue of slow growth in demand. But more importantly, I think it gives us credibility with our customers if we have formula rates with respect to investing in their homes and businesses to help them have -- to reduce their usage.

It's our first call to report on a consolidated financial results of the new Duke Energy. As a combined company, we're off to a great start. The third quarter results reflect our efforts. We are plea",2406,"Thank you, Bob, and thank you all for joining us today. It's our first call to report on a consolidated financial results of the new Duke Energy. As a combined company, we're off to a great start. The third quarter results reflect our efforts. We are pleased with what were already accomplished the positive momentum we've created.
The work of our employees has been outstanding. As the 2 companies come together, we continue to focus on our mission for customers, and that is providing affordable, reliable and increasingly clean electricity on a 24/7 basis. We are focused and will continue to meet our merger commitments, achieving synergies and savings for both customers and investors.
Today, Duke Energy announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47 for the third quarter. This compares to prior year quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share. Once again, we exceeded Wall Street consensus estimates.
In the quarter, we continue to realize the benefits from our fleet modernization program despite less favorable weather and more results in our nonregulated commercial businesses. We are positioned to finish the year within our targeted adjusted diluted earnings guidance range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share.
Before going further, I'd like to say a word about Sandy. We were saddened by the loss of life and enormous damage caused by this storm. We were very fortunate that our service areas were spared the brunt of it. We have quickly deployed contractors and employees to assist other utilities with restoration. In total, we sent over 2,900 workers to help in 8 states from Virginia to Connecticut. I deeply appreciate the commitment and dedication of these workers, most of whom are still working to restore service in New York and New Jersey. It is an example of how our new scale and geographic scope have made our storm response capabilities even stronger.
Since merger closed, we've been focused on 5 key near-term priorities: first, resolving the North Carolina Utilities Commission's investigation into the post-merger change in leadership and achieving successful outcomes in our rate cases in the Carolinas; second, achieving merger savings and efficiencies and successfully integrating the new company into a stronger, more efficient organization; third, completing the work necessary to determine the way forward for the Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida; fourth, putting the Edwardsport IGCC plant into service and receiving approval of the associated regulatory settlement in Indiana; and fifth, our ongoing effort to optimize the performance of our nuclear generating fleet.
Over the next 9 to 12 months, we expect to resolve many of these priorities while making substantial progress on the others. For example, successful merger integration and optimizing nuclear performance will be ongoing priorities beyond this period.
A word on the status of the North Carolina Utilities Commission investigation. This investigation is ongoing, and we are maintaining open communications with the commission. We will continue to keep you informed on this ongoing matter.
Next, let me turn to Slide 5. We are nearing completion of our $9 billion fleet modernization program. This will position the company to comply with more stringent environmental rules, and it will increase the efficiency and fuel diversity of our generation sources. This program allows us to ultimately retire up to 6,800 megawatts of our older, less efficient coal-fired generation. In order to recover these important investments, we have rate cases planned in the Carolinas.
The first of these rate cases is the one Progress Energy Carolinas filed in North Carolina last month. This marks its first base rate inquiries request in North Carolina in 25 years. We have requested a net increase in annualized customer rates of $359 million. This is based upon an ROE of 11.25%, a 55.4% equity component of the cap structure and a retail rate base of about $6.9 billion for the estimated date of the hearings. Around 70% of the requested rate increase is due to capital investments. This includes the 600-megawatt combined cycle unit at the Smith Energy Complex, which went into service in June of 2011; it includes the 920-megawatt Lee Energy Complex scheduled for commercial operation by year end. The filing also includes the quip associated with the 625-megawatt Sutton combined cycle gas plant expected to be in service in late 2013. All of these plants were approved by the commission through its certification process.
The commission has established a procedural schedule, and evidentiary hearings will be held beginning on March 18, 2013. We expect revised rates to be in effect by mid-2013.
We are also finalizing our rate case filings for Duke Energy Carolinas. These petitions are expected to be the last in a series of 3 rate cases for Duke Energy Carolinas to recover capital investments made to modernize the generation fleet. This includes the 825-megawatt pulverized coal unit at Cliffside, the 620-megawatt combined cycle natural gas plant at Dan River and certain upgrades made at the Oconee nuclear station.
After discussions with the North Carolina Public Staff, we have shifted the filing of the cases for Duke Energy Carolinas until the first quarter of 2013. Our North Carolina filing will be made around 1 month before our South Carolina filing. In connection with this shift in timing, we will request approval to defer depreciation, O&M expense and the return on Cliffside and Dan River until new customer rates are in effect. The Public Staff will not oppose this deferral request.
Next, I'll provide an update on our progress with merger integration as outlined on Slide 6. I'm very pleased with how our 2 companies have come together. We are well on our way to achieving the benefits expected from this transaction. Over the last 4 months, we have essentially completed staffing the organization. As you all may recall, about 1,100 employees applied for our Voluntary Severance Program. More than half of this group are expected to leave by year end, with the rest leaving over the next 12 months or so. We remain on track to achieve the guaranteed $650 million in fuel and joint dispatch savings over the first 5 years. We are dispatching the generating fleets in the Carolinas as one combined fleet.
Joint dispatch, along with fuel savings, produce significant and immediate cost efficiencies that directly benefit our customers in the Carolinas. Effective September 1, we implemented a $70 million rate decrement in the Carolinas to begin passing on the expected first year savings to customers. These efficiencies will extend beyond the 5-year regulatory period and will help us mitigate the impact of future customer rate increases.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, which outlines our ongoing evaluation of whether to repair or retire the Crystal River 3 nuclear unit in Florida. On October 1, we provided the Florida Public Service Commission with an independent engineering report commissioned by the Duke Energy Board of Directors in March 2012.
This report evaluated 3 things: first, the technical feasibility and risk of the current repair option;  Two, the estimated costs to repair the unit; and finally, the timeline needed to repair the unit. Zapata Inc. is the engineering firm that produced the report. They found that although the current repair plan appears technically feasible, a number of risks and technical issues remain that need to be resolved, including the ultimate scope of any repair. We have formed a technical review team to analyze the issues raised in the independent report. The team will continue to refine and evaluate the risk, scope, cost estimates and schedule if the unit is repaired. Because of the ongoing review of the scope and cost, it is unlikely we will begin any repair before year end. Therefore, as outlined in the settlement agreement, we're subject to a total $100 million customer refund for replacement power cost in 2015 and '16. This liability was recognized in the third quarter with an offsetting increase to goodwill.
We continue to have conversations with NEIL, the nuclear insurance company, regarding the level of insurance coverage for the repairs. NEIL has not yet finalized its coverage decisions. We expect to hold nonbinding mediation discussions with NEIL later in the fourth quarter. If we do not reach a mediated settlement, the next step is binding arbitration.
The company has not made a final decision either to repair or to retire Crystal River 3. However, the regulatory settlement approved by the Florida Commission earlier this year provides a framework for either path forward. We expect the decision could be made either by the end of this year or by summer 2013. We will proceed with repairing the unit only if there is a high degree of confidence that the repair can be completed within our estimated cost and schedule. Any final decision will be made in the best interest of our customers, joint owners and investors.
In Indiana, we are focused on bringing the Edwardsport plant online and receiving approval of the regulatory settlement for cost recovery. This has been a challenging project but an important one, not only for our company, but also for the state of Indiana. Edwardsport will use local Indiana coal in an environmentally responsible manner.
We are currently in the testing and startup phase and are about halfway through General Electric's new product introduction testing process. We have achieved important milestones: first, construction is complete; second, we have operated both the combustion and steam turbines on natural gas; third, in late October, we achieved syngas production from coal on one of the gasifiers and began testing the combustion turbines on syngas. Additional testing will continue over the next several months.
This testing and startup phase is identifying and correcting issues prior to startup. Issues discovered during the equipment testing and commissioning of the project have required an extension of the project timeline. The in-service date is now scheduled for mid-2013. Based on lower-than-projected revenues and additional costs resulting from the delayed in-service date, our updated cost estimate for the plant is $3.154 billion, excluding AFUDC of approximately $400 million. The estimated cost increase results in the recognition of a pretax charge of about $180 million in the third quarter of 2012. This charge has been treated as a special item and excluded from Duke Energy's adjusted diluted earnings per share.
As for the Edwardsport regulatory settlement, a hearing is wrapped up in July. We are optimistic the Indiana Commission will rule on this matter by year end.
Turning to Slide 9, let me update you on our other major new plants under construction. Cliffside Unit 6 is now undergoing an intensive testing and commissioning process. We expect Cliffside to become commercially available by the end of the year with the current approved budget. Our combined cycle natural gas projects in the Carolinas, Dan River, Lee and Sutton are all on budget and on schedule. Both Dan River and Lee are expected to be commercially available before year end.
Before moving on to our commercial businesses, let me briefly discuss our nuclear fleet. Our combined nuclear organization has enormous experience and depth of talent. Today, we operate a nuclear fleet of around 11,000 megawatts with all of our plants in the Carolinas, except one. During the third quarter, our operational performance for the combined nuclear fleet was strong. We performed at an approximate 98% capacity factor, excluding Crystal River 3. This exceptional performance gave our customers the benefit of efficient and reliable nuclear generation during the hot summer months when they need it most. We continue to push for improvement and overall consistency in fleet performance. Safety is always first. We also focus closely on reliability and efficiency metrics such as capacity factors and operating costs per megawatt hour. We are leveraging best practices and making additional investments in our nuclear fleet to optimize safety, reliability and efficiency.
I want to take a moment to provide a few updates on our Commercial Power and International Operations. In late August, Duke Energy Ohio filed a request with the Ohio Commission to establish a charge for its cost to providing capacity services in PJM, consistent with the new state compensation mechanism. This filing also included a request for deferral treatment of the differences between our cost base capacity charge and the PJM market prices from August 2012 through May 2015. This filing does not seek to alter the Electric Security Plan under which Duke Energy Ohio is currently operating. A procedural schedule has been established for the capacity filing. It currently includes a hearing date of April 2, 2013. We have filed a motion with the Ohio Commission requesting an expedited schedule. Our current focus is on obtaining approval of this cost base capacity compensation mechanism. Gaining necessary clarity on this capacity filing will inform any long-term strategic decisions related to this asset portfolio.
The renewable portion of our Commercial Power portfolio continues to grow. We project a total renewable capacity of around 2,000 megawatts in service by the end of this year. Earlier this year, we finalized a joint venture agreement with Sumitomo on 2 of our Kansas renewable wind projects, Cimarron II and Ironwood. Both are already in service.
As for our International business, it continues to perform very well. This business has provided reliable earnings over time. You may recall that Brazil represents half of the earnings from our International business. In September, the President of Brazil proposed a program to reduce electricity tariffs by an average of around 20%. This is tied to concessions scheduled to expire in 2015 and 2017. We anticipate this program will be finalized in early 2013. The program, if approved, is not expected to impact our Brazilian assets in the short term because our concession agreements expire in 2029 and 2033. Additionally, our assets are almost fully contracted through 2014 and around 60% committed in 2015 and 2016. We will continue to monitor this development and potential impact on market prices as we pursue additional contracting for our generation fleet.
In summary, we're off to a great start as a combined company. It shows in our financial performance, it shows in the savings we've delivered to our customers from day 1 and it shows in the way our employees have focused on performing their work. I appreciate and am thankful for their laser focus on excellence in all they do.
Now I'll turn it over to Lynn who will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance with the third quarter and going forward."

I will begin with an overview of Duke Energy's third quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends in economic conditions, as well as our financial objectives going forward.As summ",1309,"Thank you, Jim. I will begin with an overview of Duke Energy's third quarter earnings results for each of its business segments, an update on retail customer volume trends in economic conditions, as well as our financial objectives going forward.
As summarized on Slide 11, for the third quarter of 2012, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47, slightly lower than the $1.50 for third quarter 2011. However, it's important to remember that our prior year results included $0.12 of favorable weather. Even though weather was favorable this year, it was not at the same level we experienced in 2011.
This quarter is also the first period that reflects Progress Energy's results in our financial statements. Also remember that last year's results have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-3 reverse stock split that occurred just prior to the merger closing.
On a reported basis, our earnings for the quarter were $0.85 per share as compared to $1.06 per share for the prior year quarter. These reported results for the third quarter 2012 include $0.17 of impairment charges related to the estimated cost increases at Edwardsport and merger-related costs of around $0.42. These charges are considered special items and, therefore, have been excluded from our quarterly adjusted EPS. The merger-related costs consists of employee severance costs, costs related to the interim and permanent FERC mitigation plan, concessions agreed to with the Carolinas commissions in order to receive merger approval and merger transaction costs.
Let me briefly discuss the primary adjusted earnings per share drivers for each of our business segments. Adjusted earnings at our regulated business, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas, were $0.62 higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the addition of the former Progress Energy regulated utility operations in the Carolinas and Florida. Updated customer pricing, including the implementation of revised customer rates at Duke Energy Carolinas, also contributed to USFE&G's increase in quarterly results by $0.12 per share. These favorable drivers were partially offset by less favorable weather.
Duke Energy International's results for the quarter were $0.02 lower due primarily to unfavorable exchange rates in Brazil. As expected, Commercial Power's results were $0.06 lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to implementation of the new market-based Electric Security Plan in Ohio. Our nonregulated Midwest gas generating fleet realized the lower PJM capacity revenues as the market-based price fell from $110 per megawatt day in the prior year quarter to $16 per megawatt day in the current quarter. Due to continued low natural gas prices, this gas-fired fleet continued operating at record generating levels. Actual generation for the quarter was around 35% higher than the prior year quarter.
Other financial drivers for the quarter included dilution of $0.54 for the quarter-over-quarter impact on EPS resulting from the issuance of additional shares in connection with the merger, and $0.05 of additional interest expense on Progress Energy holding company debt. As you will recall, we issued around 258 million shares to former holders of Progress Energy common stock and now have around 700 million shares of Duke Energy outstanding.
An important consideration as you evaluate our year-to-date EPS results is that the weighted average number of shares outstanding will increase from the current year-to-date average of 531 million to 575 million shares for full year 2012.
Slide 12 presents both our quarter-over-quarter weather-normalized customer usage trends as well as what we are experiencing on a rolling 12-month basis for our regulated business. This chart includes trends for the Progress Energy utilities compared to what they experienced last year. Trends for the third quarter show residential and industrial demand down from the prior year quarter. Since volume trends in any single quarter can be difficult to evaluate, we have also included 12-month rolling average volume trends as a point of comparison. Over the 12-month horizon, total weather-normalized load is slightly higher, with growth seen in all major customer classes.
For residential customers, we continue to experience growth in the number of customers in each of our service territories. In fact, the average number of residential customers has increased by around 50,000 or 0.7% over last year's quarter. This growth is around double what we experienced at this time last year. However, average usage for residential customer continues to trend modestly lower as a result of the challenging economy and energy efficiency efforts. Industrial demand reflects recent weakness in primary metals in the Midwest, the chemicals sector and textile customers in the Carolinas. The automotive sector remains strong.
We entered the year expecting overall load growth to be less than 1% over the prior year. Our actual experience to date has generally met expectations, although customer usage patterns continue to be hampered by the economic uncertainty. Despite improvements in national unemployment, home sales and retail sales, U.S. fiscal policy and the European situation leave us cautious about the strength of future growth. We believe our service territories are well positioned and remain attractive for the long term. However, we are planning our business for an environment of very modest load growth until we see greater economic stability.
As Bob highlighted during his opening comments, we will hold our analyst meeting in late February in New York. During that meeting, we will discuss our overall business strategy, our 2013 earnings guidance range, CapEx and financing assumptions. You will also have the opportunity to hear from our executive team on focus areas and their businesses. During this meeting, we will discuss our long-term earnings growth objectives for the new combined company. We continue to target a long-term earnings growth range of 4% to 6% in adjusted diluted earnings per share and have determined that 2013, the first full year for the combined company, represents an appropriate base for future growth.
Our long-term earnings growth potential remains strong and will continue to be anchored by investments in the regulated businesses; weather-normalized load growth; reaching reasonable regulatory outcomes, particularly in the Carolinas and in Ohio; achieving merger integration benefits and synergies; managing our costs, including emergent work related to our nuclear fleet and the addition of new resources; and continued contributions from our commercial businesses.
We have included on Slide 13 an overview of the primary earnings drivers we expect in each of these areas for 2013. Continued growth in the regulated businesses and our ability to harvest merger synergies will help us mitigate the decline in PJM capacity revenues impacting our nonregulated Midwest generation. Our detailed planning for 2013 and beyond continues, and we look forward to discussing our strategic plan in further detail during our analyst meeting in late February.
I will close with Slide 14 which addresses our main financial objectives. We remain on track to achieve our 2012 earnings guidance in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share, adjusted for the 1-for-3 reverse stock split. In addition to growth in our long-term earnings per share, continued growth in the dividend remained central to our investor value proposition. We are targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% based on adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our current dividend yield of 4.9% remains attractive compared to the S&P and the current low interest rate environment.
The strength of our balance sheet, liquidity and credit metrics support our ability to grow the business as well as the dividend. We remain committed to maintaining this financial strength, which allows us to finance our growth in a cost-effective manner, directly benefiting our customers.
In summary, I'm pleased with our quarterly financial performance and how we hit the ground running as the new Duke Energy. We have a strong growth platform as efficiencies from the merger allow us to pass along savings to our customers and shareholders. From a financial perspective, we remain very well positioned for the future.
Now let me turn the call back over to Jim for closing comments."
