Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. With me are COO, Tim Leyden; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. After my introductory remarks, Tim will provide an update on our operations, and Wolfgang will review our Q2 financial performance and current outlook. 
I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress in our mission to restore our manufacturing capacity in the aftermath of the historic flooding in Thailand. This is reflected in our Q2 financial performance announced earlier today, the continued ramp of our Thai HDD production capacity and the fact that we have now recommenced slider manufacturing, which had been suspended since October 10. 
While much work remains to be done over the next several quarters to reach our pre-flood manufacturing capabilities, the progress, thus far, is ahead of our original expectations and is attributable to the dedicated and effective actions of our employees, contractors and Thai government agencies, the efforts of our supply partners and the support of our customers. I want to thank all of those involved in this huge and extraordinary effort. 
We believe industry shipments in the December quarter were about 119 million units, which included approximately 11 million units of pre-flood inventory. Today, one quarter after the flood hit and despite the industry's recovery efforts, supply remains significantly constrained. We believe this condition will persist throughout calendar 2012, with gradually improvement during the year with industry production in the June quarter approaching pre-flood quarterly good levels. However, with the expected uptick in demand in the back half of the year, rollover demand from the current shortages and inventories throughout the supply chain at record lows from component supply through HDD and system manufacturing and distribution and retail channels, we believe the pipeline will not be refilled to normal levels until the first half of calendar 2013. We believe demand for storage for the long-term continues to grow unabated. With the HDD industries remarkable flood recovery effort and the gradual replenishment of the inventory pipeline, we believe rotating magnetic storage will render its recent challenges and remain the preferred and most cost-effective solution to meet the demand for storage in high volume mass-market applications. With no significant loss of share to competing technologies as we remain focused on innovating and creating compelling value for customers. 
From a WD standpoint, we expect our own recovery to  weather the trajectory of the industry that just outlined, with a returned to pre-flood capacity levels in the quarter ending September and with our customer's inventory pipeline replenished in the first half of calendar 2013. This pace of recovery is important as we focus on satisfying our customer's needs and as we respond to their strong encouragement to resume our leading role in the industry. To that end, our priorities are clear for calendar 2012: First, we will continue to focus on restoring our manufacturing and supply chain capacity to pre-flood levels; second, in concert with our supply partners, we are establishing the most robust and resilient supply chain of critical HDD components as we ramp our manufacturing capability backup; third, during the flood recovery period, we have maintained our focus and investment in development to ensure that we will be in a position to offer new products with advanced technology to sustain our leadership as we ramp our post-flood production. We plan to achieve these goals in the same time-tested focus on high-quality, low-cost and increased execution that has established WD as a trusted leader in the storage industry over the last dozen years. We believe that executing to this strategy and achieving the aforementioned priorities will prove to be a compelling value proposition for our customers as we complete for the future business. 
Before turn the call over to Tim Leyden for a review of our operations and recovery effort, I want to comment on 2 additional matters. Our plan to complete the acquisition of HGST and the pending litigation with Seagate. Our plan to complete the acquisition of HGST by March of this year is on track and we continue to work on obtaining the remaining approvals of the transaction from the respective government agencies. We remain very excited about the synergies of the acquisition and advantages it will create for our customers. 
On November 18, 2011, an arbitration award of $525 million was rendered against WD. Earlier today, the arbitrator awarded prejudgment interest in the amount of $105 million. WD will promptly file a petition to vacate the award on the grounds that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and failed to consider relevant evidence. We anticipate that the court will hear arguments on our petition in March or April of 2012, and issue a decision sometime thereafter. While we can't provide no assurance that we will be successful, we believe that if the court reviewing our petition correctly considers the law, the arbitration award should be vacated. Tim?"

In the aftermath of the Thailand flooding, our primary focus is to bring stability and predictability back to our operations by getting our disabled manufacturing locations and those of affected suppliers back in operation as quickly as poss",1066,"Thanks, John. In the aftermath of the Thailand flooding, our primary focus is to bring stability and predictability back to our operations by getting our disabled manufacturing locations and those of affected suppliers back in operation as quickly as possible. With this overall objective in mind, we moved quickly to limit the disruption to our customers. We optimized our HDD availability through increased throughput from our Malaysian factory, increased the availability of external HDAs with assistance from SAE/TDK. We engaged our previously idled employees to recover many of the inundated fixed assets. And once the flooding had receded, we'll restart the production in our dried-out factories on a limited basis. 
In addition to these operational initiatives, we took further action to remain profitable and minimize the impact on our working capital. Our team responded magnificently to these challenges, and I am pleased to report we have made substantial progress on the journey back to achieving full pre-flood capacity by the third calendar quarter of 2012. 
Our focus now is on accelerating our recovery and increasing availability to our customers. At this point in time, we are not constrained relative to HDD assembly or test. We are still constrained by components availability, specifically sliders. 
We are very pleased with the support we have been getting from SAE/TDK in providing both completed HDAs and processing WD's for our wafers. Additionally, we are grateful for the expeditious recovery efforts of our mechanical and other suppliers who themselves were affected by the Thailand flood. 
As of yesterday, we have completed our first batch of post-flood sliders in our Bang Pa-in facility, and we are working through qualification and expect to have a meaningful quantity of internally produced sliders shipping in our HDD products by the end of the current quarter. 
We are enhancing our infrastructure by extending slider production capacity and capability into Malaysia in order to mitigate risk. We expect to have Malaysian sliders shipping in our HDDs in the June quarter. 
The Bang Pa-in and Navanakorn Industrial Park landlords and the Thailand government are planning to reinforce and install Sud Barriers for these industrial zones, and we intend to augment those with company-specific initiatives. 
We are working with our suppliers to diversify their manufacturing locations in order to reduce geographic concentration. Supplier recovery is progressing well and we expect the suppliers will be substantially back to pre-flood run rate levels with the June quarter. 
We are maintaining the pace of product and technology development and though we have encountered challenges towards the flooding, we're focused on minimizing the impact. We are shipping 1 petabyte per platter 3.5-inch and 500 gigabytes per platter 2.5-inch drives in volume. 
In accordance with our normal practice, the rate of decline of those newer technologies is dependent on cost gross-over-points at each capacity point. Additionally, I am pleased to report that we have our 900 gigabytes 2.5-inch SAS product in quantification at multiple OEMs. 
As we emerge from the aftermath of the flooding, we are mindful of coming back with a more robust supply chain model that cease to dispersed in-house and supplier risks across geographies and factory locations. These dispersion of volumes across a wider geographic area will contribute to some structural and logistic cost increases, which should be recovered from customers in order to maintain the continuing investment required in one of the high technology and capital intensive business. And the anticipated benefit of our recovery activities is that we are taking advantage of the downtime to improve process efficiencies and cycle times. 
Supply in the HDD is constrained in an overall industry levels due to supply chain disruption. From WD's standpoint, we are allocating product to customers, segments and channels by attempting to maximize HDD availability through optimizing component utilization. We are taking current inventory positions into account as we respond to immediate customer needs, while at the same time, paying attention to the fundamentals of running a viable, profitable business, conserving cash and continuing to stay competitive technologically. 
As a result of balancing all these factors, you will note that broadly speaking, the percentages of volume to supply to market segments and channels is different to what might be perceived as our more normal supply profile. 
In general, channels with shorter inventory pipelines are getting higher and more immediate product allocations, while channels with longer inventory pipelines are expected to deplete available inventory before receiving further product allocation. This methodology was and is being deployed with the intent to maximize the availability of HDD products to the end customer within the shortest time horizon. As a result, we shipped $9.8 million notebook drives, 11.4 million desktops, 2.4 million CE, 3.2 million branded and 1.7 million enterprise units into the marketplace during the December quarter. 
I will now comment on expected industry supply demand conditions for the current quarter and the balance of calendar 2012. We expect demand to again significantly exceed supply during the March quarter and thrive to remain supply deficit that occurred during the December quarter. We estimate that supply in the March quarter will be back in the order, as component's availability improve and that there will be further depletion of inventory in each of the segments and channels, leading to better clarity around supply demand positions as the quarter unfolds. WD's HDD production will continue to be constrained by component availability. 
In contrast to the December quarter, our inventory buffers in all sectors of the supply chain somewhat mitigated the HDD shortage as evidenced by the PC OEM units being only modestly down from expected volumes. Most of that excess inventory has now being extracted and inventory levels are extremely low. These depleted inventory levels, coupled with and rolled over demand as a result of the December and March quarters supply deficits mentioned above. The additional prospects of the decreasing seasonal demand in the back half of the year and the value proposition from the emerging ultrabook and Windows 8 introductions will mean that the HDD supply will struggle to match demand through calendar year 2012. 
Consequently, we do not expect meaningful inventory replenishment until the first half of 2013. In WD's case, we are targeting throughput to approach 60%, 82% and 100% of pre-flood production volumes in the March, June and September quarters, respectively. 
I'll now turn the call over to Wolfgang for commentary on fiscal Q2 and our forecast for fiscal Q3 2012."
314057,145707602,209432,"Western Digital Corp., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jan 23, 2012",2012-01-23,"Earnings Calls","Western Digital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tim. As a reminder, the summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance last quarter, and then I will provide a range",1371,"Thank you, Tim. As a reminder, the summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance last quarter, and then I will provide a range of expected financial results for the March quarter. 
For the December quarter, revenue was $2 billion, down 19% from the prior year and 26% from the September quarter. We shipped a total of $28.5 million hard drives, as compared to 52.2 million and 57.8 million for the year ago and the September quarter, respectively. In excess of 3 million units that we shipped to customer during December quarter, were manufactured in the prior quarter. 
Average selling price was approximately $69 per unit, up $22 from the year ago quarter and up $23 from the September quarter. There were 2 customers, which is comprised 10% or more of our total revenue: Acer and Dell. OEM sales represent a 59% of revenue, up from 45% and the prior year and 53% in the September quarter. Distribution channel represented a 23% of revenue, down from 33% in the prior year and 29% in the September quarter. Retail sales as a percent of revenue was 16%, down from prior years of 22% in September of 18%. 
Revenue from sales of our branded products was $328 million, down 40% from the year ago quarter and 33% from the September quarter. As Tim mentioned earlier, we deliberately allocated production output of balancing immediate customer needs with prevailing inventory position. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.5%, up from 19.2% in the year ago quarter and 20.1% in the September quarter. The increase in gross margin is a result of higher ASP's, partially offset by higher cost per unit. 
On average, per unit costs were approximately $10 higher than in the September quarter due to low production volume, increased use of airfreight, a higher mix of externally procured test and higher cost for other component as a result of the flood impact on ourselves and our supply chain problem. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $287 million in the December quarter, as compared to $235 million and $282 million in the year ago and September quarter, respectively. SG&A included $11 million of acquisition-related expenses in the December quarter and a total of $18 million in acquisition and unrelated litigation accruals in the September quarter. Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $276 million, $235 million and $264 million in the December, year ago and September quarters, respectively. The increase in total R&D and SG&A is a due to higher spending on development and marketing of new products, particularly in the branded and enterprise area and higher incentive accruals. 
Expenses for the December quarter also included $199 million for charges and expenses related to the Thailand flood. These costs consist of $109 million of fixed asset impairments and $90 million for damaged inventory, recovery and remediation services and wage consideration. This does not include any offset of potential insurance recovery. 
The company, as we have previously stated, carries property and business interruption insurance. Discussions with our insurance carriers are moving forward, but the claim process is still in its early stages. 
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $2 million, including $3 million of commitment fees on the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's Drive business. 
Fixed expense for the December quarter was $15 million or 9.4% of pretax income. Our net income for the December quarter totaled $145 million or $0.61 per share as compared to $225 million or $0.96 per share for the year ago quarter and $239 million or $1.1 per share in the September quarter. The December quarter included $199 million for charges and expenses related to the Thailand flood and $14 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees, whereas the September quarter included a combined $21 million for acquisition-related expenses, bank commitment fees and unrelated litigation accruals. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the December quarter totaled $358 million or $1.51 per share. That's compared to $225 million or $0.96 per share in the year ago quarter and $260 million or $1.10 per share in the September quarter. 
As John indicated in his remarks regarding the arbitration award, we intend to promptly file a petition to vacate. We believe that if the Court correctly considers the law, the award should be vacated. As a result, we have not made an accrual for the award in the December quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the December quarter was a positive 5 days. This compares to the 34 days of receivables, 31 days of inventory of 12 turns and 60 days of payables. Once we realize the extent to which our production was impacted, as well as the impact to our key suppliers, we shortened payment terms with our customers and directed more cash to our strategic component and equipment supply partners in order to stabilize the supply chain and support the quick company. I would now that we did not accept prepayments from our customers and prepayments to suppliers were not material. We generated $378 million in cash from operations during the December quarter and our free cash flow totaled $258 million. 
Capital spending for the December quarter totaled $120 million. December quarter disbursements were for assets that were ordered prior to the flood. Depreciation and amortization expense for the December quarter totaled $140 million. 
Recovery capital received during the December quarter was not significant as the leadtime for such items is several months. March quarter capital spending will include a significant amount of replacement capital. The total amount of capital spending we will incur during calendar of 2012 to restore our capacity to pre-flood levels and increase the robustness of our supply chain is approximately $650 million. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2012 to be between $750 million and $800 million inclusive of a recovery capital. This was accomplished by reallocating much of our original operational capacity capital to recovery capital. 
Capital spending for technology-related assets continue as originally planned. We made a $31 million debt repayment during the December quarter, and thereby reduced our debt balance to $231 million. We exited fiscal Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.9 billion, an increase of $249 million from the September quarter. Approximately $3.2 billion of our ending cash balance was offshore. 
Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the March quarter. Despite the heroic efforts of our employees and suppliers resulting in the recommencement of operations in both the drive and slider factories, our March quarter output will be significantly constrained and we expect to ship between 31 million and 33 million drives. 
Total demand for the quarter is expected to significantly exceed industry supply capability. We expect that our pricing will continue to be significantly above pre-flood levels due to the supply constrained environment, underabsorption of our manufacturing assets and higher component costs. Average cost will not improve significantly quarter-over-quarter. While we have greater output, and therefore, less impact from fixed cost absorption, we do not have the benefit of mixing in pre-flood, lower-cost inventory. 
With respect to operating expenses, we will continue to invest in growth areas, such as our enterprise, SSDs and branded product businesses. Our March guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses or charges and expenses related to the flood. In relation to expenses related to our flood recovery efforts, we expect to incur about $50 million, consisting primarily of ongoing reclaim and recovery work and wage continuation for idled workers. 
With these sectors in mind, our March quarter guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.15 billion; R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $275 million, excluding acquisition and flood-related expenses; we expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our 6% to 9% business model; we anticipate our share count to be approximately $239 million; accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.15 and $1.45 for the March quarter, which excludes acquisition and flood-related expenses.

Additionally, in getting back the capacity wiped out by the floods, there's been significant incremental spending by ourselves and by our supply chain and by the industry supply chain in general. And so we expect that, that incremental investment will be reflected in the costs that are carried forward into the future. So we think that while there will be a gradual reduction of the pricing that's being driven by the imbalance between supply and demand in a stabilized situation where inventories have been rebuilt throughout the chain to normal levels, which we anticipate will be in the first half of 2013 calendar year, that when prices stabilize in that environment, we expect they will be at a higher level than pre-flood due to the incremental cost that I just outlined."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. With me are COO, Tim Leyden; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. After my introductory remarks, Tim will provide an update on our operations and Wolfgang will review our Q2 financial performance and current outlook.
I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress in our mission to restore our manufacturing capacity in the aftermath of the historic flooding in Thailand. This is reflected in our Q2 financial performance announced earlier today, the continued ramp of our Thai HDD production capacity and in the fact that we have now recommenced slider manufacturing, which had been suspended since October 10. 
While much work remains to be done over the next several quarters to reach our pre-flood manufacturing capabilities, the progress, thus far, is ahead of our original expectations and is attributable to the dedicated and effective actions of our employees, contractors and Thai government agencies, the efforts of our supply partners and the support of our customers. I want to thank all of those involved in this huge and extraordinary effort.
We believe industry shipments in the December quarter were about 119 million units, which included approximately 11 million units of pre-flood inventory. Today, one quarter after the floods hit and despite the industry's heroic recovery efforts, supply remains significantly constrained. We believe this condition will persist throughout calendar 2012 with gradual improvement during the year, with industry production in the June quarter approaching pre-flood quarterly build levels. 
However, with the expected uptick in demand in the back half of the year, rollover demand from the current shortages and inventories throughout the supply chain at record lows, from component supply through HDD and system manufacturing and distribution and retail channels, we believe the pipeline will not be refilled to normal levels until the first half of calendar 2013. 
We believe demand for storage for the long term continues to grow unabated. With the HDD industries remarkable flood recovery effort and the gradual replenishment of the inventory pipeline, we believe rotating magnetic storage will weather its recent challenges and remain the preferred and most cost-effective solution to meet the demand for storage in high volume mass-market applications, with no significant loss of share to competing technologies as we remain focused on innovating and creating compelling value for customers.
From a WD standpoint, we expect our own recovery to  mirror the trajectory of the industry that I just outlined, with a returned to pre-flood capacity levels in the quarter ending September and with our customers' inventory pipeline replenished in the first half of calendar 2013. 
This pace of recovery is important as we focus on satisfying our customers' needs and as we respond to their strong encouragement to resume our leading role in the industry. 
To that end, our priorities are clear for calendar 2012: First, we will continue to focus on restoring our manufacturing and supply-chain capacity to pre-flood levels; second, in concert with our supply partners, we are establishing the most robust and resilient supply chain of critical HDD components as we ramp our manufacturing capability back up; third, during the flood recovery period, we have maintained our focus and investment in development to ensure that we will be in a position to offer new products with advanced technology to sustain our leadership as we ramp our post-flood production. 
We plan to achieve these goals in the same time-tested focus on high-quality, low-cost and crisp execution that has established WD as a trusted leader in the storage industry over the last dozen years. We believe that executing to this strategy and achieving the aforementioned priorities will prove to be a compelling value proposition for our customers as we compete for their future business. 
Before turning the call over to Tim Leyden for a review of our operations and recovery effort, I want to comment on 2 additional matters: our plan to complete the acquisition of HGST and the pending litigation with Seagate. 
Our plan to complete the acquisition of HGST by March of this year is on track, and we continue to work on obtaining the remaining approvals of the transaction from the respective government agencies. We remain very excited about the synergies of the acquisition and the advantages it will create for our customers.
On November 18, 2011, an arbitration award of $525 million was rendered against WD. Earlier today, the arbitrator awarded prejudgment interest in the amount of $105 million. WD will promptly file a petition to vacate the award on the grounds that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and failed to consider relevant evidence. We anticipate that the court will hear our arguments on our petition in March or April of 2012, and issue a decision sometime thereafter. 
While we can't provide no assurance that we will be successful, we believe that if the court reviewing our petition correctly considers the law, the arbitration award should be vacated. Tim?"

In the aftermath of the Thailand flooding, our primary focus was to bring stability and predictability back to our operations by getting our disabled manufacturing locations and those of our affected suppliers back in operation as quickly as",1067,"Thanks, John. In the aftermath of the Thailand flooding, our primary focus was to bring stability and predictability back to our operations by getting our disabled manufacturing locations and those of our affected suppliers back in operation as quickly as possible. 
With this overall objective in mind, we moved quickly to limit the disruption to our customers. We optimized our HDD availability through increased throughput from our Malaysian factory, increased the availability of external HGAs with assistance from SAE/TDK. We engaged our previously idled island employees to recover many of the inundated fixed assets. And once the flooding had receded, we restarted production in our dried-out factories on a limited basis.
In addition to these operational initiatives, we took further action to remain profitable and minimize the impact on our working capital. Our team responded magnificently to these challenges, and I am pleased to report that we have made substantial progress on the journey back to achieving full pre-flood capacity by the third calendar quarter of 2012.
Our focus now is on accelerating our recovery and increasing availability to our customers. At this point in time, we are not constrained relative to HDD assembly or test. We are still constrained by components availability, specifically sliders.
We are very pleased with the support we have been getting from SAE/TDK in providing both completed HGAs and processing WD's raw wafers. Additionally, we are grateful for the expeditious recovery efforts of our mechanical and other suppliers, who themselves were affected by the Thailand floods.
As of yesterday, we have completed our first batch of post-flood sliders in our Bang Pa-in facility, and we are working through qualification and expect to have a meaningful quantity of internally produced sliders shipping in our HDD products by the end of the current quarter.
We are enhancing our infrastructure by extending slider production capacity and capability into Malaysia in order to mitigate risk. We expect to have Malaysian sliders shipping in our HDDs in the June quarter.
The Bang Pa-in and Navanakorn Industrial Park landlords and the Thailand government are planning to reinforce and install flood barriers for these industrial zones, and we intend to augment those with company-specific initiatives.
We are working with our suppliers to diversify their manufacturing locations in order to reduce geographic concentration. Supplier recovery is progressing well, and we expect that suppliers will be substantially back to pre-flood run rate levels by the June quarter.
We are maintaining the pace of product and technology development and though we have encountered challenges due to flooding, we are focused on minimizing the impact. We are currently shipping 1 terabyte per platter of 3.5-inch and 500 gigabytes per platter of 2.5-inch drives in volume. 
In accordance with our normal practice, the rate of deployment of those newer technologies is dependent on cost-crossover points at each capacity point. Additionally, I am pleased to report that we have our 900-gigabyte 2.5-inch SAS product in qualification at multiple OEMs.
As we emerge from the aftermath of the flooding, we are mindful of coming back with a more robust supply-chain model that seeks to disperse in-house and supplier risks across geographies and factory locations. 
This dispersion of volumes across a wider geographic area will contribute to some structural and logistical cost increases, which should be recovered from customers in order to maintain the continuing investment required in one of the high technology and capital intensive business.  And one anticipated benefit of our recovery activities is that we are taking advantage of the downtime to improve process efficiencies and cycle times.
Supply of HDD is constrained at an overall industry level due to supply-chain disruption. From WD's standpoint, we are allocating product to customers, segments and channels by attempting to maximize HDD availability through optimizing component utilization. We are taking current inventory positions where known into account as we respond to immediate customer needs, while at the same time, paying attention to the fundamentals of running a viable, profitable business, conserving cash and continuing to stay competitive technologically.
As a result of balancing all these factors, you will note that, broadly speaking, the percentages of volume supplies to market segments and channels is different to what might be perceived as our more normal supply profile.
In general, channels with shorter inventory pipelines are getting higher and more immediate product allocations, while channels with longer inventory pipelines are expected to deplete available inventory before receiving further product allocation. 
This methodology was and is being deployed with the intent to maximize the availability of HDD products to the end customer within the shortest time horizon.
As a result, we shipped 9.8 million netbook drives --notebook drives, 11.4 million desktops, 2.4 million CE, 3.2 million branded and 1.7 million enterprise units into the marketplace during the December quarter.
I will now comment on expected industry supply-demand conditions for the current quarter and the balance of calendar 2012. We expect demand to again significantly exceed supply during the March quarter and to add to the net supply deficit that occurred during the December quarter. We estimate that supply in the March quarter will be back-end loaded, as components' availability improve, and that there will be further depletion of inventory in each of the segments and channels, leading to better clarity around supply-demand positions as the quarter unfolds. WD's HDD production will continue to be constrained by component availability.
In contrast to the December quarter, where inventory buffers in all sectors of the supply chain, somewhat mitigated the HDD shortage as evidenced by the PC OEM units being only modestly down from expected volumes. Most of that excess inventory has now been extracted, and inventory levels are extremely low. 
These depleted inventory levels, coupled with any rolled over demand as a result of the December and March quarters supply deficits mentioned above, the additional prospects of the increasing seasonal demand in the back half of the year and the value proposition from the emerging ultrabook and Windows 8 introductions will mean that HDD supply will struggle to match demand through calendar year 2012.  Consequently, we do not expect meaningful inventory replenishment until the first half of 2013. 
In WD's case, we are targeting throughput to approach 60%, 80% and 100% of pre-flood production volumes in the March, June and September quarters, respectively.
I'll now turn the call over to Wolfgang for commentary on fiscal Q2 and our forecast for fiscal Q3 2012."

As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance the last quarter, and then I will provide a range of expected financial results for the March quarter.
For the December quarter, revenue was $2 billion, down 19% from the prior year and 26% from the September quarter. We shipped a total of 28.5 million hard drives as compared to 52.2 million and 57.8 million for the year ago and the September quarters, respectively. In excess of 3 million units that we shipped to customer during the December quarter were manufactured in the prior quarter.
Average selling price was approximately $69 per unit, up $22 from the year ago quarter and up $23 from the September quarter. There were 2 customers, which each comprised 10% or more of our total revenue: Acer and Dell. 
OEM sales represented 59% of revenue, up from 45% in the prior year and 53% in the September quarter. Distribution channel sales represented 25% of revenue, down from 33% in the prior year and 29% in the September quarter. Retail sales as a percent of revenue were 16%, down from prior year's 22% and September's 18%. 
Revenue from sales of our branded products was $328 million, down 40% from the year ago quarter and 33% from the September quarter. As Tim mentioned earlier, we deliberately allocated production output by balancing immediate customer needs with prevailing inventory positions.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.5%, up from 19.2% in the year ago quarter and 20.1% in the September quarter. The increase in gross margin is a result of higher ASPs, partially offset by higher cost per unit.
On average, per unit costs were approximately $10 higher than in the September quarter due to low production volume, increased use of airfreight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and a higher cost for other components as a result of the flood impact on ourselves and our supply-chain problems.
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $287 million in the December quarter as compared to $235 million and $282 million in the year ago and September quarters, respectively. 
SG&A included $11 million of acquisition-related expenses in the December quarter and a total of $18 million in acquisition and unrelated litigation accruals in the September quarter. 
Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $276 million, $235 million and $264 million in the December, year ago and September quarters, respectively. The increase in total R&D and SG&A is due to higher spending on development and marketing of new products, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas and higher incentive accruals.
Expenses for the December quarter also included $199 million for charges and expenses related to the Thailand floods. These costs consist of $109 million of fixed asset impairments and $90 million for damaged inventory, recovery and remediation services and wage continuation. This does not include any offset of potential insurance recovery.
The company, as we have previously stated, carries property and business interruption insurance. Discussions with our insurance carriers are moving forward, but the claim process is still in its early stages.
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $2 million, including $3 million of commitment fees on the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's drive business.  Net expense for the December quarter was $15 million or 9.4% of pretax income. 
Our net income for the December quarter totaled $145 million or $0.61 per share as compared to $225 million or $0.96 per share for the year ago quarter and $239 million or $1.01 per share in the September quarter. 
The December quarter included $199 million for charges and expenses related to the Thailand flood and $14 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees. Whereas the September quarter included the combined $21 million for acquisition-related expenses, bank commitment fees and unrelated litigation accruals. 
Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the December quarter totaled $358 million or $1.51 per share as compared to $225 million or $0.96 per share in the year ago quarter and $260 million or $1.10 per share in the September quarter.
As John indicated in his remarks regarding the arbitration award, we intend to promptly file a petition to vacate. We believe that if the court correctly considers the law the award should be vacated. As a result, we have not made an accrual for the award in the December quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the December quarter was a positive 5 days. This consisted of 34 days of receivables, 31 days of inventory or 12 turns and 60 days of payables. Once we realizes the extent to which our production was impacted, as well as the impact to our key suppliers, we shortened payment terms with our customers and directed more cash to our strategic component and equipment supply partners in order to stabilize the supply chain and support a quick recovery.  I would note that we did not accept prepayments from our customers, and prepayments to suppliers were not material. 
We generated $378 million in cash from operations during the December quarter and our free cash flow totaled $258 million. 
Capital spending for the December quarter totaled $120 million. December quarter disbursements were for assets that were ordered prior to the flood. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the December quarter totaled $140 million. 
Recovery capital received during the December quarter was not significant as the lead time for such items is several months.  March quarter capital spending will include a significant amount of replacement capital. The total amount of capital spending we will incur during calendar of 2012 to restore our capacity to pre-flood levels and increase the robustness of our supply chain is approximately $650 million. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2012 to be between $750 million and $800 million inclusive of recovery capital. This was accomplished by reallocating much of our original capacity capital to recovery capital.
Capital spending for technology-related assets continues as originally planned. We made a $31 million debt repayment during the December quarter and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $231 million. 
We exited fiscal Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.9 billion, an increase of $249 million from the September quarter. Approximately $3.2 billion of our ending cash balance was offshore.
Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the March quarter. Despite the heroic efforts of our employees and suppliers resulting in the recommencement of operations in both drive and slider factories, our March quarter output will be significantly constrained and we expect to ship between 31 million and 33 million drives.
Total demand for the quarter is expected to significantly exceed industry supply capability. We expect that our pricing will continue to be significantly above pre-flood levels due to the supply-constrained environment, under-absorption of our manufacturing assets and higher component cost. Average costs will not improve significantly quarter-over-quarter. While we have greater output and therefore less impact from fixed cost absorption, we do not have the benefit of mixing in pre-flood lower-cost inventory. 
With respect to operating expenses, we will continue to invest in growth areas, such as our enterprise, SSD and branded products businesses. 
Our March guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses or charges and expenses related to the flood. In relation to expenses related to our flood recovery efforts, we expect to incur about $50 million, consisting primarily of ongoing reclaim and recovery work and wage continuation for idled workers.
With these sectors in mind, our March quarter guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.15 billion; R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $275 million, excluding acquisition and flood-related expenses; we expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our 6% to 9% business model; we anticipate our share count to be approximately $239 million; accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.15 and $1.45 for the March quarter, which excludes acquisition and flood-related expenses.

Additionally, in getting back the capacity wiped out by the floods, there's been significant incremental spending by ourselves and by our supply chain and by the industry supply chain in general. And so we expect that, that incremental investment will be reflected in the costs that are carried forward into the future. So we think that while there will be a gradual reduction of the pricing that's being driven by the imbalance between supply and demand in a stabilized situation where inventories have been rebuilt throughout the chain to normal levels, which we anticipate will be in the first half of 2013 calendar year. That when prices stabilize in that environment, we expect they will be at a higher level than pre-flood due to the incremental costs that I just outlined."

The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call, excludes charges and expenses related to the Thailand flooding and our planned acquisition of HGST. Because these charges and expenses are not known to us at this time, we are unable to provide guidance or a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The impact of these excluded items may cause the estimated non-GAAP financial measures to differ materially from the comparable GAAP financial measures.
I would also like to mention that due to daily changes in the industry supply picture and continuing evaluation of our Thailand flood losses and litigation exposures, our financial results for the December quarter are preliminary until we file our Form 10-Q for the quarter with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In addition, we expect additional flood recovery expenses -- related expenses to be incurred in the March quarter, and it is possible that our fixed asset -- impairment estimates for the December quarter may have to be adjusted as the recovered assets are put into production.
Also as a reminder, until our acquisition of HGST closes, WD and HGST remain independent companies, but we will not be taking any questions about HGST's business or financial performance. 
[Operator Instructions] I also want to note that copies of remarks from today's call will be available on the Investors section of WD's website immediately following the conclusion of this call.
I would now turn the call over to President and CEO, John Coyne."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. With me are COO, Tim Leyden; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl. After my introductory remarks, Tim will provide an update on our operations and Wolfgang will review our Q2 financial performance and current outlook.
I'm pleased to report that we've made substantial progress in our mission to restore our manufacturing capacity in the aftermath of the historic flooding in Thailand. This is reflected in our Q2 financial performance announced earlier today, the continued ramp of our Thai HDD production capacity and in the fact that we have now recommenced slider manufacturing, which had been suspended since October 10. 
While much work remains to be done over the next several quarters to reach our pre-flood manufacturing capabilities, the progress, thus far, is ahead of our original expectations and is attributable to the dedicated and effective actions of our employees, contractors and Thai government agencies, the efforts of our supply partners and the support of our customers. I want to thank all of those involved in this huge and extraordinary effort.
We believe industry shipments in the December quarter were about 119 million units, which included approximately 11 million units of pre-flood inventory. Today, one quarter after the floods hit and despite the industry's heroic recovery efforts, supply remains significantly constrained. We believe this condition will persist throughout calendar 2012 with gradual improvement during the year, with industry production in the June quarter approaching pre-flood quarterly build levels. 
However, with the expected uptick in demand in the back half of the year, rollover demand from the current shortages and inventories throughout the supply chain at record lows, from component supply through HDD and system manufacturing and distribution and retail channels, we believe the pipeline will not be refilled to normal levels until the first half of calendar 2013. 
We believe demand for storage for the long term continues to grow unabated. With the HDD industries remarkable flood recovery effort and the gradual replenishment of the inventory pipeline, we believe rotating magnetic storage will weather its recent challenges and remain the preferred and most cost-effective solution to meet the demand for storage in high volume mass-market applications, with no significant loss of share to competing technologies as we remain focused on innovating and creating compelling value for customers.
From a WD standpoint, we expect our own recovery to  mirror the trajectory of the industry that I just outlined, with a return to pre-flood capacity levels in the quarter ending September and with our customers' inventory pipeline replenished in the first half of calendar 2013. 
This pace of recovery is important as we focus on satisfying our customers' needs and as we respond to their strong encouragement to resume our leading role in the industry. 
To that end, our priorities are clear for calendar 2012: First, we will continue to focus on restoring our manufacturing and supply-chain capacity to pre-flood levels; second, in concert with our supply partners, we are establishing the most robust and resilient supply chain of critical HDD components as we ramp our manufacturing capability back up; third, during the flood recovery period, we have maintained our focus and investment in development to ensure that we will be in a position to offer new products with advanced technology to sustain our leadership as we ramp our post-flood production. 
We plan to achieve these goals in the same time-tested focus on high-quality, low-cost and crisp execution that has established WD as a trusted leader in the storage industry over the last dozen years. We believe that executing to this strategy and achieving the aforementioned priorities will prove to be a compelling value proposition for our customers as we compete for their future business. 
Before turning the call over to Tim Leyden for a review of our operations and recovery effort, I want to comment on 2 additional matters: our plan to complete the acquisition of HGST and the pending litigation with Seagate. 
Our plan to complete the acquisition of HGST by March of this year is on track, and we continue to work on obtaining the remaining approvals of the transaction from the respective government agencies. We remain very excited about the synergies of the acquisition and the advantages it will create for our customers.
On November 18, 2011, an arbitration award of $525 million was rendered against WD. Earlier today, the arbitrator awarded prejudgment interest in the amount of $105 million. WD will promptly file a petition to vacate the award on the grounds that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and failed to consider relevant evidence. We anticipate that the court will hear our arguments on our petition in March or April of 2012, and issue a decision sometime thereafter. 
While we can provide no assurance that we will be successful, we believe that if the court reviewing our petition correctly considers the law, the arbitration award should be vacated. Tim?"

In the aftermath of the Thailand flooding, our primary focus was to bring stability and predictability back to our operations by getting our disabled manufacturing locations and those of our affected suppliers back in operation as quickly as",1068,"Thanks, John. In the aftermath of the Thailand flooding, our primary focus was to bring stability and predictability back to our operations by getting our disabled manufacturing locations and those of our affected suppliers back in operation as quickly as possible. 
With this overall objective in mind, we moved quickly to limit the disruption to our customers. We optimized our HDD availability through increased throughput from our Malaysian factory, increased the availability of external HGAs with assistance from SAE/TDK. We engaged our previously idled island employees to recover many of the inundated fixed assets. And once the flooding had receded, we restarted production in our dried-out factories on a limited basis.
In addition to these operational initiatives, we took further action to remain profitable and minimize the impact on our working capital. Our team responded magnificently to these challenges, and I am pleased to report that we have made substantial progress on the journey back to achieving full pre-flood capacity by the third calendar quarter of 2012.
Our focus now is on accelerating our recovery and increasing availability to our customers. At this point in time, we are not constrained relative to HDD assembly or test. We are still constrained by components availability, specifically sliders.
We are very pleased with the support we have been getting from SAE/TDK in providing both completed HGAs and processing WD's raw wafers. Additionally, we are grateful for the expeditious recovery efforts of our mechanical and other suppliers, who themselves were affected by the Thailand floods.
As of yesterday, we have completed our first batch of post-flood sliders in our Bang Pa-in facility, and we are working through qualification and expect to have a meaningful quantity of internally produced sliders shipping in our HDD products by the end of the current quarter.
We are enhancing our infrastructure by extending slider production capacity and capability into Malaysia in order to mitigate risk. We expect to have Malaysian sliders shipping in our HDDs in the June quarter.
The Bang Pa-in and Navanakorn Industrial Park landlords and the Thailand government are planning to reinforce and install flood barriers for these industrial zones, and we intend to augment those with company-specific initiatives.
We are working with our suppliers to diversify their manufacturing locations in order to reduce geographical concentration. Supplier recovery is progressing well, and we expect that suppliers will be substantially back to pre-flood run rate levels by the June quarter.
We are maintaining the pace of product and technology development and though we have encountered challenges due to flooding, we are focused on minimizing the impact. We are currently shipping 1 terabyte per platter of 3.5-inch and 500 gigabytes per platter of 2.5-inch drives in volume. 
In accordance with our normal practice, the rate of deployment of those newer technologies is dependent on cost-crossover points at each capacity point. Additionally, I am pleased to report that we have our 900-gigabyte 2.5-inch SAS product in qualification at multiple OEMs.
As we emerge from the aftermath of the flooding, we are mindful of coming back with a more robust supply-chain model that seeks to disperse in-house and supplier risks across geographies and factory locations. 
This dispersion of volumes across a wider geographical area will contribute to some structural and logistical cost increases, which should be recovered from customers in order to maintain the continuing investment required in one of the high technology and capital intensive business.  And one anticipated benefit of our recovery activities is that we are taking advantage of the downtime to improve process efficiencies and cycle times.
Supply of HDD is constrained at an overall industry level due to supply-chain disruption. From WD's standpoint, we are allocating product to customers, segments and channels by attempting to maximize HDD availability through optimizing component utilization. We are taking current inventory positions where known into account as we respond to immediate customer needs, while at the same time, paying attention to the fundamentals of running a viable, profitable business, conserving cash and continuing to stay competitive technologically.
As a result of balancing all these factors, you will note that, broadly speaking, the percentages of volume supplies to market segments and channels is different to what might be perceived as our more normal supply profile.
In general, channels with shorter inventory pipelines are getting higher and more immediate product allocations, while channels with longer inventory pipelines are expected to deplete available inventory before receiving further product allocation. 
This methodology was and is being deployed with the intent to maximize the availability of HDD products to the end customer within the shortest time horizon.
As a result, we shipped 9.8 million netbook drives --notebook drives, 11.4 million desktops, 2.4 million CE, 3.2 million branded and 1.7 million enterprise units into the marketplace during the December quarter.
I will now comment on expected industry supply-demand conditions for the current quarter and the balance of calendar 2012. We expect demand to again significantly exceed supply during the March quarter and to add to the net supply deficit that occurred during the December quarter. We estimate that supply in the March quarter will be back-end loaded, as components' availability improve, and that there will be further depletion of inventory in each of the segments and channels, leading to better clarity around supply-demand positions as the quarter unfolds. WD's HDD production will continue to be constrained by component availability.
In contrast to the December quarter, where inventory buffers in all sectors of the supply chain, somewhat mitigated the HDD shortage as evidenced by the PC OEM units being only modestly down from expected volumes. Most of that excess inventory has now been extracted, and inventory levels are extremely low. 
These depleted inventory levels, coupled with any rolled over demand as a result of the December and March quarters supply deficits mentioned above, the additional prospects of the increasing seasonal demand in the back half of the year and the value proposition from the emerging ultrabook and Windows 8 introductions will mean that the HDD supply will struggle to match demand through calendar year 2012.  Consequently, we do not expect meaningful inventory replenishment until the first half of 2013. 
In WD's case, we are targeting throughput to approach 60%, 80% and 100% of pre-flood production volumes in the March, June and September quarters, respectively.
I'll now turn the call over to Wolfgang for commentary on fiscal Q2 and our forecast for fiscal Q3 2012."

As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance the last quarter, and then I will provide a rang",1365,"Thank you, Tim. As a reminder, a summary of historical financial information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. In my remarks, I will first summarize our financial performance the last quarter, and then I will provide a range of expected financial results for the March quarter.
For the December quarter, revenue was $2 billion, down 19% from the prior year and 26% from the September quarter. We shipped a total of 28.5 million hard drives as compared to 52.2 million and 57.8 million for the year ago and the September quarters, respectively. In excess of 3 million units that we shipped to customers during the December quarter were manufactured in the prior quarter.
Average selling price was approximately $69 per unit, up $22 from the year ago quarter and up $23 from the September quarter. There were 2 customers, which each comprised 10% or more of our total revenue: Acer and Dell. 
OEM sales represented 59% of revenue, up from 45% in the prior year and 53% in the September quarter. Distribution channel sales represented 25% of revenue, down from 33% in the prior year and 29% in the September quarter. Retail sales as a percent of revenue were 16%, down from prior year's 22% and September's 18%. 
Revenue from sales of our branded products was $328 million, down 40% from the year ago quarter and 33% from the September quarter. As Tim mentioned earlier, we deliberately allocated production output by balancing immediate customer needs with prevailing inventory positions.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.5%, up from 19.2% in the year ago quarter and 20.1% in the September quarter. The increase in gross margin is a result of higher ASPs, partially offset by higher cost per unit.
On average, per unit costs were approximately $10 higher than in the September quarter due to low production volume, increased use of airfreight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and a higher cost for other components as a result of the flood impact on ourselves and our supply-chain partners.
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $287 million in the December quarter as compared to $235 million and $282 million in the year ago and September quarters, respectively. 
SG&A included $11 million of acquisition-related expenses in the December quarter and a total of $18 million in acquisition and unrelated litigation accruals in the September quarter. 
Excluding these items, R&D and SG&A would have totaled $276 million, $235 million and $264 million in the December, year ago and September quarters, respectively. The increase in total R&D and SG&A is due to higher spending on development and marketing of new products, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas and higher incentive accruals.
Expenses for the December quarter also included $199 million for charges and expenses related to the Thailand floods. These costs consist of $109 million of fixed asset impairments and $90 million for damaged inventory, recovery and remediation services and wage continuation. This does not include any offset of potential insurance recoveries.
The company, as we have previously stated, carries property and business interruption insurance. Discussions with our insurance carriers are moving forward, but the claim process is still in its early stages.
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $2 million, including $3 million of commitment fees on the credit facility related to the pending acquisition of Hitachi's drive business.  Net expense for the December quarter was $15 million or 9.4% of pretax income. 
Our net income for the December quarter totaled $145 million or $0.61 per share as compared to $225 million or $0.96 per share for the year ago quarter and $239 million or $1.01 per share in the September quarter. 
The December quarter included $199 million for charges and expenses related to the Thailand flood and $14 million for acquisition-related operating expenses and bank commitment fees. Whereas the September quarter included the combined $21 million for acquisition-related expenses, bank commitment fees and unrelated litigation accruals. 
Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the December quarter totaled $358 million or $1.51 per share as compared to $225 million or $0.96 per share in the year ago quarter and $260 million or $1.10 per share in the September quarter.
As John indicated in his remarks regarding the arbitration award, we intend to promptly file a petition to vacate. We believe that if the court correctly considers the law, the award should be vacated. As a result, we have not made an accrual for the award in the December quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash conversion cycle for the December quarter was a positive 5 days. This consisted of 34 days of receivables, 31 days of inventory or 12 turns and 60 days of payables. Once we realized the extent to which our production was impacted, as well as the impact to our key suppliers, we shortened payment terms with our customers and directed more cash to our strategic component and equipment supply partners in order to stabilize the supply chain and support a quick recovery.  I would note that we did not accept prepayments from our customers, and prepayments to suppliers were not material. 
We generated $378 million in cash from operations during the December quarter and our free cash flow totaled $258 million. 
Capital spending for the December quarter totaled $120 million. December quarter disbursements were for assets that were ordered prior to the flood. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the December quarter totaled $140 million. 
Recovery capital received during the December quarter was not significant as the lead time for such items is several months.  March quarter capital spending will include a significant amount of replacement capital. The total amount of capital spending we will incur during calendar of 2012 to restore our capacity to pre-flood levels and increase the robustness of our supply chain is approximately $650 million. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2012 to be between $750 million and $800 million inclusive of recovery capital. This was accomplished by reallocating much of our original capacity capital to recovery capital.
Capital spending for technology-related assets continues as originally planned. We made a $31 million debt repayment during the December quarter and thereby, reduced our debt balance to $231 million. 
We exited fiscal Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.9 billion, an increase of $249 million from the September quarter. Approximately $3.2 billion of our ending cash balance was offshore.
Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the March quarter. Despite the heroic efforts of our employees and suppliers resulting in the recommencement of operations in both drive and slider factories, our March quarter output will be significantly constrained and we expect to ship between 31 million and 33 million drives.
Total demand for the quarter is expected to significantly exceed industry supply capability. We expect that our pricing will continue to be significantly above pre-flood levels due to the supply-constrained environment, under-absorption of our manufacturing assets and higher component costs. Average costs will not improve significantly quarter-over-quarter. While we have greater output and therefore less impact from fixed cost absorption, we do not have the benefit of mixing in pre-flood lower-cost inventory. 
With respect to operating expenses, we will continue to invest in growth areas, such as our Enterprise, SSD and Branded Products businesses. 
Our March guidance does not include acquisition-related expenses or charges and expenses related to the flood. In relation to expenses related to our flood recovery efforts, we expect to incur about $50 million, consisting primarily of ongoing reclaim and recovery work and wage continuation for idled workers.
With these sectors in mind, our March quarter guidance is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.15 billion; R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $275 million, excluding acquisition and flood-related expenses; we expect our tax rate to be in the middle of our 6% to 9% business model; we anticipate our share count to be approximately 239 million; accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.15 and $1.45 for the March quarter, which excludes acquisition and flood-related expenses.

Add",170,"I think the fundamental difference in a post-flood recovered era versus pre-flood is that we will have created a more robust and more geographically dispersed supply chain, which will have some intrinsic cost increases relative to pre-flood footprint. Additionally, in getting back the capacity wiped out by the floods, there's been significant incremental spending by ourselves and by our supply chain and by the industry supply chain in general. And so we expect that, that incremental investment will be reflected in the costs that are carried forward into the future. So we think that while there will be a gradual reduction of the pricing that's being driven by the imbalance between supply and demand in a stabilized situation where inventories have been rebuilt throughout the chain to normal levels, which we anticipate will be in the first half of 2013 calendar year. That when prices stabilize in that environment, we expect they will be at a higher level than pre-flood due to the incremental costs that I just outlined."

After my introductory remarks, Wolfgang Nickl, our CFO, will review our Q3 financial performance and the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
We are delighted to report these exceptional financial results for the March quarter, demonstrating the potential of the new WD that just 3.5 weeks of HGST results added to the standalone WD business. 
Competing in the marketplace through our WD and HGST subsidiaries, we now have the product portfolio, technology resources and the people to focus on serving the needs of a significantly expanded customer base and to better address the tremendous growth opportunities in the storage industry in the years ahead. 
IDC expects the amount of digital storage capacity shipped across all digital storage media will more than double by 2015 from 767 exobytes in 2012. With the HDD storage responsible for roughly 70% of shipments over this time frame, driven by mobility, connectivity and the cloud. These dynamics create the need for an increasingly diverse set of products and technology capabilities from storage solutions providers. 
Rotating magnetic storage continues to be the dominant technology in this highest volume, high-capacity storage markets based on availability, scalability, usability and value. The recently updated IDC forecast calls for hard drive unit volume growth of 10% per year from 2011 to 2016, another indicator of the tremendous growth opportunity at hand for the new WD. 
When we announced the HGST acquisition in March 2011, we emphasized that this would be the hard drive industry's first ever transaction involving 2 profitable and growing companies. And that this was significant because the result and customer breadth and product breadth, depth of technology, people and scale. We're highly focused on what we believe is a tremendous revenue opportunity for the new WD based on the value proposition offered to our customers by each subsidiary. We aim to continue the strong track record of customer delight and superior financial performance of each subsidiary by delivering efficiencies consistent with regulatory requirements. 
It is noteworthy that during more than 12 months of regular reviews and 2 natural disasters, WD and HGST teams maintained full engagement with customers and continue to invest and execute to develop and deliver multiple innovative products. I call your attention to an impressive list of recent innovations outlined in the expanded quarterly investment summary report on our website. One example include the shipment of the industry's first 2 terabyte, 2.5-inch My Passport hard drives for mobile personal storage. The industry's first 1 terabyte 10,000 RPM, 2.5-inch WD VelociRaptor hard drive for high-performance workstations and extreme gaming platforms. The industry's first 4 terabytes, 7200 RPM, 3.5-inch drive for the capacity enterprise and cloud infrastructure markets, the industry's first SAS enterprise class SSD to use 25-nanometer single level cell nonclass technology, the 400 gigabyte ultra Star SSD. The industry's first 7,200 RPM, 2.5-inch, 7 millimeter, 500 gigabyte Travelstar mobile hard drive, expanding our lead in the low-profile drive market, where to date, we have shipped more than 25 million 7-millimeter hard drives for use in slim notebooks and ultrabooks. 
We also announced the formation of a consortium with SanDisk, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. who advanced digital distribution and consumer ownership of high-definition movies. 
With the HGST acquisition now closed, we are working closely with China's Ministry of Commerce to finalize our operations plan in compliance with the remedy outlined in MOFCOM's approval decision last month. Concurrently, Toshiba is awaiting the completion of the regulatory review process, associated with its agreement to acquire certain WD and HGST assets. The process that is expected to be completed within the next 90 days. In the meantime, we continue to support customer demand for the products covered by the anticipated Toshiba transaction. 
I'm also pleased to announce today that the recovery activities related to both WD operations and those of our supply chain partners impacted by the Thailand floods have reached the point where we now have the capability to adequately meet anticipated customer demands in the current quarter and beyond. Our subsidiaries are now focused on profitably serving customer needs in terms of mix and volume. 
We have navigated successfully through a series of significant events in the last year, including the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which had a substantial supply chain impact on both HGST and WD, and the floods in Thailand, which knocked out almost 90% of WD's slider availability and 60% of WD drive assembly capacity and a substantial portion of the industry supply chain. Concurrently, we completed the largest acquisition in the history of the hard drive industry. 
I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their strong support throughout this time and to congratulate and thank all of our employees who's dedicated efforts have delivered such outstanding results. 
As I look at the opportunities for Western Digital in the quarters and years ahead, I cannot think of a more exciting time to be leading this talented team. We have just delivered the strongest revenue and profit performance in the company's 42-year history, with the contribution of less than a month of HGST performance. 
We have a series of upside opportunities that have energized our teams against the backdrop of a industry TAM in the near term and the storage industries significant growth opportunity in the long term, we are focused on delighting our customers with an improving mix of competitive products, growing to full utilization of our installed capacity over time and continuing the measure deployment of our newer technologies. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Wolfgang for a review of our Q3 financials and our outlook."

It also included a detailed GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in this package. We'd also like to remind you that we have announced our Investor Day to be held on September 13, 2012 here in Orange County. On that day, we expect to discuss our strategy for our business, growth opportunities, our go-forward business model and our cash utilization strategy. 
Today, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the June quarter. The data all serves fiscal includes HGST's results from the acquisitions date of March 8 through the end of our quarter. 
Revenue for the March quarter was $3 billion, including $614 million for HGST. We shipped a total of $44.2 million hard drives in average selling price of approximately $68. 
OEM sales represented 64% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 28% and retail sales were 8%. The retail channel percentage was lower than prior quarters due to a total available market that is running at about 1/2 of last year's run rate and Hitachi lower presence in that channel. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes acquisition accounting-related adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, non-GAAP gross margin was 35.5%. Average cost per unit continues to run above pre-flood levels due to lower capacity utilization, increased use of airfreight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and higher cost for other components as a result of the flood's impact on our supply chain partners. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $420 million for the March quarter. SG&A include acquisition-related expenses of $33 million and $3 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. R&D and SG&A spending reflect continued investment in new product and market development, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas. 
Growth-related expenses totaled $36 million, which was offset by $21 million in insurance recoveries and other cost through reimbursement. In the quarter, we filed a significant clean for property damage, which is currently in the early stage of evaluation by our insurance carriers. We also expect to file business interruption and other claims. 
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $4 million, including $1 million of credit commitment fees prior to the acquisition. 
Tax expense for the March quarter was $55 million, 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $483 million, a $1.96 per share. And on a non-GAAP basis, net income was $619 million or $2.52 per share. 
Going to the balance sheet. We generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations during the March quarter. And our free cash flow totaled $1.1 billion, significantly enhanced by the timing of the acquisition. 
Capital spending and depreciation and amortized for the March quarter totaled $139 million and $188 million, respectively. 
For the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we spend $393 million on capital. We expect capital spending of approximately $357 million for the current quarter, bringing the total for fiscal year 2012 to approximately $750 million, inclusive of HGST capital spending for the June quarter. 
Capital expenditures for the June quarter will be driven by flood recovery, technology investments and investment in process capability as opposed to capacity expansion. As a reminder, we report capital spending based on cash disbursements. Thus, the capital disbursements expect for the June quarter primarily reflect capital that was received during the March quarter. 
Our conversion cycle was a positive 5 days. The DSO, DIO and DPO calculations, as well as inventory turns are skewed by the fact that our March ending balance sheet includes full HGST accounts observable inventory and account payables, while our revenue and cost of sales include only 3.5 weeks of HGST's operations. 
We exited fiscal Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion, is approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S. and $2.1 billion offshore. Subtracting our total debt of $2.7 billion, results in the net cash balance of $634 million. 
HGST's purchase price for accounting purposes was approximately $4.7 billion. While purchase price allocation included goodwill of approximately $1.7 billion since other intangibles are about $800 million. 
On a full quarter run rate basis, we expect the intangibles to drive amortization expense of approximately $50 million. These amounts are preliminary. Updated amounts will appear in the 10-Q we will file in early May. 
Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the June quarter. We expect the TAM for the June quarter in a range of 155 million to 160 million units. We believe there is sufficient capacity in the industry to support these demand. From a volume perspective, this model was previously announced divestiture of certain 3.5 adjusted to Toshiba to close towards the end of May. 
With regard to pricing, it's important to note that our WD subsidiary was the most heavily impacted of any drive company by the floods in Thailand last October. WD asked for and received customer's support to enable our rapid recovery. Now that these recoveries is essentially complete, WD is forecasting pricing reflective of current market conditions. 
After we close the acquisition, we learned that our HGST a subsidiary, which was not directly impacted by the floods, have implemented multi quarter agreements with certain customers, that provided for pricing a low March pricing subject to the achievement of certain volume growth. 
WD's subsidiary continues to operate with substantially substantial underutilize capacity and the supply mix of externally hedge in excess of the subsidiary's strategic sourcing model. Both sectors lead to a cost disadvantage of several dollars when compared to its pre-flood levels. 
While we are identifying OpEx energies, it is consistent with the regulatory requirements, we are not factoring any of these synergies into our guidance as we are currently working with China's MOFCOM to finalize the operations plan, which we submitted earlier this month. In addition, we are continuing investments in strategic growth areas such as SSB, hybrid drives and the digital home. 
From a gross margin perspective, we believe that product mix and cost will provide significant future upside potential for our businesses as they managed the deployment of new area of densities in a massive session. 
We also want to note that our guidance is in a non-GAAP basis. It excludes the amortization of intangibles related to the HGST acquisition of approximately $40 million in cost of sales and $10 million in OpEx. We also exclude any P&L impacts from the pending divestiture of 3.5 ingested to Toshiba and any potential restructuring activity. Our forecast does not include any acquisition of flood-related expenses and all that it's factoring any flood-related insurance proceeds during the quarter. 
As these factors in mind, our June quarter guidance including a full quarter of HGST is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $550 million. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 9% of our taxable income. We anticipate our share count to be approximately $269 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.35 and $2.55 for the June quarter. 
Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

I think in terms of mobile 2.5-inch drives for the PC industry, I think we're in reasonable balance.

And on the cost side, we currently have some cost matters our business that are result of the floods. Some those are industrywide and are being reflected on through into an overall step up in ASPs. But some of those are company specific, and the company specific ones will be addressed by a combination of addressing a growing TAM and they do that execute against opportunity, as well as we have in prior years, we should expect that we will grow with the TAM or ahead of the TAM. And that will address some of the under absorptions we have. We'll also help with the ratio of external hedge to internal hedge and improve the utilization of our head component business, and consequently, improve our cost structure there. So there's substantial opportunity there. Also, as a result of the floods, we -- in order to focus on supporting our customer's immediate requirements and utilizing our assets under our supply base effectively as possible, we delayed some deployment of our newer technology products, which, as we move up in our deployment of the newer technologies, as a proportion of our total shipments, again, we expect to see a substantially impact on our cost profile in that. So I'm very encouraged by when you look at the guidance and you look at our relative competitive position on margin, and then you see that we have substantial opportunity to improve our cost structure as we move forward for the balance of the year. I think you see that our comments in the supplementary information March 8 where we indicated that a profile of the business on a post-acquisition basis being very close in terms of participation in different market segments have been very close to our largest competitor that we expected that the metrics driving the business will be equally close.

It's not relevant in terms of how we utilize that capacity. We plan capacity utilization based on our read of market requirement. And whether that is as of we are at the current moment, planning in this quarter to run less than the installed capital base would allow in order to match the demand that we perceived to be available to us profitably. We've also demonstrated in history a very good capability to scale our business upward as demand appears and to do that in a very timely manner and a very efficient manner from our incremental output perspective. So I do anticipate we'll have some drag of overall invested capital, and hence, depreciation over the next several quarters as the TAM rebuilds and as we earn our share of that TAM.

I think when you think about the retail channel, we're -- the price of the product on the retail shelf is dominated by the cost of the hard drive within that package. Consequently, the increases in hard drive pricing immediately post-flood, there were 2 impacts on the retail channel: one, was availability. The second was the price increases on drives is immediately it affected in the full level of the increase to the consumer. If you look at all our other markets for hard drives, the hard drives that are incorporated in a larger system, where the hard drive is maybe 10%, 15%, at most 20% of the system value material. And consequently, the price increases in those markets had less chilling affect on purchasing behavior. So I think there's a 2 part element. The third element that affected the retail channel was that absent a clear visibility into supply, the retailers were reluctant to place ads and give prominence to the category because they were not sure that they could fulfill the demand that they would create by doing those promotional activities. So you take those 3 elements have contributed together. We believe that demand for personal ownership, availability, security of content and the value proposition of owning a terabyte of your own secure accessible data for less than $100 compared with renting that same capacity at 10x or 20x that cost over a reasonable expectation of lifetime of that data in the cloud. We believe the personal content ownership, both from a safety and security and keeping other people's eyes off it,  as well as the value proposition, offer a compelling value. And so we believe we're going to see the retail market rebound as the constraints I outlined go away. And in fact, we see the way that the cloud enables mobility and the way that it enables people to easily generate content on mobile devices and consume content on mobile devices, all plays into a significant increase in demand for personal storage for personal content and home-based personnel network attached storage or personal cloud storage and we're addressing both of those markets. Now just, of course, we're very strong players in the cloud market. In fact, the entire cloud would not exist were if not for the backbone technology of performance and capacity enterprise product. So either way, we win."

After my introductory remarks, Wolfgang Nickl, our CFO, will review our Q3 financial performance and the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
We are delighted to report these exceptional financial results for the March quarter, demonstrating the potential of the new WD with just 3.5 weeks of HGST results added to the standalone WD business. 
Competing in the marketplace through our WD and HGST subsidiaries, we now have the product portfolio, technology resources and the people to focus on serving the needs of a significantly expanded customer base and to better address the tremendous growth opportunities in the storage industry in the years ahead. 
IDC expects the amount of digital storage capacity shipped across all digital storage media will more than double by 2015 from 767 exabytes in 2012. With the HDD storage responsible for roughly 70% of exabyte shipments over this time frame, driven by mobility, connectivity and the cloud. These dynamics create the need for an increasingly diverse set of products and technology capabilities from storage solutions providers. 
Rotating magnetic storage continues to be the dominant technology in this highest volume, high-capacity storage markets based on availability, scalability, usability and value. The recently updated IDC forecast calls for hard drive unit volume growth of 10% per year from 2011 to 2016, another indicator of the tremendous growth opportunity at hand for the new WD. 
When we announced the HGST acquisition in March 2011, we emphasized that this would be the hard drive industry's first ever transaction involving 2 profitable and growing companies, and that this was significant because of the resultant customer breadth and product breadth, depth of technology, people and scale. We are highly focused on what we believe is a tremendous revenue opportunity for the new WD based on the value proposition offered to our customers by each subsidiary. We aim to continue the strong track record of customer delight and superior financial performance of each subsidiary by delivering efficiencies consistent with regulatory requirements. 
It is noteworthy that during more than 12 months of regulatory reviews and 2 natural disasters, WD and HGST teams maintained full engagement with customers and continue to invest and execute to develop and deliver multiple innovative products. I call your attention to an impressive list of recent innovations outlined in the expanded quarterly investment summary report on our website. 
Some examples include: The shipment of the industry's first 2-terabyte, 2.5-inch My Passport hard drives for mobile personal storage; the industry's first 1-terabyte 10,000 RPM, 2.5-inch WD VelociRaptor hard drive for high-performance workstations and extreme gaming platforms; the industry's first 4-terabyte, 7,200 RPM, 3.5-inch Ultrastar drive for the capacity enterprise and cloud infrastructure markets; the industry's first SAS enterprise class SSD to use 25-nanometer single-level cell NAND flash technology, the 400-gigabyte Ultrastar SSD; the industry's first 7,200 RPM, 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter, 500-gigabyte Travelstar mobile hard drive, extending our lead in the low-profile drive market, where to date, we have shipped more than 25 million 7-millimeter hard drives for use in slim notebooks and Ultrabooks. 
We also announced the formation of a consortium with SanDisk, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. to advance digital distribution and consumer ownership of high-definition movies. 
With the HGST acquisition now closed, we're working closely with China's Ministry of Commerce to finalize our operations plan in compliance with the remedy outlined in MOFCOM's approval decision last month. Concurrently, Toshiba is awaiting the completion of the regulatory review process, associated with its agreement to acquire certain WD and HGST assets, a process that is expected to be completed within the next 90 days. In the meantime, we continue to support customer demand for the products covered by the anticipated Toshiba transaction. 
I'm also pleased to announce today that the recovery activities related to both WD operations and those of our supply chain partners impacted by the Thailand floods have reached the point where we now have the capability to adequately meet anticipated customer demand in the current quarter and beyond. Our subsidiaries are now focused on profitably serving customer needs in terms of both mix and volume. 
We have navigated successfully through a series of significant events in the last year, including the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which had a substantial supply chain impact on both HGST and WD and the floods in Thailand, which knocked out almost 90% of WD's slider availability and 60% of WD drive assembly capacity and a substantial portion of the industry supply chain. Concurrently, we completed the largest acquisition in the history of the hard drive industry. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their strong support throughout this time and to congratulate and thank all of our employees whose dedicated efforts have delivered such outstanding results. 
As I look at the opportunities for Western Digital in the quarters and years ahead, I cannot think of a more exciting time to be leading this talented team. We have just delivered the strongest revenue and profit performance in the company's 42-year history, with the contribution of less than a month of HGST performance. 
We have a series of upside opportunities that have energized our teams against the backdrop of a recovering industry TAM in the near term and the storage industry's significant growth opportunity in the long term, we are focused on delighting our customers with an improving mix of compelling products, growing to full utilization of our installed capacity over time and continuing the measured deployment of our newer technologies. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Wolfgang for a review of our Q3 financials and our outlook."

We have also included a detailed GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in this package. 
We'd also like to remind you that we have announced our Investor Day to be held on September 13, 2012, here in Orange County. On that day, we expect to discuss our strategy for our core business, growth opportunities, our go-forward business model and our cash utilization strategy. 
Today, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the June quarter. The data of our third fiscal quarter includes HGST results from the acquisitions date of March 8 through the end of our quarter. 
Revenue for the March quarter was $3 billion, including $614 million for HGST. We shipped a total of 44.2 million hard drives at an average selling price of approximately $68. 
OEM sales represented 64% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 28% and retail sales were 8%. The retail channel percentage was lower than prior quarters due to a total available market that is running at about 1/2 of last year's run rate and Hitachi's lower presence in that channel. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes acquisition accounting-related adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, non-GAAP gross margin was 35.5%. Average cost per unit continues to run above pre-flood level due to lower capacity utilization, increased use of air freight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and higher costs for other components as a result of the flood's impact on our supply chain partners. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $420 million for the March quarter. SG&A included acquisition-related expenses of $33 million and $3 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. R&D and SG&A spending reflect continued investments in new product and market development, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas. 
Flood-related expenses totaled $36 million, which was offset by $21 million in insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements. During the quarter, we filed a significant claim for property damage, which is currently in the early stage of evaluation by our insurance carriers. We also expect to file business interruption and other claims. 
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $4 million, including $1 million of credit commitment fees prior to the acquisition. Tax expense for the March quarter was $55 million or .2% of pretax income. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $483 million, a $1.96 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $619 million or $2.52 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $1.1 billion, significantly enhanced by the timing of the acquisition. 
Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $139 million and $188 million, respectively. Through the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we have spent $393 million on capital. We expect capital spending of approximately $357 million for the current quarter, bringing the total for fiscal year 2012 to approximately $750 million, inclusive of HGST capital spending for the June quarter. 
Capital expenditures for the June quarter will be driven by flood recovery, technology investments and investments n process capability as opposed to capacity expansion. As a reminder, we report capital spending based on cash disbursements. Thus, the capital disbursements expected for the June quarter primarily reflect capital that was received during the March quarter. 
Our conversion cycle was a positive 5 days. The DSO, DIO and DPO calculations, as well as inventory turns are skewed by the fact that our March ending balance sheet includes full HGST accounts receivable, inventory and account payables, but our revenue and cost of sales include only 3.5 weeks of HGST's operations. 
We exited fiscal Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion, with approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S. and $2.1 billion offshore. Subtracting our total debt of $2.7 billion, results in a net cash balance of $634 million. 
HGST's purchase price for accounting purposes was approximately $4.7 billion. While purchase price allocation included goodwill of approximately $1.7 billion and other intangibles of about $800 million. On a full quarter run rate basis, we expect the intangibles to drive amortization expense of approximately $50 million. These amounts are preliminary. Updated amounts will appear in the 10-Q we will file in early May. 
Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the June quarter. We expect the TAM for the June quarter in a range of 155 million to 160 million units. We believe there is sufficient capacity in the industry to support this demand. From a volume perspective, we have modeled the previously announced divestiture of certain 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba to close towards the end of May. 
With regard to pricing, it's important to note that our WD subsidiary was the most heavily impacted of any drive company by the floods in Thailand last October. WD asked for and received customer support to enable a rapid recovery. Now that these recovery is essentially complete, WD is forecasting pricing reflective of current market conditions. 
After we close the acquisition, we learned that our HGST subsidiary, which was not directly impacted by the floods, had implemented multi-quarter agreements with certain customers that provided for June pricing below March pricing subject to the achievement of certain volume goals. 
WD's subsidiary continues to operate with substantially -- substantial underutilized capacity and at a supply mix of external heads in excess of the subsidiary's strategic sourcing model. Both sectors lead to a cost disadvantage of several dollars when compared to its pre-flood levels. 
While we are identifying OpEx synergies that are consistent with regulatory requirements, we are not factoring any of these synergies into our guidance, as we are currently working with China's MOFCOM to finalize the operations plan, which we submitted earlier this month. In addition, we are continuing investments in strategic growth areas such as SSD, hybrid drives and the digital home. 
From a gross margin perspective, we believe that product mix and cost will provide significant future upside potential for our businesses as they managed the deployment of new areal densities in a measured fashion. 
I also want to note that our guidance is in a non-GAAP basis. It excludes amortization of intangibles related to the HGST acquisition of approximately $40 million in cost of sales and $10 million in OpEx. We also excludes any P&L impact from the pending divestiture of 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba and any potential restructuring activities. Our forecast does not include any acquisition of flood-related expenses, nor does it factor in any flood-related insurance proceeds during the quarter. 
With these factors in mind, our June quarter guidance including a full quarter of HGST is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $550 million. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 9% of our taxable income. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 269 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.35 and $2.55 for the June quarter. 
Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

The difference from traditional situation is that the inventory instead of being in HDD industry, JIT hubs is in the OEM's own inventory, that are PC manufacturers and the ODMs. So as of today, I believe the majority of that business is being done on a direct ship from factory basis so that, that inventory shifted from HDD-owned to customer-owned.

And the ASPs are going to be what the market dictates they be. And on the cost side, we currently have some cost matters to our business that are a result of the floods. Some those are industry-wide and are being reflected on through into an overall step up in ASPs. But some of those are company-specific, and the company-specific ones will be addressed by a combination of addressing a growing TAM, and if we do that and execute against the opportunity, as well as we have in prior years, we should expect that we will grow with the TAM or ahead of the TAM. And that will address some of the under absorptions we have. We'll also help with the ratio of external hedge to internal hedge and then improve the utilization of our head component business, and consequently, improve our cost structure there. So we -- there's substantial opportunity there. Also, as a result of the floods, we, in order to focus on supporting our customer's immediate requirements and utilizing our assets under our supply base as effectively as possible, we delayed some deployment of our newer technology products, which, as we move up in our deployment of the newer technologies, as a proportion of our total shipments, again, we expect to see a substantial impact on our cost profile in that. So I'm very encouraged by when you look at the guidance and you look at our relative competitive position on margin, and then you'll see that we have substantial opportunity to improve our cost structure as we move forward for the balance of the year. I think you see that our comments in the supplementary information on March 8, where we indicated that a profile of the business, on a post-acquisition basis, being very close in terms of participation in different market segments, been very close to that of our largest competitor, that we expected that the metrics driving the business will be equally close. And so it will take us a few quarters to get there, but I'm highly confident that we have what it takes. And I think we've got a track record to demonstrate that our confidence is not misplaced."

You're also correct in looking at divestiture to Toshiba. Now over many, many years, I think we have demonstrated that the installed capacity is -- I mean, it's relevant in terms of the depreciation numbers. It's not relevant in terms of how we utilize that capacity. We plan capacity utilization based on our read of market requirement. And whether that is as of we are at the current moment, planning in this quarter to run less than the installed capital base would allow in order to match the demand that we perceived to be available to us profitably. We've also demonstrated in history a very good capability to scale our business upward as demand appears and to do that in a very timely manner and a very efficient manner from a dollar per incremental output perspective. So I do anticipate we'll have some drag of overall invested capital, and hence, depreciation over the next several quarters as the TAM rebuilds and as we earn our share of that TAM. And I think as we look at the longer term for the overall business, we will, in calendar '13 and beyond, be looking at deploying those previously demonstrated skills of adding judicious capacity to meet opportunity in a timely manner."

If you just take this quarter, for instance, at the midpoint of our guidance and 269 million shares, if you apply the gross margin and deduct the OpEx and then take the $350 million CapEx -- or $357 million CapEx, total amortization and depreciation excluding the intangibles that we just added somewhere to $280 million range.

I think it's -- when you think about the retail channel, where the price of the product on the retail shelf is dominated by the cost of the hard drive within that package. Consequently, the increases in hard drive pricing immediately post-flood, there were 2 impacts on the retail channel. One, was availability. The second was that the price increases on drives were immediately reflected in the full level of the increase to the consumer. If you look at all our other markets for hard drives, the hard drives incorporated in a larger system, where the hard drive is maybe 10%, 15%, at most 20% of the system value billing material. And consequently, the price increases in those markets had less chilling affect on purchasing behavior. So I think there's a 2-part element. The third element that affected the retail channel was that absent a clear visibility into supply, the retailers were reluctant to place ads and give prominence to the category because they were not sure that they could fulfill the demand that they would create by doing those promotional activities. So you take those 3 elements -- have contributed together. We believe the demand for personal ownership, availability, security of content and the value proposition of owning a terabyte of your own secure accessible data for less than $100 compared with renting that same capacity at 10x or 20x that cost over a reasonable expectation of lifetime of that data in the cloud, we believe the personal content ownership, both from a safety and security and keeping other people's eyes off it, as well as the value proposition, offer a compelling value. And so we believe we're going to see the retail market rebound as the constraints I outlined go away. And in fact, we see the way that the cloud enables mobility and the way that it enables people to easily generate content on mobile devices and consume content on mobile devices, all plays into a significant increase in demand for personally -- personal storage for personal content and home-based personnel network-attached storage or personal cloud storage, and we're addressing both of those markets. Now just to hedge our bets, of course, we're very strong players in the cloud market. In fact, the entire cloud would not exist, were if not for the backbone technology of performance and capacity enterprise product. So either way, we win."

After my introductory remarks, Wolfgang Nickl, our CFO, will review our Q3 financial performance and the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
We are delighted to report these exceptional financial results for the March quarter, demonstrating the potential of the new WD with just 3.5 weeks of HGST results added to the standalone WD business. 
Competing in the marketplace through our WD and HGST subsidiaries, we now have the product portfolio, technology resources and the people to focus on serving the needs of a significantly expanded customer base and to better address the tremendous growth opportunities in the storage industry in the years ahead. 
IDC expects the amount of digital storage capacity shipped across all digital storage media will more than double by 2015 from 767 exabytes in 2012. With the HDD storage responsible for roughly 70% of exabyte shipments over this time frame, driven by mobility, connectivity and the cloud. These dynamics create the need for an increasingly diverse set of products and technology capabilities from storage solutions providers. 
Rotating magnetic storage continues to be the dominant technology in this highest volume, high-capacity storage markets based on availability, scalability, usability and value. The recently updated IDC forecast calls for hard drive unit volume growth of 10% per year from 2011 to 2016, another indicator of the tremendous growth opportunity at hand for the new WD. 
When we announced the HGST acquisition in March 2011, we emphasized that this would be the hard drive industry's first ever transaction involving 2 profitable and growing companies, and that this was significant because of the resultant customer breadth and product breadth, depth of technology, people and scale. We are highly focused on what we believe is a tremendous revenue opportunity for the new WD based on the value proposition offered to our customers by each subsidiary. We aim to continue the strong track record of customer delight and superior financial performance of each subsidiary by delivering efficiencies consistent with regulatory requirements. 
It is noteworthy that during more than 12 months of regulatory reviews and 2 natural disasters, WD and HGST teams maintained full engagement with customers and continued to invest and execute to develop and deliver multiple innovative products. I call your attention to an impressive list of recent innovations outlined in the expanded quarterly investment summary report on our website. 
Some examples include: The shipment of the industry's first 2-terabyte, 2.5-inch My Passport hard drives for mobile personal storage; the industry's first 1-terabyte 10,000 RPM, 2.5-inch WD VelociRaptor hard drive for high-performance workstations and extreme gaming platforms; the industry's first 4-terabyte, 7,200 RPM, 3.5-inch Ultrastar drive for the capacity enterprise and cloud infrastructure markets; the industry's first SAS enterprise class SSD to use 25-nanometer single-level cell NAND flash technology, the 400-gigabyte Ultrastar SSD; the industry's first 7,200 RPM, 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter, 500-gigabyte Travelstar mobile hard drive, extending our lead in the low-profile drive market, where to date, we have shipped more than 25 million 7-millimeter hard drives for use in slim notebooks and Ultrabooks. 
We also announced the formation of a consortium with SanDisk, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. to advance digital distribution and consumer ownership of high-definition movies. 
With the HGST acquisition now closed, we're working closely with China's Ministry of Commerce to finalize our operations plan in compliance with the remedy outlined in MOFCOM's approval decision last month. Concurrently, Toshiba is awaiting the completion of the regulatory review process, associated with its agreement to acquire certain WD and HGST assets, a process that is expected to be completed within the next 90 days. In the meantime, we continue to support customer demand for the products covered by the anticipated Toshiba transaction. 
I'm also pleased to announce today that the recovery activities related to both WD operations and those of our supply chain partners impacted by the Thailand floods have reached the point where we now have the capability to adequately meet anticipated customer demand in the current quarter and beyond. Our subsidiaries are now focused on profitably serving customer needs in terms of both mix and volume. 
We have navigated successfully through a series of significant events in the last year, including the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which had a substantial supply chain impact on both HGST and WD and the floods in Thailand, which knocked out almost 90% of WD's slider availability and 60% of WD drive assembly capacity and a substantial portion of the industry supply chain. Concurrently, we completed the largest acquisition in the history of the hard drive industry. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their strong support throughout this time and to congratulate and thank all of our employees whose dedicated efforts have delivered such outstanding results. 
As I look at the opportunities for Western Digital in the quarters and years ahead, I cannot think of a more exciting time to be leading this talented team. We have just delivered the strongest revenue and profit performance in the company's 42-year history, with the contribution of less than a month of HGST performance. 
We have a series of upside opportunities that have energized our teams against the backdrop of a recovering industry TAM in the near term and the storage industry's significant growth opportunity in the long term, we are focused on delighting our customers with an improving mix of compelling products, growing to full utilization of our installed capacity over time and continuing the measured deployment of our newer technologies. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Wolfgang for a review of our Q3 financials and our outlook."

We have also included a detailed GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in this package. 
We'd also like to remind you that we have announced our Investor Day to be held on September 13, 2012, here in Orange County. On that day, we expect to discuss our strategy for our core business, growth opportunities, our go-forward business model and our cash utilization strategy. 
Today, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the June quarter. The data of our third fiscal quarter includes HGST results from the acquisitions date of March 8 through the end of our quarter. 
Revenue for the March quarter was $3 billion, including $614 million for HGST. We shipped a total of 44.2 million hard drives at an average selling price of approximately $68. 
OEM sales represented 64% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 28% and retail sales were 8%. The retail channel percentage was lower than prior quarters due to a total available market that is running at about 1/2 of last year's run rate and Hitachi's lower presence in that channel. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes acquisition accounting-related adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, non-GAAP gross margin was 35.5%. Average cost per unit continues to run above pre-flood level due to lower capacity utilization, increased use of air freight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and higher costs for other components as a result of the flood's impact on our supply chain partners. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $420 million for the March quarter. SG&A included acquisition-related expenses of $33 million and $3 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. R&D and SG&A spending reflect continued investments in new product and market development, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas. 
Flood-related expenses totaled $36 million, which was offset by $21 million in insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements. During the quarter, we filed a significant claim for property damage, which is currently in the early stage of evaluation by our insurance carriers. We also expect to file business interruption and other claims. 
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $4 million, including $1 million of credit commitment fees prior to the acquisition. Tax expense for the March quarter was $55 million or 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $483 million, a $1.96 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $619 million or $2.52 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $1.1 billion, significantly enhanced by the timing of the acquisition. 
Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $139 million and $188 million, respectively. Through the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we have spent $393 million on capital. We expect capital spending of approximately $357 million for the current quarter, bringing the total for fiscal year 2012 to approximately $750 million, inclusive of HGST capital spending for the June quarter. 
Capital expenditures for the June quarter will be driven by flood recovery, technology investments and investments n process capability as opposed to capacity expansion. As a reminder, we report capital spending based on cash disbursements. Thus, the capital disbursements expected for the June quarter primarily reflect capital that was received during the March quarter. 
Our conversion cycle was a positive 5 days. The DSO, DIO and DPO calculations, as well as inventory turns are skewed by the fact that our March ending balance sheet includes full HGST accounts receivable, inventory and account payables, but our revenue and cost of sales include only 3.5 weeks of HGST's operations. 
We exited fiscal Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion, with approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S. and $2.1 billion offshore. Subtracting our total debt of $2.7 billion, results in a net cash balance of $634 million. 
HGST's purchase price for accounting purposes was approximately $4.7 billion. While purchase price allocation included goodwill of approximately $1.7 billion and other intangibles of about $800 million. On a full quarter run rate basis, we expect the intangibles to drive amortization expense of approximately $50 million. These amounts are preliminary. Updated amounts will appear in the 10-Q we will file in early May. 
Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the June quarter. We expect the TAM for the June quarter in a range of 155 million to 160 million units. We believe there is sufficient capacity in the industry to support this demand. From a volume perspective, we have modeled the previously announced divestiture of certain 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba to close towards the end of May. 
With regard to pricing, it's important to note that our WD subsidiary was the most heavily impacted of any drive company by the floods in Thailand last October. WD asked for and received customer support to enable a rapid recovery. Now that this recovery is essentially complete, WD is forecasting pricing reflective of current market conditions. 
After we close the acquisition, we learned that our HGST subsidiary, which was not directly impacted by the floods, had implemented multi-quarter agreements with certain customers that provided for June pricing below March pricing subject to the achievement of certain volume goals. 
WD's subsidiary continues to operate with substantially -- substantial underutilized capacity and at a supply mix of external heads in excess of the subsidiary's strategic sourcing model. Both factors lead to a cost disadvantage of several dollars when compared to its pre-flood levels. 
While we are identifying OpEx synergies that are consistent with regulatory requirements, we are not factoring any of these synergies into our guidance, as we are currently working with China's MOFCOM to finalize the operations plan, which we submitted earlier this month. In addition, we are continuing investments in strategic growth areas such as SSD, hybrid drives and the digital home. 
From a gross margin perspective, we believe that product mix and cost will provide significant future upside potential for our businesses as they managed the deployment of new areal densities in a measured fashion. 
I also want to note that our guidance is in a non-GAAP basis. It excludes amortization of intangibles related to the HGST acquisition of approximately $40 million in cost of sales and $10 million in OpEx. We also excludes any P&L impact from the pending divestiture of 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba and any potential restructuring activities. Our forecast does not include any acquisition of flood-related expenses, nor does it factor in any flood-related insurance proceeds during the quarter. 
With these factors in mind, our June quarter guidance including a full quarter of HGST is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $550 million. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 9% of our taxable income. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 269 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.35 and $2.55 for the June quarter. 
Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

The difference from traditional situation is that the inventory instead of being in HDD industry, JIT hubs is in the OEM's own inventory, the PC manufacturers and the ODMs. So as of today, I believe the majority of that business is being done on a direct ship from factory basis so that, that inventory shifted from HDD-owned to customer-owned. And we think that, that business is in reasonable balance relative to supply and demand and traditional inventory levels. The desktop, we think is a little short, and we'll, from an OEM perspective, we'll take through this quarter to approach a balanced situation.

We're still, I think, about 4% on a year-over-year, the 160 number for the June quarter would be compared with 166 a year ago.

And that will translate into very substantially year-over-year increases obviously because of the flood impact in October."

So looked at in a medium to long-term perspective, we're very excited by the opportunities, and we see substantial opportunity for us to continue to improve performance as those cost drags on the business are eliminated by growth as we move forward."

I don't think we'll do much in the way of rebuilding inventories or recreating the traditional model of where those inventories are and the timing between cutting an order and delivering the product to where it's meant to be. We're using air freight almost exclusively today. The velocity through the distribution channel is very high, and I think as the momentum builds in distribution and the volumes get back to pre-flood levels and as momentum builds back in retail, back to -- towards to pre-flood levels, I think that's the first order of business is to fuel that growth and support it. And then the second order of business, which comes later in the year or possibly early next year, is to see the inventory and distribution models revert to a more normal level of inventory and velocity of that inventory."

And the ASPs are going to be what the market dictates they be. And on the cost side, we currently have some cost matters to our business that are a result of the floods. Some those are industry-wide and are being reflected on through into an overall step up in ASPs. But some of those are company-specific, and the company-specific ones will be addressed by a combination of addressing a growing TAM, and if we do that and execute against the opportunity, as well as we have in prior years, we should expect that we will grow with the TAM or ahead of the TAM. And that will address some of the under absorptions we have. We'll also help with the ratio of external heads to internal heads and then improve the utilization of our head component business, and consequently, improve our cost structure there. So we -- there's substantial opportunity there. Also, as a result of the floods, we, in order to focus on supporting our customer's immediate requirements and utilizing our assets and our supply base as effectively as possible, we delayed some deployment of our newer technology products, which, as we move up in our deployment of the newer technologies, as a proportion of our total shipments, again, we expect to see a substantial impact on our cost profile in that. So I'm very encouraged by when you look at the guidance and you look at our relative competitive position on margin, and then you'll see that we have substantial opportunity to improve our cost structure as we move forward for the balance of the year. I think you see that our comments in the supplementary information on March 8, where we indicated that a profile of the business, on a post-acquisition basis, being very close in terms of participation in different market segments, being very close to that of our largest competitor, that we expected that the metrics driving the business will be equally close. And so it will take us a few quarters to get there, but I'm highly confident that we have what it takes. And I think we've got a track record to demonstrate that our confidence is not misplaced."

You're also correct in looking at divestiture to Toshiba. Now over many, many years, I think we have demonstrated that the installed capacity is -- I mean, it's relevant in terms of the depreciation numbers. It's not relevant in terms of how we utilized that capacity. We plan capacity utilization based on our read of market requirement. And whether that is as of we are at the current moment, planning in this quarter to run less than the installed capital base would allow in order to match the demand that we perceive to be available to us profitably. We've also demonstrated in history a very good capability to scale our business upward as demand appears and to do that in a very timely manner and a very efficient manner from a dollar per incremental output perspective. So I do anticipate we'll have some drag of overall invested capital, and hence, depreciation over the next several quarters as the TAM rebuilds and as we earn our share of that TAM.

If you just take this quarter, for instance, at the midpoint of our guidance and 269 million shares, if you apply the gross margin and deduct the OpEx and then take the $350 million CapEx -- or $357 million CapEx, total amortization and depreciation excluding the intangibles that we just added somewhere to $280 million range.

I think it's -- when you think about the retail channel, where the price of the product on the retail shelf is dominated by the cost of the hard drive within that package. Consequently, the increases in hard drive pricing immediately post-flood, there were 2 impacts on the retail channel. One, was availability. The second was that the price increases on drives were immediately reflected in the full level of the increase to the consumer. If you look at all our other markets for hard drives, the hard drives incorporated in a larger system, where the hard drive is maybe 10%, 15%, at most 20% of the system value billing material. And consequently, the price increases in those markets had less chilling affect on purchasing behavior. So I think there's a 2-part element. The third element that affected the retail channel was that absent a clear visibility into supply, the retailers were reluctant to place ads and give prominence to the category because they were not sure that they could fulfill the demand that they would create by doing those promotional activities. So you take those 3 elements -- have contributed together. We believe the demand for personal ownership, availability, security of content and the value proposition of owning a terabyte of your own secure accessible data for less than $100 compared with renting that same capacity at 10x or 20x that cost over a reasonable expectation of lifetime of that data in the cloud, we believe the personal content ownership, both from a safety and security and keeping other people's eyes off it, as well as the value proposition, offer a compelling value. And so we believe we're going to see the retail market rebound as the constraints I outlined go away. And in fact, we see the way that the cloud enables mobility and the way that it enables people to easily generate content on mobile devices and consume content on mobile devices, all plays into a significant increase in demand for personally -- personal storage for personal content and home-based personnel network-attached storage or personal cloud storage, and we're addressing both of those markets. Now just to hedge our bets, of course, we're very strong players in the cloud market. In fact, the entire cloud would not exist, were if not for the backbone technology of performance and capacity enterprise product. So either way, we win."

After my introductory remarks, Wolfgang Nickl, our CFO, will review our Q3 financial performance and the outlook for the fourth quarter. 
We are delighted to report these exceptional financial results for the March quarter, demonstrating the potential of the new WD with just 3.5 weeks of HGST results added to the standalone WD business. 
Competing in the marketplace through our WD and HGST subsidiaries, we now have the product portfolio, technology resources and the people to focus on serving the needs of a significantly expanded customer base and to better address the tremendous growth opportunities in the storage industry in the years ahead. 
IDC expects the amount of digital storage capacity shipped across all digital storage media will more than double by 2015 from 767 exabytes in 2012. With the HDD storage responsible for roughly 70% of exabyte shipments over this time frame, driven by mobility, connectivity and the cloud. These dynamics create the need for an increasingly diverse set of products and technology capabilities from storage solutions providers. 
Rotating magnetic storage continues to be the dominant technology in this highest volume, high-capacity storage markets based on availability, scalability, usability and value. The recently updated IDC forecast calls for hard drive unit volume growth of 10% per year from 2011 to 2016, another indicator of the tremendous growth opportunity at hand for the new WD. 
When we announced the HGST acquisition in March 2011, we emphasized that this would be the hard drive industry's first ever transaction involving 2 profitable and growing companies, and that this was significant because of the resultant customer breadth and product breadth, depth of technology, people and scale. We are highly focused on what we believe is a tremendous revenue opportunity for the new WD based on the value proposition offered to our customers by each subsidiary. We aim to continue the strong track record of customer delight and superior financial performance of each subsidiary by delivering efficiencies consistent with regulatory requirements. 
It is noteworthy that during more than 12 months of regulatory reviews and 2 natural disasters, WD and HGST teams maintained full engagement with customers and continued to invest and execute to develop and deliver multiple innovative products. I call your attention to an impressive list of recent innovations outlined in the expanded quarterly investment summary report on our website. 
Some examples include: The shipment of the industry's first 2-terabyte, 2.5-inch My Passport hard drives for mobile personal storage; the industry's first 1-terabyte 10,000 RPM, 2.5-inch WD VelociRaptor hard drive for high-performance workstations and extreme gaming platforms; the industry's first 4-terabyte, 7,200 RPM, 3.5-inch Ultrastar drive for the capacity enterprise and cloud infrastructure markets; the industry's first SAS enterprise class SSD to use 25-nanometer single-level cell NAND flash technology, the 400-gigabyte Ultrastar SSD; the industry's first 7,200 RPM, 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter, 500-gigabyte Travelstar mobile hard drive, extending our lead in the low-profile drive market, where to date, we have shipped more than 25 million 7-millimeter hard drives for use in slim notebooks and Ultrabooks. 
We also announced the formation of a consortium with SanDisk, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. to advance digital distribution and consumer ownership of high-definition movies. 
With the HGST acquisition now closed, we're working closely with China's Ministry of Commerce to finalize our operations plan in compliance with the remedy outlined in MOFCOM's approval decision last month. Concurrently, Toshiba is awaiting the completion of the regulatory review process, associated with its agreement to acquire certain WD and HGST assets, a process that is expected to be completed within the next 90 days. In the meantime, we continue to support customer demand for the products covered by the anticipated Toshiba transaction. 
I'm also pleased to announce today that the recovery activities related to both WD operations and those of our supply chain partners impacted by the Thailand floods have reached the point where we now have the capability to adequately meet anticipated customer demand in the current quarter and beyond. Our subsidiaries are now focused on profitably serving customer needs in terms of both mix and volume. 
We have navigated successfully through a series of significant events in the last year, including the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which had a substantial supply chain impact on both HGST and WD and the floods in Thailand, which knocked out almost 90% of WD's slider availability and 60% of WD drive assembly capacity and a substantial portion of the industry supply chain. Concurrently, we completed the largest acquisition in the history of the hard drive industry. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their strong support throughout this time and to congratulate and thank all of our employees whose dedicated efforts have delivered such outstanding results. 
As I look at the opportunities for Western Digital in the quarters and years ahead, I cannot think of a more exciting time to be leading this talented team. We have just delivered the strongest revenue and profit performance in the company's 42-year history, with the contribution of less than a month of HGST performance. 
We have a series of upside opportunities that have energized our teams against the backdrop of a recovering industry TAM in the near term and the storage industry's significant growth opportunity in the long term, we are focused on delighting our customers with an improving mix of compelling products, growing to full utilization of our installed capacity over time and continuing the measured deployment of our newer technologies. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Wolfgang for a review of our Q3 financials and our outlook."

We have also included a detailed GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in this package. 
We'd also like to remind you that we have announced our Investor Day to be held on September 13, 2012, here in Orange County. On that day, we expect to discuss our strategy for our core business, growth opportunities, our go-forward business model and our cash utilization strategy. 
Today, I will first summarize our financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the June quarter. The data of our third fiscal quarter includes HGST results from the acquisitions date of March 8 through the end of our quarter. 
Revenue for the March quarter was $3 billion, including $614 million for HGST. We shipped a total of 44.2 million hard drives at an average selling price of approximately $68. 
OEM sales represented 64% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 28% and retail sales were 8%. The retail channel percentage was lower than prior quarters due to a total available market that is running at about 1/2 of last year's run rate and Hitachi's lower presence in that channel. 
Our gross margin for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes acquisition accounting-related adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, non-GAAP gross margin was 35.5%. Average cost per unit continues to run above pre-flood level due to lower capacity utilization, increased use of air freight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and higher costs for other components as a result of the flood's impact on our supply chain partners. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $420 million for the March quarter. SG&A included acquisition-related expenses of $33 million and $3 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. R&D and SG&A spending reflect continued investments in new product and market development, particularly in the branded and enterprise areas. 
Flood-related expenses totaled $36 million, which was offset by $21 million in insurance recoveries and other cost reimbursements. During the quarter, we filed a significant claim for property damage, which is currently in the early stage of evaluation by our insurance carriers. We also expect to file business interruption and other claims. 
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $4 million, including $1 million of credit commitment fees prior to the acquisition. Tax expense for the March quarter was $55 million or 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the March quarter totaled $483 million, a $1.96 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $619 million or $2.52 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations during the March quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $1.1 billion, significantly enhanced by the timing of the acquisition. 
Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $139 million and $188 million, respectively. Through the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we have spent $393 million on capital. We expect capital spending of approximately $357 million for the current quarter, bringing the total for fiscal year 2012 to approximately $750 million, inclusive of HGST capital spending for the June quarter. 
Capital expenditures for the June quarter will be driven by flood recovery, technology investments and investments n process capability as opposed to capacity expansion. As a reminder, we report capital spending based on cash disbursements. Thus, the capital disbursements expected for the June quarter primarily reflect capital that was received during the March quarter. 
Our conversion cycle was a positive 5 days. The DSO, DIO and DPO calculations, as well as inventory turns are skewed by the fact that our March ending balance sheet includes full HGST accounts receivable, inventory and account payables, but our revenue and cost of sales include only 3.5 weeks of HGST's operations. 
We exited fiscal Q3 with total cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion, with approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S. and $2.1 billion offshore. Subtracting our total debt of $2.7 billion, results in a net cash balance of $634 million. 
HGST's purchase price for accounting purposes was approximately $4.7 billion. While purchase price allocation included goodwill of approximately $1.7 billion and other intangibles of about $800 million. On a full quarter run rate basis, we expect the intangibles to drive amortization expense of approximately $50 million. These amounts are preliminary. Updated amounts will appear in the 10-Q we will file in early May. 
Let me now provide some context for our guidance for the June quarter. We expect the TAM for the June quarter in a range of 155 million to 160 million units. We believe there is sufficient capacity in the industry to support this demand. From a volume perspective, we have modeled the previously announced divestiture of certain 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba to close towards the end of May. 
With regard to pricing, it's important to note that our WD subsidiary was the most heavily impacted of any drive company by the floods in Thailand last October. WD asked for and received customer support to enable a rapid recovery. Now that this recovery is essentially complete, WD is forecasting pricing reflective of current market conditions. 
After we close the acquisition, we learned that our HGST subsidiary, which was not directly impacted by the floods, had implemented multi-quarter agreements with certain customers that provided for June pricing below March pricing subject to the achievement of certain volume goals. 
WD's subsidiary continues to operate with substantially -- substantial underutilized capacity and at a supply mix of external heads in excess of the subsidiary's strategic sourcing model. Both factors lead to a cost disadvantage of several dollars when compared to its pre-flood levels. 
While we are identifying OpEx synergies that are consistent with regulatory requirements, we are not factoring any of these synergies into our guidance, as we are currently working with China's MOFCOM to finalize the operations plan, which we submitted earlier this month. In addition, we are continuing investments in strategic growth areas such as SSD, hybrid drives and the digital home. 
From a gross margin perspective, we believe that product mix and cost will provide significant future upside potential for our businesses as they managed the deployment of new areal densities in a measured fashion. 
I also want to note that our guidance is in a non-GAAP basis. It excludes amortization of intangibles related to the HGST acquisition of approximately $40 million in cost of sales and $10 million in OpEx. We also excludes any P&L impact from the pending divestiture of 3.5-inch assets to Toshiba and any potential restructuring activities. Our forecast does not include any acquisition of flood-related expenses, nor does it factor in any flood-related insurance proceeds during the quarter. 
With these factors in mind, our June quarter guidance including a full quarter of HGST is as follows: We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. R&D and SG&A spending will be approximately $550 million. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 9% of our taxable income. We anticipate our share count to be approximately 269 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.35 and $2.55 for the June quarter. 
Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions."

The desktop, we think is a little short, and we'll, from an OEM perspective, we'll take through this quarter to approach a balanced situation.

We're still, I think, about 4% on a year-over-year, the 160 number for the June quarter would be compared with 166 a year ago.

And that will translate into very substantially year-over-year increases obviously because of the flood impact in October."

And from that directional guidance, you can imply that we believe that the gross margin is slightly higher than the June 19 to 24 that we said a year ago. And we also highlighted that the OpEx might be a little bit higher and well, you have to wait for the outcome of the operating plan, operations plan that we're concluding with MOFCOM to specify that. And again, the go-forward model will be communicated at the Investor Day on September 13."

I don't think we'll do much in the way of rebuilding inventories or recreating the traditional model of where those inventories are and the timing between cutting an order and delivering the product to where it's meant to be. We're using air freight almost exclusively today. The velocity through the distribution channel is very high, and I think as the momentum builds in distribution and the volumes get back to pre-flood levels and as momentum builds back in retail, back to -- towards to pre-flood levels, I think that's the first order of business is to fuel that growth and support it. And then the second order of business, which comes later in the year or possibly early next year, is to see the inventory and distribution models revert to a more normal level of inventory and velocity of that inventory."

And the ASPs are going to be what the market dictates they be. And on the cost side, we currently have some cost matters to our business that are a result of the floods. Some those are industry-wide and are being reflected on through into an overall step up in ASPs. But some of those are company-specific, and the company-specific ones will be addressed by a combination of addressing a growing TAM, and if we do that and execute against the opportunity, as well as we have in prior years, we should expect that we will grow with the TAM or ahead of the TAM. And that will address some of the under absorptions we have. We'll also help with the ratio of external heads to internal heads and then improve the utilization of our head component business, and consequently, improve our cost structure there. So we -- there's substantial opportunity there. Also, as a result of the floods, we, in order to focus on supporting our customer's immediate requirements and utilizing our assets and our supply base as effectively as possible, we delayed some deployment of our newer technology products, which, as we move up in our deployment of the newer technologies, as a proportion of our total shipments, again, we expect to see a substantial impact on our cost profile in that. So I'm very encouraged by when you look at the guidance and you look at our relative competitive position on margin, and then you'll see that we have substantial opportunity to improve our cost structure as we move forward for the balance of the year. I think you see that our comments in the supplementary information on March 8, where we indicated that a profile of the business, on a post-acquisition basis, being very close in terms of participation in different market segments, being very close to that of our largest competitor, that we expected that the metrics driving the business will be equally close. And so it will take us a few quarters to get there, but I'm highly confident that we have what it takes. And I think we've got a track record to demonstrate that our confidence is not misplaced."

Now over many, many years, I think we have demonstrated that the installed capacity is -- I mean, it's relevant in terms of the depreciation numbers. It's not relevant in terms of how we utilized that capacity. We plan capacity utilization based on our read of market requirement. And whether that is as of we are at the current moment, planning in this quarter to run less than the installed capital base would allow in order to match the demand that we perceive to be available to us profitably. We've also demonstrated in history a very good capability to scale our business upward as demand appears and to do that in a very timely manner and a very efficient manner from a dollar per incremental output perspective. So I do anticipate we'll have some drag of overall invested capital, and hence, depreciation over the next several quarters as the TAM rebuilds and as we earn our share of that TAM.

I think it's -- when you think about the retail channel, where the price of the product on the retail shelf is dominated by the cost of the hard drive within that package. Consequently, the increases in hard drive pricing immediately post-flood, there were 2 impacts on the retail channel. One, was availability. The second was that the price increases on drives were immediately reflected in the full level of the increase to the consumer. If you look at all our other markets for hard drives, the hard drives incorporated in a larger system, where the hard drive is maybe 10%, 15%, at most 20% of the system value billing material. And consequently, the price increases in those markets had less chilling effect on purchasing behavior. So I think there's a 2-part element. The third element that affected the retail channel was that absent a clear visibility into supply, the retailers were reluctant to place ads and give prominence to the category because they were not sure that they could fulfill the demand that they would create by doing those promotional activities. So you take those 3 elements -- have contributed together. We believe the demand for personal ownership, availability, security of content and the value proposition of owning a terabyte of your own secure accessible data for less than $100 compared with renting that same capacity at 10x or 20x that cost over a reasonable expectation of lifetime of that data in the cloud, we believe the personal content ownership, both from a safety and security and keeping other people's eyes off it, as well as the value proposition, offer a compelling value. And so we believe we're going to see the retail market rebound as the constraints I outlined go away. And in fact, we see the way that the cloud enables mobility and the way that it enables people to easily generate content on mobile devices and consume content on mobile devices, all plays into a significant increase in demand for personally -- personal storage for personal content and home-based personnel network-attached storage or personal cloud storage, and we're addressing both of those markets. Now just to hedge our bets, of course, we're very strong players in the cloud market. In fact, the entire cloud would not exist, were if not for the backbone technology of performance and capacity enterprise product. So either way, we win."

With me are President, Steve Milligan; and Chief Financial Officer, Wolfgang Nickl. 
To begin, I want to thank all our employees for their extraordinary achievements in one of the most challenging and exciting years in our 42-year history. While responding to 2 major natural disasters and completing the largest acquisition in the history of the industry, we achieved revenue growth of over 31% and more than doubled earnings. 
Turning to the market. June quarter demand was in line with our forecast of late April. Industry shipments reached 157 million units, bringing total hard drive shipments for the year to 599 million units. Our WD and HGST teams both performed ahead of plan in Q4, with consistent execution, delighting customers with compelling and high-quality products and flexible service. As a result, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and cash flows.
In formulating our outlook for fiscal 2013, which we will share with you today, we considered many factors. We took into account several broad trends such as the soft macroeconomic environment, the growing use of tablets and smartphones and the modest expectation for the initial acceptance of Windows 8 and Ultrabooks. Consequently, our planning assumption for unit growth and hard-drive demand is a 5%.
We considered several Western Digital specific factors: First, due to the regulatory requirements to operate WD and HGST as separate subsidiaries for at least 2 years, we do not expect any significant OpEx synergies in that timeframe; second, our experience since completing the HGST acquisition has demonstrated customers continued appreciation of the respective strengths of our WD and HGST subsidiaries; third, following 4 months of experience, we have confirmed the robustness and predictability of the HGST's business operations, processes and controls; fourth, each subsidiary has multiple opportunities to further improve its cost structure by ramping newer area of density platforms throughout the fiscal year and by making continued progress on cost optimization and recovery from flood-related cost issues.
Taking all these into account, we believe that Western Digital can deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $10 in fiscal '13. 
Storage continues to be at the center of the evolving digital universe in entertainment, education, commerce and communication. WD and HGST continue to focus on serving this market with a broad and expanding portfolio of products. We believe a strategy of delighting customers, focusing investments and faster growing market segments and driving strong execution in both internal operations and our supply chain will continue to deliver consistent and superior financial performance.
Steve Milligan will now cover the operational highlights of our Q4 performance. Steve?"

When we announced the acquisition of HGST in March 2011, we emphasized the potential for strong financial returns. We believe the consolidated June quarter financial results provide a compelling early proof point. Both WD and HGST have heritage of developing strategic and collaborative customer relationships, underpinned by innovative products, great technology and consistent execution. We are very pleased with the momentum we have maintained in the marketplace as we continue to focus on helping our customers succeed by developing and delivering great products across all segments of our business.
We delivered strong financial performance in the June quarter, with consolidated revenue of $4.8  billion. Crisp execution and healthy profitability generated strong cash flows. Our subsidiaries also independently managed their billed plans with the prevailing demand environment. We shipped a total of 71 million units or 48 million petabytes of storage into the market in the June quarter. The segment mix of the consolidated results for the 2 subsidiaries demonstrates a very healthy balance. In total, Western Digital shipped 7.9 million hard drives into the enterprise market, 54 million hard drives into the client space, including notebook and desktop, 4.2 million hard drives into the consumer electronics segment, including DVR, gaming and automotive applications and 5 million hard drives for branded products. We also shipped 1 million non-HDD units, including solid state drives, media players and routers. 
It is worth noting that our advocate shipments in nearly 8 million hard drives to enterprise customers demonstrate continued momentum by both HGST and WD in this highly strategic space. As expected, WD's industry-leading branded products business rebounded in the June quarter from its post flood downturn with exciting new products. 
On the operations fronts, WD began production in its slider fabrication facility in Malaysia, and those subsidiaries improved efficiencies and reduced cost from flood-induced levels.
It is also important to note that both WD and HGST continue to invest in new product development. During the fourth quarter, several innovations were delivered to customers, including some important new market entries.  Specifically, the WD brand of products group advanced its connected home strategy with entry into the wireless, home, networking business, launching its family of My Net routers. It also added new software and services, including the WD to go personal cloud mobile app with Dropbox integration. 
On the component side, WD introduced its WD read series, the industry's first hard drive, specifically designed for home and small office mass systems. To request demand for thin and light devices, HGST continued to leverage its first mover advantage with its 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter drives. More than 46 million of this particular drives have shipped since product inception.
Continuing its leadership position in enterprise storage, HGST demonstrated its industry's first 12 gigabit per second, fast solid state drive. In the departure from Western Digital's long standing tradition of announcing new products only as they ship, we plan to providing a preview of some exciting innovations at our Investor Day on September 13th. I look forward to seeing many of you at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to Wolfgang for his financial reports."

I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the September quarter.
The revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion. We shipped a total of 71 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $65. Both unit volume and average selling price exceeded the expectations that were implied in our guidance. OEM sales represented 69% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 21% and retail sales were 10%.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 31%. This includes $39 million of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Excluding this, non-GAAP gross margin was 31.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin came in better than the implied gross margin in our guidance due to lower-than-expected price declines and better-than-expected shipment linearity. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $584 million for the June quarter. SG&A included $12 million of amortization expense related to intangible recorded through the purchase price allocation. Incremental OpEx was in our guidance reflects higher attainment on our variable compensation program.
In order to better align our production with anticipated market demand, we took certain resizing actions that resulted in $80 million of restructuring charges in the June quarter, consisting of $72 million related to fixed assets and $8 million for severance. 
Net and other non-operating expense was $7 million. This includes $4 million of gains and investments.
Tax expense for the June quarter was $56 million or 7% of pretax income. Our net income for the June quarter totaled $745 million or $2.87 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $872 million or $3.35 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations during the June quarter and our free cash flow totaled $804 million, reflecting better-than-expected profitability, solid shipment linearity, a reduction in inventory and reduced capital expenditure. 
Our conversion cycle was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 45 days of receivables, 34 days of inventory or 11 turns and 77 days payable.
Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $324 million and $339 million, respectively. Capital expenditure for fiscal '12 drove $717 million. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal '12 totaled $825 million.
During the June quarter, we made a scheduled $58 million principal payment on our term loan and also repaid the $500 million line of credit that was drawn during the HGST acquisition. In addition, we used $604 million to repurchase 16.4 million shares.
As announced in May, our Board approved an increase of $1.5 billion in our stock purchase authorization. As of the end of last quarter, $1.3 billion remained available for future purchases.
We exited fiscal Q4 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.2 billion of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S. Affecting our total debt of $2.2 billion dollars result in a net cash balance of $1 billion.
I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter. We expect 10 to be flat with the prior quarter. Revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, gross margin to be 30%, excluding the amortization of intangibles and a 50 basis point dilutive impact of sales of drive to Toshiba. R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of intangible as we continue to operate HGST and WD as independent subsidiaries, a tax rate of approximately 8.5% and a share count of approximately 253 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.45 and $2.55 for the September quarter.

What we're planning to change our approach to share repurchases where we did more opportunistic share repurchases in the past, we are now switching over to more systematic share purchases.

I mean, I think what we're undoubtedly seeing across the industry and its not just call it the hard drive industry, but we continue to see a tremendous amount of growth in data, right? For a variety of different reasons. And what we're seeing is a proliferation, which, by the way, there's always been a proliferation of storage devices that are used to store that increasingly in data. Right? And so undoubtedly, a large amount of data growth is going on in the cloud, right? No doubt about that. And we being Western Digital, as well as our separate subsidiaries, WD and HGST, are very well-positioned to take advantage of that in a number of different ways, whether it be the on the HGST side in terms of the tiering, types of drives that we have, enterprise class, SSD on the front, traditional performance, drives in the middle and fat drives on the back end. And then on the client side, yes, you're seeing strong level of increased participation with solid state drives. But, by the way, that increase participation in pure SSD drives is not outside of our expectations. Right? What we are saying, which is certainly benefiting our business is an increased trend in terms of thin and light hard drives. So we talked about the 7-millimeter drives that right now both the WD sub and HGST sub has, that's being coupled up in some cases, a solid-state dual drive configuration that is allowing for the performance improvements or benefits that you get whatever it happened to be, coupled with the storage and cost benefit of a hard drive. And so it's a little bit difficult to answer your question in a direct fashion, but I think that the point is that all of the data growth, as a good thing for all of us, and that what we go to do is continue to provide the right level of innovation, that level of product, interact with our customers in the right to be, we continued to bring different solutions that address always different applications.

Will they kind of inline with your expectations? Were they more severe or less severe, and should we think about that going into September quarter?"

Last quarter, pricing actually came in, that doesn't expect it. You see that with the major impact of our over achieving the EPS. And that had to do with the differential between channel pricing and OEM pricing in the flood, the spot market increased much more than the OEM markets and the teams were very, very disciplined to manage shipments linearity. And like I said, the inventories are extremely tightly managed to set 4 weeks and that includes a transit. We were able to maintain that spread between the markets a bit better than we thought when we gave the guidance for the quarter, both Q1 implied in our guidance is a mix that includes the position in the market and the price declines. It was our subsidiaries at market pricing for OEMs. And it assumes that the distribution pricing gets into the normal range to the OEM pricing."

With me are President, Steve Milligan; and Chief Financial Officer, Wolfgang Nickl. 
To begin, I want to thank all our employees for their extraordinary achievements in one of the most challenging and exciting years in our 42-year history. While responding to 2 major natural disasters and completing the largest acquisition in the history of the industry, we achieved revenue growth of over 31% and more than doubled earnings. 
Turning to the market. June quarter demand was in line with our forecast of late April. Industry shipments reached 157 million units, bringing total hard drive shipments for the year to 599 million units. Our WD and HGST teams both performed ahead of plan in Q4, with consistent execution, delighting customers with compelling and high-quality products and flexible service. As a result, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and cash flows.
In formulating our outlook for fiscal 2013, which we will share with you today, we considered many factors: We took into account several broad trends such as the soft macroeconomic environment, the growing use of tablets and smartphones and a modest expectation for the initial acceptance of Windows 8 and Ultrabooks. Consequently, our planning assumption for unit growth and hard-drive demand is a 5%.
We considered several Western Digital specific factors: First, due to the regulatory requirements to operate WD and HGST as separate subsidiaries for at least 2 years, we do not expect any significant OpEx synergies in that timeframe; second, our experience since completing the HGST acquisition has demonstrated customers' continued appreciation of the respective strengths of our WD and HGST subsidiaries; third, following 4 months of experience, we have confirmed the robustness and predictability of the HGST's business operations, processes and controls; fourth, each subsidiary has multiple opportunities to further improve its cost structure, by ramping newer areal density platforms throughout the fiscal year and by making continued progress on cost optimization and the recovery from flood-related cost issues.
Taking all these into account, we believe that Western Digital can deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $10 in fiscal '13. 
Storage continues to be at the center of the evolving digital universe: In entertainment, education, commerce and communication. WD and HGST continue to focus on serving this market with a broad and expanding portfolio of products. We believe a strategy of delighting customers, focusing investments in faster growing market segments and driving strong execution in both internal operations and our supply chain will continue to deliver consistent and superior financial performance.
Steve Milligan will now cover the operational highlights of our Q4 performance. Steve?"

When we announced the acquisition of HGST in March 2011, we emphasized the potential for strong financial returns. We believe the consolidated June quarter financial results provide a compelling early proof point. 
Both WD and HGST have a heritage of developing strategic and collaborative customer relationships, underpinned by innovative products, great technology and consistent execution. We are very pleased with the momentum we have maintained in the marketplace as we continue to focus on helping our customers succeed by developing and delivering great products across all segments of our business.
We delivered strong financial performance in the June quarter, with consolidated revenue of $4.8  billion. Crisp execution and healthy profitability generated strong cash flows. Our subsidiaries also independently managed their build plans to the prevailing demand environment. 
We shipped a total of 71 million units or 48 million terabytes of storage into the market in the June quarter. The segment mix of the consolidated results for the 2 subsidiaries demonstrates a very healthy balance. In total, Western Digital shipped 7.9 million hard drives into the enterprise market; 54 million hard drives into the client space, including notebook and desktop; 4.2 million hard drives into the consumer electronics segment, including DVR, gaming and automotive applications; and 5 million hard drives for branded products. We also shipped 1 million non-HDD units including solid state drives, media players and routers. 
It is worth noting that our aggregate shipments of nearly 8 million hard drives to enterprise customers demonstrate continued momentum by both HGST and WD in this highly strategic space. 
As expected, WD's industry-leading branded products business rebounded in the June quarter from its post-flood downturn with exciting new products. 
On the operations front, WD began production in its slider fabrication facility in Malaysia, and both subsidiaries improved efficiencies and reduced cost from flood-induced levels.
It is also important to note that both WD and HGST continue to invest in new product development. During the fourth quarter, several innovations were delivered to customers including some important new market entries:  Specifically, the WD branded products group advanced its connected home strategy with entry into the wireless home networking business, launching its family of My Net routers. It also added new software and services, including the WD 2go personal cloud mobile app with Dropbox integration. 
On the component side, WD introduced its WD Red series, the industry's first hard drives specifically designed for home and small office NAS systems. 
To address demand for thin and light devices, HGST continued to leverage its first-mover advantage with its 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter drives. More than 46 million of these particular drives have shipped since product inception.
Continuing its leadership position in enterprise storage, HGST demonstrated its industry's first 12 gigabit per second SAS solid state drive. 
In the departure from Western Digital's long-standing tradition of announcing new products only as they ship, we plan to providing a preview of some exciting innovations at our Investor Day on September 13th. I look forward to seeing many of you at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to Wolfgang for his financial reports."

We shipped a total",609,"Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the September quarter.
The revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion. We shipped a total of 71 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $65. Both unit volume and average selling price exceeded the expectations that were implied in our guidance. 
OEM sales represented 69% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 21% and retail sales were 10%.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 31%. This includes $39 million of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Excluding this, non-GAAP gross margin was 31.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin came in better than the implied gross margin in our guidance due to lower-than-expected price declines and better-than-expected shipment linearity. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $584 million for the June quarter. SG&A included $12 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. Incremental OpEx versus our guidance reflect higher attainments on our variable compensation program.
In order to better align our production with anticipated market demand, we took certain resizing actions that resulted in $80 million of restructuring charges in the June quarter, consisting of $72 million related to fixed assets and $8 million for severance. 
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $7 million. This includes $4 million of gains on  investments.
Tax expense for the June quarter was $56 million or 7% of pretax income. 
Our net income for the June quarter totaled $745 million or $2.87 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $872 million or $3.35 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations during the June quarter and our free cash flow totaled $804 million, reflecting better-than-expected profitability, solid shipment linearity, a reduction in inventory and reduced capital expenditures. 
Our conversion cycle was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 45 days of receivables, 34 days of inventory, or 11 turns, and 77 days payables.
Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $324 million and $339 million, respectively. Capital expenditure for fiscal '12 totaled $717 million. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal '12 totaled $825 million.
During the June quarter, we made a scheduled $58 million principal payment on our term loan and also repaid the $500 million line of credit that was drawn during the HGST acquisition. In addition, we used $604 million to repurchase 16.4 million shares.
As announced in May, our Board approved an increase of $1.5 billion in our stock purchase authorization. As of the end of last quarter, $1.3 billion remained available for future purchases.
We exited fiscal Q4 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.2 billion of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.2 billion dollars results in a net cash balance of $1 billion.
I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter: We expect TAM to be flat with the prior quarter; revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion; gross margin to be 30%, excluding the amortization of intangibles and a 50 basis point dilutive impact of sales of drive to Toshiba; R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles, as we continue to operate HGST and WD as independent subsidiaries; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 253 million. 
Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.45 and $2.55 for the September quarter.

But in average, you should assume what we guided for in Q1. As it relates to the tax rate, I think the 8.5% that we gave you for Q1 is probably a good proxy for the year as well. We're planning to change our approach to share repurchases, where we did more opportunistic share repurchases in the past, we are now switching over to more systematic share purchases. And when you compute all these numbers together, you're coming to a gross margin that's roughly about 30%, give or take. So those are the major assumptions.

HGST has filed with a model of whether it will be 80%, 90% internal, 10%, 20% external purchases. WD has got kind of a similar model.  Obviously, that became overweighted in terms of the recovery from the flood. And as John and Wolfgang alluded to, we still got a variety of different things that we need to do as an organization to get to pre-flood kind of levels from a cost perspective. And certainly returning to that kind of blend will be something that we'll be looking to do as we progress into the future."

I mean, I think we're undoubtedly seeing across the industry and its not just call it ""the hard drive industry,"" but we continue to see a tremendous amount of growth in data, right? For a variety of different reasons. And what we're seeing is a proliferation, which, by the way, there's always been a proliferation of storage devices that are used to store that increase in data, right? And so, undoubtedly, a large amount of data growth is going on in the cloud, right? No doubt about that. And we, being Western Digital, as well as our separate subsidiaries, WD and HGST, are very well-positioned to take advantage of that in a number of different ways, whether it be the, on the HGST side, in terms of the tiering types of drives that we have, enterprise class, SSD on the front, traditional performance, drives in the middle and fat drives on the back end. And then on the client side, yes, you're seeing some level of increased participation with solid state drives. But, by the way, that increased participation in pure SSD drives is not outside of our expectations, right? What we are saying, which is certainly benefiting our business, is an increased trend in terms of thin and light hard drives. So we talked about the 7-millimeter drives that, right now, both the WD sub and HGST sub have, that's being coupled up in some cases with solid-state, a dual drive configuration, that is allowing for the performance improvements or benefits that you get [indiscernible] whatever it might happen to be, coupled with the storage and cost benefit of a hard drive. And so it's a little bit difficult to answer your question in a direct fashion, but I think that the point is, is that all of this data growth is a good thing for all of us, and that what we've got to do is continue to provide the right level of innovation, the right level of product, interact with our customers in the right way, to continued to bring different solutions that address all these different applications.

Last quarter, pricing actually came in better than expected. You see that with the major impact of our over achieving of the EPS. And that had to do with the differential between channel pricing and OEM pricing. In the flood, the spot markets increased much more than the OEM markets and the teams were very, very disciplined to manage shipments linearity. And like Steve said, the inventories are extremely tightly managed to sub 4 weeks and that includes in transit. But we were able to maintain that spread between the markets, a bit better than we thought when we gave the guidance for the quarter. For Q1, implied in our guidance is a mix. Obviously, it includes now our position in the market and enterprise drives.

With me are President, Steve Milligan; and Chief Financial Officer, Wolfgang Nickl. 
To begin, I want to thank all our employees for their extraordinary achievements in one of the most challenging and exciting years in our 42-year history. While responding to 2 major natural disasters and completing the largest acquisition in the history of the industry, we achieved revenue growth of over 31% and more than doubled earnings. 
Turning to the market. June quarter demand was in line with our forecast of late April. Industry shipments reached 157 million units, bringing total hard drive shipments for the year to 599 million units. Our WD and HGST teams both performed ahead of plan in Q4, with consistent execution, delighting customers with compelling and high-quality products and flexible service. As a result, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and cash flows.
In formulating our outlook for fiscal 2013, which we will share with you today, we considered many factors: We took into account several broad trends such as the soft macroeconomic environment, the growing use of tablets and smartphones and a modest expectation for the initial acceptance of Windows 8 and Ultrabooks. Consequently, our planning assumption for unit growth and hard-drive demand is a 5%.
We considered several Western Digital specific factors: First, due to the regulatory requirements to operate WD and HGST as separate subsidiaries for at least 2 years, we do not expect any significant OpEx synergies in that timeframe; second, our experience since completing the HGST acquisition has demonstrated customers' continued appreciation of the respective strengths of our WD and HGST subsidiaries; third, following 4 months of experience, we have confirmed the robustness and predictability of HGST's business operations, processes and controls; fourth, each subsidiary has multiple opportunities to further improve its cost structure, by ramping newer areal density platforms throughout the fiscal year and by making continued progress on cost optimization and the recovery from flood-related cost issues.
Taking all this into account, we believe that Western Digital can deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $10 in fiscal '13. 
Storage continues to be at the center of the evolving digital universe: In entertainment, education, commerce and communication. WD and HGST continue to focus on serving this market with a broad and expanding portfolio of products. We believe a strategy of delighting customers, focusing investments in faster growing market segments and driving strong execution in both internal operations and our supply chain will continue to deliver consistent and superior financial performance.
Steve Milligan will now cover the operational highlights of our Q4 performance. Steve?"

When we announced the acquisition of HGST in March 2011, we emphasized the potential for strong financial returns. We believe the consolidated June quarter financial results provide a compelling early proof point. 
Both WD and HGST have a heritage of developing strategic and collaborative customer relationships, underpinned by innovative products, great technology and consistent execution. We are very pleased with the momentum we have maintained in the marketplace as we continue to focus on helping our customers succeed by developing and delivering great products across all segments of our business.
We delivered strong financial performance in the June quarter, with consolidated revenue of $4.8  billion. Crisp execution and healthy profitability generated strong cash flows. Our subsidiaries also independently managed their build plans to the prevailing demand environment. 
We shipped a total of 71 million units or 48 million terabytes of storage into the market in the June quarter. The segment mix of the consolidated results for the 2 subsidiaries demonstrates a very healthy balance. In total, Western Digital shipped 7.9 million hard drives into the enterprise market; 54 million hard drives into the client space, including notebook and desktop; 4.2 million hard drives into the consumer electronics segment, including DVR, gaming and automotive applications; and 5 million hard drives for branded products. We also shipped 1 million non-HDD units including solid state drives, media players and routers. 
It is worth noting that our aggregate shipments of nearly 8 million hard drives to enterprise customers demonstrates continued momentum by both HGST and WD in this highly strategic space. 
As expected, WD's industry-leading branded products business rebounded in the June quarter from its post-flood downturn with exciting new products. 
On the operations front, WD began production in its new slider fabrication facility in Malaysia, and both subsidiaries improved efficiencies and reduced cost from flood-induced levels.
It is also important to note that both WD and HGST continue to invest in new product development. During the fourth quarter, several innovations were delivered to customers including some important new market entries:  Specifically, the WD branded products group advanced its connected home strategy with entry into the wireless home networking business, launching its family of My Net routers. It also added new software and services, including the WD 2go personal cloud mobile app with Dropbox integration. 
On the component side, WD introduced its WD Red series, the industry's first hard drives specifically designed for home and small office NAS systems. 
To address demand for thin and light devices, HGST continued to leverage its first-mover advantage with its 2.5-inch, 7-millimeter drives. More than 46 million of these particular drives have shipped since product inception.
Continuing its leadership position in enterprise storage, HGST demonstrated the industry's first 12 gigabit per second SAS solid state drive. 
In a departure from Western Digital's long-standing tradition of announcing new products only as they ship, we plan on providing a preview of some exciting innovations at our Investor Day on September 13th. I look forward to seeing many of you at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to Wolfgang for his financial reports."

We shipped a total",609,"Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and will then provide a range of expected financial results for the September quarter.
The revenue for the June quarter was $4.8 billion. We shipped a total of 71 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $65. Both unit volume and average selling price exceeded the expectations that were implied in our guidance. 
OEM sales represented 69% of revenue, distribution channel sales were 21% and retail sales were 10%.
Our gross margin for the quarter was 31%. This includes $39 million of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Excluding this, non-GAAP gross margin was 31.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin came in better than the implied gross margin in our guidance due to lower-than-expected price declines and better-than-expected shipment linearity. 
R&D and SG&A spending totaled $584 million for the June quarter. SG&A included $12 million of amortization expense related to intangibles recorded through the purchase price allocation. Incremental OpEx versus our guidance reflect higher attainments on our variable compensation program.
In order to better align our production with anticipated market demand, we took certain resizing actions that resulted in $80 million of restructuring charges in the June quarter, consisting of $72 million related to fixed assets and $8 million for severance. 
Net interest and other non-operating expense was $7 million. This includes $4 million of gains on  investments.
Tax expense for the June quarter was $56 million or 7% of pretax income. 
Our net income for the June quarter totaled $745 million or $2.87 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $872 million or $3.35 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations during the June quarter and our free cash flow totaled $804 million, reflecting better-than-expected profitability, solid shipment linearity, a reduction in inventory and reduced capital expenditures. 
Our conversion cycle was a positive 2 days. This consisted of 45 days of receivables, 34 days of inventory, or 11 turns, and 77 days payables.
Capital spending and depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $324 million and $339 million, respectively. Capital expenditure for fiscal '12 totaled $717 million. Depreciation and amortization for fiscal '12 totaled $825 million.
During the June quarter, we made a scheduled $58 million principal payment on our term loan and also repaid the $500 million line of credit that was drawn during the HGST acquisition. In addition, we used $604 million to repurchase 16.4 million shares.
As announced in May, our Board approved an increase of $1.5 billion in our stock purchase authorization. As of the end of last quarter, $1.3 billion remained available for future purchases.
We exited fiscal Q4 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.2 billion of which $1.5 billion was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.2 billion dollars results in a net cash balance of $1 billion.
I will now provide our guidance for the September quarter: We expect TAM to be flat with the prior quarter; revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion; gross margin to be 30%, excluding the amortization of intangibles and a 50 basis point dilutive impact of sales of drive to Toshiba; R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $550 million, excluding the amortization of intangibles, as we continue to operate HGST and WD as independent subsidiaries; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 253 million. 
Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $2.45 and $2.55 for the September quarter.

But in average, you should assume what we guided for in Q1. As it relates to the tax rate, I think the 8.5% that we gave you for Q1 is probably a good proxy for the year as well. We're planning to change our approach to share repurchases, where we did more opportunistic share repurchases in the past, we are now switching over to more systematic share purchases. And when you compute all these numbers together, you're coming to a gross margin that's roughly about 30%, give or take. So those are the major assumptions.

I mean, I think what we're undoubtedly seeing across the industry and its not just call it ""the hard drive industry,"" but we continue to see a tremendous amount of growth in data, right? For a variety of different reasons. And what we're seeing is a proliferation, which, by the way, there's always been a proliferation of storage devices that are used to store that increase in data, right? And so, undoubtedly, a large amount of data growth is going on in the cloud, right? No doubt about that. And we, we being Western Digital, as well as our separate subsidiaries, WD and HGST, are very well-positioned to take advantage of that in a number of different ways, whether it be the, on the HGST side, in terms of the tiering types of drives that we have, enterprise class, SSD on the front, traditional performance drives in the middle and fat drives on the back end. And then on the client side, yes, you're seeing some level of increased participation with solid state drives. But, by the way, that increased participation in pure SSD drives is not outside of our expectations, right? What we are saying, which is certainly benefiting our business, is an increased trend in terms of thin and light hard drives. So we talked about the 7-millimeter drives that, right now, both the WD sub and HGST sub have, that's being coupled up in some cases with solid-state, a dual drive configuration, that is allowing for the performance improvements or benefits that you get instant on whatever it might happen to be, coupled with the storage and cost benefit of a hard drive. And so it's a little bit difficult to answer your question in a direct fashion, but I think that the point is, is that all of this data growth is a good thing for all of us, and that what we've got to do is continue to provide the right level of innovation, the right level of products, interact with our customers in the right way, to continue to bring different solutions that address all these different applications. And so, it's actually, I think we're very optimistic in terms of our ability to be able to do that."

Last quarter, pricing actually came in better than expected. You see that with the major impact of our overachieving of the EPS. And that had to do with the differential between channel pricing and OEM pricing. In the flood, the spot markets increased much more than the OEM markets and the teams were very, very disciplined to manage shipments linearity. And like Steve said, the inventories are extremely tightly managed to sub 4 weeks and that includes in transit. But we were able to maintain that spread between the markets a bit better than we thought when we gave the guidance for the quarter. For Q1, implied in our guidance is a mix. Obviously, it includes now our position in the market and enterprise drives. It has our subsidiaries at market pricing for OEMs. And it assumes that the distribution pricing gets into the normal range to the OEM pricing."

In this, my last earnings call, I'm happy to report another quarter of strong financial performance continuing our track record of consistent execution. During my 6-year tenure as CEO, we have experienced and successfully addressed many different challenges and opportunities. Throughout, we have continued to hone our time-tested and flexible business model delivering outstanding returns and value under varying scenarios. The results include a doubling of market share, a tripling of revenue and a fivefold increase in profits. 
I'm proud of this sustained performance by the team and I'm confident, as I pass the leadership of the company to Steve, ably supported by Tim Laden, Mike Cordano and Wolfgang, that they will continue to build on that momentum.

We have built strong relationships with customers in all of our markets by consistently delighting them with high quality, reliable products based on superior technology and delivered through the industry's most efficient supply chain.

We are very pleased to report strong financial results for our September quarter, demonstrating our continued ability to deliver value under varying market conditions. There are several dynamics currently limiting market demand: First, global macroeconomic weakness, which is impacting overall IT spending; second, product transitions in the PC industry; and third, the continued adoption of tablets and smartphones which is meeting PC sales growth. 
These headwinds notwithstanding, the Western Digital team remains focused on creating outstanding economic value, building on our strong multiyear track record. There is a tremendous opportunity as we innovate and enable customers to store, manage and connect the massive and growing amounts of digital data in their personal and professional lives. This opportunity extends well into the future. 
Looking across our markets, the needs of customers are becoming more diverse, resulting in greater market segmentation. Computing is no longer a general purpose opposition and that evolution plays to the strengths of Western Digital with our technology breadth, people and product portfolio. 
Currently, we are focused on 3 key initiatives to broaden our portfolio to meet the evolving needs of our customers, enabling continued value creation. First, the delivery of innovative and cost-effective storage products, including hybrid drives, present and light mobile devices. Second, a portfolio enterprise products that fit the varying needs of the public and private cloud environments, including high-performance, SSD systems and high-performance and large capacity hard drives with the lowest total cost of ownership. Third, providing easy-to-use integrated solutions for the personal cloud environment and our connected lives. 
We have received very positive customer feedback on our latest differentiated solutions to address these trends. All major PC OEMs have shown strong interest in our 5-millimeter and 7-millimeter hybrid designs as an alternative to solid-state and dual drive configurations. 
In the cloud environment, our new 7-disc high-capacity CO drive announcement has been extremely well received, confirming the need to seek better total cost of ownership solutions for this growing market. For the Connected Life, we introduced today the My Passport Enterprise, one of the industry's first portable hard drives designed specifically for use with Microsoft's Windows To Go, enabling corporate customers to provision a fully featured Windows 8 workspace on a USB drive. 
For fiscal 2013, we remain focused on realizing the $10 EPS target established in July of this year, despite a significant change in underlying industry growth assumptions. We will continue to manage closely those aspects of our business that we control namely, delighting our customers, executing to our product roadmap, remaining diligent with regards to managing costs and expenses and strategically allocating our capital. 
Looking forward, I am very excited about the future of Western Digital. We have the people, platform, technology and financial resources to continue to invest in growth opportunities while, at the same time, returning approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.

I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and then provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter. Revenue for the September quarter was $4 billion. Excluding shipment to Toshiba under our divestiture agreement, we shifted total of 62.5 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $62. 
OEM sales represented 63% of revenue; distribution channel sales, 24%; and retail sales, 13%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.6%. Excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets, non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5%. Our SG&A spending totaled to $575 million for the September quarter. SG&A included $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. 
In order to align our production with anticipated market demand, we incurred charges of $26 million in the September quarter. Net interest and other nonoperating expense was $14 million. Tax expense for the September quarter was $59 million or 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the September quarter totaled $519 million or $2.06 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $594 million or $2.36 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $936 million in cash from operations during the September quarter and our free cash flow totaled $554 million. We used $218 million to repurchase 5.2 million shares. As of the end of September, an authorization of $2.6 billion remains available for future repurchases. 
We declared the first dividend in company history in the amount of $0.25 per share for a total of $61 million, which we paid on October 15 to shareholders of record as of September 28. 
We exited fiscal Q1 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.5 billion of which $826 million was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.1 billion, our net cash balance was $1.4 billion.
I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect a total available market of approximately 140 million units; revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.7 billion, reflecting the muted demand environment, a seasonal reduction in our gaming business and a planned reduction of our 3.5-inch contract manufacturing for Toshiba; gross margin of approximately 28%, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles, which is within our new business model despite continued cost challenges stemming from the floods in Thailand last year; we expect R&D SG&A spending to be approximately $525 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and the share count of approximately 248 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.65 and $1.85 for the December quarter.

We've got -- as we indicated on our prepared remarks, there's a lot of different factors at play. Clearly, the global macroeconomic environment -- I mean and it's not just the IT industry but there's a lot of headwinds in terms of what's happening on a global basis. Additionally, the IT segment is not immune to that, so we've seen other announcements come out that have talked about weakness in terms of overall IT spending. And then clearly, the PC industry is weak, all right. And some of that is due to product transitions with Windows 8. But undoubtedly, there is an impact, as we're seeing, if you want to call it cannibalization, in terms of tablets and smartphones or other kind of connected devices. And I think the important thing for to really refer to is when we had our Investor Day, we talked about a longer-term growth rate in the HDD industry of 3%. When we put that together, we attempted as best as possible to estimate the impact of all these different factors. And right now, we don't see a reason to alter that 3% longer-term growth rate in terms of a number of hard drives sold."

And if you do the math, that would be a TAM of 630 million units. And with the first 2 quarter that 139 and 140, respectively, we need a bit of an uptick in the second half of the fiscal year to continue to be able to do the target.

First thing is if you go back to the floods, really a couple different things there. First off, the enterprise segment was the one segment that was least impacted from a drive output perspective as it relates to the floods. We all, the various different companies, independently did as much as we could protect the supply in that critical part of the market. Nevertheless, our customers, because of concerns about shortages, I would say bought ahead from a demand perspective in order to protect themselves in that segment. Additionally, if you look at some of the impact of the LTA contracts that were out there, that also resulted in customers purchasing ahead from a supply perspective ahead of the demand. And then, sure, we have seen some slowdown in terms of end-user demand, if you want to refer at with that way. But fundamentally, the overall dynamics in the enterprise space remain positive as we're saying substantial data growth and build out of infrastructures from that perspective. However, in terms of the units that we ship as an industry and we ship as a company, we are seeing the impact of that inventory correction roll through the latest quarter.

I have with me our President, Steve Milligan; and our Chief Financial Officer, Wolfgang Nickl. 
In this, my last earnings call, I'm happy to report another quarter of strong financial performance, continuing our track record of consistent execution. During my 6-year tenure as CEO, we have experienced and successfully addressed many different challenges and opportunities. Throughout, we have continued to hone our time-tested and flexible business model, delivering outstanding returns and value under varying scenarios. The results include a doubling of market share, a tripling of revenue and a fivefold increase in profits. 
I'm proud of this sustained performance by the team, and I'm confident as I pass the leadership of the company to Steve, ably supported by Tim Laden, Mike Cordano and Wolfgang, that they will continue to build on that momentum. 
While the macroeconomic environment is dampening near-term demand, we remain confident in the continued long-term growth in the creation, storage and management of digital content. This is being seen in every aspect of our lives, and monetizing it provides a compelling long-term opportunity for the company. 
We have built strong relationships with customers in all of our markets by consistently delighting them with high-quality, reliable products based on superior technology and delivered through the industry's most efficient supply chain. We have developed a tremendously broad product portfolio, great depth and breadth in our people and technology resources and a powerful platform. Western Digital has never been better positioned to succeed as it continues to thrive on change and deliver great value to all its constituents. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank our customers, our supply partners and our investors for their support, and I especially want to thank our employees around the world who have consistently delivered such outstanding performance.

We are very pleased to report strong financial results for our September quarter, demonstrating our continued ability to deliver value under varying market conditions. There are several dynamics currently limiting market demand: first, global macroeconomic weakness, which is impacting overall IT spending; second, product transitions in the PC industry; and third, the continued adoption of tablets and smartphones, which is meeting PC sales growth. 
These headwinds notwithstanding, the Western Digital team remains focused on creating outstanding economic value, building on our strong multiyear track record. There is a tremendous opportunity as we innovate and enable customers to store, manage and connect the massive and growing amounts of digital data in their personal and professional lives. This opportunity extends well into the future. 
Looking across our markets, the needs of customers are becoming more diverse, resulting in greater market segmentation. Computing is no longer a general purpose opposition, and that evolution plays to the strengths of Western Digital with our technology breadth, people and product portfolio. 
Currently, we are focused on 3 key initiatives to broaden our portfolio to meet the evolving needs of our customers, enabling continued value creation: first, the delivery of innovative and cost-effective storage products, including hybrid drives for thin and light mobile devices; second, a portfolio of enterprise products that fit the varying needs of the public and private cloud environments, including high-performance SSD systems and high-performance and large-capacity hard drives with the lowest total cost of ownership; third, providing easy-to-use integrated solutions for the personal cloud environment and our connected lives. 
We have received very positive customer feedback on our latest differentiated solutions to address these trends. All major PC OEMs have shown strong interest in our 5-millimeter and 7-millimeter hybrid designs as an alternative to solid-state and dual drive configurations. 
In the cloud environment, our new 7-disk high-capacity sealed drive announcement has been extremely well received, confirming the need to seek better total cost of ownership solutions for this growing market. For the Connected Life, we introduced today the My Passport Enterprise, one of the industry's first portable hard drives designed specifically for use with Microsoft's Windows To Go, enabling corporate customers to provision a fully featured Windows 8 workspace on a USB drive. 
For fiscal 2013, we remain focused on realizing the $10 EPS target established in July of this year despite a significant change in the underlying industry growth assumptions. We will continue to manage closely those aspects of our business that we control, namely delighting our customers, executing to our product roadmap, remaining diligent with regards to managing costs and expenses and strategically allocating our capital. 
Looking forward, I am very excited about the future of Western Digital. We have the people, platform, technology and financial resources to continue to invest in growth opportunities while at the same time, returning approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.

I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and then provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter. Revenue for the September quarter was $4 billion. Excluding shipment to Toshi",457,"Thank you, Steve. I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and then provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter. Revenue for the September quarter was $4 billion. Excluding shipment to Toshiba under our divestiture agreement, we shifted total of 62.5 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $62. 
OEM sales represented 63% of revenue; distribution channel sales, 24%; and retail sales, 13%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.6%. Excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets, non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5%. Our R&D and SG&A spending totaled $575 million for the September quarter. SG&A included $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. 
In order to align our production with anticipated market demand, we incurred charges of $26 million in the September quarter. Net interest and other non-operating expense was $14 million. Tax expense for the September quarter was $59 million or 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the September quarter totaled $519 million or $2.06 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $594 million or $2.36 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $936 million in cash from operations during the September quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $554 million. We used $218 million to repurchase 5.2 million shares. As of the end of September, an authorization of $2.6 billion remains available for future repurchases. 
We declared the first dividend in company history in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $61 million, which we paid on October 15 to shareholders of record as of September 28. 
We exited fiscal Q1 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.5 billion, of which $826 million was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.1 billion, our net cash balance was $1.4 billion.
I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect a total available market of approximately 140 million units; revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.7 billion, reflecting the muted demand environment, a seasonal reduction in our gaming business and a planned reduction of our 3.5-inch contract manufacturing for Toshiba; gross margin of approximately 28%, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles, which is within our new business model despite continued cost challenges stemming from the floods in Thailand last year. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $525 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 248 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.65 and $1.85 for the December quarter.

Additionally, the IT segment is not immune to that. So we've seen other announcements come out that have talked about weakness in terms of overall IT spending. And then clearly, the PC industry is weak, all right. And some of that is due to product transitions with Windows 8. But undoubtedly, there is an impact, as we're seeing, if you want to call it cannibalization in terms of tablets and smartphones or other kind of connected devices. And I think the important thing to really refer to is when we had our Investor Day, we talked about a longer-term growth rate in the HDD industry of 3%. When we put that together, we attempted as best as possible to estimate the impact of all these different factors. And right now, we don't see a reason to alter that 3% longer-term growth rate in terms of a number of hard drives sold."

And if you do the math, that would be a TAM of 630 million units. And with the first 2 quarters, that 139 and 140, respectively, we need a bit of an uptick in the second half of the fiscal year to continue to be able to do the target. I believe that we'll get in the 600 range. It's very doable. And like we said, we focus on the levels that we control. And it remains a target, and that's what we're shooting for."

First thing is if you go back to the floods, really a couple of different things there. First off, the enterprise segment was the one segment that was least impacted from a drive output perspective as it relates to the floods. We all -- the various different companies independently did as much as we could to protect the supply in that critical part of the market. Nevertheless, our customers, because of concerns about shortages, I would say, bought ahead from a demand perspective in order to protect themselves in that segment. Additionally, if you look at some of the impact of the LTA contracts that were out there, that also resulted in customers purchasing ahead from a supply perspective ahead of the demand. And then, sure, we have seen some slowdown in terms of end-user demand, if you want to refer to it that way. But fundamentally, the overall dynamics in the enterprise space remain positive as we're seeing substantial data growth and build-out of infrastructures from that perspective. However, in terms of the units that we ship as an industry and we ship as a company, we are seeing the impact of that inventory correction roll through the latest quarter.

And one of the impacts is absorption, the fewer drive you build. And we mentioned the gaming effect, and we mentioned the Toshiba effect. And the fewer drive you built in a quarter, the more challenging it is to get your cost objective.

We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.

Reconciliations of the differences between the historical non-GAAP measures that we provide during this call to the comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the investor information summary posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. 
The forward-looking guidance we provide during this call excludes certain items such as amortization of intangibles and the dilutive impact of sales of drives to Toshiba in connection with our divestiture transaction.

I have with me our President, Steve Milligan; and our Chief Financial Officer, Wolfgang Nickl. 
In this, my last earnings call, I'm happy to report another quarter of strong financial performance, continuing our track record of consistent execution. During my 6-year tenure as CEO, we have experienced and successfully addressed many different challenges and opportunities. Throughout, we have continued to hone our time-tested and flexible business model, delivering outstanding returns and value under varying scenarios. The results include a doubling of market share, a tripling of revenue and a fivefold increase in profits. 
I'm proud of this sustained performance by the team, and I'm confident as I pass the leadership of the company to Steve, ably supported by Tim Leyden, Mike Cordano and Wolfgang, that they will continue to build on that momentum. 
While the macroeconomic environment is dampening near-term demand, we remain confident in the continued long-term growth in the creation, storage and management of digital content. This is being seen in every aspect of our lives, and monetizing it provides a compelling long-term opportunity for the company. 
We have built strong relationships with customers in all of our markets by consistently delighting them with high-quality, reliable products based on superior technology and delivered through the industry's most efficient supply chain. We have developed a tremendously broad product portfolio, great depth and breadth in our people and technology resources and a powerful platform. Western Digital has never been better positioned to succeed as it continues to thrive on change and deliver great value to all its constituents. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank our customers, our supply partners and our investors for their support, and I especially want to thank our employees around the world who have consistently delivered such outstanding performance. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Milligan."

We are very pleased to report strong financial results for our September quarter, demonstrating our continued ability to deliver value under varying market conditions. There are several dynamics currently limiting market demand: first, global macroeconomic weakness, which is impacting overall IT spending; second, product transitions in the PC industry; and third, the continued adoption of tablets and smartphones, which is muting PC sales growth. 
These headwinds notwithstanding, the Western Digital team remains focused on creating outstanding economic value, building on our strong multiyear track record. There is a tremendous opportunity as we innovate and enable customers to store, manage and connect the massive and growing amounts of digital data in their personal and professional lives. This opportunity extends well into the future. 
Looking across our markets, the needs of customers are becoming more diverse, resulting in greater market segmentation. Computing is no longer a general purpose proposition, and that evolution plays to the strengths of Western Digital with our technology breadth, people and product portfolio. 
Currently, we are focused on 3 key initiatives to broaden our portfolio to meet the evolving needs of our customers, enabling continued value creation: first, the delivery of innovative and cost-effective storage products, including hybrid drives for thin and light mobile devices; second, a portfolio of enterprise products that fit the varying needs of the public and private cloud environments, including high-performance SSD systems and high-performance and large-capacity hard drives with the lowest total cost of ownership; third, providing easy-to-use integrated solutions for the personal cloud environment and our connected lives. 
We have received very positive customer feedback on our latest differentiated solutions to address these trends. All major PC OEMs have shown strong interest in our 5-millimeter and 7-millimeter hybrid designs as an alternative to solid-state and dual drive configurations. 
In the cloud environment, our new 7-disk high-capacity sealed drive announcement has been extremely well received, confirming the need to seek better total cost of ownership solutions for this growing market. For the Connected Life, we introduced today the My Passport Enterprise, one of the industry's first portable hard drives designed specifically for use with Microsoft's Windows To Go, enabling corporate customers to provision a fully featured Windows 8 workspace on a USB drive. 
For fiscal 2013, we remain focused on realizing the $10 EPS target established in July of this year despite a significant change in the underlying industry growth assumptions. We will continue to manage closely those aspects of our business that we control, namely delighting our customers, executing to our product roadmap, remaining diligent with regards to managing costs and expenses and strategically allocating our capital. 
Looking forward, I am very excited about the future of Western Digital. We have the people, platform, technology and financial resources to continue to invest in growth opportunities while at the same time, returning approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. 
Wolfgang will now provide a report on our Q1 performance and our Q2 outlook."

I will first summarize our consolidated financial performance for last quarter and then provide a range of expected financial results for the December quarter. Revenue for the September quarter was $4 billion. Excluding shipment to Toshiba under our divestiture agreement, we shifted total of 62.5 million hard drives into the market at an average selling price of $62. 
OEM sales represented 63% of revenue; distribution channel sales, 24%; and retail sales, 13%. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.6%. Excluding $38 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets, non-GAAP gross margin was 30.5%. Our R&D and SG&A spending totaled $575 million for the September quarter. SG&A included $11 million of amortization expense related to acquired HGST intangible assets. 
In order to align our production with anticipated market demand, we incurred charges of $26 million in the September quarter. Net interest and other non-operating expense was $14 million. Tax expense for the September quarter was $59 million or 10.2% of pretax income. Our net income for the September quarter totaled $519 million or $2.06 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $594 million or $2.36 per share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $936 million in cash from operations during the September quarter, and our free cash flow totaled $554 million. We used $218 million to repurchase 5.2 million shares. As of the end of September, an authorization of $2.6 billion remains available for future repurchases. 
We declared the first dividend in company history in the amount of $0.25 per share or a total of $61 million, which we paid on October 15 to shareholders of record as of September 28. 
We exited fiscal Q1 with total cash and cash equivalent of $3.5 billion, of which $826 million was in the U.S. Subtracting our total debt of $2.1 billion, our net cash balance was $1.4 billion.
I will now provide our guidance for the December quarter. We expect a total available market of approximately 140 million units; revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.7 billion, reflecting the muted demand environment, a seasonal reduction in our gaming business and a planned reduction of our 3.5-inch contract manufacturing for Toshiba; gross margin of approximately 28%, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles, which is within our new business model despite continued cost challenges stemming from the floods in Thailand last year. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $525 million, excluding the amortization of HGST intangibles; a tax rate of approximately 8.5%; and a share count of approximately 248 million. Accordingly, we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.65 and $1.85 for the December quarter.

Additionally, the IT segment is not immune to that. So we've seen other announcements come out that have talked about weakness in terms of overall IT spending. And then clearly, the PC industry is weak, right? And some of that is due to product transitions with Windows 8. But undoubtedly, there is an impact, as we're seeing, if you want to call it cannibalization in terms of tablets and smartphones or other kind of connected devices. And I think the important thing to really refer to is when we had our Investor Day, we talked about a longer-term growth rate in the HDD industry of 3%. When we put that together, we attempted as best as possible to estimate the impact of all these different factors. And right now, we don't see a reason to alter that 3% longer-term growth rate in terms of number of hard drives sold."

And if you do the math, that would be a TAM of 630 million units. And with the first 2 quarters at 139 and 140, respectively, we need a bit of an uptick in the second half of the fiscal year to continue to be able to do the target. I believe that we'll get in the 600 range. It's very doable. And like we said, we focus on the levels that we control. And it remains a target, and that's what we're shooting for."

First thing is if you go back to the floods, really a couple of different things there. First off, the enterprise segment was the one segment that was least impacted from a drive output perspective as it relates to the floods. We all -- the various different companies independently did as much as we could to protect the supply in that critical part of the market. Nevertheless, our customers, because of concerns about shortages, I would say, bought ahead from a demand perspective in order to protect themselves in that segment. Additionally, if you look at some of the impact of the LTA contracts that were out there, that also resulted in customers purchasing ahead from a supply perspective ahead of the demand. And then, sure, we have seen some slowdown in terms of end-user demand, if you want to refer to it that way. But fundamentally, the overall dynamics in the enterprise space remain positive as we're seeing substantial data growth and build-out of infrastructures from that perspective. However, in terms of the units that we shipped as an industry and we shipped as a company, we are seeing the impact of that inventory correction roll through the latest quarter.

And the fewer drives you build in a quarter, the more challenging it is to get to your cost objective.

So if you look at it from a demand perspective, both the traditional performance segment and the capacity enterprise segment were affected by the inventory overhang that we spoke of -- that I spoke of earlier. I would say, and this is our view, that the inventory adjustment and the capacity enterprise space is behind us. And we expect some modest growth in that segment here in the calendar Q4. Now just to remind everybody, the demand in that segment, and this is maybe becoming a little bit less so than in the past, but it tends to be a little bit more project based, so it can be a little bit lumpy. But we are anticipating some modest growth here in the final quarter of the calendar year."
