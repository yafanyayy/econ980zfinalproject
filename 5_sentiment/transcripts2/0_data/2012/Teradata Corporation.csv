And non-GAAP ea",1965,"Thanks, Gregg. And good morning, everyone. Teradata ended 2011 with the highest revenue growth ever achieved for the quarter during the past decade. Q4 revenue of $673 million was up 23% over prior year's reported and in constant currency. And non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.66 grew 25%. Product revenue increased 24% in Q4, which was well above the 20% growth rate we have average in 2010 and 2011. Services revenue continued its strong growth at 22% and our non-GAAP gross margin rate improved 70 basis points to 56.5%. New customer wins were at record levels in Q4 making this one of the finest quarters ever achieved for Teradata. For the full year, revenue finished at $2.36 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share finished at $2.32. Revenue growth of 22% as reported and 19% in constant currency was by far, the highest annual growth rate for Teradata.
We were particularly pleased with the growth of our core Data Warehouse business in 2011, which grew 16% net of currency and acquisitions. Our previous highest growth rate was in 2010 when revenue grew 12% in constant currency. For the year, we also have a record number of Data Warehouse new customer wins, and Aprimo was close to their all-time record for new customer wins as well. Among the new customers joining Teradata in 2011 were 18 companies that are in the Fortune 500. And finally, our new sales territories finished well above $120 million revenue target we set for 2011. With this increased demand, we chose to add more resources into the existing new territories to capture the revenue opportunity. In addition, we consolidated the reduced some of the existing new territories added from previous years to optimize the return on our investments. As a result, we exited the year with 45 net new territories versus the increase target of 60 we set in July, well above the original target of 30 we set at the beginning of the year.
Overall, Q4 and 2011 were the best quarter and the best year ever for Teradata. Turning to the regions, all 3 regions grew more than 20% in constant currency in Q4. The Americas fourth quarter revenue was up 22% as reported and in constant currency, and for the full year grew revenue 21% as recorded and in constant currency to a total of $1.44 billion. The Americas set records for new customer wins for the year and in the quarter including one of the largest military medical agencies, which is implementing Aster Data to unify and analyze huge volumes of multi-structure, clinical and patient data to improve treatments while reducing the cost of care.
AARP selected Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand to increase coordination of various marketing functions with the intent of improving their member experience. And that one of the largest financial services companies, which is installing an integrated data warehouse to increase operational efficiencies, better understanding risks and reducing fraud. This customer is also a user of Aprimo. NBIC, the Brazilian Ministry of development and foreign trade, is building an integrated data warehouse to get you insight into international trading, internal commerce and the development of the variety of services to improve to promote a more competitive Brazil. Synergistic new customer wins for Aprimo included with Teradata customers, the American Red Cross, Caesars Entertainment, CBS and the Sports Authority.
The Americas also had a strong activity with existing customers such as PepsiCo, where Teradata is becoming the foundation of its mobile business intelligence and geospatial applications. One of the largest mobile providers, which is now using Teradata for their network operations. That's an addition to integrating data from marketing, retail, finance and customer care. We now have 2 telcos using Teradata for their network operations, which is a good growth opportunity for Teradata to expand our business with our telco customers. And that one of the largest consumer packaged goods companies in the world, which is expanding its Teradata system to provide additional analytic insights and as expected to reduce out of stocks by 2%, which would increase revenue by $300 million per year. EMEA match the Americas with fourth quarter revenue growth of 22% as recorded and in constant currency. For the full year, revenue increased 24% as recorded and 18% in constant currency to a total of $548 million. New customer wins for the year were the highest level since 2002. Fourth quarter new customer wins included one of the leading oil and gas companies in the Nordics, which used Teradata to analyze seismic data and improve oil recovery. This company will use Teradata Analytics to improve extraction levels, just a small increase in oil recovery is worth millions of dollars. This is a significant opportunity for oil and gas companies and also for Teradata. Sainsbury's, one of the largest retailers in the UK chose Teradata to replace multiple competitor systems. Their integrated data warehouse environment will enable them to gain new analytic insights from their food and nonfood operations to reduce operating costs, enhance supply chains and improve their retail operations.
And that one of the largest global car manufacturers, which is implementing our Aprimo marketing solution to allow their local dealers to participate in marketing activities. By integrating data from the dealers, the companies can create more effective, personalized, marketing campaigns. Customer expansions and upgrades included, Komercní banka, the third largest bank in the Czech Republic, recently added solid state drives to their data warehouse environment. Komercní has transformed itself with a company with no systemized information flow to one that is adept at managing data and saves EUR 19 million as a result. Other EMEA upgrades included Belgacom, the largest telco in Belgium. Centrica, a leading utility based in the UK; BBBA in Spain; and DMD in Norway. Asia Pacific Japan had a very strong quarter and led all of the regions with fourth quarter revenue growth of 20% and 26%, constant currency growth. For the full-year, revenue grew 15% to $378 million and was up 8% in constant currency. New customer wins were at their highest levels since 2004. Fourth quarter new customers included Korea Power Exchange, which is implementing Teradata to improve the reliability of its service and the BII Bank, one of the largest bank in Indonesia, which has installed Teradata and Aprimo to integrate information throughout the company and enhance marketing effectiveness and campaign management. Upgrades and expansions in APJ included Daiei, Japan's third-largest general merchandise retailer, which has now consolidated 300 data marts into it EDW to reduce costs and provide insights into the business.
And at Credit Saison, Fuji Xerox, Nissen Holdings and NTT in Japan. Additional upgrades included China Mobile, and [ph] hung young Securities in China. And MYOB Limited in Australia. Overall, we're very pleased with performances across all the regions this past year. Now I'd like to provide the revenue contribution by each of the industries for 2011. As a reminder, these results are for Data Warehouse only and do not include Maintenance revenue.
Financial services, which includes banks, capital markets, credit card and insurance companies accounted for 28% of total revenue. Communications, which includes telecommunications, cable, e-business and media and entertainment companies finished at 24%; retail was at 16%; manufacturing, 12%; healthcare, 7%; government, 6%; travel and transportation, 5%; and energy, utilities and other, 2%.
Industry growth rates for 2011 rest follows: Financial services grew 21% for the year with all regions growing double digits. We continually align Teradata's solution consulting in our focus with various industry and customer specific parties on an ongoing basis. In the case of the financial services industry, most of our activities have been centered on that industry's top initiative and priorities such as cost reduction, regulatory reform and providing detailed insights across the company around customers, products and risks. Our integrated data warehouse architecture, logical data models and platform family also provide the agility and flexibility for all of the customers reserve to respond quickly to tomorrow's unknown challenges and do it cost-effectively. The communications industry grew 20% in 2011; retail, 15%; manufacturing, 14%; government, 5%; travel and transportation, 10%; and healthcare had a very strong year with growth of 42% with all regions contributing double-digit growth. New regulations and demands for better quality of care at lower cost have accelerated this market adoption of integrated analytic data solutions. Turning to our strategic growth initiatives, it is now been 4 years since we started increasing investments to growing scale Teradata. These investments have helped extend our lead in the data warehouse market as evident in the Gartner Magic Quadrant that was published Monday. And this also helped to drive the record revenue growth and new customer wins recorded in 2011. We have increased the number of our data warehouse consultants by over 60%, the number of partners by 50%, our R&D spend by close to 40% and the number of sales territories from 385 to 520  since the end of 2007. We also made key acquisitions with Claraview for BI Consulting, xkoto to provide the interoperability foundation for our platform family, Kickfire for data warehouse performance acceleration, Aprimo for the integrated marketing management applications, and Software-as-a-Service and Cloud capabilities. And Aster Data for big data Analytics. With these investments and acquisitions over the past 4 years, we have grown our customer base by more than 50%, our revenue by close to $600 million and our market cap has almost doubled. Looking to the future, we are well-positioned in 3 large and growing market: Data warehousing, big data analytics and integrated marketing management, and we will continue to focus investments in these 3 areas. We now have 3 core competencies to address these market opportunities with our consulting and support services, our SaaS, Cloud and applications capabilities and our data warehouse technology including big data analytics. From a business model perspective, our growth in subscriptions, maintenance, manage services and now Software-as-a-Service has increased our recurring revenue mix to 37% and we plan to gradually increase that over time. The explosion of data and new datatypes will continue to benefit Teradata. It is evident in our business today. Just last year, the number of Teradata customers with the data warehouse greater than a petabyte increased by 150%. And the number of 100 terabyte data warehouse customers increased 120% in 2011. Having the right data foundation and data analytics solutions continues to increase as a priority for business. The companies that can manage the complexity and cost from the volumes and diversity of data and extract value from it will have a significant competitive advantage. The leading corporations in the world are gaining competitive advantage by equipping their business with superior and innovative analytics. They are moving to get an integrated view of what's important for success at any given moment, and make it leverageable across the enterprise. Teradata has the best knowledge, technology and people to provide these capability, and we are already doing this today together with our customers. Turning to guidance, we're expecting revenue to increase 10% to 12% in 2012, which includes 1 percentage point of currency headwinds. So we expect to grow 11% to 13% in constant currency versus the 16% organic constant currency growth we have in 2011. As of today, our sales activity and pipeline is very strong and expect to have good revenue growth in the first quarter. Consistent with previous years, as we get more detailed visibility into sales pipeline for the other quarters, we will provide updated guidance in our quarterly earnings releases as appropriate. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share for the year to be in the $2.56 to $2.66 range. Now I will turn it over to Steve, who will provide more details on the quarter to full year and our 2012 expectations. Steve?"

Highlighted by 22% revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin of 23.4% and increase non-GAAP earnings per share by 25%. In addition, free cash flow was greater than $400 million, all by adding new sales territories and the new record number of new customers. The fourth quarter was one of Teradata's strongest. Fourth quarter revenue was $673 million was up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2010, also up 23% in constant currency. Product revenue of $331 million was up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2010, also up 24% in constant currency. Services revenue at $342 million was up 52% of 21% in constant currency.
Within our services revenue, Consulting Services was up 26% and up 25% in constant currency. And maintenance services was up 16% in the quarter and also up 16% in constant currency. For the full year, total revenue was up 22% to $2.36 billion. In constant currency, total revenue was up 19% from 2010. Product revenue for the year was $1.12 billion, up 20% from 2010, up 18% in constant currency. Services revenue of $1.4 billion was up 24% end up 20% in constant currency. Within services, Consulting Services revenue was up 30%, up 25% in constant currency and maintenance revenue was up 17%, up 14% in constant currency.
During 2011, we had a number of special items largely related to our acquisition activity as well as stock-based compensation expense. We have discussed the special items in prior quarters, so I won't go through them today. However, the special items are detailed in the footnotes to oour earnings release for your review and analysis. Additionally, we have reconciliation schedules in our earnings release as well as on our website to show the bridge between our GAAP and non-GAAP results. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 56.5%, up from 55.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in gross margin was driven by favorable deal mix and leverage from increased revenue as well as the improved consulting margins. Gross margins for the was 55.9% versus 56.4% in 2010. The decreasing gross margin for the full year was primarily due to a higher mix of consulting revenue. Product gross margin of fourth quarter was a record for the fourth quarter at 67.9%, up 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010 fueled by a favorable deal mix and growth leverage. Product gross margin for the year was a record 67.7%, a 50 basis points increase on 67.2% for the full year 2010. For both the quarter and the year, revenue from our 2,000 series appliance was approximately 13% of our data warehouse product revenue, in line with our prior expectations of the 10% to 15% range for 2011. Services gross margins in the quarter was 45.5% versus 46.3% in Q4 2010. Services gross margin for the full year was 45.1% versus 46.3% in 2010. The significant increase in Consulting Services revenue changed the mix of our overall Services business more towards consulting for both the quarter and the full year, which naturally comes with a lower gross margin versus maintenance gross margin. Turning to our operating expense structure and on a non-GAAP basis. SG&A expense of $175 million in Q4 2011 increased $33 million from the same period last year. For the year, we absorbed $108 million increase in SG&A and still improved operating margin, 60 basis points. The increase in SG&A for the quarter and the year were primarily driven by the acquisition related impact or effect, increased number of sales territories, increase sales opportunities and increased variable compensation. As we discussed from the previous quarters, we expect the continued to increase our selling expense in 2012 as we incur the full year or annualized cost of the new sales territories. R&D in the in the quarter was $52 million versus $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. As we have discussed for the last few quarters, we are increasing our investments in R&D, in particular through enhancements to our core database technology as well as continuing to improve the capabilities of our product family. For the full year, R&D was $161 million and this compares to $144 million in 2010. For 2012, we estimate that R&D expense should go slightly less than 10% over the prior year. As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D expense for 2011 before capitalization of internally developed software, which is included in the line item additions to capitalized software in the statement of cash flows was approximately $224 million in 2011, compared to approximately $188 million in 2010 or 19% increase. As a reminder, these capitalized software costs are then amortized back to the income statement product cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin. As a result of these items, Teradata's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 22.9% versus 22.8% in Q4 2010. The contribution from higher revenue offset the increased investments in sales related activities and R&D. For the full year, operating margin was 23.4% versus 22.8% in 2010, again, a 60 basis points improvement. Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q4 2011 was 26% as compared to the 27% effective tax rate applied in the fourth quarter of 2010. However, on a full year basis, our GAAP effective tax rate was 27% in both 2010 and 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2011 was approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate. As a non-GAAP pretax earnings were weighted more to the U.S. We expect the effective tax rate to be similar in 2012 with the same 1% differential. Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.57 versus $0.50 in Q4 of 2010. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $2.05 versus $1.77 in 2010. Noncash stock-based compensation expense is included in our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $10 million, or approximately $0.04 per share. For the full year, stock-based compensation expense was $35 million or approximately $0.13 per share compared to $0.09 per share in 2010. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $40 million or approximately $0.15 per share in 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense as well as the full year increase related to adding the Aprimo and Aster Data teams during 2011. As I mentioned earlier, a number of primarily acquisition related items were also included in our GAAP results. These items are described in the footnotes of our earnings release on our website. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and the acquisition related and other special items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.66 in Q4 of 2011 compared with $0.53 in Q4 of 2010, a 25% increase. And for the full year, non-GAAP EPS was $2.32 versus $1.86, also a 25% increase.
We provide these non-GAAP information because we use these information internally to manage the business and compare our results to our peers. Turning to cash flow.
We have a good quarter in terms of net cash provided by operating activities, generating $126 million in Q4 2011. However, this is actually a decline from the $148 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter of 2010 was benefited from the timing of payments relating to Q4 2010 revenue. Payments made within the quarter whereas Q4 2011 was more of a normal cycle of payment activity. For example, January 2012 cash receipts exceeded January cash receipts by approximately $45 million. After $23 million of capital expenditures, which included additions to capitalized software development cost and expenditures for property equipment versus $21 million in the fourth quarter 2010, we generated $103 million of free cash flow versus $127 million free cash flow generated in Q4 2010. During 2011, Teradata generated $513 million of cash from operating activities compared to $413 million in 2010. Capital expenditures in 2011 were $110 million compared to $83 million in the prior year yielding $403 million of free cash flow for the year versus $330 million in 2010. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. Turning to the balance sheet. We had $772 million of cash as of December 31, 2011, an $81 million increase from the end of the third quarter. During the quarter, we used approximately $32 million to repurchase approximately 635,000 shares. During the year, we invested $127 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares. This compares to the $88 million used in 2010 to repurchase 2.9 million shares. Our board of directors approved a new $300 million share repurchase authorization. The prior share repurchase authorization is replaced by this new 3-year authorization. Approximately 25% of our cash balance is available in the U.S., with the remainder being held offshore. With respect to our accounts receivable, days sales outstanding or DSO, was 76 days as of December 31, 2011, compared to 76 days as of December 31, 2010. With respect to foreign currency, to provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential movement on our future revenue, we provided a schedule on our website detailing how currencies move in 2011 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons in 2012. Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of January and assuming the currency exchange rates do not change throughout 2012, we expect currency to provide an approximate 1 point headwind for us in 2012 at similar headwind into Q1 2012. Mike provided our revenue and EPS guidance earlier, but I want to give a little bit more color on some of the specific items. We had another solid quarter in Q4 and we're looking at a healthy pipeline. We are guiding 10% to 12% revenue growth in 2012 or 11% to 13% in constant currency. And as Mike referred to, we are positioned for a good start in Q1 2012. Again, as Mike mentioned, it is typically decays due to the nature of our sales pipeline, we have less predictability into the timing and size of transactions for the other quarters. However, we have better perfect ability, relating to our Services revenue for 2012, which we anticipate should grow in the low double digits under constant currency basis over 2011. Behind aggregate services revenue growth rate, we have anticipated that the maintenance revenue will grow at high single-digit in constant currency, which is similar to 2011's maintenance revenue organic growth rate. Turning to EPS.
Specifically, we anticipate the following: Headwind on product gross margin due to higher cost and increased amortization of capitalized software. To be partially mitigated by our internal initiatives, resulting in approximately one percentage point decline in gross product margin in 2012 versus 2011. Higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% in 2011; g&A expense, to only increased by only approximately 3%; higher selling expense, primarily from the new territories and in 2011 and anticipated to be added in 2012 and higher variable incentive compensation and presale consulting expense from the new territories as productivity improves across all of our sales organization. The effective tax rates for 2012 will be consistent with 2011, which assumes that the federal R&D tax credit which expired at the end of 2011 will be retroactively installed for the full year 2012. Incorporating all of these factors into our EPS guidance, we expect GAAP EPS guidance up $2.27 to $2.37. However, this includes approximately $14 million or $0.15 of EPS of stock-based compensation expense. $2 million, or $0.01 per share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions, $29 million or $0.10 per share of amortization of previously acquired intangible assets and transaction integration costs are approximately $8 million our $0.03 per share. these items may be refined throughout the year. Excluding these nonoperational items, we expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $2.56 to $2.66 per share in 2012. In closing, we are very pleased with our 2011 results. And we are confident in our ability to execute and drive our business model to leverage our opportunities in 2012. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So, the dynamics of what happened is being please demand in existing new territories and we've added over the past 2 or three years, picked up activity pickup and we prioritize a hiring of these ICs and TCs to get some of them align into some of the previous territories, which left some of the new territories we are adding short. The dynamics in this relative to consolidation of territories is really not related competition. It's more related to after territories in existence for 2 or 3 years. You take a look at the yield and the dynamics and opportunities that are going on in the territory and you might find it's more efficient to consolidate to 2 into 1 or 3 territories into 2. And that's just a normal ongoing process that we do all the time. We also have other dynamics or there's mergers, acquisitions that are occurring and a lot of those kinds of things that continually go on. I think this year, not to blow it out of proportion, we have a higher number of consolidation then in the previous 2 or 3 years, simply because we've added so many territories now that are 2 or 3 years old, that you have the opportunity to optimize more than we did in the previous years. The other dynamic is, we're very selective about the people we hire and I'm sure all companies are. But particularly in the case of getting the right account exec, the right client rep, based on the accounts and opportunities at a given territory, we don't rush and pressure ourselves to hit a certain number of territories. We do it very thoughtfully and making sure that we have the right people. Guarded thing I would add is when you look at this year, we have such an opportunity in the additional 135 or so territories that we've added over the past 3 years to go drive more business there. We do want to balance resources to bring it into the company to make sure that we are maximizing the yield and the existing you were territories that we've added along with adding additional territories in 2012. So I would characterize this more as an ongoing exercise to optimize what you have and expand the number of territories as quickly as we can."

But on absolute dollars on the gross profit perspective, it's growing. So you'll continue to see in my prepared remarks I said maintenance would be growing high single digits in constant currency in 2012 and I mentioned the overall Services growth rate so you can do the math and you can just find it provisional services we have anticipated in 2012. On a constant currency basis, we'll be growing greater than the maintenance side. So again, you'll have that distortion and the total mix for 2012 on the services gross margin line."

Teradata ended 2011 with the highest revenue growth ever achieved for a quarter during the past decade. Q4 revenue of $673 million was up 23% over prior years reported and in constant currency. And non-GAAP earni",1973,"Thanks, Gregg, and good morning, everyone. Teradata ended 2011 with the highest revenue growth ever achieved for a quarter during the past decade. Q4 revenue of $673 million was up 23% over prior years reported and in constant currency. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 grew 25%. Product revenue increased 24% in Q4, which was well above the 20% growth rate we have averaged in 2010 and 2011. Services revenue continued its strong growth at 22%, and our non-GAAP gross margin rate improved 70 basis points to 56.5%. 
New customer wins were at record levels in Q4, making this one of the finest quarters ever achieved for Teradata. For the full year, revenue finished at $2.36 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share finished at $2.32. Revenue growth of 22% as reported and 19% in constant currency was, by far, the highest annual growth rate for Teradata.
We were particularly pleased with the growth of our core Data Warehouse business in 2011, which grew 16% net of currency and acquisitions. Our previous highest growth rate was in 2010 when revenue grew 12% in constant currency. 
For the year, we also had a record number of Data Warehouse new customer wins, and Aprimo was close to their all-time record for new customer wins as well. Among the new customers joining Teradata in 2011 were 18 companies that are in the Fortune 500. And finally, our new sales territories finished well above the $120 million revenue target we set for 2011. 
With this increased demand, we chose to add more resources into the existing new territories to capture the revenue opportunity. In addition, we consolidated or reduced some of the existing new territories added from previous years to optimize the return on our investments. As a result, we exited the year with 45 net new territories versus the increased target of 60 we set in July, well above the original target of 30 we set at the beginning of the year.  Overall, Q4 and 2011 were the best quarter and the best year ever for Teradata. 
Turning to the regions. All 3 regions grew more than 20% in constant currency in Q4. The Americas fourth quarter revenue was up 22% as reported and in constant currency, and for the full year grew revenue 21% as recorded and in constant currency to a total of $1.44 billion. 
The Americas set records for new customer wins for the year and in the quarter, including: One of the largest military medical agencies, which is implementing Aster Data to unify and analyze huge volumes of multi-structure, clinical and patient data to improve treatments while reducing the cost of care;  AARP selected Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand to increase coordination of various marketing functions, with the intent of improving their member experience; and at one of the largest financial services companies, which is installing an integrated data warehouse to increase operational efficiencies, better understanding risks and reducing fraud. This customer is also a user of Aprimo. 
MDIC, the Brazilian Ministry of Development and Foreign Trade, is building an integrated data warehouse to get you insights into international trading, internal commerce and the development of the variety of services to promote a more competitive Brazil. Synergistic new customer wins for Aprimo included, with Teradata customers, the American Red Cross, Caesars Entertainment, CBS and the Sports Authority.
The Americas also had strong activity with existing customers such as PepsiCo, where Teradata's becoming the foundation for its mobile business intelligence and geospatial applications, one of the largest mobile providers, which is now using Teradata for their network operations. That's an addition to integrating data from marketing, retail, finance and customer care. 
We now have 2 telcos using Teradata for their network operations, which is a good growth opportunity for Teradata to expand our business with our telco customers. And that one of the largest consumer packaged goods companies in the world, which is expanding its Teradata system to provide additional analytic insights and is expected to reduce out of stocks by 2%, which would increase revenue by $300 million per year. 
EMEA match the Americas with fourth quarter revenue growth of 22% as recorded and in constant currency. For the full year, revenue increased 24% as recorded and 18% in constant currency to a total of $548 million. New customer wins for the year were at the highest level since 2002. 
Fourth quarter new customer wins included one of the leading oil and gas companies in the Nordics, which will use Teradata to analyze seismic data and improve oil recovery. This company will use Teradata analytics to improve extraction levels, just a small increase in oil recovery is worth millions of dollars. This is a significant opportunity for oil and gas companies and also for Teradata. 
Sainsbury's, one of the largest retailers in the UK chose Teradata to replace multiple competitor systems. Their integrated data warehouse environment will enable them to gain new analytic insights from their food and nonfood operations to reduce operating costs, enhance supply chains and improve their retail operations.
And at one of the largest global car manufacturers, which is implementing our Aprimo marketing solution to allow their local dealers to participate in marketing activities by integrating data from the dealers, the companies can create more effective, personalized, marketing campaigns. 
Customer expansions and upgrades included, Komercní Banka, the third largest bank in the Czech Republic, recently added solid state drives to their data warehouse environment. Komercní has transformed itself from a company with no systemized information flow to one that is adept at managing data and saves EUR 19 million as a result.  Other EMEA upgrades included Belgacom, the largest telco in Belgium; Centrica, a leading utility based in the UK; BBVA in Spain; and DMB in Norway. 
Asia Pacific Japan had a very strong quarter and led all the regions with fourth quarter revenue growth of 20% and 26%, constant currency growth. For the full year, revenue grew 15% to $378 million and was up 8% in constant currency. New customer wins were at their highest levels since 2004. 
Fourth quarter new customers included Korea Power Exchange, which is implementing Teradata to improve the reliability of its service; and BII bank, one of the largest bank in Indonesia, which has installed Teradata and Aprimo to integrate information throughout the company and enhance marketing effectiveness and campaign management. 
Upgrades and expansions in APJ included: Daiei, Japan's third-largest general merchandise retailer, which has now consolidated 300 data marts into its EDW to reduce costs and provide insights into the business; and at Credit Saison, Fuji Xerox, Nissen Holdings and NTT in Japan. Additional upgrades included China Mobile, and Jiangxiu Filex [ph] Hung Young Securities [ph] in China; and MYOB Limited in Australia.  Overall, we were very pleased with the performances across all the regions this past year. 
Now I'd like to provide the revenue contribution by each of the industries for 2011. As a reminder, these results are for Data Warehouse only and do not include Maintenance revenue.
Financial services, which includes banks, capital markets, credit card and insurance companies accounted for 28% of total revenue. Communications, which includes telecommunications, cable, e-business and media and entertainment companies finished at 24%. Retail was at 16%; manufacturing, 12%; healthcare, 7%; government, 6%; travel and transportation, 5%; and energy, utilities and other, 2%.
Industry growth rates for 2011 were as follows: Financial services grew 21% for the year, with all regions growing double digits. We continually align Teradata's solutions consulting and our focus with the various industry and customer-specific parties on an ongoing basis. In the case of the financial services industry, most of our activities have been centered on that industry's top initiatives and priorities such as cost reduction, regulatory reform and providing detailed insights across their company around customers, products and risks. 
Our integrated data warehouse architecture, logical data models and platform family also provide the agility and flexibility for all of the customers we serve to respond quickly to tomorrow's unknown challenges and do it cost-effectively. 
The communications industry grew 20% in 2011; retail, 15%; manufacturing, 14%; government, 5%; travel and transportation, 10%; and healthcare had a very strong year with growth of 42% with all regions contributing double-digit growth. New regulations and demands for better quality of care at lower cost have accelerated this market's adoption of integrated analytic data solutions. 
Turning to our strategic growth initiatives. It has now been 4 years since we started increasing investments to grow and scale Teradata. These investments have helped to extend our lead in the data warehouse market, as evident in the Gartner Magic Quadrant that was published Monday and has also helped to drive the record revenue growth and new customer wins recorded in 2011. 
We have increased the number of our data warehouse consultants by over 60%, the number of partners by 50%, our R&D spend by close to 40% and the number of sales territories from 385 to 520  since the end of 2007. We also made key acquisitions with Claraview for BI Consulting; xkoto, to provide the interoperability foundation for our platform family; Kickfire for data warehouse performance acceleration; Aprimo for integrated marketing management applications; and software-as-a-service and cloud capabilities; and Aster Data for big data Analytics. 
With these investments and acquisitions over the past 4 years, we have grown our customer base by more than 50%, our revenue by close to $600 million and our market cap has almost doubled. Looking to the future, we are well positioned in 3 large and growing markets: Data warehousing, big data analytics and integrated marketing management. And we will continue to focus investments in these 3 areas. 
We now have 3 core competencies to address these market opportunities with our consulting and support services, our SaaS, cloud and applications capabilities and our data warehouse technology including big data analytics. From a business model perspective, our growth in subscriptions, maintenance, manage services and now software-as-a-service has increased our recurring revenue mix to 37%, and we plan to gradually increase that over time. 
The explosion of data and new data types will continue to benefit Teradata. It is evident in our business today. Just last year, the number of Teradata customers with the data warehouse greater than a petabyte increased by 150%. And the number of 100 terabyte data warehouse customers increased 120% in 2011. 
Having the right data foundation and data analytics solutions continues to increase as the priority for business. The companies that can manage the complexity and cost from the volumes and diversity of data and extract value from it will have a significant competitive advantage. The leading corporations in the world are gaining competitive advantage by equipping their business with superior and innovative analytics. They are moving to get an integrated view of what's important for success at any given moment and make it leverageable across the enterprise.  Teradata has the best knowledge, technology and people to provide these capability, and we are already doing this today together with our customers. 
Turning to guidance. We're expecting revenue to increase 10% to 12% in 2012, which includes 1 percentage point of currency headwind. So we expect to grow 11% to 13% in constant currency versus the 16% organic constant currency growth we have in 2011. As of today, our sales activity and pipeline is very strong and expect to have good revenue growth in the first quarter. 
Consistent with previous years, as we get more detailed visibility into our  sales pipeline for the other quarters, we will provide updated guidance in our quarterly earnings releases as appropriate. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share for the year to be in the $2.56 to $2.66 range. 
Now I will turn it over to Steve, who'll provide more details on the quarter, the full year and our 2012 expectations. Steve?"

In addition, free cash",2073,"Thanks for joining us this morning. We just completed one of the, if not the, best years in Teradata's history. Highlighted by 22% revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin of 23.4% and increased non-GAAP earnings per share by 25%. In addition, free cash flow was greater than $400 million, all while adding new sales territories and a new record number of new customers. 
The fourth quarter was one of Teradata's strongest. Fourth quarter revenue of $673 million was up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2010, also up 23% in constant currency. Product revenue of $331 million was up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2010, also up 24% in constant currency. Services revenue at $342 million was up 22%, up 21% in constant currency.
Within our services revenue, Consulting Services was up 26% and up 25% in constant currency. And maintenance services was up 16% in the quarter and also up 16% in constant currency. For the full year, total revenue was up 22% to $2.36 billion. In constant currency, total revenue was up 19% from 2010. Product revenue for the year was $1.12 billion, up 20% from 2010, up 18% in constant currency. Services revenue of $1.24 billion was up 24% and up 20% in constant currency. Within services, Consulting Services revenue was up 30%, up 25% in constant currency and maintenance revenue was up 17%, up 14% in constant currency.
During 2011, we had a number of special items largely related to our acquisition activity as well as stock-based compensation expense. We have discussed the special items in prior quarters, so I won't go through them today. However, the special items are detailed in the footnotes to our earnings release for your review and analysis. Additionally, we have reconciliation schedules in our earnings release as well as on our website to show the bridge between our GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 56.5%, up from 55.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable deal mix and leverage from increased revenue as well as the improved consulting margins. 
Gross margins for the was 55.9% versus 56.4% in 2010. The decreasing gross margin for the full year was primarily due to a higher mix of consulting revenue. Product gross margin in the fourth quarter was a record for the fourth quarter at 67.9%, up 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010, fueled by our favorable deal mix and growth leverage. Product gross margin for the year was a record 67.7%, a 50 basis point increase from 67.2% for the full year 2010. 
For both the quarter and the year, revenue from our 2,000 series appliance was approximately 13% of our Data Warehouse product revenue, in line with our prior expectations in the 10% to 15% range for 2011. Services gross margin in the quarter was 45.5% versus 46.3% in Q4 2010. Services gross margin for the full year was 45.1% versus 46.3% in 2010. The significant increase in Consulting Services revenue changed the mix of our overall services business more towards consulting for both the quarter and the full year, which naturally comes with a lower gross margin versus maintenance gross margin. 
Turning to our operating expense structure and on a non-GAAP basis. SG&A expense of $175 million in Q4 2011 increased $33 million from the same period last year. For the year, we absorbed $108 million increase in SG&A and still improved operating margin, 60 basis points. The increases in SG&A for the quarter and the year were primarily driven by the acquisition-related impact or effect, increased number of sales territories, increased sales opportunities and increased variable compensation.  As we discussed from the previous quarters, we expect the continued increase in our selling expense in 2012, as we incur the full year or annualized cost of the new sales territories. 
R&D in the quarter was $52 million versus $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. As we have discussed for the last few quarters, we are increasing our investments in R&D, in particular, through enhancements to our core database technology, as well as continuing to improve the capabilities of our product family. For the full year, R&D was $161 million, and this compares to $144 million in 2010. For 2012, we estimate that R&D expense should grow slightly less than 10% over the prior year. 
As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D expense for 2011 before capitalization of internally developed software, which is included in the line item additions to capitalized software in the statement of cash flows, was approximately $224 million in 2011 compared to approximately $188 million in 2010 or 19% increase. 
As a reminder, these capitalized software costs are then amortized back to the income statement as product cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin. As a result of these items, Teradata's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 22.9% versus 22.8% in Q4 2010. The contribution from higher revenue offset the increased investments in sales related activities and R&D. For the full year, operating margin was 23.4% versus 22.8% in 2010, again, a 60 basis points improvement. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q4 2011 was 26% as compared to the 27% effective tax rate applied in the fourth quarter of 2010. However, on a full year basis, our GAAP effective tax rate was 27% in both 2010 and 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2011 was approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate, as the non-GAAP pretax earnings were weighted more to the U.S. We expect the effective tax rates to be similar in 2012 with the same 1% differential. 
Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.57 versus $0.50 in Q4 of 2010. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $2.05 versus $1.77 in 2010. Noncash stock-based compensation expense is included in our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $10 million, or approximately $0.04 per share. For the full year, stock-based compensation expense was $35 million or approximately $0.13 per share compared to $0.09 per share in 2010. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $40 million or approximately $0.15 per share in 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense as well as the full year increase related to adding the Aprimo and Aster Data teams during 2011. 
As I mentioned earlier, a number of primarily acquisition-related items were also included in our GAAP results. These items are described in the footnotes of our earnings release on our website. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and the acquisition-related and other special items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.66 in Q4 of 2011 compared to $0.53 in Q4 of 2010, a 25% increase. And for the full year, non-GAAP EPS was $2.32 versus $1.86, also a 25% increase.  We provide this non-GAAP information, because we use this information internally to manage the business and compare our results to our peers. 
Turning to cash flow. We had a good quarter in terms of net cash provided by operating activities, generating $126 million in Q4 2011. However, this is actually a decline from the $148 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter of 2010 was benefited from the timing of payments relating to Q4 2010 revenue. Payments made within the quarter, whereas Q4 2011 was more of a normal cycle of payment activity. For example, January 2012 cash receipts exceeded January cash receipts by approximately $45 million. 
After $23 million of capital expenditures, which included additions to capitalized software and development costs and expenditures for property equipment versus $21 million in the fourth quarter 2010, we generated $103 million of free cash flow versus $127 million free cash flow generated in Q4 2010. 
During 2011, Teradata generated $513 million of cash from operating activities compared to $413 million in 2010. Capital expenditures in 2011 were $110 million compared to $83 million in the prior year, yielding $403 million of free cash flow for the year versus $330 million in 2010. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $772 million of cash as of December 31, 2011, an $81 million increase from the end of the third quarter. During the quarter, we used approximately $32 million to repurchase approximately 635,000 shares. During the year, we invested $127 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares. This compares to the $88 million used in 2010 to repurchase 2.9 million shares. 
Our Board of Directors approved a new $300 million share repurchase authorization. The prior share repurchase authorization is replaced by this new 3-year authorization. Approximately 25% of our cash balance is available in the U.S., with the remainder being held offshore. 
With respect to our accounts receivable, days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 76 days as of December 31, 2011, compared to 76 days as of December 31, 2010. With respect to foreign currency, to provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential movement on our future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currencies moved in 2011 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons in 2012.  Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of January and assuming the currency exchange rates do not change throughout 2012, we expect currency to provide an approximate 1 point headwind for us in 2012 and a similar headwind into Q1 2012. 
Mike provided our revenue and EPS guidance earlier, but I want to give a little more color on more -- on some of the specific items. We had another solid quarter in Q4, and we are looking at a healthy pipeline. We are guiding 10% to 12% revenue growth in 2012 or 11% to 13% in constant currency. And as Mike referred to, we are positioned for a good start in Q1 2012. 
Again, as Mike mentioned, as is typically the case due to the nature of our sales pipeline, we have less predictability into the timing and size of transactions for the other quarters. However, we have better predictability, relating to our Services revenue for 2012, which we anticipate should grow in the low double digits under constant currency basis over 2011. Behind the aggregate services revenue growth rate, we have anticipated that the maintenance revenue will grow at high single digits in constant currency, which is similar to 2011's maintenance revenue organic growth rate. 
Turning to EPS. Specifically, we anticipate the following: Headwind on product gross margin due to higher disk drive cost and increased amortization of capitalized software. To be partially mitigated by our internal initiatives, resulting in approximately 1 percentage point decline in gross product margin in 2012 versus 2011. Higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% in 2011; G&A expense, to only increase by only approximately 3%; higher selling expense, primarily from the new territories and in 2011 and anticipated to be added in 2012 and higher variable incentive compensation and presale consulting expense from the new territories, as productivity improves across all of our sales organizations. 
The effective tax rates for 2012 will be consistent with 2011, which assumes that the federal R&D tax credit which expired at the end of 2011 will be retroactively installed for the full year 2012. Incorporating all of these factors into our EPS guidance, we expect GAAP EPS guidance up $2.27 to $2.37. However, this includes approximately $14 million or $0.15 of EPS of stock-based compensation expense. $2 million or $0.01 per share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions. $29 million or $0.10 per share of amortization of previously acquired intangible assets and transaction integration costs are approximately $8 million or $0.03 per share. These items may be refined throughout the year. 
Excluding these nonoperational items, we expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $2.56 to $2.66 per share in 2012. In closing, we are very pleased with our 2011 results. And we are confident in our ability to execute and drive our business model to leverage our opportunities in 2012. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So the dynamics of what happened is being the increased demand in existing new territories, so we'd added over the past 2, 3 years, picked up -- the activity picked up, and we prioritized the hiring of these ICs and TCs to get some of them align into some of the previous territories, which left some of the new territories we were adding short. The dynamics in this relative to consolidations of territories is really not related to competition. It's more related to -- after our territories has been in existence for 2 or 3 years, you take a look at the yields and the dynamics and the opportunities that are going on in the territory, and it's -- you might find it's more efficient to consolidate 2 territories into 1 or 3 territories into 2. And that's just a normal ongoing process that we do all the time. We also have other dynamics or there's mergers, acquisitions that are occurring and a lot of those kinds of things that continually go on. I think this year, not to blow it out of proportion, we had a higher number of consolidations than in the previous 2 or 3 years, simply because we've added so many territories now that are 2 or 3 years old, that you have the opportunity to optimize more than we did in the previous years. The other dynamic is, we're very selective about the people we hire, as I'm sure all companies are. But particularly, in the case of getting the right account exec, the right client rep, based on the accounts and opportunities in a given territory, we don't rush and pressure ourselves to hit a certain number of territories. We do it very thoughtfully and making sure that we have the right people. The other thing I would add is when you look at this year, we have such an opportunity in the additional 135 or so territories that we've added over the past 3 years to go drive more business there. We do want to balance resources we're bringing it into the company to make sure we're maximizing the yield and the existing newer territories that we've added, along with adding additional territories in 2012. So I would characterize this more as it's an ongoing exercise to optimize what you have and expand the number of territories as quickly as we can."

And non-GAAP earni",1974,"Thanks, Gregg, and good morning, everyone. Teradata ended 2011 with the highest revenue growth ever achieved for a quarter during the past decade. Q4 revenue of $673 million was up 23% over prior years reported and in constant currency. And non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 grew 25%. Product revenue increased 24% in Q4, which was well above the 20% growth rate we have averaged in 2010 and 2011. Services revenue continued its strong growth at 22%, and our non-GAAP gross margin rate improved 70 basis points to 56.5%. 
New customer wins were at record levels in Q4, making this one of the finest quarters ever achieved for Teradata. For the full year, revenue finished at $2.36 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share finished at $2.32. Revenue growth of 22% as reported and 19% in constant currency was by far the highest annual growth rate for Teradata.
We were particularly pleased with the growth of our core Data Warehouse business in 2011, which grew 16% net of currency and acquisitions. Our previous highest growth rate was in 2010 when revenue grew 12% in constant currency. 
For the year, we also had a record number of Data Warehouse new customer wins, and Aprimo was close to their all-time record for new customer wins as well. Among the new customers joining Teradata in 2011 were 18 companies that are in the Fortune 500. And finally, our new sales territories finished well above the $120 million revenue target we set for 2011. 
With this increased demand, we chose to add more resources into the existing new territories to capture the revenue opportunity. In addition, we consolidated or reduced some of the existing new territories added from previous years to optimize the return on our investments. As a result, we exited the year with 45 net new territories versus the increased target of 60 we set in July, well above the original target of 30 we set at the beginning of the year.  Overall, Q4 and 2011 were the best quarter and the best year ever for Teradata. 
Turning to the regions, all 3 regions grew more than 20% in constant currency in Q4. The Americas fourth quarter revenue was up 22% as reported and in constant currency, and for the full year grew revenue 21% as recorded and in constant currency to a total of $1.44 billion. 
The Americas set records for new customer wins for the year and in the quarter, including: One of the largest military medical agencies, which is implementing Aster Data to unify and analyze huge volumes of multi-structured, clinical and patient data to improve treatments while reducing the cost of care;  AARP selected Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand to increase coordination of various marketing functions, with the intent of improving their member experience; and at one of the largest financial services companies, which is installing an integrated data warehouse to increase operational efficiencies, better understanding risks and reducing fraud. This customer is also a user of Aprimo. 
MDIC, the Brazilian Ministry of Development and Foreign Trade, is building an integrated data warehouse to get new insights into international trading, internal commerce and the development of the variety of services to promote a more competitive Brazil. Synergistic new customer wins for Aprimo included, with Teradata customers, the American Red Cross, Caesars Entertainment, CBS and the Sports Authority.
The Americas also had strong activity with existing customers such as PepsiCo, where Teradata's becoming the foundation for its mobile business intelligence and geospatial applications, one of the largest mobile providers, which is now using Teradata for their network operations. That's in addition to integrating data from marketing, retail, finance and customer care. 
We now have 2 telcos using Teradata for their network operations, which is a good growth opportunity for Teradata to expand our business with our telco customers. And that one of the largest consumer packaged goods companies in the world, which is expanding its Teradata system to provide additional analytic insights and is expected to reduce out of stocks by 2%, which would increase revenue by $300 million per year. 
EMEA match the Americas with fourth quarter revenue growth of 22% as recorded and in constant currency. For the full year, revenue increased 24% as reported and 18% in constant currency to a total of $548 million. New customer wins for the year were at the highest level since 2002. 
Fourth quarter new customer wins included one of the leading oil and gas companies in the Nordics, which will use Teradata to analyze seismic data and improve oil recovery. This company will use Teradata analytics to improve extraction levels; just a small increase in oil recovery is worth millions of dollars. This is a significant opportunity for oil and gas companies and also for Teradata. 
Sainsbury's, one of the largest retailers in the UK, chose Teradata to replace multiple competitor systems. Their integrated data warehouse environment will enable them to gain new analytic insights from their food and nonfood operations to reduce operating costs, enhance supply chains and improve their retail operations.
And at one of the largest global car manufacturers, which is implementing our Aprimo marketing solution to allow their local dealers to participate in marketing activities. By integrating data from the dealers, the companies can create more effective, personalized, marketing campaigns. 
Customer expansions and upgrades included, Komercní Banka, the third largest bank in the Czech Republic, recently added solid state drives to their data warehouse environment. Komercní has transformed itself from a company with no systemized information flow to one that is adept at managing data and saves EUR 19 million as a result.  Other EMEA upgrades included Belgacom, the largest telco in Belgium; Centrica, a leading utility based in the UK; BBVA in Spain; and DMB in Norway. 
Asia Pacific Japan had a very strong quarter and led all the regions with fourth quarter revenue growth of 20% and 26% constant currency growth. For the full year, revenue grew 15% to $378 million and was up 8% in constant currency. New customer wins were at their highest levels since 2004. 
Fourth quarter new customers included Korea Power Exchange, which is implementing Teradata to improve the reliability of its service; and BII bank, one of the largest bank in Indonesia, which has installed Teradata and Aprimo to integrate information throughout the company and enhance marketing effectiveness and campaign management. 
Upgrades and expansions in APJ included: Daiei, Japan's third-largest general merchandise retailer, which has now consolidated 300 data marts into its EDW to reduce costs and provide insights into the business; and at Credit Saison, Fuji Xerox, Nissen Holdings and NTT in Japan. Additional upgrades included China Mobile, and Jiangxiu Filex [ph] Hung Young Securities [ph] in China; and MYOB Limited in Australia.  Overall, we were very pleased with the performances across all the regions this past year. 
Now I'd like to provide the revenue contribution by each of the industries for 2011. As a reminder, these results are for Data Warehouse only and do not include Maintenance revenue.
Financial services, which includes banks, capital markets, credit card and insurance companies accounted for 28% of total revenue. Communications, which includes telecommunications, cable, e-business and media and entertainment companies finished at 24%. Retail was at 16%; manufacturing 12%; healthcare 7%; government 6%; travel and transportation 5%; and energy, utilities and other 2%.
Industry growth rates for 2011 were as follows: Financial services grew 21% for the year, with all regions growing double digits. We continually align Teradata's solutions consulting and our focus with the various industry and customer-specific parties on an ongoing basis. In the case of the financial services industry, most of our activities have been centered on that industry's top initiatives and priorities such as cost reduction, regulatory reform and providing detailed insights across their company around customers, products and risks. 
Our integrated data warehouse architecture, logical data models and platform family also provide the agility and flexibility for all of the customers we serve to respond quickly to tomorrow's unknown challenges and do it cost-effectively. 
The communications industry grew 20% in 2011; retail 15%; manufacturing 14%; government 5%; travel and transportation 10%; and healthcare had a very strong year with growth of 42% with all regions contributing double-digit growth. New regulations and demands for better quality of care at lower cost have accelerated this market's adoption of integrated analytic data solutions. 
Turning to our strategic growth initiatives, it has now been 4 years since we started increasing investments to grow and scale Teradata. These investments have helped to extend our lead in the data warehouse market, as evident in the Gartner Magic Quadrant that was published Monday and has also helped to drive the record revenue growth and new customer wins recorded in 2011. 
We have increased the number of our data warehouse consultants by over 60%, the number of partners by 50%, our R&D spend by close to 40% and the number of sales territories from 385 to 520 since the end of 2007. We also made key acquisitions with Claraview for BI Consulting; xkoto to provide the interoperability foundation for our platform family; Kickfire for data warehouse performance acceleration; Aprimo for integrated marketing management applications; and software-as-a-service and cloud capabilities; and Aster Data for big data Analytics. 
With these investments and acquisitions over the past 4 years, we have grown our customer base by more than 50%, our revenue by close to $600 million and our market cap has almost doubled. Looking to the future, we are well positioned in 3 large and growing markets: Data warehousing, big data analytics and integrated marketing management. And we will continue to focus investments in these 3 areas. 
We now have 3 core competencies to address these market opportunities with our consulting and support services, our SaaS, cloud and applications capabilities and our data warehouse technology including big data analytics. From a business model perspective, our growth in subscriptions, maintenance, Managed Services and now software-as-a-service has increased our recurring revenue mix to 37%, and we plan to gradually increase that over time. 
The explosion of data and new data types will continue to benefit Teradata. It is evident in our business today. Just last year, the number of Teradata customers with a data warehouse greater than a petabyte increased by 150%. And the number of 100 terabyte data warehouse customers increased 120% in 2011. 
Having the right data foundation and data analytics solutions continues to increase as a priority for business. The companies that can manage the complexity and cost from the volumes and diversity of data and extract value from it will have a significant competitive advantage. The leading corporations in the world are gaining competitive advantage by equipping their business with superior and innovative analytics. They are moving to get an integrated view of what's important for success at any given moment and make it leverageable across the enterprise.  Teradata has the best knowledge, technology and people to provide this capability, and we are already doing this today together with our customers. 
Turning to guidance, we're expecting revenue to increase 10% to 12% in 2012, which includes 1 percentage point of currency headwind. So we expect to grow 11% to 13% in constant currency versus the 16% organic constant currency growth we had in 2011. As of today, our sales activity and pipeline is very strong and we expect to have good revenue growth in the first quarter. 
Consistent with previous years, as we get more detailed visibility into our sales pipeline for the other quarters, we will provide updated guidance in our quarterly earnings releases as appropriate. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share for the year to be in the $2.56 to $2.66 range. 
Now I will turn it over to Steve, who'll provide more details on the quarter, the full year and our 2012 expectations. Steve?"

Highlighted by 22% revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin of 23.4% and increased non-GAAP earnings per share by 25%. In addition, free cash flow was greater than $400 million, all while adding new sales territories and a new record number of new customers. 
The fourth quarter was one of Teradata's strongest. Fourth quarter revenue of $673 million was up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2010, also up 23% in constant currency. Product revenue of $331 million was up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2010, also up 24% in constant currency. Services revenue of $342 million was up 22%, up 21% in constant currency.
Within our services revenue, Consulting Services was up 26% and up 25% in constant currency. And maintenance services was up 16% in the quarter and also up 16% in constant currency. For the full year, total revenue was up 22% to $2.36 billion. In constant currency, total revenue was up 19% from 2010. Product revenue for the year was $1.12 billion, up 20% from 2010, up 18% in constant currency. Services revenue of $1.24 billion was up 24% and up 20% in constant currency. Within services, Consulting Services revenue was up 30%, up 25% in constant currency and maintenance revenue was up 17%, up 14% in constant currency.
During 2011, we had a number of special items largely related to our acquisition activity as well as stock-based compensation expense. We have discussed the special items in prior quarters, so I won't go through them today. However, the special items are detailed in the footnotes to our earnings release for your review and analysis. Additionally, we have reconciliation schedules in our earnings release as well as on our website to show the bridge between our GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 56.5%, up from 55.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable deal mix and leverage from increased revenue as well as the improved consulting margins. 
Gross margins for the year was 55.9% versus 56.4% in 2010. The decrease in gross margin for the full year was primarily due to a higher mix of consulting revenue. Product gross margin in the fourth quarter was a record for the fourth quarter at 67.9%, up 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010, fueled by a favorable deal mix and growth leverage. Product gross margin for the year was a record 67.7%, a 50 basis point increase from 67.2% for the full year 2010. 
For both the quarter and the year, revenue from our 2,000 series appliance was approximately 13% of our Data Warehouse product revenue, in line with our prior expectations in the 10% to 15% range for 2011. Services gross margin in the quarter was 45.5% versus 46.3% in Q4 2010. Services gross margin for the full year was 45.1% versus 46.3% in 2010. The significant increase in Consulting Services revenue changed the mix of our overall services business more towards consulting for both the quarter and the full year, which naturally comes with a lower gross margin versus maintenance gross margin. 
Turning to our operating expense structure and on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expense of $175 million in Q4 2011 increased $33 million from the same period last year. For the year, we absorbed $108 million increase in SG&A and still improved operating margin 60 basis points. The increases in SG&A for the quarter and the year were primarily driven by the acquisition-related impact or effect, increased number of sales territories, increased sales opportunities and increased variable compensation.  As we discussed from the previous quarters, we expect the continued increase in our selling expense in 2012, as we incur the full year or annualized cost of the new sales territories. 
R&D in the quarter was $52 million versus $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. As we have discussed for the last few quarters, we are increasing our investments in R&D, in particular through enhancements to our core database technology, as well as continuing to improve the capabilities of our product family. For the full year, R&D was $161 million, and this compares to $144 million in 2010. For 2012, we estimate that R&D expense should grow slightly less than 10% over the prior year. 
As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D expense for 2011 before capitalization of internally developed software, which is included in the line item additions to capitalized software in the statement of cash flows, was approximately $224 million in 2011 compared to approximately $188 million in 2010 or a 19% increase. 
As a reminder, these capitalized software costs are then amortized back to the income statement as product cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin. As a result of these items, Teradata's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 22.9% versus 22.8% in Q4 2010. The contribution from higher revenue offset the increased investments in sales related activities and R&D. For the full year, operating margin was 23.4% versus 22.8% in 2010. Again, a 60 basis points improvement. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q4 2011 was 26% as compared to the 27% effective tax rate applied in the fourth quarter of 2010. However, on a full year basis, our GAAP effective tax rate was 27% in both 2010 and 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2011 was approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate, as the non-GAAP pretax earnings were weighted more to the U.S. We expect the effective tax rates to be similar in 2012 with the same 1% differential. 
Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.57 versus $0.50 in Q4 of 2010. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $2.05 versus $1.77 in 2010. Noncash stock-based compensation expense is included in our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $10 million, or approximately $0.04 per share. For the full year, stock-based compensation expense was $35 million or approximately $0.13 per share compared to $0.09 per share in 2010. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $40 million or approximately $0.15 per share in 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense as well as the full year increase related to adding the Aprimo and Aster Data teams during 2011. 
As I mentioned earlier, a number of primarily acquisition-related items were also included in our GAAP results. These items are described in the footnotes of our earnings release on our website. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and the acquisition-related and other special items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.66 in Q4 2011 compared to $0.53 in Q4 2010, a 25% increase. And for the full year, non-GAAP EPS was $2.32 versus $1.86, also a 25% increase.  We provide this non-GAAP information because we use this information internally to manage the business and compare our results to our peers. 
Turning to cash flow. We had a good quarter in terms of net cash provided by operating activities, generating $126 million in Q4 2011. However, this is actually a decline from the $148 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter of 2010 was benefited from the timing of payments relating to Q4 2010 revenue. Payments made within the quarter, whereas Q4 2011 was more of a normal cycle of payment activity. For example, January 2012 cash receipts exceeded January 2011 cash receipts by approximately $45 million. 
After $23 million of capital expenditures, which included additions to capitalized software and development costs and expenditures for property equipment versus $21 million in the fourth quarter 2010, we generated $103 million of free cash flow versus the $127 million free cash flow generated in Q4 2010. 
During 2011, Teradata generated $513 million of cash from operating activities compared to $413 million in 2010. Capital expenditures in 2011 were $110 million compared to $83 million in the prior year, yielding $403 million of free cash flow for the year versus $330 million in 2010. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We have $772 million of cash as of December 31, 2011, an $81 million increase from the end of the third quarter. During the quarter, we used approximately $32 million to repurchase approximately 635,000 shares. During the year, we invested $127 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares. This compares to the $88 million used in 2010 to repurchase 2.9 million shares. 
Our Board of Directors approved a new $300 million share repurchase authorization. The prior share repurchase authorization is replaced by this new 3-year authorization. Approximately 25% of our cash balance is available in the U.S., with the remainder being held offshore. 
With respect to our accounts receivable, days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 76 days as of December 31, 2011 compared to 76 days as of December 31, 2010. With respect to foreign currency, to provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential movement on our future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currencies moved in 2011 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons in 2012. Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of January and assuming the currency exchange rates do not change throughout 2012, we expect currency to provide an approximate 1-point headwind for us in 2012 and a similar headwind into Q1 2012. 
Mike provided our revenue and EPS guidance earlier, but I want to give a little more color on more -- on some of the specific items. We had another solid quarter in Q4, and we are looking at a healthy pipeline. We are guiding 10% to 12% revenue growth in 2012 or 11% to 13% in constant currency. And as Mike referred to, we are positioned for a good start in Q1 2012. 
Again, as Mike mentioned, as is typically the case due to the nature of our sales pipeline, we have less predictability into the timing and size of transactions for the other quarters. However, we have better predictability relating to our Services revenue for 2012, which we anticipate should grow in the low double digits on a constant currency basis over 2011. Behind the aggregate services revenue growth rate, we have anticipated that the maintenance revenue will grow at high single digits in constant currency, which is similar to 2011's maintenance revenue organic growth rate. 
Turning to EPS. Specifically, we anticipate the following: Headwind on product gross margin due to higher disk drive cost and increased amortization of capitalized software; to be partially mitigated by our internal initiatives, resulting in approximately 1 percentage point decline in gross product margin in 2012 versus 2011; higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% in 2011; G&A expense to only increase by only approximately 3%; higher selling expense, primarily from the new territories added in 2011 and anticipated to be added in 2012 and higher variable incentive compensation and presale consulting expense from the new territories as productivity improves across all of our sales organizations. 
The effective tax rates for 2012 will be consistent with 2011, which assumes that the federal R&D tax credit which expired at the end of 2011 will be retroactively installed for the full year 2012. Incorporating all of these factors into our EPS guidance, we expect GAAP EPS guidance up $2.27 to $2.37. However, this includes approximately $40 million or $0.15 of EPS of stock-based compensation expense. $2 million or $0.01 per share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions. $29 million or $0.10 per share of amortization of previously acquired intangible assets and transaction integration costs of approximately $8 million or $0.03 per share. These items may be refined throughout the year. 
Excluding these nonoperational items, we expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $2.56 to $2.66 per share in 2012. In closing, we are very pleased with our 2011 results, and we are confident in our ability to execute and drive our business model to leverage our opportunities in 2012. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So the dynamics of what happened is the increased demand in existing new territories that we'd added over the past 2, 3 years picked up -- the activity picked up, and we prioritized the hiring of these ICs and TCs to get some of them aligned into some of the previous territories, which left some of the new territories we were adding short. The dynamics in this relative to consolidations of territories is really not related to competition. It's more related to -- after a territory's been in existence for 2 or 3 years, you take a look at the yields and the dynamics and the opportunities that are going on in the territory, and it's -- you might find it's more efficient to consolidate 2 territories into 1 or 3 territories into 2. And that's just a normal ongoing process that we do all the time. We also have other dynamics or there's mergers, acquisitions that are occurring and a lot of those kinds of things that continually go on. I think this year, not to blow it out of proportion, we had a higher number of consolidations than in the previous 2 or 3 years, simply because we've added so many territories now that are 2 or 3 years old, that you have the opportunity to optimize more than we did in the previous years. The other dynamic is we're very selective about the people we hire, as I'm sure all companies are. But particularly in the case of getting the right account exec, the right client rep based on the accounts and opportunities in a given territory, we don't rush and pressure ourselves to hit a certain number of territories. We do it very thoughtfully and making sure that we have the right people. The other thing I would add is when you look at this year, we have such an opportunity in the additional 135 or so territories that we've added over the past 3 years to go drive more business there. We do want to balance resources we're bringing it into the company to make sure we're maximizing the yield and the existing newer territories that we've added, along with adding additional territories in 2012. So I would characterize this more as it's an ongoing exercise to optimize what you have and expand the number of territories as quickly as we can."

Jeff Cole, [ph] our Canadian insurance company, became our new customer in the quarter as well.

And Liverpool, Mexico's largest department store retailer selected Teradata to improve marketing and operations. Customer upgrades and expansions included Supervalu, which added an Aster Data appliance to their ecosystem of Teradata Analytics solutions. Aster is a complementary extension of their existing Enterprise Data Warehouse and is slated to deliver rapid analytics for large, multi-structured data sets, spanning 8 years of history. A leading U.S. telecommunications company is also adding an Aster Data appliance to analyze clickstream data in order to improve targeted advertising to mobile devices and more rapidly identify potential customer churn. Southwest Airlines, which is leveraging their EDW to help integrate data from its acquisition of AirTran and to help improve forecasting and revenue management. And at Cincinnati Bell, which is now implementing the Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand to improve marketing and its wireline and wireless businesses across both residential and business markets. Other upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Arrow Electronics, Comcast, CBS, Kaiser Permanente, Macy's, Safeway, Unilever, Well Point and Banco Agrario in Columbia.

They will use the data warehouse to enable business users to do their own detailed analytics, and the Aprimo, our relationship manager, to improve marketing campaigns and customer interactions.
Another retail new customer win was Jeronimo Martins, the second largest retailer in Portugal. Jeronimo Martins will now use a Teradata data warehouse to integrate all of its sales, store and inventory data to improve operations and profitability. And the EADS [ph] France, a leader in aerospace and defense, its Airbus military division will use our data warehouse and our manufacturing logical data model to expand mission-critical services such as monitoring the usage and health of its fleet to improve the efficiency of its maintenance, repair and operations activity.
Some of the major upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Repsol in Spain; Aviva, the UK's largest insurer and the sixth largest globally, which is creating a single view of their customers across their general insurance, life and healthcare businesses.

We saw a number of expansions and upgrades across APJ including Toho Bank, Razzano Bank, Yamanashi Cho bank and Club Tourism International in Japan. And in Australia, we have expansion at Telstra and also in government to address health and human services management, tax compliance and defense logistics.
Our strategic growth initiatives have been a key contributor to our higher growth rates the past couple of years, and we'll continue to be a key contributor going forward. Consulting Services revenue grew 15% in constant currency in the quarter, and we continue to add industry and technical consultants to meet increasing demand. We added several new sales teams in Q1, and we're on target to add another 35 to 45 new territories for the full year in 2012. Our number of partnerships continue to increase. In Q1, we added a couple of new strategic partnerships including Norris [ph]  -- a leading cybersecurity company that can now provide real-time security and network monitoring for Teradata customers. And [ph] Kohden the leading contributor and distributor of open source Apache Hadoop. This partnership will allow customers to ingest and transform big data in a Hadoop environment with deep integration to Aster Data and Teradata for Analytics. Lastly, we continue to increase investments in R&D. Recent announcements from Teradata labs included our active data warehouse private cloud, which is based on our 6690 Enterprise Data Warehouse platform. A key benefit of private clouds is to increase the utilization of IT computing resources. This in turn reduces data center footprints and associated costs as well as CapEx and support for hardware among other things. According to industry analysts, on average, the utilization of computing resource is in corporations today is only 20% to 25%, and that includes data marts. Teradata's Enterprise Data Warehouses have been consolidating underutilized data marts for years, integrating the data into a centralized data warehouse that can serve multiple users and organizations. And as a result, most of our customers have utilization rates that are somewhere between 90% to 100%. Teradata's virtual computing and storage software and workload management capabilities allow us to meet the demands of thousands of concurrent users, queries and workload complexities required in a private cloud, as well as providing mission-critical availability on commodity servers and storage. The Teradata active data warehouse private cloud provides significant cost savings, a single version of information for the business to operate from and better information from the integrated data versus data marts silos with 20% to 25% utilization. With this announcement, we have added a significant industry first. We are now providing elastic capacity on demand. Customers can now pay on a used basis for additional capacity as needed to address spikes and demand. We are pleased with the Aster wins we had in the quarter, and also the activity we're seeing in the U.S. and now, internationally. We're making good progress toward the development of use cases, which is critical for the adoption of big data analytics in the mainstream market. We're hosting a series of big data analytics conferences here in the U.S. These conferences are focused on helping businesses cut through the big data hype and leverage new types of data and applications to gain deeper business insights. We held our first event in San Francisco 2 weeks ago and had over 500 attendees. Additional events will be held in Boston, Chicago and New York over the next 4 months. Going forward, Teradata's objective is to provide best-in-class data warehouse analytics, consulting and support to all of our customers and all of their organizations and to do this for all of our customers' data, both structured and multi-structured. In addition, it is our objective to be the best-in-class integrated marketing management provider. A little over a year ago, we acquired the leader in integrated marketing management, Aprimo, and combined it with our Teradata Applications business. We've experienced good success to date and had a strong Q1. Yesterday, we made a significant addition to our integrated marketing management portfolio with the signing of the Definitive Agreement to acquire Munich based, E Circle. E Circle is the European leader in cloud based digital marketing with email, mobile and social capabilities. Forrester estimates digital marketing to be a $6 billion market today growing to $16 billion by 2016. We see a great opportunity for Teradata to go deeper into integrated marketing management along with digital marketing. Marketing organizations have been a leader in leveraging analytics over the years. Today, the majority of our data warehouses are being used by marketing organizations and a good portion of those are using our Teradata Aprimo multichannel campaign management application. But going forward, we believe that marketing will lead the way in most corporations to drive innovation from game changing new analytics with big data. It is marketing that can use and apply the new insights created from social and mobile data to impact the corporations top and bottom line, and it's marketing that will leverage the new channels created with social and mobile to interact with and market to customers.
Forrester estimates that 45% of big data implementations are in marketing. Gartner said that by 2017, the CMO will likely spend more on IT than the CIO. We believe the combination of Aprimo, E Circle, Aster and Teradata provides a great foundation for marketing organizations to reap the benefits from big data and the new channels they bring. We're expecting to complete the transaction in Q2 subject to all regulatory clearances. As I've said earlier, we are off to a strong start in 2012. Longer term, we are well-positioned in 3 large and growing markets: Data warehousing, big data analytics and integrated marketing management. As you look at the remainder of the year, our activity remains strong across all the regions. But we expect our growth, or revenue growth, to increase at a lower rate than we achieved in Q1. We will be going again stronger prior year comparable starting with Q2, and currency headwinds in Q2 and Q3 particularly in EMEA. The net-net is we are increasing our 2012 full-year revenue growth guidance 2 points to 12% to 14%, or 13% to 15% in constant currency. Without the pending E Circle acquisition, our revenue growth guidance will be 12% to 14% in constant currency. We are also increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range $0.04 to a range of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes a penny from E Circle. Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on Q1 and our full-year guidance. Steve?"

Within our services revenue, Consulting Services was up 14%, up 15% in constant currency. And maintenance services was up 11% in the quarter, up 12% in constant currency. During 2011, we had special items largely related to our acquisition activity as well as stock-based compensation expense. We have discussed the special items in prior quarters, so I won't go through the details today. However, these special items are described in the footnotes to our earnings release and are shown in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation schedules in our earnings release as well as on our website. During my discussion today, I will be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin and the first quarter of 2012 was 55.9%, up from the 55.7% in the first quarter of 2011. The increasing gross margin was driven primarily by greater proportion of product revenue. The Americas and APJ regions experienced solid improvement in gross margin, while the EMEA region gross margin declined primarily due to consulting revenues growing faster than product revenue, a well as timing of transactions and deal mix. Product gross margin in the first quarter was 67.9%, up 30 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. This performance mitigated the expected headwind from increased FAS 86 amortization, up prior capitalized software development costs and higher hard disk drive prices resulting from the flooding in Thailand as we discussed last quarter. As a component of product revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q1 was at the lower end of the 10% to 15% range we discussed previously. However, we continue to expect that the 2000 series appliance revenue will be at the higher end of the range for the full year. Since the appliance revenue was a lower percentage of product revenue in the quarter, it provided a favorable mix shift as it relates to product gross margin in Q1 2012. Services gross margin in the quarter was 44% versus 45% in Q1 2011. The decline is primarily due to a higher mix of consulting revenue while operation maintenance margin remained relatively consistent in between quarters. Consulting revenues grew faster than the maintenance revenue, which lowers the overall services gross margins and consulting margins are lower than the maintenance gross margins. Turning to our operating expense structure. SG&A expense of $154 million increased $18 million or 13% from Q1 2011. The increase in SG&A for the quarter was primarily driven by acquisition related headcount and increased number of sales territories. As we discussed in previous quarters, we expect the continued increase in our selling expense in 2012 as we incur the full year or annualized cost of the new sales territories added in 2011 as well as the additional territories we anticipate adding in 2012. We should however, continue to slightly improve SG&A's efficiency ratio described as a percentage of earning. R&D in the quarter was $43 million versus $33 million in the first quarter of 2011. Keep in mind, our R&D spend in Q1 2012 includes a full quarter of R&D spend for the Aprimo and Aster Data while we only had 2 months of R&D spend from a Aprimo in Q1 2011 and the Aster Data transaction did not close until April of last year. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, we continue to increase our investments in R&D, particularly through enhancements to our core technology base as well as continuing to build out our Teradata product family and ecosystem including big data capabilities. For 2012, we estimate that the non-GAAP R&D expense should grow slightly less than 10% over 2011 factoring the full year impact of the R&D expense from the acquisitions. As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D spend for the first quarter before capitalization of internally developed software, which is included in the line items additions to capitalized software under statement of cash flows, was approximately $59 million compared to approximately $51 million in Q1 2011 or 16% increase. As a reminder, these capitalized software costs are then amortizate back to the income statement as part of cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin. As a result of these items, Teradata's operating margin in the first quarter was 23.9% versus 22.7% in Q1 2011. The contribution from higher revenue and favorable deal mix offset the increased investments in sales related activity in R&D as well as the higher FAS 86 software amortization cost and higher cost of our hard disk drives. Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q1 2012 was 28%, the same as it was in the first quarter of 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for first quarter was 29%, again, the same as the prior-year period. We continue to expect our full-year GAAP tax rate to be approximately 27% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly higher, approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate. As the majority of the non-GAAP pre-tax earnings including stock-based compensation expense, the acquisition related special items are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for 2012 assumes that the federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively restated for the full-year 2012 prior to the end of 2012. In terms of earnings per share, our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.53 versus $0.38 in Q1 2011. Noncash stock-based compensation expenses included in our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock based compensation expense to be approximately $0.15 per share in 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense as well as the full-year increase related to the acquisitions made during 2011. As I mentioned earlier, a couple of acquisition related items were also included in our GAAP results in Q1. These items are described in the footnotes of our earnings release and on our website. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.60 in Q1 2012 compared to $0.48 in Q1 2011, a 25% increase. Turning to cash flow, we have strong quarters in terms of net cash provided by operating activities generating $192 million in Q1 2012 versus $106 million in the first quarter of 2011 or an 81% increase. After $30 million of capital expenditures, which includes additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2011, we generated $162 million of free cash flow versus the $79 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 of 2011. The 105% increase in free cash flow was driven by an increase in net income in the first quarter of 2012 as well as the small increase in receivables in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software.
Turning to the balance sheet, we had $978 million of cash as of March 31, 2012, a $206 million or 27% increase from December 31, 2011. Approximately 30% of our cash balance is available in the U.S., With the remainder being held offshore. With respect to our accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 74 days as of March 31, 2012, compared to 76 days as of December 31, 2011. DSO, as of March 31, 2011, was 85 days. With respect to the deferred revenue, deferred maintenance and subscriptions continue to account for over 70% of the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2012. The deferred revenue change from March 31, 2012, versus December 31, 2011, increased as expected over the change from March 31, 2011, versus December 31, 2010, after removing the impact that a Aprimo had on the March 31, 2011, deferred revenue. The Aprimo acquisition closed during Q1 2011. 
Turning to foreign currency. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on our future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currency has impacted the first quarter of 2012 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons throughout 2012. Assuming the currency rates as of the end of April and assumed currency rates do not change throughout 2012, we expect currency to create about approximately 1 point of a headwind plus for a full year-end 2 points of headwind in Q2. Mike provided our increased revenue and EPS guidance earlier in this call. But I want to give a little bit more color on some specific items. We have known the strong quarter in Q1 and our pipeline remains solid. In light of the tough Q2 2011 comparable, particularly in EMEA, when they grew revenue 34% as reported, and the FX headwind in Q2 2012, we are increasing our full-year revenue guidance to 12% to 14% or 13% to 15% in constant currency from our original guidance of 10% to 12%, or 11% to 13% in constant currency. Due to the good start we had in Q1, at approximately 1% of that revenue growth from the digital marketing acquisition E Circle we announced yesterday. Turning to EPS. Specifically, we continue to expect headwind and product gross margins going into Q2 due to higher the stock cost and amortization of capitalized software and are still expected a decline of approximately 1 percentage point for full year 2012 versus 2011. Higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% from 2011 including R&D from the acquisitions. G&A expense to increase in the lower single digits on a percentage basis, again included in the ongoing G&A from that acquisitions. And higher selling expense primarily from the new sales territories added 2011 as those territories anticipated to be added in 2012. And higher variable incentive compensation and presale consulting expense from the new sales territories as productivity improves across all sales are ghettoization spirit incorporating all these factors into our EPS guidance, we are changing our expectations for GAAP EPS to a range of $24 to $2.54. [ph] However, this includes approximately $0.15 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisitions, $0.12 a share of amortization acquired intangible assets, and $0.08 a share of transaction and integration costs. Excluding these nonoperational items, we are increasing our expectations for non-GAAP EPS to a range of approximately $2.60 to $2.70 per share in 2012. To provide further color on EPS growth for the remainder of the year, assuming the midpoint of our 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance, this would imply a remaining 9-month EPS increase of $0.21 when compared to the same nine months of 2011. And expect the majority of increased incurred during Q4 2012, primarily due to the effect of variable incentive compensation program head on our Q4 2012 results. In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start to 2012 and we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute and drive our business model to leverage our opportunities during the remainder of 2012. And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley."

This is more of correlation as it relates to maintenance revenues when you have a strong product revenue growth. However, with the maintenance revenue, our larger Enterprise Data Warehouse customers, as they expand to systems, the pricing of the maintenance on their systems as they get added to is not linear. So although there is a correlation with maintenance with product revenue, it doesn't necessarily grow as the same rate as the product revenue. The consulting, we've take can -- we commented on this before between correlations between holding revenue product revenue and when you break the quarter of Consulting business, approximately 25% of our revenue is a leading indicator, 45% is lagging indicator. So it's been jump along with implementation services and everything else that we're selling as product revenue. But in addition to those to, bucket, if you will, we have 30% of our consulting revenue that's not related to product revenue at all. It's independent. So things like our Managed Services NBI consulting and a lot of other things that we're doing is independent and separate.

We would characterize it as like you said, core to Teradata was the integrated data warehouse and enterprise data warehouse. In a way, it's a no-brainer, it's the best-in-class architecture and reduces a ton of costs by centralizing data that can give better insight into the business when it's integrated from other data across the enterprise and it's also as I discussed earlier about our active data warehouse private cloud, it consolidates underutilized data marts and puts them in one central location to be shared with multiple organizations, multiple users and everything else and drives a higher utilization and as a result, reduces data center footprint and gets a ton of costs down. So for data, that has better value being integrated and for data that is relevant and that should be used to multiple organizations in the company, and Enterprise Data Warehouse is without a doubt, the right architecture. Think of that as a workload. So after workload or data that's used by a lot of people, lots of organizations and shared throughout the company to get higher utilization, lower costs, better information. So what we saw was the workload specific data warehouses or the platform family is -- what we begin to see is workloads such as our Extreme Data Appliance where it's lots of history, if it's archival or regulatory or it's clickstream data from the web that, that data is relevant to less people within the organization. So our 1000 series Extreme Data Appliance, we build something that has lots of storage and have lots of data in it, but it doesn't have a lot of CPUs to serve a lot of users and in effect, we are building a configuration that is a much lower cost per piece of data than an EDW to serve a smaller group of people that are using it. So it's workload specific. So when you look at the Aster Data appliance once again, in a Aster Data plans, you're doing exploratory and discovery types of analytical analysis on big data. And we don't need a mission-critical environment somewhat to the 1000. You don't have the need all the robustness that you would need in an Enterprise Data Warehouse, and you're using it with a smaller group of users. It gets back to the workload that's more specific for a limited number of users and requirements that are in the same as running your company on the data warehouse like our EDWs. Our customers in EDW side need 49s availability, it's mission-critical, the thing is critical. So we continue to slice and dice workload specific data warehouses to address different workloads and different user sets in addition to an Enterprise Data Warehouse that integrate and share data and information across all the organizations that's required because in that environment, that's the lower cost, lower cost solution."

I actually think, I'm thinking through the previous quarters last year and everything. We didn't have transactions quite the size of some of the ones we saw in the previous 4 quarters in 2011. So anyway, that's the answer to that one. I think, the full-year guidance, there's a couple of things going on the currency headwinds if is for real, and some of the prior year comparables are real versus what we had in Q1 as the prior-year comparable, and when you get into certain regions, right? So like in EMEA, the currency headwinds in EMEA in Q2 was 7% and the rest of EMEA made 5% in Q3. When you look at EMEA's prior year Q2, the revenue produced in Q2 in EMEA of last year was the same amount EMEA produced in Q4. This was a huge prior year for EMEA in Q2, 2011. In fact, the revenue growth in Q2 in 2011 was 34%. So what happens is you start to slice and dice this thing, and we get strong headwinds in EMEA in Q2. When you look at -- in EMEA thing is not a macro economic thing or businesses is buying. It's just that we're going to run into a tough prior year comparable in EMEA in Q2 between the currency in the prior year and some currency in Q3. The only other thing we're seeing in terms of softness is in China. So we are very big in the financial services industry in China. We have 12 of the top 15 banks and there we are seeing delays in approvals and a slowdown in the financial services sector in China. We are seeing some, I'm not saying to a great degree, but we are seeing some there. But on the flipside, Japan was off to a really good start in Q1 and activity in Japan is pretty good. We finished the year strongly in Japan. That's kind of the mix of things. The other thing is, when we look at the full year and similar to what we saw, I believe we said on the last call, the services revenue is going to be more in the lower double digits range and that's going to have an impact on the full year."

And some of the early ones that are very hard thing to be around digital marketing optimization, also fraud detection and prevention as well a social network analysis but we're also seeing a trend where people are looking at traditional analytics and how can they add more transactional data in a time series approach to understanding the bigger picture. So people are looking at going from 2 years to 10 years of history and doing analysis on it like they traditionally did to try to gain new insights. It's also, there often that's we're seeing in marketing, there leveraging big data as part of this new digital marketing phenomena that's going on peers if you look at some of the studies put out around impacts to see most. It's understanding the big data phenomenon as well as how to monetize the social environments, and we see that this a big take-up of leveraging this technology that help them better understand how to interact with those clients as well as how to look at that transactional data in its raw form. So those are definitely some of the areas that we see use case was on the Aster front.

Q1 revenue of $613 million was up 21% over Q1 2011 and up 22% in constant currency. This was our highest organic constant currency revenue growth ever achieved in a quarter. Q1 was also the second-largest quarter ever next to Q4 in 2011. Product revenue increased 31% and 32% in constant currency, which set a record for product revenue growth in a quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 25%, and non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% was our second-highest quarter ever. 
Turning to the regions. All 3 regions grew revenue double digits in constant currency. The Americas led the way with $388 million of revenue, which was a 26% increase over our strong Q1 in 2011. New customer wins included BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, which purchased a data warehouse and our healthcare logical data model to use as their foundation for their clinical healthcare analytics, along with our partner SAS. Our activity in healthcare is increasing as these organizations are looking to Teradata for advanced analytics to gain insight into clinical, patient, provider and claims information for better medical outcomes and at lower costs. 
JEVCO, Canadian insurance company, became our new customer in the quarter as well. JEVCO's IT environment had evolved over the years to include many data sources, data marts and also duplication of data. Leveraging our data warehouse, financial services logical data model and our consulting services expertise, JEVCO is now centralizing and integrating data to a reduce cost and provide better information for market development, risk management and operations. 
Cars.com, the leading destination for online car shoppers, also selected Teradata in Q1 as their data warehouse provider. And Liverpool, Mexico's largest department store retailer selected Teradata to improve marketing and operations. 
Customer upgrades and expansions included Supervalu, which added an Aster Data Appliance to their ecosystem of Teradata Analytics solutions. Aster is a complementary extension of their existing Enterprise Data Warehouse and is slated to deliver rapid analytics for large, multi-structured data sets, spanning 8 years of history. A leading U.S. telecommunications company is also adding an Aster Data Appliance to analyze clickstream data in order to improve targeted advertising to mobile devices and more rapidly identify potential customer churn. 
Southwest Airlines, which is leveraging their EDW to help integrate data from its acquisition of AirTran and to help improve forecasting and revenue management. And at Cincinnati Bell, which is now implementing the Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand to improve marketing and its wireline and wireless businesses across both residential and business markets. Other upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Arrow Electronics, Comcast, CBS, Kaiser Permanente, Macy's, Safeway, Unilever, WellPoint and Banco Agrario in Columbia. 
Turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa. Revenue of $136 million was up 9% over Q1 2011 and up 13% in current currency. New customer wins in EMEA included of El Corte Inglés, which is the largest retailer in Spain and is implementing both Teradata's Enterprise Data Warehouse and the Aprimo Relationship Manager. They will use the data warehouse to enable business users to do their own detailed analytics and the Aprimo Relationship Manager to improve marketing campaigns and customer interactions.
Another retail new customer win was Jerónimo Martins, the second largest retailer in Portugal. Jerónimo Martins will now use a Teradata data warehouse to integrate all of its sales, store and inventory data to improve operations and profitability. 
And the EADS France, a leader in aerospace and defense, its Airbus Military division will use our data warehouse and our Manufacturing Logical Data Model to expand mission-critical services such as monitoring the usage and health of its fleet to improve the efficiency of its maintenance, repair and operations activity.
Some of the major upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Repsol in Spain; Aviva, the UK's largest insurer and the sixth largest globally, which is creating a single view of their customers across their general insurance, life and healthcare businesses. This will also enable of Aviva to build marketing campaigns through multiple channels to increase average product holdings across its customer base, run campaigns that enable cross-sell, upsell and retention activities and drive overall revenue growth. Additional expansions from EMEA included Nordia Group, Telenor Pakistan, DHL and Vodafone Spain. 
And finally, Asia Pacific and Japan generated $89 million of revenue in Q1, which was up 20% over Q1 2011 and up 18% in constant currency. Major new customer wins included one of Japan's leading airlines, which will use our data warehouse to integrate customer, operations and fuel data, as well as to merge and analyze passenger name records and weblog data to improve its marketing. 
Another major new customer win was a leading auto manufacturer in India, which is implementing our data warehouse and Manufacturing Logical Data Model to analyze its inventory and more new services to better meet demand and to improve customer satisfaction. We saw a number of expansions and upgrades across APJ including Toho Bank, Resona Bank,  Yamanashi Chuo Bank and Club Tourism International in Japan. And in Australia, we have expansion at Telstra and also in government to address health and human services management, tax compliance and defense logistics.
Our strategic growth initiatives had been a key contributor to our higher growth rates the past couple of years, and we'll continue to be a key contributor going forward. Consulting Services revenue grew 15% in constant currency in the quarter, and we continue to add industry and technical consultants to meet increasing demand. We added several new sales teams in Q1, and we're on target to add another 35 to 45 new territories for the full year in 2012. 
Our number of partnerships continues to increase. In Q1, we added a couple of new strategic partnerships including Narus, a leading cybersecurity company that can now provide real-time security and network monitoring for Teradata customers, and Hortonworks, the leading contributor and distributor of open source Apache Hadoop. This partnership will allow customers to ingest and transform big data in a Hadoop environment with deep integration to Aster Data and Teradata for analytics. 
Last, we continue to increase investments in R&D. Recent announcements from Teradata labs included our Active Data Warehouse Private Cloud, which is based on our 6690 Enterprise Data Warehouse platform. A key benefit of private cloud is to increase the utilization of IT computing resources. This, in turn, reduces data center footprints and associated costs, as well as CapEx and support for hardware, among other things. According to industry analysts, on average, the utilization of computing resources in corporations today is only 20% to 25%, and that includes data marts. 
Teradata's Enterprise Data Warehouses have been consolidating underutilized data marts for years, integrating the data into a centralized data warehouse that can serve multiple users and organizations. And as a result, most of our customers have utilization rates that are somewhere between 90% to 100%. Teradata's virtual computing and storage software and workload management capabilities allow us to meet the demands of thousands of concurrent users, queries and workload complexities required in a private cloud, as well as providing mission-critical availability on commodity servers and storage. 
The Teradata Active Data Warehouse Private Cloud provides significant cost savings, a single version of information for the business to operate from and better information from the integrated data versus data mart silos with 20% to 25% utilization. With this announcement, we have added a significant industry first. We are now providing elastic capacity on demand. Customers can now pay on a used basis for additional capacity as needed to address spikes and demand. 
We are pleased with the Aster wins we had in the quarter and also the activity we're seeing in the U.S., and now, internationally. We're making good progress toward the development of use cases, which is critical for the adoption of big data analytics in the mainstream market. We are hosting a series of big data analytics conferences here in the U.S. These conferences are focused on helping businesses cut through the big data hype and leverage new types of data and applications to gain deeper business insights. We held our first event in San Francisco 2 weeks ago and had over 500 attendees. Additional events will be held in Boston, Chicago and New York over the next 4 months. 
Going forward, Teradata's objective is to provide best-in-class data warehouse analytics, consulting and support to all of our customers and all of their organizations and to do this for all of our customers' data, both structured and multi-structured. In addition, it is our objective to be the best-in-class integrated marketing management provider. 
A little over a year ago, we acquired the leader in integrated marketing management, Aprimo, and combined it with our Teradata Applications business. We have experienced good success to date and had a strong Q1. Yesterday, we made a significant addition to our integrated marketing management portfolio with the signing of the Definitive Agreement to acquire Munich-based eCircle. eCircle is the European leader in cloud based digital marketing with email, mobile and social capabilities. 
Forrester estimates digital marketing to be a $6 billion market today growing to $16 billion by 2016. We see a great opportunity for Teradata to go deeper into integrated marketing management along with digital marketing. Marketing organizations have been a leader in leveraging analytics over the years. Today, the majority of our data warehouses are being used by marketing organizations, and a good portion of those are using our Teradata Aprimo multi-channel campaign management application. But going forward, we believe that marketing will lead the way in most corporations to drive innovation from game-changing, new analytics with big data. It is marketing that can use and apply the new insights created from social and mobile data to impact the corporations top and bottom line, and it's marketing that will leverage the new channels created with social and mobile to interact with and market to customers.
Forrester estimates that 45% of big data implementations are in marketing. Gartner said that by 2017, the CMO will likely spend more on IT than the CIO. We believe the combination of Aprimo, eCircle, Aster and Teradata provides a great foundation for marketing organizations to reap the benefits from big data and the new channels they bring. We're expecting to complete the transaction in Q2 subject to all regulatory clearances. 
As I said earlier, we are off to a strong start in 2012. Longer term, we are well positioned in 3 large and growing markets: data warehousing, big data analytics and integrated marketing management. As you look at the remainder of the year, our activity remains strong across all the regions. But we expect our growth, or revenue growth, to increase at a lower rate than we achieved in Q1. We will be going against stronger prior year comparable starting with Q2 and currency headwinds in Q2 and Q3, particularly in EMEA. The net-net is we are increasing our 2012 full year revenue growth guidance 2 points to 12% to 14%, or 13% to 15% in constant currency. Without the pending eCircle acquisition, our revenue growth guidance will be 12% to 14% in constant currency. We are also increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range $0.04 to a range of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes $0.01 from eCircle. 
Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on Q1 and our full year guidance. Steve?"
97999,184282057,296333,"Teradata Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. We just completed another strong quarter driven by the heightened demand for analytics and business intelligence. This is one of the best quarters in Teradata's history, highlighted by 21% revenue growth, non-GAAP operating",2001,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. We just completed another strong quarter driven by the heightened demand for analytics and business intelligence. This is one of the best quarters in Teradata's history, highlighted by 21% revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%, non-GAAP earnings per share up 25% and 105% increase in free cash flow generated in Q1 versus the prior year period. 
First quarter revenue was $613 million, was up 21% from the first quarter of 2011, up 22% in constant currency. Product revenue of $308 million was up 31% from the first quarter of 2011, up 32% in constant currency. Services revenue of $305 million was up 13%, up 14% in constant currency. Within our services revenue, Consulting Services was up 14%, up 15% in constant currency. And Maintenance Services was up 11% in the quarter, up 12% in constant currency. 
During 2011, we had special items largely related to our acquisition activity, as well as stock-based compensation expense. We have discussed the special items in prior quarters, so I won't go through the details today. However, these special items are described in the footnotes to our earnings release and are shown in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation schedules in our earnings release as well as on our website. During my discussion today, I will be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis. 
Gross margin in the first quarter of 2012 was 55.9%, up from the 55.7% in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by a greater proportion of product revenue. The Americas and APJ regions experienced solid improvement in gross margin while the EMEA region gross margin declined primarily due to consulting revenues growing faster than the product revenue, as well as timing of transactions and deal mix. Product gross margin in the first quarter was 67.9%, up 30 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. This performance mitigated the expected headwind from increased FAS 86 amortization, a prior capitalized software development cost and the higher hard disk drive prices resulting from the flooding in Thailand, as we discussed last quarter. 
As a component of product revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q1 was at the lower end of the 10% to 15% range we discussed previously. However, we continue to expect that the 2000 series appliance revenue will be at the higher end of the range for the full year. Since the appliance revenue was a lower percentage of product revenue in the quarter, it provided a favorable mix shift as it relates to product gross margin in Q1 2012. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was 44% versus 45% in Q1 2011. The decline is primarily due to a higher mix of Consulting revenue while operational maintenance margins remained relatively consistent between quarters. Consulting revenues grew faster than the Maintenance revenue, which lowers the overall services gross margins. And the Consulting margins are lower than the Maintenance gross margins. 
Turning to our operating expense structure. SG&A expense of $154 million increased $18 million or 13% from Q1 2011. The increase in SG&A for the quarter was primarily driven by acquisition-related headcount and the increased number of sales territories. As we discussed in previous quarters, we expect the continued increase in our selling expense in 2012 as we incur the full year or annualized cost of the new sales territories added in 2011, as well as the additional territories we anticipate adding in 2012. We should however, continue to slightly improve SG&A's efficiency ratio described as a percentage of earning. 
R&D in the quarter was $43 million versus $33 million in the first quarter of 2011. Keep in mind, our R&D spend in Q1 2012 includes a full quarter of R&D spend for the Aprimo and Aster Data, while we only had 2 months of R&D spend from a Aprimo in Q1 2011, and the Aster Data transaction did not close until April of last year. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, we continue to increase our investments in R&D, particularly through enhancements to our core technology base, as well as continuing to build out our Teradata product family and ecosystem including big data capabilities. For 2012, we estimate that the non-GAAP R&D expense should grow slightly less than 10% over 2011, factoring in the full year impact of the R&D expense from the acquisitions. 
As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D spend for the first quarter before capitalization of internally developed software, which is included in the line items additions to capitalized software under statement of cash flows, was approximately $59 million compared to approximately $51 million in Q1 2011 or a 16% increase. As a reminder, these capitalized software costs are then amortized back to the income statement as product of cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin. As a result of these items, Teradata's operating margin in the first quarter was 23.9% versus 22.7% in Q1 2011. The contribution from higher revenue and favorable deal mix offset the increased investments in sales-related activities in R&D, as well as the higher FAS 86 software amortization cost and higher cost of our hard disk drives. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q1 2012 was 28%, the same as in the first quarter of 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for first quarter was 29%, again, the same as the prior year period. We continue to expect our full year GAAP tax rate to be approximately 27% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly higher, approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate as the majority of the non-GAAP pre-tax earnings including stock-based compensation expense, as well as the acquisition-related and other special items, are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for 2012 assumes that the federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively restated for the full year 2012, prior to the end of 2012. 
In terms of earnings per share, our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.53 versus $0.38 in Q1 2011. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is included in our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.15 per share in 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense, as well as the full year increase related to the acquisitions made during 2011. As I mentioned earlier, a couple of acquisition-related items were also included in our GAAP results in Q1. These items are described in the footnotes of our earnings release and on our website. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and the acquisition-related items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.60 in Q1 2012 compared to $0.48 in Q1 2011, a 25% increase. 
Turning to cash flow. We had a strong quarter in terms of net cash provided by operating activities, generating $192 million in Q1 2012 versus $106 million in the first quarter of 2011 or an 81% increase. After $30 million of capital expenditures, which include additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment, versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2011, we generated $162 million of free cash flow versus the $79 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 of 2011. The 105% increase in free cash flow was driven by our increased net income in the first quarter of 2012, as well as the smaller increase in receivables in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software.
Turning to the balance sheet. We had $978 million of cash as of March 31, 2012, a $206 million or 27% increase from December 31, 2011. Approximately 30% of our cash balance is available in the U.S. with the remainder being held offshore. With respect to our accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 74 days as of March 31, 2012, compared to 76 days as of December 31, 2011. DSO as of March 31, 2011, was 85 days. With respect to the deferred revenue, deferred maintenance and subscriptions continue to account for over 70% of the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2012. The deferred revenue change from March 31, 2012, versus December 31, 2011, increased as expected over the change from March 31, 2011, versus December 31, 2010, after removing the impact that Aprimo had on the March 31, 2011, deferred revenue. The Aprimo acquisition closed during Q1 2011. 
Turning to foreign currency. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on our future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currency has impacted the first quarter of 2012 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons throughout 2012. Assuming the currency rates as of the end of April and assuming currency rates do not change throughout 2012, we expect currency to create about approximately 1 point of a headwind plus for us for the full year and 2 points of headwind in Q2. 
Mike provided our increased revenue and EPS guidance earlier in this call, but I want to give a little bit more color on some specific items. We have now the strong quarter in Q1, and our pipeline remains solid. In light of the tough Q2 2011 comparable, particularly in EMEA, when they grew revenue 34% as reported, and the FX headwind in Q2 2012, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to 12% to 14%, or 13% to 15% in constant currency, from our original guidance of 10% to 12%, or 11% to 13% in constant currency due to the good start we had in Q1 and approximately 1% of that revenue growth from the digital marketing acquisition eCircle we announced yesterday. 
Turning to EPS. Specifically, we continue to expect: headwind on product gross margins going into Q2 due to a higher disk drive cost and increased amortization of capitalized software, and we still expect it to decline of approximately 1 percentage point for full year 2012 versus 2011; higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% from 2011, including R&D from the acquisitions; G&A expense to increase in the low single digits on a percentage basis, again included in the ongoing G&A from the acquisitions; and higher selling expense, primarily from the new sales territories added in 2011 and those territories anticipated to be added in 2012 and higher variable incentive compensation and presale consulting expense from the new sales territories as productivity improves across all sales organizations. 
Incorporating all these factors into our EPS guidance, we are changing our expectations for GAAP EPS to a range of $2.24 to $2.34. However, this includes approximately $0.15 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisitions, $0.12 a share of amortization acquired intangible assets and $0.08 a share of transaction and integration costs. Excluding these non-operational items, we are increasing our expectations for non-GAAP EPS to a range of approximately $2.60 to $2.70 per share in 2012. 
To provide further color on EPS growth for the remainder of the year, assuming the midpoint of our 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance, this would imply a remaining 9-month EPS increase of $0.21 when compared to the same 9 months of 2011. And we expect the majority of increase to incur during Q4 2012, primarily due to the effect our variable incentive compensation programs head on our Q4 2012 results. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start to 2012, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute and drive our business model to leverage our opportunities during the remainder of 2012. 
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

This is more of correlation as it relates to maintenance revenues when you have a strong product revenue growth. However, with the maintenance revenue, our larger Enterprise Data Warehouse customers, as they expand and add to systems, the pricing of the maintenance on their systems as they get added to and they become larger is not linear. So although there is a correlation with maintenance with product revenue, it doesn't necessarily grow at the same rate as the product revenue. The consulting, we've taken -- we commented on this before between the correlations between consulting revenue and product revenue, and when you break up our Consulting business, approximately 25% of our revenue is a leading indicator, 45% is a lagging indicator. So it's being dragged along with implementation services and everything else that we're selling as product revenue. But in addition to those 2 buckets, if you will, we have 30% of our consulting revenue that's not related to product revenue at all. It's independent. So things like our Managed Services and our BI Consulting and a lot of other things that we're doing is independent and separate.

The way we would characterize it is, like you said, core to Teradata was the integrated data warehouse, an Enterprise Data Warehouse. And in a way, it's a no-brainer, it's the best-in-class architecture and reduces a ton of costs by centralizing data that can give better insight into the business when it's integrated from other data across the enterprise. And it also, as I discussed earlier about our Active Data Warehouse Private Cloud, it consolidates underutilized data marts and puts them in one central location to be shared with multiple organizations, multiple users and everything else and drives a higher utilization, and as a result, reduces data center footprint and gets a ton of costs down. So for data that has better value being integrated and for data that is relevant and should be used by multiple organizations in a company, an Enterprise Data Warehouse is, without a doubt, the right architecture. Think of that as a workload. So it's a workload or data that's used by lots of people, lots of organizations and shared throughout the company to get higher utilization, lower costs, better information. So what we saw with the workload-specific data warehouses or the platform family is -- what we began to see is there's workloads such as our Extreme Data Appliance where it's lots of history, if it's archival or regulatory or it's clickstream data from the web that, that data is relevant to less people within the organization. So our 1000 series Extreme Data Appliance, we build something that has lots of storage, can have lots of data in it, but it doesn't have a lot of CPU to serve a lot of users, and in effect, were building a configuration that is a much lower cost per piece of data than an EDW to serve a smaller group of people that are using it. So it's workload-specific. So when you look at the Aster Data Appliance once again, in Aster Data Appliance, you're doing exploratory and discovery types of analytical analysis on big data. And you don't need a mission-critical environment similar to the 1000. You don't need all the robustness that you need in an Enterprise Data Warehouse, and you're using it with a smaller group of users. So it gets back to a workload that's more specific for a limited number of users and requirements that aren't the same as running your company on the data warehouse like our EDWs. Our customers in EDW side need 49s [ph] availability. It's mission-critical. The thing is critical. So we continue to slice and dice workload-specific data warehouses to address different workloads and different user sets in addition to an Enterprise Data Warehouse to integrate and share data and information across all the organizations that's required, because in that environment, that's the lower-cost solution."

We had a very, very, I would call it, normal mix of transactions in terms of size. I actually think we -- I'm thinking through the previous quarters last year and everything. We didn't have transactions quite the size of some of the ones we saw in the previous 4 quarters in 2011. So anyway, that's the answer to that one. I think on the full-year guidance, there's a couple of things going on. The currency headwind is for real, and some of the prior year comparables are real versus what we had in Q1 as a prior year comparable, and when you get into certain regions, right? So like in EMEA, the currency headwinds in EMEA in Q2 was 7%, and the rest of EMEA did 5% in Q3. When you look at EMEA's prior year Q2, the revenue produced in Q2 in EMEA of last year was the same amount EMEA produced in Q4. This was a huge prior year for EMEA in Q2 2011. In fact, the revenue growth in Q2 in 2011 was 34%. So what happens is you start to slice and dice this thing, and we've got get strong headwinds in EMEA in Q2. When you look at -- and EMEA thing is not a macroeconomic thing our business is buying. It's just we're going to run into a tough prior year comparable in EMEA in Q2 between the currency in the prior year and some currency in Q3. The only other thing we're seeing in terms of softness is in China. So we're very big in the financial services industry in China. We have 12 of the top 15 banks, and there, we are seeing delays in approvals and a slowdown in the financial services sector in China. We are seeing some. I'm not saying to a great degree, but we are seeing some there. But on the flipside, Japan was off to a really good start in Q1. And our activity in Japan is pretty good. We finished the year strongly in Japan. So that's kind of the mix of things. The other thing is when we look at the full year, and similar to what we said, I believe we said on the last call, the services revenue is going to be more in the lower double digits range, and that's going to have an impact on the full year."

The notion of I want to take data out of something that's shared across multiple organizations, I want to go put it in a data mart, whether it's in memory data mart or whatever kind of data mart it is, just defies gravity. You're creating another footprint thing to put on the data center floor. You're adding to your costs. You've got to humans run it and everything else. And I know a lot of our competitors advocate this because they cannot do what we do in an active Enterprise Data Warehouse, which, in effect, has private cloud capabilities.

We're saying lots of good use cases being developed as we deploy Aster into accounts, as also as well as we talk to clients. And some of the early ones that are very hot thing to be around, digital marketing optimization, also fraud detection and prevention, as well a social network analysis. But we're also seeing a trend where people are looking at traditional analytics and how can they add more transactional data in a time series approach to understanding the bigger picture. So people are looking at going from 2 years to 10 years of history and doing analysis on it like they traditionally did to try to gain new insights. It's also a -- they're often -- we're seeing in marketing they're leveraging big data as a part of this new digital marketing phenomenon that's going on. So if you look at some of the studies put out around impacts to see the most, it's understanding the big data phenomenon, as well as how to monetize the social environments. And we see that this a big take-up of leveraging this technology to help them better understand how to interact with those clients, as well as how to look at that transactional data in its raw form. So those are definitely some of the areas we're seeing use case-wise in the Aster front. On the Narus, yes, it's a new relationship. We're finding that a lot of our customers want to leverage the power of the Active Data Warehouse to really look at things that come in and out of their data environment. So they start putting in place to spot fraud or transactional behavior that may be is not a part of the way it typically runs in their business. And they're deleveraging that technology in conjunction with Teradata to spot those kinds of things on people accessing the networks and moving and changing data and leveraging that as a part of their enterprise. Today, it's currently working with Teradata, and we'll continue to look at how we can leverage that across the other platforms."

Q1 revenue of $613 million was up 21% over Q1 2011 and up 22% in constant currency. This was our highest organic constant currency revenue growth ever achieved in a quarter. Q1 was also the second-largest quarter ever next to Q4 in 2011. Product revenue increased 31% and 32% in constant currency, which set a record for product revenue growth in a quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 25%, and non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% was our second-highest quarter ever. 
Turning to the regions. All 3 regions grew revenue double digits in constant currency. The Americas led the way with $388 million of revenue, which was a 26% increase over our strong Q1 in 2011. New customer wins included BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, which purchased a data warehouse and our healthcare logical data model to use as their foundation for their clinical healthcare analytics, along with our partner SAS. Our activity in healthcare is increasing as these organizations are looking to Teradata for advanced analytics to gain insight into clinical, patient, provider and claims information for better medical outcomes and at lower costs. 
JEVCO, a Canadian insurance company, became a new customer in the quarter as well. JEVCO's IT environment had evolved over the years to include many data sources, data marts and also duplication of data. Leveraging our data warehouse, financial services logical data model and our consulting services expertise, JEVCO is now centralizing and integrating data to a reduce cost and provide better information for market development, risk management and operations. 
Cars.com, the leading destination for online car shoppers, also selected Teradata in Q1 as their data warehouse provider. And Liverpool, Mexico's largest department store retailer selected Teradata to improve marketing and operations. 
Customer upgrades and expansions included Supervalu, which added an Aster Data Appliance to their ecosystem of Teradata Analytics solutions. Aster is a complementary extension of their existing Enterprise Data Warehouse and is slated to deliver rapid analytics for large, multi-structured data sets, spanning 8 years of history. A leading U.S. telecommunications company is also adding an Aster Data Appliance to analyze clickstream data in order to improve targeted advertising to mobile devices and more rapidly identify potential customer churn. 
Southwest Airlines, which is leveraging their EDW to help integrate data from its acquisition of AirTran and to help improve forecasting and revenue management. And at Cincinnati Bell, which is now implementing the Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand to improve marketing in its wireline and wireless businesses across both residential and business markets. Other upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Arrow Electronics, Comcast, CBS, Kaiser Permanente, Macy's, Safeway, Unilever, WellPoint and Banco Agrario in Columbia. 
Turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa. Revenue of $136 million was up 9% over Q1 2011 and up 13% in constant currency. New customer wins in EMEA included El Corte Inglés, which is the largest retailer in Spain and is implementing both Teradata's Enterprise Data Warehouse and the Aprimo Relationship Manager. They will use the data warehouse to enable business users to do their own detailed analytics and the Aprimo Relationship Manager to improve marketing campaigns and customer interactions.
Another retail new customer win was Jerónimo Martins, the second largest retailer in Portugal. Jerónimo Martins will now use a Teradata data warehouse to integrate all of its sales, store and inventory data to improve operations and profitability. 
And the EADS France, a leader in aerospace and defense, its Airbus Military division will use our data warehouse and our Manufacturing Logical Data Model to expand mission-critical services such as monitoring the usage and health of its fleet to improve the efficiency of its maintenance, repair and operations activity.
Some of the major upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Repsol in Spain; Aviva, the UK's largest insurer and the sixth largest globally, which is creating a single view of their customers across their general insurance, life and healthcare businesses. This will also enable of Aviva to build marketing campaigns through multiple channels to increase average product holdings across its customer base, run campaigns that enable cross-sell, upsell and retention activities and drive overall revenue growth. Additional expansions from EMEA included Nordia Group, Telenor Pakistan, DHL and Vodafone Spain. 
And finally, Asia Pacific and Japan generated $89 million of revenue in Q1, which was up 20% over Q1 2011 and up 18% in constant currency. Major new customer wins included one of Japan's leading airlines, which will use our data warehouse to integrate customer, operations and fuel data, as well as to merge and analyze passenger name records and weblog data to improve its marketing. 
Another major new customer win was a leading auto manufacturer in India, which is implementing our data warehouse and Manufacturing Logical Data Model to analyze its inventory and more new services to better meet demand and to improve customer satisfaction. We saw a number of expansions and upgrades across APJ including Toho Bank, Resona Bank, Yamanashi Chuo Bank and Club Tourism International in Japan. And in Australia, we have expansion at Telstra and also in government to address health and human services management, tax compliance and defense logistics.
Our strategic growth initiatives have been a key contributor to our higher growth rates the past couple of years, and we'll continue to be a key contributor going forward. Consulting Services revenue grew 15% in constant currency in the quarter, and we continue to add industry and technical consultants to meet increasing demand. We added several new sales teams in Q1, and we're on target to add another 35 to 45 new territories for the full year in 2012. 
Our number of partnerships continues to increase. In Q1, we added a couple of new strategic partnerships including Narus, a leading cybersecurity company that can now provide real-time security and network monitoring for Teradata customers, and Hortonworks, the leading contributor and distributor of open source Apache Hadoop. This partnership will allow customers to ingest and transform big data in a Hadoop environment with deep integration to Aster Data and Teradata for analytics. 
Last, we continue to increase investments in R&D. Recent announcements from Teradata labs included our Active Data Warehouse Private Cloud, which is based on our 6690 Enterprise Data Warehouse platform. A key benefit of private clouds is to increase the utilization of IT computing resources. This, in turn, reduces data center footprints and associated costs, as well as CapEx and support for hardware, among other things. According to industry analysts, on average, the utilization of computing resources in corporations today is only 20% to 25%, and that includes data marts. 
Teradata's Enterprise Data Warehouses have been consolidating underutilized data marts for years, integrating the data in those centralized data warehouse that can serve multiple users and organizations. And as a result, most of our customers have utilization rates that are somewhere between 90% to 100%. Teradata's virtual computing and storage software and workload management capabilities allow us to meet the demands of thousands of concurrent users, queries and workload complexities required in a private cloud, as well as providing mission-critical availability on commodity servers and storage. 
The Teradata Active Data Warehouse Private Cloud provides significant cost savings, a single version of information for the business to operate from and better information from the integrated data versus data mart silos with 20% to 25% utilization. With this announcement, we have added a significant industry first. We are now providing elastic capacity on demand. Customers can now pay on a use basis for additional capacity as needed to address spikes and demand. 
We are pleased with the Aster wins we had in the quarter and also the activity we're seeing in the U.S., and now, internationally. We're making good progress for the development of use cases, which is critical for the adoption of big data analytics in the mainstream market. We are hosting a series of big data analytics conferences here in the U.S. These conferences are focused on helping businesses cut through the big data hype and leverage new types of data and applications to gain deeper business insights. We held our first event in San Francisco 2 weeks ago and had over 500 attendees. Additional events will be held in Boston, Chicago and New York over the next 4 months. 
Going forward, Teradata's objective is to provide best-in-class data warehouse analytics, consulting and support to all of our customers and all of their organizations and to do this for all of our customers' data, both structured and multi-structured. In addition, it is our objective to be the best-in-class integrated marketing management provider. 
A little over a year ago, we acquired the leader in integrated marketing management, Aprimo, and combined it with our Teradata Applications business. We have experienced good success to date and had a strong Q1. Yesterday, we made a significant addition to our integrated marketing management portfolio with the signing of the Definitive Agreement to acquire Munich-based eCircle. eCircle is the European leader in cloud based digital marketing with email, mobile and social capabilities. 
Forrester estimates digital marketing to be a $6 billion market today growing to $16 billion by 2016. We see a great opportunity for Teradata to go deeper into integrated marketing management along with digital marketing. Marketing organizations have been a leader in leveraging analytics over the years. Today, the majority of our data warehouses are being used by marketing organizations, and a good portion of those are using our Teradata Aprimo multi-channel campaign management application. But going forward, we believe that marketing will lead the way in most corporations to drive innovation from game-changing, new analytics with big data. It is marketing that can use and apply the new insights created from social and mobile data to impact the corporations top and bottom line, and it's marketing that will leverage the new channels created with social and mobile to interact with and market to customers.
Forrester estimates that 45% of big data implementations are in marketing. Gartner said that by 2017, the CMO will likely spend more on IT than the CIO. We believe the combination of Aprimo, eCircle, Aster and Teradata provides a great foundation for marketing organizations to reap the benefits from big data and the new channels they bring. We're expecting to complete the transaction in Q2 subject to all regulatory clearances. 
As I said earlier, we are off to a strong start in 2012. Longer term, we are well positioned in 3 large and growing markets: data warehousing, big data analytics and integrated marketing management. As we look at the remainder of the year, our activity remains strong across all the regions. But we expect our growth, or revenue growth, to increase at a lower rate than we achieved in Q1. We will be going against stronger prior year comparable starting with Q2 and currency headwinds in Q2 and Q3, particularly in EMEA. The net-net is we are increasing our 2012 full year revenue growth guidance 2 points to 12% to 14%, or 13% to 15% in constant currency. Without the pending eCircle acquisition, our revenue growth guidance would be 12% to 14% in constant currency. We are also increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range $0.04 to a range of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes $0.01 from eCircle. 
Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on Q1 and our full year guidance. Steve?"
97999,184282057,296682,"Teradata Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. We just completed another strong quarter driven by the heightened demand for analytics and business intelligence. This is one of the best quarters in Teradata's history, highlighted by 21% revenue growth, non-GAAP operating",1997,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. We just completed another strong quarter driven by the heightened demand for analytics and business intelligence. This is one of the best quarters in Teradata's history, highlighted by 21% revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%, non-GAAP earnings per share up 25% and 105% increase in free cash flow generated in Q1 versus the prior year period. 
First quarter revenue was $613 million, was up 21% from the first quarter of 2011, up 22% in constant currency. Product revenue of $308 million was up 31% from the first quarter of 2011, up 32% in constant currency. Services revenue of $305 million was up 13%, up 14% in constant currency. Within our services revenue, Consulting Services was up 14%, up 15% in constant currency. And Maintenance Services was up 11% in the quarter, up 12% in constant currency. 
During 2011, we had special items largely related to our acquisition activity, as well as stock-based compensation expense. We have discussed the special items in prior quarters, so I won't go through the details today. However, these special items are described in the footnotes to our earnings release and are shown in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation schedules in our earnings release as well as on our website. During my discussion today, I will be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis. 
Gross margin in the first quarter of 2012 was 55.9%, up from the 55.7% in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by a greater proportion of product revenue. The Americas and APJ regions experienced solid improvement in gross margin while the EMEA region gross margin declined primarily due to consulting revenues growing faster than the product revenue, as well as timing of transactions and deal mix. Product gross margin in the first quarter was 67.9%, up 30 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. This performance mitigated the expected headwind from increased FAS 86 amortization, a prior capitalized software development cost and the higher hard disk drive prices resulting from the flooding in Thailand, as we discussed last quarter. 
As a component of product revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q1 was at the lower end of the 10% to 15% range we discussed previously. However, we continue to expect that the 2000 series appliance revenue will be at the higher end of the range for the full year. Since the appliance revenue was a lower percentage of product revenue in the quarter, it provided a favorable mix shift as it relates to product gross margin in Q1 2012. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was 44% versus 45% in Q1 2011. The decline is primarily due to a higher mix of Consulting revenue while operational maintenance margins remained relatively consistent between quarters. Consulting revenues grew faster than the Maintenance revenue, which lowers the overall services gross margins since Consulting margins are lower than the Maintenance gross margins. 
Turning to our operating expense structure. SG&A expense of $154 million increased $18 million or 13% from Q1 2011. The increase in SG&A for the quarter was primarily driven by acquisition-related headcount and the increased number of sales territories. As we discussed in previous quarters, we expect a continued increase in our selling expense in 2012 as we incur the full year or annualized cost of the new sales territories added in 2011, as well as the additional territories we anticipate adding in 2012. We should however, continue to slightly improve SG&A's efficiency ratio described as a percentage of earning. 
R&D in the quarter was $43 million versus $33 million in the first quarter of 2011. Keep in mind, our R&D spend in Q1 2012 includes a full quarter of R&D spend for the Aprimo and Aster Data, while we only had 2 months of R&D spend from a Aprimo in Q1 2011, and the Aster Data transaction did not close until April of last year. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, we continue to increase our investments in R&D, particularly through enhancements to our core technology base, as well as continuing to build out our Teradata product family and ecosystem including big data capabilities. For 2012, we estimate that the non-GAAP R&D expense should grow slightly less than 10% over 2011, factoring in the full year impact of the R&D expense from the acquisitions. 
As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D spend for the first quarter before capitalization of internally developed software, which is included in the line items additions to capitalized software on the statement of cash flows, was approximately $59 million compared to approximately $51 million in Q1 2011 or a 16% increase. As a reminder, these capitalized software costs are then amortized back to the income statement as product cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin. As a result of these items, Teradata's operating margin in the first quarter was 23.9% versus 22.7% in Q1 2011. The contribution from higher revenue and favorable deal mix offset the increased investments in sales-related activities in R&D, as well as the higher FAS 86 software amortization cost and higher cost of our hard disk drives. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q1 2012 was 28%, the same as in the first quarter of 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for first quarter was 29%, again, the same as the prior year period. We continue to expect our full year GAAP tax rate to be approximately 27% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly higher, approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate as the majority of the non-GAAP pre-tax earnings including stock-based compensation expense, as well as acquisition-related and other special items, are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for 2012 assumes that the federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively restated for the full year 2012, prior to the end of 2012. 
In terms of earnings per share, our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.53 versus $0.38 in Q1 2011. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is included in our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.15 per share in 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense, as well as the full year increase related to the acquisitions made during 2011. As I mentioned earlier, a couple of acquisition-related items were also included in our GAAP results in Q1. These items are described in the footnotes of our earnings release and on our website. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and the acquisition-related items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.60 in Q1 2012 compared to $0.48 in Q1 2011, a 25% increase. 
Turning to cash flow. We had a strong quarter in terms of net cash provided by operating activities, generating $192 million in Q1 2012 versus $106 million in the first quarter of 2011 or an 81% increase. After $30 million of capital expenditures, which include additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment, versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2011, we generated $162 million of free cash flow versus the $79 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 of 2011. The 105% increase in free cash flow was driven by our increased net income in the first quarter of 2012, as well as the smaller increase in receivables in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software.
Turning to the balance sheet. We had $978 million of cash as of March 31, 2012, a $206 million or 27% increase from December 31, 2011. Approximately 30% of our cash balance is available in the U.S. with the remainder being held offshore. With respect to our accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 74 days as of March 31, 2012, compared to 76 days as of December 31, 2011. DSO as of March 31, 2011, was 85 days. With respect to the deferred revenue, deferred maintenance and subscriptions continue to account for over 70% of the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2012. The deferred revenue change from March 31, 2012, versus December 31, 2011, increased as expected over the change from March 31, 2011, versus December 31, 2010, after removing the impact that Aprimo had on the March 31, 2011, deferred revenue. The Aprimo acquisition closed during Q1 2011. 
Turning to foreign currency. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on our future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currency has impacted the first quarter of 2012 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons throughout 2012. Assuming the currency rates as of the end of April and assume currency rates do not change throughout 2012, we expect currency to create about approximately 1 point of a headwind for us for the full year and 2 points of headwind in Q2. 
Mike provided our increased revenue and EPS guidance earlier in this call, but I want to give a little more color on some specific items. We had another strong quarter in Q1, and our pipeline remains solid. In light of the tough Q2 2011 comparable, particularly in EMEA, when they grew revenue 34% as reported, and the FX headwind in Q2 2012, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to 12% to 14%, or 13% to 15% in constant currency, from our original guidance of 10% to 12%, or 11% to 13% in constant currency due to the good start we had in Q1 and approximately 1% of that revenue growth from the digital marketing acquisition eCircle we announced yesterday. 
Turning to EPS. Specifically, we continue to expect: headwind on product gross margins going into Q2 due to a higher disk drive cost and increased amortization of capitalized software, and we still expect it to decline approximately 1 percentage point for full year 2012 versus 2011; higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% from 2011, including R&D from the acquisitions; G&A expense to increase in the low single digits on a percentage basis, again included in the ongoing G&A from the acquisitions; and higher selling expense, primarily from the new sales territories added in 2011 as those territories anticipated to be added in 2012 and higher variable incentive compensation and presale consulting expense from the new sales territories as productivity improves across all sales organizations. 
Incorporating all these factors into our EPS guidance, we are changing our expectations for GAAP EPS to a range of $2.24 to $2.34. However, this includes approximately $0.15 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisitions, $0.12 a share of amortization acquired in tangible assets and $0.08 a share of transaction and integration costs. Excluding these non-operational items, we are increasing our expectations for non-GAAP EPS to a range of approximating $2.60 to $2.70 per share in 2012. 
To provide further color around EPS growth for the remainder of the year, assuming the midpoint of our 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance, this would imply a remaining 9-month EPS increase of $0.21 when compared to the same 9 months of 2011. And we expect the majority of the increase to incur during Q4 2012, primarily due to the effect our variable incentive compensation programs head on our Q4 2012 results. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start to 2012, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute and drive our business model to leverage our opportunities during the remainder of 2012. 
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

There’s more of correlation as it relates to maintenance revenues when you have a strong product revenue growth. However, with the maintenance revenue, our larger Enterprise Data Warehouse customers, as they expand and add to systems, the pricing of the maintenance on those systems as they get added to and they become larger is not linear. So although there is a correlation with maintenance with product revenue, it doesn't necessarily grow at the same rate as the product revenue. The consulting, we've taken – we’ve commented on this before between the correlations between consulting revenue and product revenue, and when you break apart our Consulting business, approximately 25% of our revenue is a leading indicator, 45% is a lagging indicator. So it's being dragged along with implementation services and everything else that we're selling as product revenue. But in addition to those 2 buckets, if you will, we have 30% of our consulting revenue that's not related to product revenue at all. It's independent. So things like our Managed Services and our BI Consulting and a lot of other things that we're doing is independent and separate.

The way we would characterize it is, like you said, core to Teradata was the integrated data warehouse, an Enterprise Data Warehouse. And in a way, it's a no-brainer, it's a best-in-class architecture and reduces a ton of cost by centralizing data that can give better insight into the business when it's integrated from other data across the enterprise. And it also, as I discussed earlier about our Active Data Warehouse Private Cloud, it consolidates underutilized data marts and puts them in one central location to be shared with multiple organizations, multiple users and everything else and drives a higher utilization, and as a result, reduces data center footprint and gets a ton of costs down. So for data that has better value being integrated and for data that is relevant and should be used by multiple organizations in a company, an Enterprise Data Warehouse is, without a doubt, the right architecture. Think of that as a workload. So it's a workload or data that's used by lots of people, lots of organizations and shared throughout the company to get higher utilization, lower costs, better information. So what we saw with the workload-specific data warehouses or the platform family is -- what we began to see is there's workloads such as our Extreme Data Appliance where it's lots of history, if it's archival or regulatory or it's clickstream data from the web that, that data is relevant to less people within the organization. So our 1000 series Extreme Data Appliance, we build something that has lots of storage, can have lots of data in it, but it doesn't have a lot of CPU to serve a lot of users, and in effect, we’re building a configuration that is a much lower cost per piece of data than an EDW to serve a smaller group of people that are using it. So it's workload-specific. So when you look at the Aster Data Appliance once again, in Aster Data Appliance, you're doing exploratory and discovery types of analytical analysis on big data. And you don't need a mission-critical environment similar to the 1000. You don't need all the robustness that you need in an Enterprise Data Warehouse, and you're using it with a smaller group of users. So it gets back to a workload that's more specific for a limited number of users and requirements that aren't the same as running your company on the data warehouse like our EDWs. Our customers in EDW’s side need 49s [ph] availability. It's mission-critical. The thing is critical. So we continue to slice and dice workload-specific data warehouses to address different workloads and different user sets in addition to an Enterprise Data Warehouse to integrate and share data and information across all the organizations that's required, because in that environment, that's the lower-cost solution."

We had a very, very, I would call it, normal mix of transactions in terms of size. I actually think we -- I'm thinking through the previous quarters last year and everything. We didn't have transactions quite the size of some of the ones we saw in the previous 4 quarters in 2011. So anyway, that's the answer to that one. I think on the full-year guidance, there's a couple of things going on. The currency headwind is for real, and some of the prior year comparables are real versus what we had in Q1 as a prior year comparable, and when you get into certain regions, right? So like in EMEA, the currency headwinds in EMEA in Q2 were 7%, and they’re estimated at 5% in Q3. When you look at EMEA's prior year Q2, the revenue produced in Q2 in EMEA of last year was the same amount EMEA produced in Q4. This was a huge prior year for EMEA in Q2 2011. In fact, the revenue growth in Q2 in 2011 was 34%. So what happens is you start to slice and dice this thing, and we've got get strong headwinds in EMEA in Q2. When you look at – and the EMEA thing is not a macroeconomic thing our business is fine. It's just we're going to run into a tough prior year comparable in EMEA in Q2 between the currency and the prior year and some currency in Q3. The only other thing we're seeing in terms of softness is in China. So we're very big in the financial services industry in China. We have 12 of the top 15 banks, and there, we are seeing delays in approvals and a slowdown in the financial services sector in China. We are seeing some. I'm not saying to a great degree, but we are seeing some there. But on the flipside, Japan we’re off to a really good start in Q1. And our activity in Japan is pretty good. We finished the year strongly in Japan. So that's kind of the mix of things. The other thing is when we look at the full year, and similar to what we said, I believe we said on the last call, the services revenue is going to be more in the lower double digits range, and that's going to have an impact on the full year."

We're seeing lots of good use cases being developed as we deploy Aster into accounts, as also as well as we talk to clients. And some of the early ones that are very hot thing to be around, digital marketing optimization, also fraud detection and prevention, as well a social network analysis. But we're also seeing a trend where people are looking at traditional analytics and how can they add more transactional data in a time series approach to understanding the bigger picture. So people are looking at going from 2 years to 10 years of history and doing analysis on it like they traditionally did to try to gain new insights. It's also a -- very often we're seeing in marketing they're leveraging big data as a part of this new digital marketing phenomenon that's going on. So if you look at some of the studies put out around impacts to CMOs, it's understanding the big data phenomenon, as well as how to monetize the social environments. And we see that as a big take-up of leveraging this technology to help them better understand how to interact with those clients, as well as how to look at that transactional data in its raw form. So those are definitely some of the areas we're seeing use case-wise in the Aster front. On the Narus, yes, it's a new relationship. We're finding that a lot of our customers want to leverage the power of the Active Data Warehouse to really look at things that come in and out of their data environment. So they start putting rules in place to spot fraud or transactional behavior that may be is not a part of the way it typically runs in their business. And they're leveraging that technology in conjunction with Teradata to spot those kinds of things on people entering and accessing the networks and moving and changing data and leveraging that as a part of their enterprise. Today, it's currently working with Teradata, and we'll continue to look at how we can leverage that across the other platforms."

This was our highest organic constant currency revenue",1913,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We were pleased to get off to another strong start again in 2012. Q1 revenue of $613 million was up 21% over Q1 2011 and up 22% in constant currency. This was our highest organic constant currency revenue growth ever achieved in a quarter. Q1 was also the second-largest quarter ever next to Q4 in 2011. Product revenue increased 31% and 32% in constant currency, which set a record for product revenue growth in a quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 25%, and non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% was our second-highest quarter ever. 
Turning to the regions. All 3 regions grew revenue double digits in constant currency. The Americas led the way with $388 million of revenue, which was a 26% increase over our strong Q1 in 2011. New customer wins included BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, which purchased a data warehouse and our healthcare logical data model to use as their foundation for their clinical healthcare analytics, along with our partner SAS. Our activity in healthcare is increasing as these organizations are looking to Teradata for advanced analytics to gain insight into clinical, patient, provider and claims information for better medical outcomes and at lower costs. 
JEVCO, a Canadian insurance company, became a new customer in the quarter as well. JEVCO's IT environment had evolved over the years to include many data sources, data marts and also duplication of data. Leveraging our data warehouse, financial services logical data model and our consulting services expertise, JEVCO is now centralizing and integrating data to a reduce cost and provide better information for market development, risk management and operations. 
Cars.com, the leading destination for online car shoppers, also selected Teradata in Q1 as their data warehouse provider. And Liverpool, Mexico's largest department store retailer selected Teradata to improve marketing and operations. 
Customer upgrades and expansions included Supervalu, which added an Aster Data Appliance to their ecosystem of Teradata Analytics solutions. Aster is a complementary extension of their existing Enterprise Data Warehouse and is slated to deliver rapid analytics for large, multi-structured data sets, spanning 8 years of history. A leading U.S. telecommunications company is also adding an Aster Data Appliance to analyze clickstream data in order to improve targeted advertising to mobile devices and more rapidly identify potential customer churn. 
Southwest Airlines, which is leveraging their EDW to help integrate data from its acquisition of AirTran and to help improve forecasting and revenue management. And at Cincinnati Bell, which is now implementing the Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand to improve marketing in its wireline and wireless businesses across both residential and business markets. Other upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Arrow Electronics, Comcast, CBS, Kaiser Permanente, Macy's, Safeway, Unilever, WellPoint and Banco Agrario in Columbia. 
Turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa. Revenue of $136 million was up 9% over Q1 2011 and up 13% in constant currency. New customer wins in EMEA included El Corte Inglés, which is the largest retailer in Spain and is implementing both Teradata's Enterprise Data Warehouse and the Aprimo Relationship Manager. They will use the data warehouse to enable business users to do their own detailed analytics and the Aprimo Relationship Manager to improve marketing campaigns and customer interactions.
Another retail new customer win was Jerónimo Martins, the second largest retailer in Portugal. Jerónimo Martins will now use a Teradata data warehouse to integrate all of its sales, store and inventory data to improve operations and profitability. 
And the EADS France, a leader in aerospace and defense, its Airbus Military division will use our data warehouse and our Manufacturing Logical Data Model to expand mission-critical services such as monitoring the usage and health of its fleet to improve the efficiency of its maintenance, repair and operations activity.
Some of the major upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Repsol in Spain; Aviva, the UK's largest insurer and the sixth largest globally, which is creating a single view of their customers across their general insurance, life and healthcare businesses. This will also enable of Aviva to build marketing campaigns through multiple channels to increase average product holdings across its customer base, run campaigns that enable cross-sell, upsell and retention activities and drive overall revenue growth. Additional expansions from EMEA included Nordia Group, Telenor Pakistan, DHL and Vodafone Spain. 
And finally, Asia Pacific and Japan generated $89 million of revenue in Q1, which was up 20% over Q1 2011 and up 18% in constant currency. Major new customer wins included one of Japan's leading airlines, which will use our data warehouse to integrate customer, operations and fuel data, as well as to merge and analyze passenger name records and weblog data to improve its marketing. 
Another major new customer win was a leading auto manufacturer in India, which is implementing our data warehouse and Manufacturing Logical Data Model to analyze its inventory and more new services to better meet demand and to improve customer satisfaction. We saw a number of expansions and upgrades across APJ including Toho Bank, Resona Bank, Yamanashi Chuo Bank and Club Tourism International in Japan. And in Australia, we have expansion at Telstra and also in government to address health and human services management, tax compliance and defense logistics.
Our strategic growth initiatives have been a key contributor to our higher growth rates the past couple of years, and we'll continue to be a key contributor going forward. Consulting Services revenue grew 15% in constant currency in the quarter, and we continue to add industry and technical consultants to meet increasing demand. We added several new sales teams in Q1, and we're on target to add another 35 to 45 new territories for the full year in 2012. 
Our number of partnerships continues to increase. In Q1, we added a couple of new strategic partnerships including Narus, a leading cybersecurity company that can now provide real-time security and network monitoring for Teradata customers, and Hortonworks, the leading contributor and distributor of open source Apache Hadoop. This partnership will allow customers to ingest and transform big data in a Hadoop environment with deep integration to Aster Data and Teradata for analytics. 
Last, we continue to increase investments in R&D. Recent announcements from Teradata labs included our Active Data Warehouse Private Cloud, which is based on our 6690 Enterprise Data Warehouse platform. A key benefit of private clouds is to increase the utilization of IT computing resources. This, in turn, reduces data center footprints and associated costs, as well as CapEx and support for hardware, among other things. According to industry analysts, on average, the utilization of computing resources in corporations today is only 20% to 25%, and that includes data marts. 
Teradata's Enterprise Data Warehouses have been consolidating underutilized data marts for years, integrating the data in those centralized data warehouse that can serve multiple users and organizations. And as a result, most of our customers have utilization rates that are somewhere between 90% to 100%. Teradata's virtual computing and storage software and workload management capabilities allow us to meet the demands of thousands of concurrent users, queries and workload complexities required in a private cloud, as well as providing mission-critical availability on commodity servers and storage. 
The Teradata Active Data Warehouse Private Cloud provides significant cost savings, a single version of information for the business to operate from and better information from the integrated data versus data mart silos with 20% to 25% utilization. With this announcement, we have added a significant industry first. We are now providing elastic capacity on demand. Customers can now pay on a use basis for additional capacity as needed to address spikes and demand. 
We are pleased with the Aster wins we had in the quarter and also the activity we're seeing in the U.S., and now, internationally. We're making good progress for the development of use cases, which is critical for the adoption of big data analytics in the mainstream market. We are hosting a series of big data analytics conferences here in the U.S. These conferences are focused on helping businesses cut through the big data hype and leverage new types of data and applications to gain deeper business insights. We held our first event in San Francisco 2 weeks ago and had over 500 attendees. Additional events will be held in Boston, Chicago and New York over the next 4 months. 
Going forward, Teradata's objective is to provide best-in-class data warehouse analytics, consulting and support to all of our customers and all of their organizations and to do this for all of our customers' data, both structured and multi-structured. In addition, it is our objective to be the best-in-class integrated marketing management provider. 
A little over a year ago, we acquired the leader in integrated marketing management, Aprimo, and combined it with our Teradata Applications business. We have experienced good success to date and had a strong Q1. Yesterday, we made a significant addition to our integrated marketing management portfolio with the signing of the Definitive Agreement to acquire Munich-based eCircle. eCircle is the European leader in cloud based digital marketing with email, mobile and social capabilities. 
Forrester estimates digital marketing to be a $6 billion market today growing to $16 billion by 2016. We see a great opportunity for Teradata to go deeper into integrated marketing management along with digital marketing. Marketing organizations have been a leader in leveraging analytics over the years. Today, the majority of our data warehouses are being used by marketing organizations, and a good portion of those are using our Teradata Aprimo multi-channel campaign management application. But going forward, we believe that marketing will lead the way in most corporations to drive innovation from game-changing, new analytics with big data. It is marketing that can use and apply the new insights created from social and mobile data to impact the corporations top and bottom line, and it's marketing that will leverage the new channels created with social and mobile to interact with and market to customers.
Forrester estimates that 45% of big data implementations are in marketing. Gartner said that by 2017, the CMO will likely spend more on IT than the CIO. We believe the combination of Aprimo, eCircle, Aster and Teradata provides a great foundation for marketing organizations to reap the benefits from big data and the new channels they bring. We're expecting to complete the transaction in Q2 subject to all regulatory clearances. 
As I said earlier, we are off to a strong start in 2012. Longer term, we are well positioned in 3 large and growing markets: data warehousing, big data analytics and integrated marketing management. As we look at the remainder of the year, our activity remains strong across all the regions. But we expect our growth, or revenue growth, to increase at a lower rate than we achieved in Q1. We will be going against stronger prior year comparable starting with Q2 and currency headwinds in Q2 and Q3, particularly in EMEA. The net-net is we are increasing our 2012 full year revenue growth guidance 2 points to 12% to 14%, or 13% to 15% in constant currency. Without the pending eCircle acquisition, our revenue growth guidance would be 12% to 14% in constant currency. We are also increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range $0.04 to a range of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes $0.01 from eCircle. 
Now I will turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on Q1 and our full year guidance. Steve?"
97999,184282057,297162,"Teradata Corporation, Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 03, 2012",2012-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. We just completed another strong quarter driven by the heightened demand for analytics and business intelligence. This is one of the best quarters in Teradata's history, highlighted by 21% revenue growth, non-GAAP operating",1997,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. We just completed another strong quarter driven by the heightened demand for analytics and business intelligence. This is one of the best quarters in Teradata's history, highlighted by 21% revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%, non-GAAP earnings per share up 25% and 105% increase in free cash flow generated in Q1 versus the prior year period. 
First quarter revenue was $613 million, was up 21% from the first quarter of 2011, up 22% in constant currency. Product revenue of $308 million was up 31% from the first quarter of 2011, up 32% in constant currency. Services revenue of $305 million was up 13%, up 14% in constant currency. Within our services revenue, Consulting Services was up 14%, up 15% in constant currency. And Maintenance Services was up 11% in the quarter, up 12% in constant currency. 
During 2011, we had special items largely related to our acquisition activity, as well as stock-based compensation expense. We have discussed the special items in prior quarters, so I won't go through the details today. However, these special items are described in the footnotes to our earnings release and are shown in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation schedules in our earnings release as well as on our website. During my discussion today, I will be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis. 
Gross margin in the first quarter of 2012 was 55.9%, up from the 55.7% in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by a greater proportion of product revenue. The Americas and APJ regions experienced solid improvement in gross margin while the EMEA region gross margin declined primarily due to consulting revenues growing faster than the product revenue, as well as timing of transactions and deal mix. Product gross margin in the first quarter was 67.9%, up 30 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. This performance mitigated the expected headwind from increased FAS 86 amortization, a prior capitalized software development cost and the higher hard disk drive prices resulting from the flooding in Thailand, as we discussed last quarter. 
As a component of product revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q1 was at the lower end of the 10% to 15% range we discussed previously. However, we continue to expect that the 2000 series appliance revenue will be at the higher end of the range for the full year. Since the appliance revenue was a lower percentage of product revenue in the quarter, it provided a favorable mix shift as it relates to product gross margin in Q1 2012. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was 44% versus 45% in Q1 2011. The decline is primarily due to a higher mix of Consulting revenue while operational maintenance margins remained relatively consistent between quarters. Consulting revenues grew faster than the Maintenance revenue, which lowers the overall services gross margins since Consulting margins are lower than the Maintenance gross margins. 
Turning to our operating expense structure. SG&A expense of $154 million increased $18 million or 13% from Q1 2011. The increase in SG&A for the quarter was primarily driven by acquisition-related headcount and the increased number of sales territories. As we discussed in previous quarters, we expect a continued increase in our selling expense in 2012 as we incur the full year or annualized cost of the new sales territories added in 2011, as well as the additional territories we anticipate adding in 2012. We should however, continue to slightly improve SG&A's efficiency ratio described as a percentage of earning. 
R&D in the quarter was $43 million versus $33 million in the first quarter of 2011. Keep in mind, our R&D spend in Q1 2012 includes a full quarter of R&D spend for the Aprimo and Aster Data, while we only had 2 months of R&D spend from a Aprimo in Q1 2011, and the Aster Data transaction did not close until April of last year. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, we continue to increase our investments in R&D, particularly through enhancements to our core technology base, as well as continuing to build out our Teradata product family and ecosystem including big data capabilities. For 2012, we estimate that the non-GAAP R&D expense should grow slightly less than 10% over 2011, factoring in the full year impact of the R&D expense from the acquisitions. 
As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D spend for the first quarter before capitalization of internally developed software, which is included in the line items additions to capitalized software on the statement of cash flows, was approximately $59 million compared to approximately $51 million in Q1 2011 or a 16% increase. As a reminder, these capitalized software costs are then amortized back to the income statement as product cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin. As a result of these items, Teradata's operating margin in the first quarter was 23.9% versus 22.7% in Q1 2011. The contribution from higher revenue and favorable deal mix offset the increased investments in sales-related activities in R&D, as well as the higher FAS 86 software amortization cost and higher cost of our hard disk drives. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q1 2012 was 28%, the same as in the first quarter of 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for first quarter was 29%, again, the same as the prior year period. We continue to expect our full year GAAP tax rate to be approximately 27% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly higher, approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate as the majority of the non-GAAP pre-tax earnings including stock-based compensation expense, as well as acquisition-related and other special items, are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for 2012 assumes that the federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively restated for the full year 2012, prior to the end of 2012. 
In terms of earnings per share, our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.53 versus $0.38 in Q1 2011. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is included in our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.15 per share in 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense, as well as the full year increase related to the acquisitions made during 2011. As I mentioned earlier, a couple of acquisition-related items were also included in our GAAP results in Q1. These items are described in the footnotes of our earnings release and on our website. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and the acquisition-related items, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.60 in Q1 2012 compared to $0.48 in Q1 2011, a 25% increase. 
Turning to cash flow. We had a strong quarter in terms of net cash provided by operating activities, generating $192 million in Q1 2012 versus $106 million in the first quarter of 2011 or an 81% increase. After $30 million of capital expenditures, which include additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment, versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2011, we generated $162 million of free cash flow versus the $79 million of free cash flow generated in Q1 of 2011. The 105% increase in free cash flow was driven by our increased net income in the first quarter of 2012, as well as the smaller increase in receivables in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software.
Turning to the balance sheet. We had $978 million of cash as of March 31, 2012, a $206 million or 27% increase from December 31, 2011. Approximately 30% of our cash balance is available in the U.S. with the remainder being held offshore. With respect to our accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 74 days as of March 31, 2012, compared to 76 days as of December 31, 2011. DSO as of March 31, 2011, was 85 days. With respect to the deferred revenue, deferred maintenance and subscriptions continue to account for over 70% of the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2012. The deferred revenue change from March 31, 2012, versus December 31, 2011, increased as expected over the change from March 31, 2011, versus December 31, 2010, after removing the impact that Aprimo had on the March 31, 2011, deferred revenue. The Aprimo acquisition closed during Q1 2011. 
Turning to foreign currency. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on our future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currency has impacted the first quarter of 2012 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons throughout 2012. Assuming the currency rates as of the end of April and assume currency rates do not change throughout 2012, we expect currency to create about approximately 1 point of a headwind for us for the full year and 2 points of headwind in Q2. 
Mike provided our increased revenue and EPS guidance earlier in this call, but I want to give a little more color on some specific items. We had another strong quarter in Q1, and our pipeline remains solid. In light of the tough Q2 2011 comparable, particularly in EMEA, when they grew revenue 34% as reported, and the FX headwind in Q2 2012, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance to 12% to 14%, or 13% to 15% in constant currency, from our original guidance of 10% to 12%, or 11% to 13% in constant currency due to the good start we had in Q1 and approximately 1% of that revenue growth from the digital marketing acquisition eCircle we announced yesterday. 
Turning to EPS. Specifically, we continue to expect: headwind on product gross margins going into Q2 due to a higher disk drive cost and increased amortization of capitalized software, and we still expect it to decline approximately 1 percentage point for full year 2012 versus 2011; higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% from 2011, including R&D from the acquisitions; G&A expense to increase in the low single digits on a percentage basis, again included in the ongoing G&A from the acquisitions; and higher selling expense, primarily from the new sales territories added in 2011 as those territories anticipated to be added in 2012 and higher variable incentive compensation and presale consulting expense from the new sales territories as productivity improves across all sales organizations. 
Incorporating all these factors into our EPS guidance, we are changing our expectations for GAAP EPS to a range of $2.24 to $2.34. However, this includes approximately $0.15 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisitions, $0.12 a share of amortization acquired in tangible assets and $0.08 a share of transaction and integration costs. Excluding these non-operational items, we are increasing our expectations for non-GAAP EPS to a range of approximating $2.60 to $2.70 per share in 2012. 
To provide further color around EPS growth for the remainder of the year, assuming the midpoint of our 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance, this would imply a remaining 9-month EPS increase of $0.21 when compared to the same 9 months of 2011. And we expect the majority of the increase to incur during Q4 2012, primarily due to the effect our variable incentive compensation programs head on our Q4 2012 results. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start to 2012, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute and drive our business model to leverage our opportunities during the remainder of 2012. 
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

There’s more of correlation as it relates to maintenance revenues when you have a strong product revenue growth. However, with the maintenance revenue, our larger Enterprise Data Warehouse customers, as they expand and add to systems, the pricing of the maintenance on those systems as they get added to and they become larger is not linear. So although there is a correlation with maintenance with product revenue, it doesn't necessarily grow at the same rate as the product revenue. The consulting, we've taken – we’ve commented on this before between the correlations between consulting revenue and product revenue, and when you break apart our Consulting business, approximately 25% of our revenue is a leading indicator, 45% is a lagging indicator. So it's being dragged along with implementation services and everything else that we're selling as product revenue. But in addition to those 2 buckets, if you will, we have 30% of our consulting revenue that's not related to product revenue at all. It's independent. So things like our Managed Services and our BI Consulting and a lot of other things that we're doing is independent and separate.

The way we would characterize it is, like you said, core to Teradata was the integrated data warehouse, an Enterprise Data Warehouse. And in a way, it's a no-brainer, it's a best-in-class architecture and reduces a ton of cost by centralizing data that can give better insight into the business when it's integrated from other data across the enterprise. And it also, as I discussed earlier about our Active Data Warehouse Private Cloud, it consolidates underutilized data marts and puts them in one central location to be shared with multiple organizations, multiple users and everything else and drives a higher utilization, and as a result, reduces data center footprint and gets a ton of costs down. So for data that has better value being integrated and for data that is relevant and should be used by multiple organizations in a company, an Enterprise Data Warehouse is, without a doubt, the right architecture. Think of that as a workload. So it's a workload or data that's used by lots of people, lots of organizations and shared throughout the company to get higher utilization, lower costs, better information. So what we saw with the workload-specific data warehouses or the platform family is -- what we began to see is there's workloads such as our Extreme Data Appliance where it's lots of history, if it's archival or regulatory or it's clickstream data from the web that, that data is relevant to less people within the organization. So our 1000 series Extreme Data Appliance, we build something that has lots of storage, can have lots of data in it, but it doesn't have a lot of CPU to serve a lot of users, and in effect, we’re building a configuration that is a much lower cost per piece of data than an EDW to serve a smaller group of people that are using it. So it's workload-specific. So when you look at the Aster Data Appliance once again, in Aster Data Appliance, you're doing exploratory and discovery types of analytical analysis on big data. And you don't need a mission-critical environment similar to the 1000. You don't need all the robustness that you need in an Enterprise Data Warehouse, and you're using it with a smaller group of users. So it gets back to a workload that's more specific for a limited number of users and requirements that aren't the same as running your company on the data warehouse like our EDWs. Our customers in EDW’s side need 49s [ph] availability. It's mission-critical. The thing is critical. So we continue to slice and dice workload-specific data warehouses to address different workloads and different user sets in addition to an Enterprise Data Warehouse to integrate and share data and information across all the organizations that's required, because in that environment, that's the lower-cost solution."

We had a very, very, I would call it, normal mix of transactions in terms of size. I actually think we -- I'm thinking through the previous quarters last year and everything. We didn't have transactions quite the size of some of the ones we saw in the previous 4 quarters in 2011. So anyway, that's the answer to that one. I think on the full-year guidance, there's a couple of things going on. The currency headwind is for real, and some of the prior year comparables are real versus what we had in Q1 as a prior year comparable, and when you get into certain regions, right? So like in EMEA, the currency headwinds in EMEA in Q2 were 7%, and they’re estimated at 5% in Q3. When you look at EMEA's prior year Q2, the revenue produced in Q2 in EMEA of last year was the same amount EMEA produced in Q4. This was a huge prior year for EMEA in Q2 2011. In fact, the revenue growth in Q2 in 2011 was 34%. So what happens is you start to slice and dice this thing, and we've got get strong headwinds in EMEA in Q2. When you look at – and the EMEA thing is not a macroeconomic thing our business is fine. It's just we're going to run into a tough prior year comparable in EMEA in Q2 between the currency and the prior year and some currency in Q3. The only other thing we're seeing in terms of softness is in China. So we're very big in the financial services industry in China. We have 12 of the top 15 banks, and there, we are seeing delays in approvals and a slowdown in the financial services sector in China. We are seeing some. I'm not saying to a great degree, but we are seeing some there. But on the flipside, Japan we’re off to a really good start in Q1. And our activity in Japan is pretty good. We finished the year strongly in Japan. So that's kind of the mix of things. The other thing is when we look at the full year, and similar to what we said, I believe we said on the last call, the services revenue is going to be more in the lower double digits range, and that's going to have an impact on the full year."

And some of the early ones that are very hot thing to be around, digital marketing optimization, also fraud detection and prevention, as well a social network analysis. But we're also seeing a trend where people are looking at traditional analytics and how can they add more transactional data in a time series approach to understanding the bigger picture. So people are looking at going from 2 years to 10 years of history and doing analysis on it like they traditionally did to try to gain new insights. It's also a -- very often we're seeing in marketing they're leveraging big data as a part of this new digital marketing phenomenon that's going on. So if you look at some of the studies put out around impacts to CMOs, it's understanding the big data phenomenon, as well as how to monetize the social environments. And we see that as a big take-up of leveraging this technology to help them better understand how to interact with those clients, as well as how to look at that transactional data in its raw form.

And they're leveraging that technology in conjunction with Teradata to spot those kinds of things on people entering and accessing the networks and moving and changing data and leveraging that as a part of their enterprise. Today, it's currently working with Teradata, and we'll continue to look at how we can leverage that across the other platforms."

Teradata had another strong quarter in Q2, with revenue growth of 14% as reported and 18% in constant currency.  And for the first half, revenue was up 20% in constant currency, while going against last year's record first half revenue growth of 17% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP operating income grew 31% in the quarter to $188 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 was up 28% over prior year.  Non-GAAP operating margin of 28.2% was 390 basis points higher than the previous best quarter of 24.3%, which was achieved in Q2 of 2011. The record operating margin was driven by solid execution across the company, and a significantly favorable revenue mix. 
In the quarter, higher-margin product revenue grew faster than services revenue. And, within the product revenue, higher-margin EDWs grew faster than the appliances. And within the services revenue, higher-margin maintenance grew faster than consulting. It is rare when all 3 revenue mixes line up favorably like this in a quarter.
Overall, we were pleased with our better-than-expected second quarter results and where we stand at the end of the first half. 
Turning to the regions, the Americas reported revenue growth of 17%, and was up 18% in constant currency. For the first half, the Americas was up 22% as reported, and in constant currency. Q2 marked the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with 7 of those quarters growing more than 20%. The Americas had a large number of new customer wins in the quarter including Groupon, which will be implementing a data warehouse to manage large-scale weblog data and differentiate offers by location and subscriber; Mutual of Omaha, which purchased a data warehouse to integrate data from across finance, marketing, insurance and retirement services to provide better information to their users; the state of Indiana Family and Social Services Administration will be using our Enterprise Data Warehouse to better manage care for their citizens; and Machinima, the #1 entertainment channel on YouTube, purchased Oath, a data warehouse, and Aster to analyze online viewer behavior and optimize placement of advertising.
Aprimo new customer wins in the Americas included a leading university which will use Aprimo to better attract and optimize marketing spend and to improve its marketing workflow. Constellation Energy, which is a Teradata customer, and purchased Aprimo for campaign management. And at Amsterdam Printing, a leading promotional products company, which purchased Aprimo to gain better insight into its customers and prospects.
Expansions and upgrades included Susan Hogan, which will upgraded and expanded their analytics environment to the hybrid storage 6690 EDW; and the Royal Bank of Canada, which also deployed our hybrid storage 6690. Other upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Boeing, TIAA-CREF, Winn-Dixie and Protabell in Brazil. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa had an exceptional second quarter, with revenue up 16% as reported and up 27% in constant currency. This was better than we expected, given the macroeconomic environment and a strong prior year comparable when revenue grew 34% in Q2 of 2011.
For the first half, EMEA revenue was up 13% as reported and up 20% in constant currency. Although we are experiencing some lengthening of sales cycles and delays in purchases, it is currently being offset by increased pipelines across most of the region, and strong revenue growth in newer markets such as Russia, where we have been steadily adding territories the past 4 years.
New customer wins included Mobiley, Saudi Arabia's leading mobile operator where we are replacing a competitor's data warehouse. Capiola, one of Finland's largest insurers, where our Teradata Solvency II solution will be able to address the new regulatory risk requirements. Turbid Group in Italy was another new customer win and will be using our data warehouse to analyze geospatial and temporal data in order to better serve its customers.  And at Turk Telecom, which will be implementing an Enterprise Data Warehouse, along with our communications industry logical data model, to consolidate and illuminate competitor data marks.
Significant expansions and upgrades included SwiftCom, BBVA in Spain, Nordea Group and a top bank in Russia. 
And finally, Asia Pacific and Japan grew revenue 2% in the second quarter and 4% in constant currency. For the first half, revenue was up 10%, both as reported and in constant currency. Similar to Q1, we experienced extended sales cycles and delays in China during the second quarter, which was offset by growth across the rest of APJ. However, we are looking for China to provide good growth in the latter part of the second half, as opportunities that have been delayed begin to close.
APJ added a number of new customers in Q2 including several from the financial services industry in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and China, and at Tokyo Star Bank in Japan.
Initiatives around risks, compliance and marketing, as well as cost reduction were the key drivers of these wins. New wins in the government sector included the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in Australia. Upgrades and expansions included the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation, TG Telecom in Malaysia, and Star Track Express in Australia.
Regarding our growth initiatives, we are on track to reach the higher end of the 35 to 45 territories we targeted to add in 2012. I'd like to add that we are pleased with our return on investment from the territories added during 2008 to 2011. 
Consulting Services revenue grew 13% in constant currency in Q2 and 14% in constant currency for the first half of 2012. We continue to add consultants both onshore and offshore to get to a lower blended cost for our customers, which in turn helps to increase demand as well as improve margins. 
In addition, we continue to invest in new service offers and add to existing ones. However, our Consulting Services growth rate is slowing, and we are likely to see low double-digit constant currency growth during the second half and mid-single digit as reported.
And last, our increased investments in R&D continue to bring innovation and industry first to the market. We recently released our Unified Big Data architecture and software to help companies bridge the worlds of classic business intelligence and new Big Data analytics.
Hadoop plays a key role in this unified data architecture for analytics. Consistent with Teradata's view of workload-specific platforms to optimize analytical ecosystems, we see Hadoop as a workload-specific platform for storing, ingesting and transforming the new and high-volume big data. And with Aster allowing for the rapid discovery of the gold nuggets that reside in the Hadoop detailed data.
Aster enables knowledge workers to utilize mainstream analytic BI tools that they are already familiar with. This, in turn, makes it easier for companies to deploy analytics on Hadoop and reduce the dependency on expensive and scarce big data engineers for big data analytics.
And of course, our core Teradata Active Data Warehouse is the platform that provides unsurpassed integration of all data from all data sources and a real-time delivery of the analytics to the front lines.
We are clearly gaining momentum in the market with Aster. And although still a small number, we had our largest revenue quarter in Q2. And Aster's pipeline and proof-of-concepts have grown significantly. 
Marketing, as well as analytics, will continue to be a top priority for most companies over the next several years, and is in an area we will continue to increase our investments.
In June, we strengthened our integrated marketing management solution with the completion of our acquisition of eCircle, which is the leading digital marketing company in Europe. We are in the process of taking this solution globally. And most recently, Teradata Aprimo was named to the Leaders Quadrant of the Magic Quadrant for Multi-Channel Campaign Management Report by Gartner.
The combination of Aprimo, eCircle, Aster and Teradata will provide an end-to-end marketing solution, once integrated, that will encompass social, mobile, the Web, as well as all traditional channels while providing next-generation digital marketing capabilities with seamless analytics across all marketing data.
Longer-term, the positions we've established in data warehousing, big data and integrated marketing management should allow us to continue to grow revenue double-digits-plus. 
Turning to guidance. Teradata, and analytics overall, tend to receive a high priority from companies during uncertain economic environments. However, we are not immune from the various negative impacts of these environments that we are now seeing, and this is reflected in our revenue guidance.
We are increasing our constant currency revenue growth guidance by 1 point, from 13% to 15%, to 14% to 16% for the full year. But the guidance implies a slowing of constant currency revenue growth in the second half to 9% to 13% versus the 20% growth we saw in the first half. As it relates to EPS, due to the overachievement we had in Q2, we are increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance $0.12 to $2.72 to $2.82 per share. 
I will now turn it over to Steve, who will provide more details on our financial results, as well as our updated full year guidance. Steve?"

Our Q2 2012 results continue to reflect the strong qualities of our business model, driving revenue that increased 18% in constant currency and record non-GAAP product and overall gross margins, and record operating m",2407,"Thanks for joining us this morning. 
Our Q2 2012 results continue to reflect the strong qualities of our business model, driving revenue that increased 18% in constant currency and record non-GAAP product and overall gross margins, and record operating margin. This drove non-GAAP EPS of $0.77, which is a 28% increase from the prior year period. Second quarter revenue of $665 million was up 14% from the second quarter of 2011. Revenue for the first half of the year was up 18%, 20% in constant currency. As you are probably aware, currency moved against us during the course of the quarter a full percentage point, which resulted in approximately $9 million less revenue in our reported results than would've been the case using the April 30, 2012 exchange rates when we updated our 2012 guidance on May 3, 2012. In other words, our Q2 revenue would've been approximately $9 million higher than the $665 million reported.
Product revenue of $321 million was up 19% from the second quarter of 2011, up 23% in constant currency. For the first half of the year, product revenue was up 25%, 27% in constant currency.  Services revenue, up $344 million, was up 10% or up 13% in constant currency from the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, services revenue was up 11% or up 14% in constant currency.  Within the services revenue for the quarter, Consulting Services revenue was up 9%, up 13% in constant currency. And maintenance services revenue was up 12%, up 14% in constant currency. Year-to-date, both Consulting Services and Maintenance Services revenue were up 11%, with Consulting Services up 14% in constant currency, while Maintenance Services was up 13% in constant currency.
During my discussion today, I will be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, excluding special items. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures identifying the special items is available in our earnings release and on the investor page of our website.
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2012 improved 260 basis points to 58.5%, a record gross margin for the company. The increase in gross margin was driven by a greater proportion of product revenue versus services revenue, as well as improved product and services gross margins. 
Product gross margin in the second quarter was a record 70.4%, up 190 basis points from 68.5% in the second quarter of 2011. The improvement was primarily driven by less 1000 series appliance product revenue in Q2 2012 compared to the product revenue mix in Q 2011. As a percentage of total product revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q2 was 12.5%, at the midpoint of the 10% to 15% expected range we have previously discussed. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was 47.4%, versus 44.9% in Q2 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased maintenance services margins in EMEA and the Americas, as well as the improved consulting services margins in APJ. 
Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expense of $162 million increased $13 million or 9% from Q2 2011. The increase in SG&A for the quarter, which was reduced by approximately $4 million from the currency movement benefit, was primarily driven by the increased number of sales territories, as well as higher commissions due to the strong revenue growth generated in the quarter. Despite the investment in the sales territories and higher sales commissions in the quarter and year-to-date, SG&A continues to decrease as a percentage of revenue, approximately a full percentage point lower in both the quarter and the first quarter year-over-year comparisons. 
R&D in the quarter was $40 million versus $37 million in the second quarter of 2011. However, for the full year, we continue to expect that non-GAAP R&D expense should grow approximately 10% over 2011, factoring in the full year impact of the R&D expense from the acquisitions.
As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line in our income statement. Total non-GAAP R&D expense for the second quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally-developed software, was approximately $59 million compared to approximately $55 million in Q2 2011. Year-to-date, total R&D expense was $118 million versus the $106 million last year.
As a result of all the items in the second quarter, Teradata achieved its highest operating margin ever. Operating margin in Q2 was 28.2%, a significant increase over the 24.3% generated in Q2 2011, which coincidentally,, Teradata achieved the highest operating margin since going public. The contribution from higher revenue and favorable revenue mix offset the increased operating investments. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q2 2012 was 30% versus 25% in Q2 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30% compared to 27% for the same period in 2011. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter increased as we currently are forecasting a higher proportional amount of earnings being taxed in U.S., which as you know, has a higher statutory tax rate. Additionally, the Q2 2012 rate reflected no benefit related to the federal R&D tax credit due to its current expiration. 
We are raising our expectation for full year GAAP tax rate, 1  percentage point to approximately 28%. And expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated effective GAAP tax rate. As a majority of the non-GAAP pre-tax items, including stock-based compensation expense as well as the special items, are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2012 assumes that the federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively restated for the full year in Q4 of 2012.
In terms of earnings per share, our Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.65 versus $0.60 in Q2 2011. Noncash stock-based compensation expenses are included in our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.16 per share for the full year 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense, as well as the increase in stock-based compensation expense related to our acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we also had some special items which totaled approximately $0.08 per share. Excluding the impact of the stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $0.12 in Q2, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.77 in Q2 2012 compared to $0.60 in Q2 2011 for a year-over-year increase of 28%.
In Q 2011, GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were the same at $0.60, as approximately $0.13 of gains from equity investments offset the stock-based compensation and the other special items. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $152 million in Q2 2012 versus $179 million in the second quarter of 2011. After $39 million of capital expenditures, which includes additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment, versus $33 million in the second quarter of 2011, we generated $113 million of free cash flow versus the $146 million of free cash flow generated in Q2 2011. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily driven by the timing of receivables or collections between Q1 and Q2 of both years. We had stronger collections in Q1 2012 versus the same period last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, which normalizes the timing of the receivables and related collections between Q1 and Q2, free cash flow was up $50 million from the $225 million generated in the first half of 2011. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $821 million of cash, $157  million decrease from March 31, 2012, as cash used for share repurchases, acquisitions and other investing activities outweighed the cash provided by operating activities in the quarter. Approximately 40% of our cash balance is available on the U.S, with the remainder being held offshore. 
With respect to accounts receivable, day sales outstanding was 72 days as of June 30, 2012, down from the 74 days at the end of Q1 and in line with our 71 days at the end of June in 2011. With respect to deferred revenue, deferred revenue was down $44 million from March 31, 2012, compared to June 30, 2012, down $39 million in constant currency. Historically, with the exception of last year, deferred revenue declines approximately $19 million between March 31 to June 30 of each year due to a higher percentage of maintenance contracts that are renewed in Q1 each year. However, in 2011, deferred revenue only declined $8 million from March 31, 2011 to June 30, 2011, as we had approximately $10 million of partial year maintenance agreement additions for existing customers rollover from Q1 2011 to Q2 2011. So if you normalized this in 2011, the prior year decline was right on track, down approximately $18 million. 
Overall, current deferred revenue as of June 30, 2012, increased $18 million from June 30, 2011 or $30 million in constant currency. And more specifically, deferred revenue for maintenance and subscriptions was up approximately 13% in constant currency for the same period.
Maintenance and subscriptions continue to account for greater than 70% of our deferred revenue balance, with the remainder attributable both to the product transactions. Deferred revenue related to product transactions can be inconsistent quarter-over-quarter, as was reflected in the March 31, 2012 deferred revenue balance. 
Product transaction deferred revenue was down $20 million from March 31, 2012 to June 30, 2012. However, to add some color around the amount of product transactions as of June 30, 2012, the amount is consistent with 6 of the last 8 quarters. This movement is a direct reflection of our business model and revenue recognition policies and practices, but does not reflect changes in backlog or expectations for future periods. 
To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currencies impacted the second quarter of 2012 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons throughout the remainder of 2012. 
And as stated earlier, we now see an additional point of headwind from currency on our full year revenue growth, as well as 1 point of additional currency headwind in Q3 and Q4.
Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of July and assuming currency exchange rates do not change throughout the remainder of 2012, we acknowledge that currency could create 2 points of headwind for us for the full year, and 3 points of headwind in Q3 and 1 point of headwind in Q4. The effect of the change in the exchange rates from April month-end, used to base our 2012 revenue guidance on May 3 to the July month-end rates used to base our 2012 revenue guidance today, was a reduction of revenue of approximately $20 million for the second half of 2012, spread generally ratable over Q3 and Q4. 
Turning to guidance for 2012. As it relates to revenue, we are increasing our expectation for constant currency revenue growth from 13% to 15% to 14% to 16%. However, due to the additional point of headwind created by currency movements during Q2, our reported revenue growth rate guidance remains the same at 12% to 14% growth. As it relates to EPS, we continue to expect that total gross margin as a percentage of revenue in Q3 2012 is estimated to be reasonably consistent with our 2012 full year's gross margin percentage. In addition, higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% from Q2 2011, including the R&D from acquisitions. In addition, G&A expense to increase in the low single digits on a percentage basis, again including the ongoing G&A from acquisitions. And finally, higher selling expense from new territories added in 2011 and those territories anticipated to be added in 2012. As well as higher commission expense in presale consulting expense as the business continues to grow nicely. 
Incorporating all these factors, as well as our strong 2Q 2 [ph] results into our EPS guidance, we are increasing our expectations for GAAP EPS to $2.34 to $2.44 The GAAP EPS is expected to include approximately the following: $0.16 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 cent a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions; $0.13 a share of amortization of acquired intangible assets; and $0.08 a share of transaction and integration costs. 
Excluding these nonoperational items, or special items, we are increasing our expectations for our non-GAAP EPS $0.12 to approximately $2.72 to $2.82 per share in 2012. As you are aware, Teradata generates approximately 95% of our revenue from our existing customer base, which supports the strong long-term consistency of our business model. However, to get to the size of our transactions, this can drive short-term variability as we just experienced in Q2, which was driven primarily by the favorable revenue mix. As Mike indicated, Q2 2012 performance was very strong, led by an outstanding revenue mix that produced record operating metrics. In the past, we have experienced product gross margin and services gross margin declines up to 270 basis points from Q2 to Q3, driven by product revenue mix and operating expense increases up to 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Both of which are examples of short-term variability of our business model from quarter-to-quarter, and which would result in estimated yields lower than what we experienced in Q2 of 2012. However, the estimated lower Q3 yields is taken in consideration with our increased guidance. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong results in Q2, especially in light of the negative headwinds regarding the macroeconomic environment. Although we had a very good Q2, we want to be cautious when forecasting the remainder of the year. As we know, no one is immune from macroeconomic forces. Although, historically, we have fared well on a relative basis, even in difficult economic environments.

We're having some pretty good results, especially when you look at it in constant currency. The currency headwinds for EMEA in Q3 are about 10 points.

We're having some pretty good results, especially when you look at it in constant currency. The currency headwinds for EMEA in Q3 are about 10 points. And basically, what we're seeing with EMEA as you look at the second half of the year, more impact from currency, offset by the strong pipeline as well as we're getting some really strong results out of some of the newer markets such as Russia, the Middle East and some others. So the net net, because of the currency -- if you look at EMEA organically, without the favorable impact of eCircle, it's going to be challenged as reported as we look at the second half. But they should grow double digits in constant currency in the second half organically. In the case of APJ, they're pretty back-end-loaded. And as you mentioned, with China, we expect the deals that have been pushed out and delayed in the first half of the year to start closing. Hopefully some in the third quarter, but most of it is back-end-loaded. And when we look at APJ overall, the third quarter, we see more on the light side, with more upside in the fourth quarter. And then overall, when we look at the Americas, the rate of growth they've had over the past several years, we're beginning to see a little bit of a slowdown in the rate of growth simply because of the magnitude of some of the prior year comparables that we're running against there. The activity in everything else in the Americas is very good, and we have pretty good visibility on the third quarter. And in the third quarter, we think we are more towards the lower end of the 9% and 13% we're talking about, the growth in constant currency in the second half. So on the third quarter, as it stands today, we see as more towards the low end of that. And the real upside or the real wildcard comes in the fourth quarter with product revenue. We've got a pretty good handle, as you can imagine, on maintenance and consulting, which operates a pretty good backlog. The real wildcard come down at product revenue in the fourth quarter. So back to your original question, you look at first half, second half, we're feeling impacts of the macro. There's definitely some impacts. And it's not just EMEA. You can see it in our Consulting business. Some of the customers are doing more in house. Some of the customers are working with smaller chunks of consulting as opposed to broader-based projects. And So we're feeling some of those impacts broadly."

So that the magnitude of deceleration in Consulting Services revenue growth isn't quite as large as it appears. So, I believe the number in constant currency without acquisitions for Consulting Services in 2011 I think it netted down to about 18% growth, okay. And now on the first half of this year, we're looking at a number that was like 13% or 14%. So I just want to get everyone grounded on the amount of deceleration that we're seeing. As far as the consulting and its behavior and slowing down, there's several dimensions to it. So, first of all, you can always have some lumpiness. So in the first half of the year, the lumpiness going against us was mostly in the Americas. It was more related to completion of some larger contracts we had some in federal government that came into conclusion. You have to replace them with more contacts. But as you go forward, the size of the contracts in this environment and we're seeing it more broadly that companies tend to go with smaller chunks and so forth. You mentioned historically our Consulting Services has performed well in a down economy. And right now, what we're doing is more of an uncertain economy. But the Consulting Services growth rate are good, as it relates to our product revenue growth in a down economy. As a Consulting Services growth rates are lower, if you look at what we grew in 2008 and '09. So I wouldn't take anything there with that."

And a lot of that revenue is segmented into a subset of our total customer base. And we do have a pretty good communication with what's going on with our customers. I think if you look in our customer base, and especially with ones with enterprise data warehouses, it's a continual journey. So they are always building out, we're always working with them for return on investments and defining what the metrics are and everything. So as we complete each addition and buildout of an enterprise data warehouse, we can show meaningful ROI for the companies. So I think between having out there in the market place that analytics is a big thing and big data is a big thing, and all of this stuff. With that kind of air cover and us actually working hand-in-hand with customers who are actually delivering ROIs, that the seed levels can see it and understand it inside corporation bodes well for our user base. The other macro thing that works in our favor is most companies out there right now have cost reduction initiatives that are somewhere near the top on the list. If it isn't cost reduction, it's trying to constrain costs. And we have a clear methodology, documented how we can help take out cost in the process of providing better analytics. So these things tend to work in our favor. That all said, I'm very confident we can always be in the top part of the budget prioritization in corporations, right? But when the budget actually gets cut, it's difficult to have the customer, in many cases, spend more money with you than they did the year before, as their budgets are getting cut. And you saw that in 2008 and 2009. So that bodes well for us. The 6690 does present an opportunity for us to accelerate a little bit more floor sweeps as more companies have older non-hybrid storage types of EDWs than they can -- hit the tipping point, and switch over to the 6690s. Aprimo and Aster clearly are good revenue growth opportunities for us this year and next year, especially when we look at the Software-as-a-Service subscription models with Aprimo, that bodes itself well for consistent revenue growth.

Aaron, first of all, you're talking specifically about the product mix, it's a little less predictable as far as appliances versus EDW.

Don't take that as a precise answer on the percentage of which, but it's hard to predict the mix of these things on a quarter.

Teradata had another strong quarter in Q2, with revenue growth of 14% as reported and 18% in constant currency.  And for the first half, revenue was up 20% in constant currency while going against last year's record first half revenue growth of 17% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP operating income grew 31% in the quarter to $188 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 was up 28% over prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 28.2% was 390 basis points higher than the previous best quarter of 24.3%, which was achieved in Q2 of 2011. The record operating margin was driven by solid execution across the company and a significantly favorable revenue mix. 
In the quarter, higher-margin product revenue grew faster than services revenue. And within the product revenue, higher-margin EDWs grew faster than the appliances. And within the services revenue, higher-margin maintenance grew faster than Consulting. It is rare when all 3 revenue mixes line up favorably like this in a quarter. Overall, we were pleased with our better-than-expected second quarter results and where we stand at the end of the first half. 
Turning to the regions, the Americas reported revenue growth of 17% and was up 18% in constant currency. For the first half, the Americas was up 22% as reported and in constant currency. Q2 marked the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with 7 of those quarters growing more than 20%. 
The Americas had a large number of new customer wins in the quarter, including Groupon, which will be implementing a data warehouse to manage large-scale web log data and differentiate offers by location and subscriber; Mutual of Omaha, which purchased a data warehouse to integrate data from across finance, marketing, insurance and retirement services to provide better information to their users; the State of Indiana Family and Social Services Administration will be using our Enterprise Data Warehouse to better manage care for their citizens; and Machinima, the #1 entertainment channel on YouTube, purchased both a data warehouse and Aster to analyze online viewer behavior and optimize placement of advertising.
Aprimo new customer wins in the Americas included a leading university, which will use Aprimo to better track and optimize marketing spend and to improve its marketing workflow. Constellation Energy, which is a Teradata customer and purchased Aprimo for campaign management; and at Amsterdam Printing, a leading promotional products company, which purchased Aprimo to gain better insight into its customers and prospects.
Expansions and upgrades included Sears Holding, which will -- upgraded and expanded their analytics environment to the hybrid storage 6690 EDW; and the Royal Bank of Canada, which also deployed our hybrid storage 6690. Other upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Boeing, TIAA-CREF, Winn-Dixie and PRODABEL in Brazil. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa had an exceptional second quarter, with revenue up 16% as reported and up 27% in constant currency. This was better than we expected given the macroeconomic environment and the strong prior year comparable when revenue grew 34% in Q2 of 2011. For the first half, EMEA revenue was up 13% as reported and up 20% in constant currency. Although we are experiencing some lengthening of sales cycles and delays in purchases, it is currently being offset by increased pipelines across most of the region and strong revenue growth in newer markets such as Russia, where we have been steadily adding territories the past 4 years.
New customer wins included Mobily, Saudi Arabia's leading mobile operator, where we are replacing a competitor's data warehouse; Tapiola, one of Finland's largest insurers, where our Teradata Solvency II solution will be able to address the new regulatory risk requirements. TruBid Group in Italy was another new customer win and will be using our data warehouse to analyze geospatial and temporal data in order to better serve its customers. And at Türk Telekom, which will be implementing an Enterprise Data Warehouse, along with our communications industry logical data model to consolidate and illuminate competitor data marks. Significant expansions and upgrades included Swift Com, BBVA in Spain, Nordea Group and a top bank in Russia. 
And finally, Asia Pacific and Japan grew revenue 2% in the second quarter and 4% in constant currency. For the first half, revenue was up 10% both as reported and in constant currency. Similar to Q1, we experienced extended sales cycles and delays in China during the second quarter, which was offset by growth across the rest of APJ. However, we are looking for China to provide good growth in the latter part of the second half as opportunities that have been delayed begin to close.
APJ added a number of new customers in Q2, including several from the financial services industry in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and China and at Tokyo Star Bank in Japan. Initiatives around risk, compliance and marketing as well as cost reduction were the key drivers of these wins. New wins in the government sector included the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in Australia. Upgrades and expansions included the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation, DiGi Telecom in Malaysia and Star Track Express in Australia.
Regarding our growth initiatives, we are on track to reach the higher end of the 35 to 45 territories we targeted to add in 2012. I'd like to add that we are pleased with our return on investment from the territories added during 2008 to 2011. 
Consulting Services revenues grew 13% in constant currency in Q2 and 14% in constant currency for the first half of 2012. We continue to add consultants both onshore and offshore to get to a lower blended cost for our customers, which in turn helps to increase demand as well as improve margins. In addition, we continue to invest in new service offers and add to existing ones. However, our Consulting Services growth rate is slowing, and we are likely to see low double-digit constant currency growth during the second half and mid-single digit as reported.
And last, our increased investments in R&D continue to bring innovation and industry first to the market. We recently released our unified big data architecture and software to help companies bridge the worlds of classic business intelligence and new big data analytics.
Hadoop plays a key role in this unified data architecture for analytics. Consistent with Teradata's view of workload-specific platforms to optimize analytical ecosystems, we see Hadoop as a workload-specific platform for storing, ingesting and transforming the new and the high-volume big data and with Aster allowing for the rapid discovery of the gold nuggets that reside in the Hadoop detailed data.
Aster enables knowledge workers to utilize mainstream analytic BI tools that they are already familiar with. This, in turn, makes it easier for companies to deploy analytics on Hadoop and reduce the dependency on expensive and scarce big data engineers for big data analytics. And of course, our core Teradata Active Data Warehouse is the platform that provides unsurpassed integration of all data from all data sources and the real-time delivery of the analytics to the front lines. We are clearly gaining momentum in the market with Aster. And although still a small number, we had our largest revenue quarter in Q2, and Aster's pipeline and proof of concepts have grown significantly. 
Marketing, as well as analytics, will continue to be a top priority for most companies over the next several years and is in an area we will continue to increase our investments. In June, we strengthened our integrated marketing management solution with the completion of our acquisition of eCircle, which is the leading digital marketing company in Europe. We are in the process of taking this solution globally. And most recently, Teradata Aprimo was named to the Leaders Quadrant of the Magic Quadrant for Multi-Channel Campaign Management Report by Gartner.
The combination of Aprimo, eCircle, Aster and Teradata will provide an end-to-end marketing solution once integrated that will encompass social, mobile, the web as well as all traditional channels while providing next-generation digital marketing capabilities with seamless analytics across all marketing data. Longer term, the positions we have established in data warehousing, big data and integrated marketing management should allow us to continue to grow revenue double digits plus. 
Turning to guidance. Teradata and analytics overall tend to receive a high priority from companies during uncertain economic environments. However, we are not immune from the various negative impacts of these environments that we are now seeing, and this is reflected in our revenue guidance.
We are increasing our constant currency revenue growth guidance by 1 point, from 13% to 15% to 14% to 16% for the full year. But the guidance implies a slowing of constant currency revenue growth in the second half to 9% to 13% versus the 20% growth we saw in the first half. As it relates to EPS, due to the overachievement we had in Q2, we are increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance $0.12 to $2.72 to $2.82 per share. 
I will now turn it over to Steve, who will provide more details on our financial results as well as our updated full year guidance. Steve?"

Our Q2 2012 results continue to reflect the strong qualities of our business model, driving revenue that increased 18% in constant currency and record non-GAAP product and overall gross margins and record operating margin. This drove non-GAAP EPS of $0.77, which is a 28% increase from the prior year period. 
Second quarter revenue of $665 million was up 14% from the second quarter of 2011. Revenue for the first half of the year was up 18%, 20% in constant currency. As you're probably aware, currency moved against us during the course of the quarter a full percentage point, which resulted in approximately $9 million less revenue in our reported results than would have been the case using the April 30, 2012, exchange rates when we updated our 2012 guidance on May 3, 2012. In other words, our Q2 revenue would have been approximately $9 million higher than the $665 million reported.
Product revenue of $321 million was up 19% from the second quarter of 2011, up 23% in constant currency. For the first half of the year, product revenue was up 25%, 27% in constant currency.  Services revenue, up $344 million, was up 10% or up 13% in constant currency from the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, services revenue was up 11% or up 14% in constant currency.  
Within the services revenue for the quarter, Consulting Services revenue was up 9%, up 13% in constant currency. And maintenance services revenue was up 12%, up 14% in constant currency. Year-to-date, both Consulting Services and maintenance services revenue were up 11%, with Consulting Services up 14% in constant currency, while maintenance services was up 13% in constant currency.
During my discussion today, I will be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, excluding special items. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures identifying the special items is available in our earnings release and on the Investor page of our website.
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2012 improved 260 basis points to 58.5%, a record gross margin for the company. The increase in gross margin was driven by a greater proportion of product revenue versus services revenue as well as improved product and services gross margins. 
Product gross margin in the second quarter was a record 70.4%, up 190 basis points from 68.5% in the second quarter of 2011. The improvement was primarily driven by less 1000 series' appliance product revenue in Q2 2012 compared to the product revenue mix in Q2 2011. As a percentage of total product revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q2 was 12.5%, at the midpoint of the 10% to 15% expected range we have previously discussed. Services gross margin in the quarter was 47.4% versus 44.9% in Q2 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased maintenance services margins in EMEA and the Americas as well as the improved Consulting Services margins in APJ. 
Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expense of $162 million increased $13 million or 9% from Q2 2011. The increase in SG&A for the quarter, which was reduced by approximately $4 million from the currency movement benefit, was primarily driven by the increased number of sales territories as well as higher commissions due to the strong revenue growth generated in the quarter. Despite the investment in sales territories and higher sales commissions in the quarter and year-to-date, SG&A continues to decrease as a percentage of revenue, approximately a full percentage point lower in both the quarter and the first half year-over-year comparisons. 
R&D in the quarter was $40 million versus $37 million in the second quarter of 2011. However, for the full year, we continue to expect that non-GAAP R&D expense should grow approximately 10% over 2011, factoring in the full year impact of the R&D expense from the acquisitions.
As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line in our income statement. Total non-GAAP R&D expense for the second quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally developed software, was approximately $59 million compared to approximately $55 million in Q2 2011. Year-to-date, total R&D expense was $118 million versus the $106 million last year.
As a result of all the items in the second quarter, Teradata achieved its highest operating margin ever. Operating margin in Q2 was 28.2%, a significant increase over the 24.3% generated in Q2 2011 which, coincidentally, Teradata achieved the highest operating margin since going public. The contribution from higher revenue and favorable revenue mix offset the increased operating investments. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q2 2012 was 30% versus 25% in Q2 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30% compared to 27% for the same period in 2011. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter increased as we currently are forecasting a higher proportional amount of earnings being taxed in the U.S. which, as you know, has the highest statutory tax rate. Additionally, the Q2 2012 rate reflected no benefit related to the federal R&D tax credit due to its current expiration. 
We are raising our expectation for full year GAAP tax rate 1 percentage point to approximately 28% and expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate as the majority of the non-GAAP pretax items, including stock-based compensation expense as well as the special items, are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2012 assumes that the federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively restated for the full year in Q4 of 2012.
In terms of earnings per share, our Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.65 versus $0.60 in Q2 2011. Noncash stock-based compensation expenses included our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.16 per share for the full year 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense as well as the increase in stock-based compensation expense related to our acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we also had some special items, which totaled approximately $0.08 per share. Excluding the impact of the stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $0.12 in Q2, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.77 in Q2 2012 compared to $0.60 in Q2 2011 for a year-over-year increase of 28%. In Q2 2011, GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were the same at $0.60 as approximately $0.13 of gains from equity investments offset the stock-based compensation and the other special items. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $152 million in Q2 2012 versus $179 million in the second quarter of 2011. After $39 million of capital expenditures, which includes additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment, versus $33 million in the second quarter of 2011, we generated $113 million of free cash flow versus the $146 million of free cash flow generated in Q2 2011. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily driven by the timing of receivables or collections between Q1 and Q2 of both years. We had stronger collections in Q1 2012 versus the same period last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, which normalizes the timing of the receivables and the related collections between Q1 and Q2, free cash flow was up $50 million from the $225 million generated in the first half of 2011. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $821 million of cash, a $157 million decrease from March 31, 2012, as cash used for share repurchases, acquisitions and other investing activities outweighed the cash provided by operating activities in the quarter. Approximately 40% of our cash balance is available on the U.S., with the remainder being held offshore. With respect to accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 72 days as of June 30, 2012, down from the 74 days at the end of Q1 and in line with the 71 days at the end of June in 2011. 
With respect to deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was down $44 million from March 31, 2012, compared to June 30, 2012, down $39 million in constant currency. Historically, with the exception of last year, deferred revenue declined approximately $19 million between March 31 to June 30 each year due to a high percentage of maintenance contracts that are renewed in Q1 each year. However, in 2011, deferred revenue only declined $8 million from March 31, 2011, to June 30, 2011, as we had approximately $10 million of partial year maintenance agreement additions for existing customers rollover from Q1 2011 to Q2 2011. So if you normalize this in 2011, the prior year decline was right on track, down approximately $18 million. 
Overall, current deferred revenue as of June 30, 2012, increased $18 million from June 30, 2011, or $30 million in constant currency. And more specifically, deferred revenue for maintenance and subscriptions was up approximately 13% in constant currency for the same period. Maintenance and subscriptions continue to account for greater than 70% of our deferred revenue balance, with the remainder attributable to the product transactions. Deferred revenue related to product transactions can be inconsistent quarter-over-quarter as was reflected in the March 31, 2012, deferred revenue balance. 
Product transaction deferred revenue was down $20 million from March 31, 2012, to June 30, 2012. However, to add some color around the amount of the product transaction deferral as of June 30, 2012, the amount is consistent with 6 out of the last 8 quarters. This movement is a direct reflection of our business model and revenue recognition policies and practices but does not reflect changes in backlog or expectations for future periods. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on future revenue, we provided a schedule on our website detailing how currencies impacted the second quarter of 2012 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons throughout the remainder of 2012. And as stated earlier, we now see an additional point of headwind from currency on our full year revenue growth as well as 1 point of additional currency headwind in Q3 and in Q4.
Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of July and assuming currency exchange rates do not change throughout the remainder of 2012, we acknowledge that currency to create about 2 points of headwind for us for the full year and 3 points of headwind in Q3 and 1 point of headwind in Q4. The effect of the change in the exchange rates from April month end, used to base our 2012 revenue guidance on May 3, to the July month-end rates, used to base our 2012 revenue guidance to date, was a reduction of revenue of approximately $20 million for the second half in 2012, spread generally ratable over Q3 and Q4. 
Turning to guidance for 2012. As it relates to revenue, we are increasing our expectation for constant currency revenue growth from 13% to 15% to 14% to 16%. However, due to the additional point of headwind created by currency movement during Q2, our reported revenue growth rate guidance remains the same at 12% to 14% growth. 
As it relates to EPS, we continue to expect that total gross margin as a percentage of revenue in Q3 2012 is estimated to be reasonably consistent with our 2011 full year's gross margin percentage; in addition, higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% from Q2 2011, including the R&D from acquisitions; in addition, G&A expense to increase in the low single digits on a percentage basis, again including the ongoing G&A from acquisitions; and finally, higher selling expense from new territories added in 2011 and those territories anticipated to be added in 2012, as well as higher commission expense in presale and consulting expense as the business continues to grow nicely. 
Incorporating all these factors as well as our strong Q2 results into our EPS guidance, we are increasing our expectations for GAAP EPS to $2.34 to $2.44 The GAAP EPS is expected to include approximately the following: $0.16 a share of stock-based compensation expense; $0.01 cent a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions; $0.13 a share of amortization of acquired intangible assets; and $0.08 a share of transaction and integration cost. 
Excluding these nonoperational items or special items, we are increasing our expectations for our non-GAAP EPS $0.12 to approximately $2.72 to $2.82 per share in 2012. As you are aware, Teradata generates approximately 95% of our revenue from our existing customer base, which supports the strong long-term consistency of our business model. However, due to the size of our transactions, this can drive short-term variability as we just experienced in Q2, which was driven primarily by the favorable revenue mix. As Mike indicated, Q2 2012 performance was very strong, led by an outstanding revenue mix that produced record operating metrics. 
In the past, we have experienced product gross margin and services gross margin declines up to 270 basis points from Q2 to Q3, driven by product and revenue mix and operating expense increases up to 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue, both of which are examples of short-term variability of our business model from quarter-to-quarter and which would result in estimated yields lower than what we experienced in Q2 of 2012. However, the estimated lower Q3 yields is taken in consideration with our increased guidance. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong results in Q2 especially in light of the negative headwinds regarding the macroeconomic environment. Although we had a very good Q2, we want to be cautious when forecasting the remainder of the year. As we know, no one is immune from macroeconomic forces, although historically, we have fared well on a relative basis even in difficult economic environments. We are extremely pleased with our technology and competitive positioning and remain confident in our ability to execute and drive our business model to leverage our opportunities during the remainder of 2012 and beyond. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

We're having some pretty good results, especially when you look at it in constant currency. The currency headwinds for EMEA in Q3 are about 10 points. And basically, what we're seeing with EMEA as you look at the second half of the year, more impact from currency offset by the strong pipeline as well as we're getting some really strong results out of some of the newer markets, such as Russia, the Middle East and some others. So the net-net, because of the currency, if you look at EMEA organically without the favorable impact of eCircle, it's going to be challenged, as reported, as we look at the second half, but they should grow double digits in constant currency in the second half organically. In the case of APJ, they're pretty back-end loaded. And as you mentioned, with China, we expect the deals that have been pushed out and delayed in the first half of the year to start closing, hopefully, some in the third quarter, but most of it's back-end loaded. And when we look at APJ overall, the third quarter, we see it more on the light side with more upside in the fourth quarter. And then overall, when we looked at the Americas, the rate of growth they've had over the past several years, we're beginning to see a little bit of a slowdown in the rate of growth simply because of the magnitude of some of the prior year comparables that we're running against there. The activity in everything else in the Americas is very good, and we have pretty good visibility on the third quarter. And in the third quarter, we think we're more towards the lower end of the 9% and 13% we're talking about, the growth in constant currency in the second half. So on the third quarter, as it stands today, we see it's more towards the lower end of that. And the real upside or the real wildcard comes in the fourth quarter with product revenue. We've got a pretty good handle, as you can imagine, on maintenance and consulting, which operates with a pretty good backlog. The real wildcard will come down to product revenue in the fourth quarter. So -- and back to your original question. You look at first half, second half, we're feeling impacts of the macro. There's definitely some impacts, and it's not just EMEA. You can see it in our consulting business. Some of the customers are doing more in house. Some of the customers are working with smaller chunks of consulting as opposed to broader-based projects. And so we're feeling some of those impacts broadly."

So the magnitude of deceleration in Consulting Services revenue growth isn't quite as large as it appears. So I believe the number, in constant currency without acquisitions, for Consulting Services in 2011, I think it netted down to about 18% growth, okay? And now in the first half of this year, we're looking at a number that was like 13% or 14%. So I just want to get everyone grounded on the amount of deceleration that we're seeing. The -- as far as the consulting and its behavior and slowing down, there's several dimensions to it. So first of all, you can always have some lumpiness. In the first half of the year, the lumpiness going against us was mostly in the Americas. It was more related to completion of some larger contracts. We had some in the federal government that came into conclusion. Of course, you need to replace them with more contacts. But as you go forward, the size of the contracts in this environment, and we're seeing it more broadly, is companies tend to go with smaller chunks and so forth. You mentioned, historically, our Consulting Services has performed well in a down economy, and right now, I think what we're dealing with is more of an uncertain economy. But the Consulting Services growth rates are good as it relates to our product revenue growth in a down economy. The Consulting Services growth rates are lower if you look at what we grew in 2008 and '09, so I wouldn't take anything there with that."

The -- so 95% of our revenue comes from the customer base, and a lot of that revenue is segmented into a subset of our total customer base. And we do have pretty good communication with what's going on with our customers. I think if you look in our customer base and especially ones with Enterprise Data Warehouses, it's a continual journey. So they're always building out. We're always working with them for return on investments and defining what the metrics are and everything. So as we complete each addition and build-out of an Enterprise Data Warehouse, we can show meaningful ROI to the companies. So I think between having out there in the market place that analytics is a big thing and big data is a big thing and all of this stuff, with that kind of air cover and then us actually working hand-in-hand with customers and actually delivering ROIs that the seed levels can see it and understand it inside corporation, bodes well for our user base. The other macro thing that works in our favor is most companies out there right now have cost reduction initiatives that are somewhere near the top on the list. If it isn't cost reductions, it's trying to constrain cost. And we have a clear methodology, documented how we can help take out cost in the process of providing better analytics. So these things tend to work in our favor. That all said, I'm very confident we can always be in the top part of the budget prioritization in corporations, right? But when the budget actually gets cut, it's difficult to have the customer, in many cases, spend more money with you than they did the year before as the budgets are getting cut, and you saw that in 2008 and 2009. So that bodes well for us. The 6690 does present an opportunity for us to accelerate a little bit more floor sweeps as more companies have older non-hybrid storage types of EDWs than they can hit the tipping point and switch over to the 6690. Aprimo and Aster clearly are good revenue growth opportunities for us this year and next year. Especially when we look at the software as a service subscription models with Aprimo, that bodes itself well for consistent revenue growth. Did I get everything?"

Aaron, first of all, if you're talking specifically about the product mix, it's a little less predictable as far as appliances versus EDW. Obviously, if a customer is upgrading or enhancing and adding to their EDW, we know the product mix, but there are some cases of specific use data warehouses within an EDW customer that may or may not go with an appliance, new customers that we win. Half the time we're winning with an EDW, half with an appliance. Don't take that as a precise answer on the percentage of which, but it's hard to predict the mix of these things in the quarter.

A replay of this conference call will also be available later today on our website. Teradata assumes no obligation to update or revise the information included in this conference call whether as a result of new information or future results. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike."

Teradata had another strong quarter in Q2, with revenue growth of 14% as reported and 18% in constant currency. And for the first half, revenue was up 20% in constant currency while going against last year's record first half revenue growth of 17% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP operating income grew 31% in the quarter to $188 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 was up 28% over prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 28.2% was 390 basis points higher than the previous best quarter of 24.3%, which was achieved in Q2 of 2011. The record operating margin was driven by solid execution across the company and a significantly favorable revenue mix. 
In the quarter, higher-margin product revenue grew faster than services revenue. And within the product revenue, higher-margin EDWs grew faster than the appliances. And within the services revenue, higher-margin maintenance grew faster than Consulting. It is rare when all 3 revenue mixes line up favorably like this in a quarter. Overall, we were pleased with our better-than-expected second quarter results and where we stand at the end of the first half. 
Turning to the regions, the Americas reported revenue growth of 17% and was up 18% in constant currency. For the first half, the Americas was up 22% as reported and in constant currency. Q2 marked the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with 7 of those quarters growing more than 20%. 
The Americas had a large number of new customer wins in the quarter, including Groupon, which will be implementing a data warehouse to manage large-scale Web log data and differentiate offers by location and subscriber; Mutual of Omaha, which purchased a data warehouse to integrate data from across finance, marketing, insurance and retirement services to provide better information to their users; the State of Indiana Family and Social Services Administration will be using our Enterprise Data Warehouse to better manage care for their citizens; and Machinima, the #1 entertainment channel on YouTube, purchased both a data warehouse and Aster to analyze online viewer behavior and optimize placement of advertising.
Aprimo new customer wins in the Americas included a leading university, which will use Aprimo to better track and optimize marketing spend and to improve its marketing workflow. Constellation Energy, which is a Teradata customer and purchased Aprimo for campaign management; and at Amsterdam Printing, a leading promotional products company, which purchased Aprimo to gain better insight into its customers and prospects.
Expansions and upgrades included Sears Holding, which will -- upgraded and expanded their analytics environment to the hybrid storage 6690 EDW; and the Royal Bank of Canada, which also deployed our hybrid storage 6690. Other upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Boeing, TIAA-CREF, Winn-Dixie and PRODABEL in Brazil. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa had an exceptional second quarter, with revenue up 16% as reported and up 27% in constant currency. This was better than we expected given the macroeconomic environment and the strong prior year comparable when revenue grew 34% in Q2 of 2011. For the first half, EMEA revenue was up 13% as reported and up 20% in constant currency. Although we are experiencing some lengthening of sales cycles and delays in purchases, it is currently being offset by increased pipelines across most of the region and strong revenue growth in newer markets such as Russia, where we have been steadily adding territories the past 4 years.
New customer wins included Mobily, Saudi Arabia's leading mobile operator, where we are replacing a competitor's data warehouse; Tapiola, one of Finland's largest insurers, where our Teradata Solvency II solution will be able to address the new regulatory risk requirements. TruBid Group in Italy was another new customer win and will be using our data warehouse to analyze geospatial and temporal data in order to better serve its customers. And at Türk Telekom, which will be implementing an Enterprise Data Warehouse, along with our communications industry logical data model to consolidate and illuminate competitor data marks. Significant expansions and upgrades included Swift Com, BBVA in Spain, Nordea Group and a top bank in Russia. 
And finally, Asia Pacific and Japan grew revenue 2% in the second quarter and 4% in constant currency. For the first half, revenue was up 10% both as reported and in constant currency. Similar to Q1, we experienced extended sales cycles and delays in China during the second quarter, which was offset by growth across the rest of APJ. However, we are looking for China to provide good growth in the latter part of the second half as opportunities that have been delayed begin to close.
APJ added a number of new customers in Q2, including several from the financial services industry in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and China and at Tokyo Star Bank in Japan. Initiatives around risk, compliance and marketing as well as cost reduction were the key drivers of these wins. New wins in the government sector included the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in Australia. Upgrades and expansions included the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation, DiGi Telecom in Malaysia and Star Track Express in Australia.
Regarding our growth initiatives, we are on track to reach the higher end of the 35 to 45 territories we targeted to add in 2012. I'd like to add that we are pleased with our return on investment from the territories added during 2008 to 2011. 
Consulting Services revenues grew 13% in constant currency in Q2 and 14% in constant currency for the first half of 2012. We continue to add consultants both onshore and offshore to get to a lower blended cost for our customers, which in turn helps to increase demand as well as improve margins. In addition, we continue to invest in new service offers and add to existing ones. However, our Consulting Services growth rate is slowing, and we are likely to see low-double digit constant currency growth during the second half and mid-single digit as reported.
And last, our increased investments in R&D continue to bring innovation and industry first to the market. We recently released our unified big data architecture and software to help companies bridge the worlds of classic business intelligence and new big data analytics.
Hadoop plays a key role in this unified data architecture for analytics. Consistent with Teradata's view of workload-specific platforms to optimize analytical ecosystems, we see Hadoop as a workload-specific platform for storing, ingesting and transforming the new and the high-volume big data and with Aster allowing for the rapid discovery of the gold nuggets that reside in the Hadoop detailed data.
Aster enables knowledge workers to utilize mainstream analytic BI tools that they are already familiar with. This, in turn, makes it easier for companies to deploy analytics on Hadoop and reduce the dependency on expensive and scarce big data engineers for big data analytics. And of course, our core Teradata Active Data Warehouse is the platform that provides unsurpassed integration of all data from all data sources and the real-time delivery of analytics to the front lines. We are clearly gaining momentum in the market with Aster. And although still a small number, we had our largest revenue quarter in Q2, and Aster's pipeline and proof of concepts have grown significantly. 
Marketing, as well as analytics, will continue to be a top priority for most companies over the next several years and is in an area we will continue to increase our investments. In June, we strengthened our integrated marketing management solution with the completion of our acquisition of eCircle, which is the leading digital marketing company in Europe. We are in the process of taking this solution globally. And most recently, Teradata Aprimo was named to the Leaders Quadrant of the Magic Quadrant for Multi-Channel Campaign Management Report by Gartner.
The combination of Aprimo, eCircle, Aster and Teradata will provide an end-to-end marketing solution once integrated that will encompass social, mobile, the Web as well as all traditional channels while providing next-generation digital marketing capabilities with seamless analytics across all marketing data. Longer term, the positions we have established in data warehousing, big data and integrated marketing management should allow us to continue to grow revenue double digits plus. 
Turning to guidance. Teradata and analytics overall tend to receive a high priority from companies during uncertain economic environments. However, we are not immune from the various negative impacts of these environments that we are now seeing, and this is reflected in our revenue guidance.
We are increasing our constant currency revenue growth guidance by 1 point, from 13% to 15% to 14% to 16% for the full year. But the guidance implies a slowing of constant currency revenue growth in the second half to 9% to 13% versus the 20% growth we saw in the first half. As it relates to EPS, due to the overachievement we had in Q2, we are increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance $0.12 to $2.72 to $2.82 per share. 
I will now turn it over to Steve, who will provide more details on our financial results as well as our updated full year guidance. Steve?"

Our Q2 2012 results continue to reflect the strong qualities of our business model, driving revenue that increased 18% in constant currency and record non-GAAP product and overall gross margins and record operating margin. This drove non-GAAP EPS of $0.77, which is a 28% increase from the prior year period. 
Second quarter revenue of $665 million was up 14% from the second quarter of 2011. Revenue for the first half of the year was up 18%, 20% in constant currency. As you're probably aware, currency moved against us during the course of the quarter a full percentage point, which resulted in approximately $9 million less revenue in our reported results than would have been the case using the April 30, 2012, exchange rates when we updated our 2012 guidance on May 3, 2012. In other words, our Q2 revenue would have been approximately $9 million higher than the $665 million reported.
Product revenue of $321 million was up 19% from the second quarter of 2011, up 23% in constant currency. For the first half of the year, product revenue was up 25%, 27% in constant currency. Services revenue, up $344 million, was up 10% or up 13% in constant currency from the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, services revenue was up 11% or up 14% in constant currency.  
Within services revenue for the quarter, Consulting Services revenue was up 9%, up 13% in constant currency. And maintenance services revenue was up 12%, up 14% in constant currency. Year-to-date, both Consulting Services and maintenance services revenue were up 11%, with Consulting Services up 14% in constant currency, while maintenance services was up 13% in constant currency.
During my discussion today, I will be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, excluding special items. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures identifying the special items is available in our earnings release and on the Investor page of our website.
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2012 improved 260 basis points to 58.5%, a record gross margin for the company. The increase in gross margin was driven by a greater proportion of product revenue versus services revenue as well as improved product and services gross margins. 
Product gross margin in the second quarter was a record 70.4%, up 190 basis points from 68.5% in the second quarter of 2011. The improvement was primarily driven by less 1000 series appliance product revenue in Q 2012 compared to the product revenue mix in Q 2011. As a percentage of total product revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q2 was 12.5%, at the midpoint of the 10% to 15% expected range we have previously discussed. Services gross margin in the quarter was 47.4% versus 44.9% in Q2 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased maintenance services margins in EMEA and the Americas as well as the improved Consulting Services margins in APJ. 
Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expense of $162 million increased $13 million or 9% from Q2 2011. The increase in SG&A for the quarter, which was reduced by approximately $4 million from the currency movement benefit, was primarily driven by the increased number of sales territories as well as higher commissions due to the strong revenue growth generated in the quarter. Despite the investment in sales territories and higher sales commissions in the quarter and year-to-date, SG&A continues to decrease as a percentage of revenue, approximately a full percentage point lower in both the quarter and the first half year-over-year comparisons. 
R&D in the quarter was $40 million versus $37 million in the second quarter of 2011. However, for the full year, we continue to expect that non-GAAP R&D expense should grow approximately 10% over 2011, factoring in the full year impact of the R&D expense from the acquisitions.
As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line in our income statement. Total non-GAAP R&D expense for the second quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally developed software, was approximately $59 million compared to approximately $55 million in Q2 2011. Year-to-date, total R&D expense was $118 million versus the $106 million last year.
As a result of all the items in the second quarter, Teradata achieved its highest operating margin ever. Operating margin in Q2 was 28.2%, a significant increase over the 24.3% generated in Q2 2011 which, coincidentally, Teradata achieved the highest operating margin since going public. The contribution from higher revenue and favorable revenue mix offset the increased operating investments. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q2 2012 was 30% versus 25% in Q2 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30% compared to 27% for the same period in 2011. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter increased as we currently are forecasting a higher proportional amount of earnings being taxed in the U.S. which, as you know, has a higher statutory tax rate. Additionally, the Q2 2012 rate reflected no benefit related to the federal R&D tax credit due to its current expiration. 
We are raising our expectation for full year GAAP tax rate 1 percentage point to approximately 28% and expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate as the majority of the non-GAAP pretax items, including stock-based compensation expense as well as the special items, are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2012 assumes that the federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively restated for the full year in Q4 of 2012.
In terms of earnings per share, our Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.65 versus $0.60 in Q2 2011. Noncash stock-based compensation expenses included our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.16 per share for the full year 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense as well as the increase in stock-based compensation expense related to our acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we also had some special items, which totaled approximately $0.08 per share. Excluding the impact of the stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $0.12 in Q2, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.77 in Q2 2012 compared to $0.60 in Q2 2011 for a year-over-year increase of 28%. In Q 2011, GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were the same at $0.60 as approximately $0.13 of gains from equity investments offset the stock-based compensation and the other special items. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $152 million in Q2 2012 versus $179 million in the second quarter of 2011. After $39 million of capital expenditures, which includes additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment, versus $33 million in the second quarter of 2011, we generated $113 million of free cash flow versus the $146 million of free cash flow generated in Q2 2011. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily driven by the timing of receivables or collections between Q1 and Q2 of both years. We had stronger collections in Q1 2012 versus the same period last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, which normalizes the timing of the receivables and the related collections between Q1 and Q2, free cash flow was up $50 million from the $225 million generated in the first half of 2011. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $821 million of cash, a $157 million decrease from March 31, 2012, as cash used for share repurchases, acquisitions and other investing activities outweighed the cash provided by operating activities in the quarter. Approximately 40% of our cash balance is available in the U.S., with the remainder being held offshore. With respect to accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 72 days as of June 30, 2012, down from the 74 days at the end of Q1 and in line with the 71 days at the end of June in 2011. 
With respect to deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was down $44 million from March 31, 2012 compared to June 30, 2012, down $39 million in constant currency. Historically, with the exception of last year, deferred revenue declined approximately $19 million between March 31 to June 30 each year due to a high percentage of maintenance contracts that are renewed in Q1 each year. However, in 2011, deferred revenue only declined $8 million from March 31, 2011 to June 30, 2011 as we had approximately $10 million of partial year maintenance agreement additions for existing customers roll over from Q1 2011 to Q2 2011. So if you normalize this in 2011, the prior year decline was right on track, down approximately $18 million. 
Overall, current deferred revenue as of June 30, 2012, increased $18 million from June 30, 2011, or $30 million in constant currency. And more specifically, deferred revenue for maintenance and subscriptions was up approximately 13% in constant currency for the same period. Maintenance and subscriptions continue to account for greater than 70% of our deferred revenue balance, with the remainder attributable to the product transactions. Deferred revenue related to product transactions can be inconsistent quarter-over-quarter as was reflected in the March 31, 2012, deferred revenue balance. 
Product transaction deferred revenue was down $20 million from March 31, 2012 to June 30, 2012. However, to add some color around the amount of the product transaction deferral as of June 30, 2012, the amount is consistent with 6 out of the last 8 quarters. This movement is a direct reflection of our business model and revenue recognition policies and practices but does not reflect changes in backlog or expectations for future periods. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currencies impacted the second quarter of 2012 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons throughout the remainder of 2012. And as stated earlier, we now see an additional point of headwind from currency on our full year revenue growth as well as 1 point of additional currency headwind in Q3 and in Q4.
Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of July and assuming currency exchange rates do not change throughout the remainder of 2012, we acknowledge that currency to create about 2 points of headwind for us for the full year and 3 points of headwind in Q3 and 1 point of headwind in Q4. The effect of the change in the exchange rates from April month end, used to base our 2012 revenue guidance on May 3, to the July month-end rates, used to base our 2012 revenue guidance today, was a reduction of revenue of approximately $20 million for the second half of 2012, spread generally ratable over Q3 and Q4. 
Turning to guidance for 2012. As it relates to revenue, we are increasing our expectation for constant currency revenue growth from 13% to 15% to 14% to 16%. However, due to the additional point of headwind created by currency movement during Q2, our reported revenue growth rate guidance remains the same at 12% to 14% growth. 
As it relates to EPS, we continue to expect that total gross margin as a percentage of revenue in Q3 2012 is estimated to be reasonably consistent with our 2011 full year's gross margin percentage; in addition, higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% from Q2 2011, including the R&D from acquisitions; in addition, G&A expense to increase in the low-single digits on a percentage basis, again including the ongoing G&A from acquisitions; and finally, higher selling expense from new territories added in 2011 and those territories anticipated to be added in 2012, as well as higher commission expense in presale and consulting expense as the business continues to grow nicely. 
Incorporating all these factors as well as our strong Q2 results into our EPS guidance, we are increasing our expectations for GAAP EPS to $2.34 to $2.44. The GAAP EPS is expected to include approximately the following: $0.16 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions, $0.13 a share of amortization of acquired intangible assets and $0.08 a share of transaction and integration cost. 
Excluding these nonoperational items or special items, we are increasing our expectations for our non-GAAP EPS $0.12 to approximately $2.72 to $2.82 per share in 2012. As you are aware, Teradata generates approximately 95% of our revenue from our existing customer base, which supports the strong long-term consistency of our business model. However, due to the size of our transactions, this can drive short-term variability as we just experienced in Q2, which was driven primarily by the favorable revenue mix. As Mike indicated, Q2 2012 performance was very strong, led by an outstanding revenue mix that produced record operating metrics. 
In the past, we have experienced product gross margin and services gross margin declines up to 270 basis points from Q2 to Q3, driven by product and revenue mix and operating expense increases up to 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue, both of which are examples of short-term variability of our business model from quarter-to-quarter and which would result in estimated yields lower than what we experienced in Q2 of 2012. However, the estimated lower Q3 yields is taken in consideration with our increased guidance. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong results in Q2 especially in light of the negative headwinds regarding the macroeconomic environment. Although we had a very good Q2, we want to be cautious when forecasting the remainder of the year. As we know, no one is immune from macroeconomic forces, although historically, we have fared well on a relative basis even in difficult economic environments. We are extremely pleased with our technology and competitive positioning and remain confident in our ability to execute and drive our business model to leverage our opportunities during the remainder of 2012 and beyond. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

We're having some pretty good results, especially when you look at it in constant currency. The currency headwinds for EMEA in Q3 are about 10 points. And basically, what we're seeing with EMEA as you look at the second half of the year, more impact from currency offset by the strong pipeline as well as we're getting some really strong results out of some of the newer markets, such as Russia, the Middle East and some others. So the net-net, because of the currency, if you look at EMEA organically without the favorable impact of eCircle, it's going to be challenged, as reported, as we look at the second half, but they should grow double digits in constant currency in the second half organically. In the case of APJ, they're pretty back-end loaded. As you mentioned, with China, we expect the deals that have been pushed out and delayed in the first half of the year to start closing, hopefully, some in the third quarter, but most of it's back-end loaded. And when we look at APJ overall, the third quarter, we see it more on the light side with more upside in the fourth quarter. And then overall, when we look at the Americas, the rate of growth they've had over the past several years, we're beginning to see a little bit of a slowdown in the rate of growth simply because of the magnitude of some of the prior year comparables that we're running against there. The activity in everything else in the Americas is very good, and we have pretty good visibility on the third quarter. And in the third quarter, we think we're more towards the lower end of the 9% to 13% we're talking about, the growth in constant currency in the second half. So on the third quarter, as it stands today, we see us more towards the low end of that. And the real upside or the real wildcard comes in the fourth quarter with product revenue. We've got a pretty good handle, as you can imagine, on maintenance and consulting, which operates with a pretty good backlog. The real wildcard will come down to product revenue in the fourth quarter. So -- and back to your original question. You look at first half, second half, we're feeling impacts of the macro. There's definitely some impacts, and it's not just EMEA. You can see it in our consulting business. Some of the customers are doing more in house. Some of the customers are working with smaller chunks of consulting as opposed to broader-based projects. And so we're feeling some of those impacts broadly."

And now in the first half of this year, we're looking at a number that's like 13% or 14%. So I just want to get everyone grounded on the amount of deceleration that we're seeing. The -- as far as the consulting and its behavior and slowing down, there's several dimensions to it. So first of all, you can always have some lumpiness. So in the first half of the year, the lumpiness going against us was mostly in the Americas. It was more related to completion of some larger contracts. We had some in the federal government that came to conclusion. Of course, you need to replace them with more contacts. But as you go forward, the size of the contracts in this environment, and we're seeing it more broadly, is companies tend to go with smaller chunks and so forth. You mentioned, historically, our Consulting Services has performed well in a down economy, and right now, I think what we're dealing with is more of an uncertain economy. But the Consulting Services growth rates are good as it relates to our product revenue growth in a down economy. The Consulting Services growth rates are lower if you look at what we grew in 2008 and '09, so I wouldn't take anything there with that."

We're not finished with it yet. There's still one left in New York we're doing in October. And the attendance there and the interest has been very, very good. So like I said, the pipeline is up significantly. The proof of concepts is up very, very significantly.

The -- so 95% of our revenue comes from the customer base, and a lot of that revenue is segmented into a subset of our total customer base. And we do have pretty good communication with what's gone on with our customers. I think if you look in our customer base and especially ones with Enterprise Data Warehouses, it's a continual journey. So they're always building out. We're always working with them for return on investments and defining what the metrics are and everything. So as we complete each addition and build out of an Enterprise Data Warehouse, we can show meaningful ROI to the companies. So I think between having out there in the market place that analytics is a big thing and big data is a big thing and all this stuff, with that kind of air cover and then us actually working hand-in-hand with customers and actually delivering ROIs that the C levels can see it and understand it inside corporation, bodes well for our user base. The other macro thing that works in our favor is most companies out there right now have cost reduction initiatives that are somewhere near the top on the list. If it isn't cost reductions, it's trying to constrain cost. And we have a clear methodology documented how we can help take out cost in the process of providing better analytics. So these things tend to work in our favor. That all said, I'm very confident we can always be in the top part of the budget prioritization in corporations, right? But when the budget actually gets cut, it's difficult to have the customer, in many cases, spend more money with you than they did the year before as the budgets are getting cut, and you saw that in 2008 and 2009. So that bodes well for us. The 6690 does present an opportunity for us to accelerate a little bit more floor sweeps as more companies have older non-hybrid storage types of EDWs then they can hit the tipping point and switch over to the 6690. Aprimo and Aster clearly are good revenue growth opportunities for us this year and next year. Especially when we look at the software as a service subscription model with Aprimo, that bodes itself well for consistent revenue growth. Did I catch everything?"

Aaron, first of all, if you're talking specifically about the product mix, it's a little less predictable as far as appliances versus EDW. Obviously, if a customer is upgrading or enhancing and adding to their EDW, we know the product mix, but there are some cases of specific use data warehouses within an EDW customer that may or may not go with an appliance, new customers that we win. Half the time we're winning with an EDW, half with an appliance. Don't take that as a precise answer on the percentage of which, but it's hard to predict the mix of these things in the quarter. So the dynamics of the gross margin is we kind of had the trifecta here in the second quarter, where we had the product revenue growing faster than the services revenue.

Teradata had another strong quarter in Q2, with revenue growth of 14% as reported and 18% in constant currency. And for the first half, revenue was up 20% in constant currency while going against last year's record first half revenue growth of 17% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP operating income grew 31% in the quarter to $188 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 was up 28% over prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 28.2% was 390 basis points higher than the previous best quarter of 24.3%, which was achieved in Q2 of 2011. The record operating margin was driven by solid execution across the company and a significantly favorable revenue mix. 
In the quarter, higher-margin product revenue grew faster than services revenue. And within the product revenue, higher-margin EDWs grew faster than the appliances. And within the services revenue, higher-margin maintenance grew faster than Consulting. It is rare when all 3 revenue mixes line up favorably like this in a quarter. Overall, we were pleased with our better-than-expected second quarter results and where we stand at the end of the first half. 
Turning to the regions, the Americas reported revenue growth of 17% and was up 18% in constant currency. For the first half, the Americas was up 22% as reported and in constant currency. Q2 marked the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with 7 of those quarters growing more than 20%. 
The Americas had a large number of new customer wins in the quarter, including Groupon, which will be implementing a data warehouse to manage large-scale Web log data and differentiate offers by location and subscriber; Mutual of Omaha, which purchased a data warehouse to integrate data from across finance, marketing, insurance and retirement services to provide better information to their users; the State of Indiana Family and Social Services Administration will be using our Enterprise Data Warehouse to better manage care for their citizens; and Machinima, the #1 entertainment channel on YouTube, purchased both a data warehouse and Aster to analyze online viewer behavior and optimize placement of advertising.
Aprimo new customer wins in the Americas included a leading university, which will use Aprimo to better track and optimize marketing spend and to improve its marketing workflow. Constellation Energy, which is a Teradata customer and purchased Aprimo for campaign management; and at Amsterdam Printing, a leading promotional products company, which purchased Aprimo to gain better insight into its customers and prospects.
Expansions and upgrades included Sears Holding, which will -- upgraded and expanded their analytics environment to the hybrid storage 6690 EDW; and the Royal Bank of Canada, which also deployed our hybrid storage 6690. Other upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Boeing, TIAA-CREF, Winn-Dixie and PRODABEL in Brazil. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa had an exceptional second quarter, with revenue up 16% as reported and up 27% in constant currency. This was better than we expected given the macroeconomic environment and the strong prior year comparable when revenue grew 34% in Q2 of 2011. For the first half, EMEA revenue was up 13% as reported and up 20% in constant currency. Although we are experiencing some lengthening of sales cycles and delays in purchases, it is currently being offset by increased pipelines across most of the region and strong revenue growth in newer markets such as Russia, where we have been steadily adding territories the past 4 years.
New customer wins included Mobily, Saudi Arabia's leading mobile operator, where we are replacing a competitor's data warehouse; Tapiola, one of Finland's largest insurers, where our Teradata Solvency II solution will be able to address the new regulatory risk requirements. TruBid Group in Italy was another new customer win and will be using our data warehouse to analyze geospatial and temporal data in order to better serve its customers. And at Türk Telekom, which will be implementing an Enterprise Data Warehouse, along with our communications industry logical data model to consolidate and illuminate competitor data marks. Significant expansions and upgrades included Swift Com, BBVA in Spain, Nordea Group and a top bank in Russia. 
And finally, Asia Pacific and Japan grew revenue 2% in the second quarter and 4% in constant currency. For the first half, revenue was up 10% both as reported and in constant currency. Similar to Q1, we experienced extended sales cycles and delays in China during the second quarter, which was offset by growth across the rest of APJ. However, we are looking for China to provide good growth in the latter part of the second half as opportunities that have been delayed begin to close.
APJ added a number of new customers in Q2, including several from the financial services industry in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and China and at Tokyo Star Bank in Japan. Initiatives around risk, compliance and marketing as well as cost reduction were the key drivers of these wins. New wins in the government sector included the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in Australia. Upgrades and expansions included the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation, DiGi Telecom in Malaysia and Star Track Express in Australia.
Regarding our growth initiatives, we are on track to reach the higher end of the 35 to 45 territories we targeted to add in 2012. I'd like to add that we are pleased with our return on investment from the territories added during 2008 to 2011. 
Consulting Services revenues grew 13% in constant currency in Q2 and 14% in constant currency for the first half of 2012. We continue to add consultants both onshore and offshore to get to a lower blended cost for our customers, which in turn helps to increase demand as well as improve margins. In addition, we continue to invest in new service offers and add to existing ones. However, our Consulting Services growth rate is slowing, and we are likely to see low-double digit constant currency growth during the second half and mid-single digit as reported.
And last, our increased investments in R&D continue to bring innovation and industry first to the market. We recently released our unified big data architecture and software to help companies bridge the worlds of classic business intelligence and new big data analytics.
Hadoop plays a key role in this unified data architecture for analytics. Consistent with Teradata's view of workload-specific platforms to optimize analytical ecosystems, we see Hadoop as a workload-specific platform for storing, ingesting and transforming the new and the high-volume big data and with Aster allowing for the rapid discovery of the gold nuggets that reside in the Hadoop detailed data.
Aster enables knowledge workers to utilize mainstream analytic BI tools that they are already familiar with. This, in turn, makes it easier for companies to deploy analytics on Hadoop and reduce the dependency on expensive and scarce big data engineers for big data analytics. And of course, our core Teradata Active Data Warehouse is the platform that provides unsurpassed integration of all data from all data sources and the real-time delivery of analytics to the front lines. We are clearly gaining momentum in the market with Aster. And although still a small number, we had our largest revenue quarter in Q2, and Aster's pipeline and proof of concepts have grown significantly. 
Marketing, as well as analytics, will continue to be a top priority for most companies over the next several years and is in an area we will continue to increase our investments. In June, we strengthened our integrated marketing management solution with the completion of our acquisition of eCircle, which is the leading digital marketing company in Europe. We are in the process of taking this solution globally. And most recently, Teradata Aprimo was named to the Leaders Quadrant of the Magic Quadrant for Multi-Channel Campaign Management Report by Gartner.
The combination of Aprimo, eCircle, Aster and Teradata will provide an end-to-end marketing solution once integrated that will encompass social, mobile, the Web as well as all traditional channels while providing next-generation digital marketing capabilities with seamless analytics across all marketing data. Longer term, the positions we have established in data warehousing, big data and integrated marketing management should allow us to continue to grow revenue double digits plus. 
Turning to guidance. Teradata and analytics overall tend to receive a high priority from companies during uncertain economic environments. However, we are not immune from the various negative impacts of these environments that we are now seeing, and this is reflected in our revenue guidance.
We are increasing our constant currency revenue growth guidance by 1 point, from 13% to 15% to 14% to 16% for the full year. But the guidance implies a slowing of constant currency revenue growth in the second half to 9% to 13% versus the 20% growth we saw in the first half. As it relates to EPS, due to the overachievement we had in Q2, we are increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance $0.12 to $2.72 to $2.82 per share. 
I will now turn it over to Steve, who will provide more details on our financial results as well as our updated full year guidance. Steve?"

Our Q2 2012 results continue to reflect the strong qualities of our business model, driving revenue that increased 18% in constant currency and record non-GAAP product and overall gross margins and record operating margin. This drove non-GAAP EPS of $0.77, which is a 28% increase from the prior year period. 
Second quarter revenue of $665 million was up 14% from the second quarter of 2011. Revenue for the first half of the year was up 18%, 20% in constant currency. As you're probably aware, currency moved against us during the course of the quarter a full percentage point, which resulted in approximately $9 million less revenue in our reported results than would have been the case using the April 30, 2012, exchange rates when we updated our 2012 guidance on May 3, 2012. In other words, our Q2 revenue would have been approximately $9 million higher than the $665 million reported.
Product revenue of $321 million was up 19% from the second quarter of 2011, up 23% in constant currency. For the first half of the year, product revenue was up 25%, 27% in constant currency. Services revenue, up $344 million, was up 10% or up 13% in constant currency from the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, services revenue was up 11% or up 14% in constant currency.  
Within services revenue for the quarter, Consulting Services revenue was up 9%, up 13% in constant currency. And maintenance services revenue was up 12%, up 14% in constant currency. Year-to-date, both Consulting Services and maintenance services revenue were up 11%, with Consulting Services up 14% in constant currency, while maintenance services was up 13% in constant currency.
During my discussion today, I will be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, excluding special items. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures identifying the special items is available in our earnings release and on the Investor page of our website.
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2012 improved 260 basis points to 58.5%, a record gross margin for the company. The increase in gross margin was driven by a greater proportion of product revenue versus services revenue as well as improved product and services gross margins. 
Product gross margin in the second quarter was a record 70.4%, up 190 basis points from 68.5% in the second quarter of 2011. The improvement was primarily driven by less 1000 series appliance product revenue in Q 2012 compared to the product revenue mix in Q 2011. As a percentage of total product revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q2 was 12.5%, at the midpoint of the 10% to 15% expected range we have previously discussed. Services gross margin in the quarter was 47.4% versus 44.9% in Q2 2011. The increase was primarily due to increased maintenance services margins in EMEA and the Americas as well as the improved Consulting Services margins in APJ. 
Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expense of $162 million increased $13 million or 9% from Q2 2011. The increase in SG&A for the quarter, which was reduced by approximately $4 million from the currency movement benefit, was primarily driven by the increased number of sales territories as well as higher commissions due to the strong revenue growth generated in the quarter. Despite the investment in sales territories and higher sales commissions in the quarter and year-to-date, SG&A continues to decrease as a percentage of revenue, approximately a full percentage point lower in both the quarter and the first half year-over-year comparisons. 
R&D in the quarter was $40 million versus $37 million in the second quarter of 2011. However, for the full year, we continue to expect that non-GAAP R&D expense should grow approximately 10% over 2011, factoring in the full year impact of the R&D expense from the acquisitions.
As we've mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line in our income statement. Total non-GAAP R&D expense for the second quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally developed software, was approximately $59 million compared to approximately $55 million in Q2 2011. Year-to-date, total R&D expense was $118 million versus the $106 million last year.
As a result of all the items in the second quarter, Teradata achieved its highest operating margin ever. Operating margin in Q2 was 28.2%, a significant increase over the 24.3% generated in Q2 2011 which, coincidentally, Teradata achieved the highest operating margin since going public. The contribution from higher revenue and favorable revenue mix offset the increased operating investments. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate in Q2 2012 was 30% versus 25% in Q2 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30% compared to 27% for the same period in 2011. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter increased as we currently are forecasting a higher proportional amount of earnings being taxed in the U.S. which, as you know, has a higher statutory tax rate. Additionally, the Q2 2012 rate reflected no benefit related to the federal R&D tax credit due to its current expiration. 
We are raising our expectation for full year GAAP tax rate 1 percentage point to approximately 28% and expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate as the majority of the non-GAAP pretax items, including stock-based compensation expense as well as the special items, are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2012 assumes that the federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively restated for the full year in Q4 of 2012.
In terms of earnings per share, our Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.65 versus $0.60 in Q2 2011. Noncash stock-based compensation expenses included our GAAP EPS. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.16 per share for the full year 2012. This reflects the normal increase in stock-based compensation expense as well as the increase in stock-based compensation expense related to our acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we also had some special items, which totaled approximately $0.08 per share. Excluding the impact of the stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $0.12 in Q2, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.77 in Q2 2012 compared to $0.60 in Q2 2011 for a year-over-year increase of 28%. In Q 2011, GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were the same at $0.60 as approximately $0.13 of gains from equity investments offset the stock-based compensation and the other special items. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $152 million in Q2 2012 versus $179 million in the second quarter of 2011. After $39 million of capital expenditures, which includes additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment, versus $33 million in the second quarter of 2011, we generated $113 million of free cash flow versus the $146 million of free cash flow generated in Q2 2011. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily driven by the timing of receivables or collections between Q1 and Q2 of both years. We had stronger collections in Q1 2012 versus the same period last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, which normalizes the timing of the receivables and the related collections between Q1 and Q2, free cash flow was up $50 million from the $225 million generated in the first half of 2011. As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $821 million of cash, a $157 million decrease from March 31, 2012, as cash used for share repurchases, acquisitions and other investing activities outweighed the cash provided by operating activities in the quarter. Approximately 40% of our cash balance is available in the U.S., with the remainder being held offshore. With respect to accounts receivable, days sales outstanding was 72 days as of June 30, 2012, down from the 74 days at the end of Q1 and in line with the 71 days at the end of June in 2011. 
With respect to deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was down $44 million from March 31, 2012 compared to June 30, 2012, down $39 million in constant currency. Historically, with the exception of last year, deferred revenue declined approximately $19 million between March 31 to June 30 each year due to a high percentage of maintenance contracts that are renewed in Q1 each year. However, in 2011, deferred revenue only declined $8 million from March 31, 2011 to June 30, 2011 as we had approximately $10 million of partial year maintenance agreement additions for existing customers roll over from Q1 2011 to Q2 2011. So if you normalize this in 2011, the prior year decline was right on track, down approximately $18 million. 
Overall, current deferred revenue as of June 30, 2012, increased $18 million from June 30, 2011, or $30 million in constant currency. And more specifically, deferred revenue for maintenance and subscriptions was up approximately 13% in constant currency for the same period. Maintenance and subscriptions continue to account for greater than 70% of our deferred revenue balance, with the remainder attributable to the product transactions. Deferred revenue related to product transactions can be inconsistent quarter-over-quarter as was reflected in the March 31, 2012, deferred revenue balance. 
Product transaction deferred revenue was down $20 million from March 31, 2012 to June 30, 2012. However, to add some color around the amount of the product transaction deferral as of June 30, 2012, the amount is consistent with 6 out of the last 8 quarters. This movement is a direct reflection of our business model and revenue recognition policies and practices but does not reflect changes in backlog or expectations for future periods. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currencies impacted the second quarter of 2012 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons throughout the remainder of 2012. And as stated earlier, we now see an additional point of headwind from currency on our full year revenue growth as well as 1 point of additional currency headwind in Q3 and in Q4.
Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of July and assuming currency exchange rates do not change throughout the remainder of 2012, we acknowledge that currency to create about 2 points of headwind for us for the full year and 3 points of headwind in Q3 and 1 point of headwind in Q4. The effect of the change in the exchange rates from April month end, used to base our 2012 revenue guidance on May 3, to the July month-end rates, used to base our 2012 revenue guidance today, was a reduction of revenue of approximately $20 million for the second half of 2012, spread generally ratable over Q3 and Q4. 
Turning to guidance for 2012. As it relates to revenue, we are increasing our expectation for constant currency revenue growth from 13% to 15% to 14% to 16%. However, due to the additional point of headwind created by currency movement during Q2, our reported revenue growth rate guidance remains the same at 12% to 14% growth. 
As it relates to EPS, we continue to expect that total gross margin as a percentage of revenue in Q3 2012 is estimated to be reasonably consistent with our 2011 full year's gross margin percentage; in addition, higher R&D expense, up approximately 10% from Q2 2011, including the R&D from acquisitions; in addition, G&A expense to increase in the low-single digits on a percentage basis, again including the ongoing G&A from acquisitions; and finally, higher selling expense from new territories added in 2011 and those territories anticipated to be added in 2012, as well as higher commission expense in presale and consulting expense as the business continues to grow nicely. 
Incorporating all these factors as well as our strong Q2 results into our EPS guidance, we are increasing our expectations for GAAP EPS to $2.34 to $2.44. The GAAP EPS is expected to include approximately the following: $0.16 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions, $0.13 a share of amortization of acquired intangible assets and $0.08 a share of transaction and integration cost. 
Excluding these nonoperational items or special items, we are increasing our expectations for our non-GAAP EPS $0.12 to approximately $2.72 to $2.82 per share in 2012. As you are aware, Teradata generates approximately 95% of our revenue from our existing customer base, which supports the strong long-term consistency of our business model. However, due to the size of our transactions, this can drive short-term variability as we just experienced in Q2, which was driven primarily by the favorable revenue mix. As Mike indicated, Q2 2012 performance was very strong, led by an outstanding revenue mix that produced record operating metrics. 
In the past, we have experienced product gross margin and services gross margin declines up to 270 basis points from Q2 to Q3, driven by product and revenue mix and operating expense increases up to 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue, both of which are examples of short-term variability of our business model from quarter-to-quarter and which would result in estimated yields lower than what we experienced in Q2 of 2012. However, the estimated lower Q3 yields is taken in consideration with our increased guidance. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong results in Q2 especially in light of the negative headwinds regarding the macroeconomic environment. Although we had a very good Q2, we want to be cautious when forecasting the remainder of the year. As we know, no one is immune from macroeconomic forces, although historically, we have fared well on a relative basis even in difficult economic environments. We are extremely pleased with our technology and competitive positioning and remain confident in our ability to execute and drive our business model to leverage our opportunities during the remainder of 2012 and beyond. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

We're having some pretty good results, especially when you look at it in constant currency. The currency headwinds for EMEA in Q3 are about 10 points. And basically, what we're seeing with EMEA as you look at the second half of the year, more impact from currency offset by the strong pipeline as well as we're getting some really strong results out of some of the newer markets, such as Russia, the Middle East and some others. So the net-net, because of the currency, if you look at EMEA organically without the favorable impact of eCircle, it's going to be challenged, as reported, as we look at the second half, but they should grow double digits in constant currency in the second half organically. In the case of APJ, they're pretty back-end loaded. As you mentioned, with China, we expect the deals that have been pushed out and delayed in the first half of the year to start closing, hopefully, some in the third quarter, but most of it's back-end loaded. And when we look at APJ overall, the third quarter, we see it more on the light side with more upside in the fourth quarter. And then overall, when we look at the Americas, the rate of growth they've had over the past several years, we're beginning to see a little bit of a slowdown in the rate of growth simply because of the magnitude of some of the prior year comparables that we're running against there. The activity in everything else in the Americas is very good, and we have pretty good visibility on the third quarter. And in the third quarter, we think we're more towards the lower end of the 9% to 13% we're talking about, the growth in constant currency in the second half. So on the third quarter, as it stands today, we see us more towards the low end of that. And the real upside or the real wildcard comes in the fourth quarter with product revenue. We've got a pretty good handle, as you can imagine, on maintenance and consulting, which operates with a pretty good backlog. The real wildcard will come down to product revenue in the fourth quarter. So -- and back to your original question. You look at first half, second half, we're feeling impacts of the macro. There's definitely some impacts, and it's not just EMEA. You can see it in our consulting business. Some of the customers are doing more in house. Some of the customers are working with smaller chunks of consulting as opposed to broader-based projects. And so we're feeling some of those impacts broadly."

So the magnitude of deceleration in Consulting Services revenue growth isn't quite as large as it appears. So I believe the number, in constant currency without acquisitions, for Consulting Services in 2011, I think it netted down to about 18% growth, okay? And now in the first half of this year, we're looking at a number that's like 13% or 14%. So I just want to get everyone grounded on the amount of deceleration that we're seeing. The -- as far as the consulting and its behavior and slowing down, there's several dimensions to it. So first of all, you can always have some lumpiness. So in the first half of the year, the lumpiness going against us was mostly in the Americas. It was more related to completion of some larger contracts. We had some in the federal government that came to conclusion. Of course, you need to replace them with more contacts. But as you go forward, the size of the contracts in this environment, and we're seeing it more broadly, is companies tend to go with smaller chunks and so forth. You mentioned, historically, our Consulting Services has performed well in a down economy, and right now, I think what we're dealing with is more of an uncertain economy. But the Consulting Services growth rates are good as it relates to our product revenue growth in a down economy. The Consulting Services growth rates are lower if you look at what we grew in 2008 and '09, so I wouldn't take anything there with that."

It really is across the board, so we're having strong interest in financial, retail, e-business and government. And as you can imagine, a lot of them are looking at this platform as an alternative to a lot of their Hadoop projects. So many of them have started to do projects and found that they needed a tool and platform that could help them access the data using some of the standard tools, and Aster, using SQL-MapReduce, is the perfect tool to allow them to apply some of their existing tools against the big data projects that we have going on. So again, we're seeing it in finance, marketing and the e-business side at many of those industries."

So we've gained a lot of traction in the telecommunications industry, financial services industry. The retail industry is doing very well in Europe, and we're gaining traction in newer industry segments, such as manufacturing, so forth. So in Europe right now, we're at a point where relative -- if we forget the macroeconomic conditions, relative to the Americas, the revenue contribution from EMEA is going to continue to increase. That is the trajectory we're on. And we are -- as a percent of our total revenues, EMEA is at a lower percent of contribution than a lot of the U.S.-based technology companies are that are global.

The -- so 95% of our revenue comes from the customer base, and a lot of that revenue is segmented into a subset of our total customer base. And we do have pretty good communication with what's gone on with our customers. I think if you look in our customer base and especially ones with Enterprise Data Warehouses, it's a continual journey. So they're always building out. We're always working with them for return on investments and defining what the metrics are and everything. So as we complete each addition and build out of an Enterprise Data Warehouse, we can show meaningful ROI to the companies. So I think between having out there in the market place that analytics is a big thing and big data is a big thing and all this stuff, with that kind of air cover and then us actually working hand-in-hand with customers and actually delivering ROIs that the C levels can see it and understand it inside corporation, bodes well for our user base. The other macro thing that works in our favor is most companies out there right now have cost reduction initiatives that are somewhere near the top on the list. If it isn't cost reductions, it's trying to constrain cost. And we have a clear methodology documented how we can help take out cost in the process of providing better analytics. So these things tend to work in our favor. That all said, I'm very confident we can always be in the top part of the budget prioritization in corporations, right? But when the budget actually gets cut, it's difficult to have the customer, in many cases, spend more money with you than they did the year before as the budgets are getting cut, and you saw that in 2008 and 2009. So that bodes well for us. The 6690 does present an opportunity for us to accelerate a little bit more floor sweeps as more companies have older non-hybrid storage types of EDWs then they can hit the tipping point and switch over to the 6690. Aprimo and Aster clearly are good revenue growth opportunities for us this year and next year. Especially when we look at the software as a service subscription model with Aprimo, that bodes itself well for consistent revenue growth. Did I catch everything?"

Aaron, first of all, if you're talking specifically about the product mix, it's a little less predictable as far as appliances versus EDW. Obviously, if a customer is upgrading or enhancing and adding to their EDW, we know the product mix, but there are some cases of specific use data warehouses within an EDW customer that may or may not go with an appliance, new customers that we win. Half the time we're winning with an EDW, half with an appliance. Don't take that as a precise answer on the percentage of which, but it's hard to predict the mix of these things in the quarter. So the dynamics of the gross margin is we kind of had the trifecta here in the second quarter, where we had the product revenue growing faster than the services revenue.

Overall, I was pleased with Teradata's execution in Q3 given the macroenvironment. 
Revenue of $647 million was generally in line with what we've expected, growing 7% as reported and 10% in constant currency. 
From our region perspective, EMEA and APJ came in the higher than we had anticipated and the Americas lower. 
We had strong yield on revenue in Q3 with non-GAAP operating income of $166 million, which was up 16% over prior year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.69, which was up 17%. 
Longer-term, we believe we are well-positioned for a sustained double-digit revenue growth. We have market-leading technology and solutions to build upon in 3 large and growing markets: Data Warehousing, Big Data Analytics and Integrated Marketing Management. These are market opportunities that will continue to be top priorities for corporations as they look to gain competitive advantage from big data and the big data channels such as social networks, the web, mobile and serve. 
Shorter-term, we are feeling the impacts of the macroenvironment but at varying degrees in each of the 3 regions. 
In EMEA, we continue to generate double-digit organic constant currency revenue growth overall, but our results would be better if not for the macro headwinds. 
In APJ, we are now closing deals in China that were delayed from the first half. Japan is growing again, and overall, APJ is on track for decent growth for the year. 
But in the Americas, we are now seeing slower growth and 3 factors that are contributing to this. First, we are seeing a little belt tightening and uncertainty on spending with some of our customers. Second, 95% of our revenue comes from our user base on average each year. The Americas' strong product revenue growth the past 2.5 years has added a lot of capacity to many of our customers, which gives them some flexibility as to when to add capacity, especially in times of uncertainty. And third, the prior year comparables such as the 28% revenue growth we had in Q3 last year. 
Although we experienced some minor lumpiness, overall, we believe these are the 3 key headwinds we saw in Q3 and also for what we are seeing in Q4 in the Americas. 
The Americas' third quarter revenue of $384 million was up 2% and up 3% in constant currency over prior year. 
Year-to-date, revenue is up 15% as reported and also in constant currency. 
The win rates remains strong as evidenced with the Americas Q3 data warehouse and customer wins. This was the second highest for any quarter dating back to the year 2000. 
New customers joining Teradata included Fruit of the Womb, which we use our data warehouse to provide a consolidated view of the supply chain and financial metrics across all of the brands. Aviva, one of the fastest-growing life insurance companies in the U.S. which is adding Teradata for predictive analytics, 24/7 Media, which will use Teradata to power its digital forecasting solution. The Men's Warehouse, which will consolidate its data marks into an integrated data warehouse for improved analytics and Monro Energy, a new oil refining company that will use Teradata as its foundation for integrated data and analytics. 
Upgrading expansions include Safe Way, Symantec, CVS and a U.S. Government Law Enforcement Agency. 
In addition, SaaS and Teradata team to establish an innovation lab with the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services. This lab will be used for predictive modeling to understand Medicare program trends and variations and to test new risk approaches. 
Turning Europe, Middle East and Africa, revenue of $156 million for the quarter was up 17% from the third quarter of 2011 and up 28% in constant currency. 
Year-to-date, revenue was up 14% as reported and up 23% in constant currency. 
New accounts wins included one of the largest electronics companies in the world, which will use Teradata to complement their ERP solution to get more granular analytics to cross the company on consumers, products, finance, HR and suppliers. 
And Samsung U.K., which selected Aprimo to manage its direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns. 
Upgrades and expansions from existing customers included DHL, Marist, Pakistan Telecom Mobile, the Swiss Government and Tellus America. 
Asia Pacific and Japan delivered good revenue growth in Q3 with revenue of $107 million, which was up 14% over prior year and up 16% in constant currency. 
New customer wins included PC Mall, the largest computer electronics retailer in China and is now our first Aprimo customer in China. SP Aus Net, the leading Australian utility, which will use Teradata for smart network management, integrating data from over 600,000 smart meter and network monitors to help adjust to them and to give customers greater ability to manage their own power comsumption. HTC, the smartphone manufacturer and China Eastern Airlines, which will implement an enterprise data warehouse starting with Customer Relationship Analytics. 
Offerings and expansions in the quarter included Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Standard Chartered Bank of Korea, Bank of Shanghai, Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation, West Pac Bank in Australia, in Japan and Yahoo! Japan. 
Teradata's focus today in going forward is centered on driving value from big data for customers. We are doing this in 2 areas: One, by providing analytics for all data: big data, traditional data, any type of data; and two, by providing the customers the ability to leverage all channels to drive value including social networks, the web and mobile. 
The key is to have all data and all channels working in concert, past, present and future. This is critical of corporations or government agencies are going to realize the full potential of the new big data. 
And in the case of marketing, we are focused on providing an end to end solution for our customers and a solution that is available on the cloud, on premise or both. 
Our integrated marketing management solution encompasses marketing operations, analytics for all data, multichannel campaign management and the execution and delivery of marketing offers for all channels. 
We see marketing organizations as the key driver of the analytics today and that they will play an even bigger role in many corporations for the years to come. They are in the best position to enable corporations to gain competitive advantage from the new big data insights and the new big data channels. 
Last week, at our Annual Global Customer Conference, we had over 3,900 attendees with over 300 sessions and over 200 customer presentations, all focused on analytics and driving business value. There's no other event like this in the world. 
Key Teradata announcement included 3 centered on big data analytics. First, we launched our unified data architecture and integrated environment that brings together multiple data technologies. This foundation leverages a best of breed and complementary capabilities of Teradata, Aster and Hadoop. 
Second, we demonstrated our Aster big analytics appliance, which is an industry first, bringing together Aster's SQL-MapReduce capabilities, that works platform for Hadoop and our Aster's analytics portfolio, which now has more than 50 prepackaged analytics both from used cases. 
The Aster big analytics appliance is an integrated Hadoop Aster environment supported by Teradata. 
It's the adoption of big data analytics and at the lower cost by allowing existing employees to use the same SQL tools and skill sets that they already use today for traditional data analytics. 
This is in contrast to hiring expensive and scarce engineering resources to do analytics on the more structured data coming from social media, the web, mobile, call centers and more in order to gain insights in the customers from these new channels. 
Third, we announced significant advancements to our database technology including new workload management functionality and new tools to simplify and automate database management and to expand self service capabilities for our customers. 
It is key that we continue to advance our active enterprise data warehouse capabilities to help our customers manage the ongoing data exposure explosion. 
Data warehouse demands and scale are only going to get more and more challenging as evidenced by Teradata now having 34 customers with data byte warehouses. 
We also made several integrated marketing management announcements at the conference, 2 that were being data related were: Our digital Messaging Center. This solutions comes from circle and is a comprehensive cloud-based solution for the next generation of digital marketing. It is a centralized hub where all cross channel digital messaging activity can be managed. 
And second, we announced our new social network segmentation along with payor inbound and outbound active marketing integration for our multichannel campaign management solution. 
Regarding our growth initiatives, we are attracting to reach a higher end of the 35 to 45 range per sales territory additions that we targeted for 2012 and we continue to invest in tools and service offers to help customers extract more value from their data and also to make us more efficient. However, our hiring has slowed from recent levels given our lower Consulting Services growth of 10% as reported and 13% in constant currency in the quarter. 
Turning to guidance, we now expect revenue growth for the full year to be at the lower end of our previous guidance ranges and we expect earnings per share to be in the middle to higher end of our previous guidance ranges. 
Before I turn the call over to Steve, I want to summarize that I am confident that our competitive position has never been stronger. Our team continues to execute well and we are well positioned in 3 growing and strategic markets for the long-term. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for additional details. Steve?"

Teradata have generated a third quarter revenue of $647 million, which was up 7% from the third quarter of 2011, up 10% in constant currency. We've invested a good result given the uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment. 
Revenue for the first 9 months of the year was up 14%, 17% in constant currency. 
Product revenue of $3.6 million was up 7% from the third quarter of 2011, up 9% in constant currency. 
For the first 9 months of the year, product revenue is up 18%, up 21% in constant currency. 
In terms of linearity, product revenue in the quarter was more back and loaded in Q3 2012. 
Services revenue of $341 million was up 8% or up 12% in constant currency from the third quarter 2011. 
Year-to-date, services revenue was up 10%, up 13% in constant currency. 
Within services revenue for the quarter, Consulting Services revenue was up 10%, up 13% in constant currency and Maintenance Services revenue was up 6%, up 9% in constant currency. 
Year-to-date, Consulting Services revenue was up 11%, up 14% in constant currency and Maintenance Services revenue was up 10%, 12% in constant currency. 
During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and special items. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures identifying these items is available in our earnings release and also on the Investor page of our website. 
We had a solid operating execution and performance with gross and operating margin improvements, driven by disciplined operating fundamentals. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2012 improved 150 basis point to 56.9%. Product gross margin in the third quarter was a very strong 70.3%, up 340 basis points from the 66.9% in the third quarter of 2011. The second consecutive quarter of the team generating very strong product gross margin. 
The improvement was primarily driven by favorable revenue mix in Q3 2012, compared to the product revenue mix in Q3 2011. 
As a percentage of total revenue, our 2,000 series appliance revenue in Q3 2012 was generally at the midpoint of the 10% to 15% expected range we have discussed previously. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was a solid 25%, slightly higher than the 44.9% in Q3 2011. 
Turning to our operating expense structure. SG&A expense of $163 million increased $9 million or 6% from Q3 2011 with the majority of the increase being in the selling expense. 
R&D, Research and Development in the quarter was $40 million versus $39 million in the third quarter of 2011. 
Year-to-date, R&D expense was $123 million, up 13% versus the prior period. 
As we mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalize software development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of generally developed software, was approximately $60 million or approximately 20% of our product revenue.  This compares with approximately $55 million in Q3 2011. 
As a reminder, this capitalized cost, when amortized, are then added back to the income statement as product cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin. 
Year-to-date, total R&D spend was $178 million or approximately 19% of our product revenue versus $161 million last year. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 25.6%, 200 basis point increase over the 23.6% generated in Q3 2011. This contribution from higher revenue and favorable revenue mix offset the increased operating investments. 
Year-to-date, operating margin improvement was even better, increasing 240 basis point or 26% for the first 9 months of 2012 versus 23.6% for the same period last year. 
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate in Q3 2012 was 27.3% versus 28.1% in Q3 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 28.3%, compared to 28.9% for the same period in 2011. 
Year-to-date 2012 effective tax rate do not reflect the tax benefit related to the Federal R&D tax credit due to its current expiration. 
We continue to expect our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27% and expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 28% or 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP tax rate and as a majority of the non-GAAP pretax items, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as special items are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2012 assumes that the Federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively restated for the full year in Q4 2012. If the credit is not reinstated by the end of the year, our tax expense will be negatively impacted by approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
In terms of earnings per share, our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.60 versus $0.51 in Q3 2011. Noncash stock-based compensation expenses is included in our GAAP EPS. 
During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.16 per share for the full year 2012. 
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $0.09 in Q3, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.69 in Q3 2012, compared to $0.59 in Q3 2011 for a year-over-year increase of 17%. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $107 million in Q3 2012 versus $102 million in the third quarter of 2011. 
After $40 million of capital expenditures, which include additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment versus $27 million in the third quarter of 2011, we generated $67 million of free cash flow versus $75 million free cash flow generated in Q3 of 2011. 
The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to increased investments in property and equipment and capitalized software development expenses in Q3 2012 versus the same period last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $342 million, increasing $42 million year-on-year. 
As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less cash expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had $909 million of cash, an $88 million increase from June 30, 2012. 
Approximately 50% of our cash balance is available in the U.S. with the remainder being held offshore and as I said before, expect that the rate of our share repurchases will continue to fluctuate each quarter taking into account among other things working capital needs, our stock price, alternate uses of cash, our U.S. cash balances and economic and market conditions. 
With respect to accounts receivable. Days sales outstanding or DSO was 74 days as of September 30, 2012, relatively consistent with June 30, 2012, and September 30, 2011. 
Accounts Receivable increased 19% compared to revenue increased of 7%. 
The primary driver of the increase of accounts receivable was the timing of a product revenue transactions during Q3 2012, which were more back and loaded when compared to Q3 2011 with respect to deferred revenue. 
With the recent fluctuations in our deferred revenue, particularly as it relates to product transactions, which as I said in the past can be inconsistent or lumpy quarter-over-quarter, we will be presenting the short-term and the long-term deferred revenue balances on our balance sheet. 
By discussion, that follows will address total deferred revenue. 
Total deferred revenue of $382 million as of September 30, 2012, was down $52 million from the June 30, 2012, and up $7 million from September 30, 2011. Deferred maintenance of the subscription revenue continues to increase at a rate consistent with our expectations. 
As I said in the past, deferred revenue associated with maintenance and subscriptions generally account for greater than 3% of the deferred revenue balance. 
That said, over the past 16 quarter ends, deferred product transaction revenue has range from $70 million to $100 million. As of September 30, 2012, deferred revenue related to product transactions was in this historical range. The movement in product transaction deferred revenue is a direct reflection of the nature of our business model and revenue recognition practices and does not reflect changes at backlog or expectations for future periods. 
With respect to currency movement. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact in our future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website, detailing how currencies impacted the third quarter of 2012 and now this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2012. 
Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of October and assuming the currency rate exchange rates do not change throughout the remainder of 2012, we expect a 2 point headwind currency for the full year. We expect a 1 point headwind on our Q4 revenue comparison. 
Turning to guidance for the full year 2012 as it relates to revenue. As a result of the impact of the macroeconomic environment is having on overall business activity around the world and more specifically on CapEx expenditures, we now expect our growth in our reported revenue for the year to be in the low end of our prior year guidance of 12% to 14%. 
On a constant currency basis we now expect 2012 revenue at the low end of our prior guidance range of 14% to 16%. 
As it relates to EPS. We expect EPS to be in the middle to the high end of our previous guidance range of $2.34 to $2.44. This GAAP EPS is expected to include approximately the following: $0.16 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions, $0.14 a share of amortization of acquired intangible assets and $0.07 a share of transaction and integration costs. 
Excluding these nonoperational items or special items, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the middle to the high end of our prior guidance range of $2.72 to $2.82 per share for the full year. 
In closing, we are pleased with our year-to-date results and we continue to deliver solid performance. Importantly, we realized growth across all our 3 geographical operating reporting regions despite continued uncertainty in the worldwide economy. We have done this by consistently investing in our solutions, services and our go-to-market strategy and we will continue to be disciplined in managing our operations and capital. Teradata's unique combination of technologies strength and differentiation, Consulting Services excellence and our global capability should deliver long-term sustainable increases in revenue, earnings and cash flow. 
Many of you attended our Customers User Group Conference last week and experienced firsthand the strong and positive relationships that exist between Teradata, our customers and our partners. And many of you have commented that our customers repeatedly said that Teradata is true technology leadership in terms of integrating data for complex analytics, both structured and multi-structured data, scalability, concurrency, mixed workloads and workload management, as well as overall customer support. 
However, in the short-term, the global uncertainty may make it real more difficult for investments to be in proved. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So what happens is as IT budgets and our customers and the user base get a little bit tighter with how they're spending money right now, the added capacity that we put out there over the past 2.5 years gives the customers more flexibility than they had, say, 1 year ago or 2 years ago. So they're able to optimize and figure out how to use the capacity that we do have because there's more of it for different functions. So there might be some uses that are more strategic than other users, there might be different priorities they can give to different users and different types of applications and so forth. And it just gives them a little more flexibility to hold off and to add capacity at a later date. In terms of your question regarding so how long might we see this, it's difficult to tell at this juncture. It's once again it's related to the belt tightening. So if we don't have belt-tightening like we've run into right now, the impact of the added capacity we put up there is minimized. If we continue that belt-tightening, then this will linger on for a while. I think we'll be in a better position to answer that second part of the question when we get to the next earnings call early next year."

Everything that I just said answer to Juancy's question is related specifically to the Americas, all right?

So we've been able to actually accelerate and step up our new customer wins in the Americas in 2011 and also in 2012 and actually increase it over the first half of this year, the one in Q2 and Q3. So that piece is going pretty well. There is an impact as it relates to new customer wins, yes, the decisions got extended a little bit longer, but we've had a pipeline of new customers that we're always working from and we'll continue to materialize and also under some belt-tightening, the size of the deals may be smaller than they would be when we're having for the new customer wins, that is, they might be smaller than in a more robust type economic environment.

I appreciate that's not exactly a clear answer, but if a customer has capacity there, they're going to use it one way or another, but some of that capacity is being used at times as more for luxury than mission-critical."

So if you take a look at what we've done over the past 3 or 4 years with our workload specific platform family is we've picked more of the customers enterprise with data warehouse platforms that are optimized for a specific workloads and captured more wallet share than we have previously. And I think that's reflected in the strong revenue growth we've had over the past 2 years. So the types of workload specific platforms that we've come to market with have not cannibalized enterprise data warehouse and our product revenue growth for the enterprise data warehouse has the 6000 machine has been very, very high this year as it was last year, all right. So Teradata went from advocating an architectural where everything should be integrated into an enterprise data warehouse and a corporation to one where we advocate integrating all other data that's relevant to the business and think of it as an integrated, active data warehouse for all the business to work from and have a single view with the customer and a single version of the truth and everything else. With the emergence of Hadoop, we see this as a best-in-class environment and at a low cost as you mentioned with the commodity hardware and open-source type software to ingest the huge amounts of data that are coming from the new big data sources and also to transform and store that data. So this is a net new opportunity and a net new technology for our customers to adopt and we advocate that they do adopt it. But then the question gets to how do you add value or get value out all these massive multi-structured non-relational types of data and that's where Aster comes into play and doing it with SQL types of DI tools and the skill sets that most workers have in the mainstream market because to do the analytics with Hadoop takes very expensive and scarce engineering resources."

Overall, I was pleased with Teradata's execution in Q3 given the macroenvironment.  Revenue of $647 million was generally in line with what we have expected, growing 7% as reported and 10% in constant currency.  From a region perspective, EMEA and APJ came in higher than we had anticipated and the Americas lower.  
We had strong yield on revenue in Q3 with non-GAAP operating income of $166 million, which was up 16% over prior year, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 which was up 17%. 
Longer-term, we believe we are well positioned for a sustained double-digit revenue growth. We have market-leading technology and solutions to build upon in 3 large and growing markets: data warehousing, big data analytics and Integrated Marketing Management. These are market opportunities that will continue to be top priorities for corporations as they look to gain competitive advantage from big data and the big data channels such as social networks, the web, mobile and sensor. 
Shorter-term, we are feeling the impacts of the macroenvironment but of varying degrees in each of the 3 regions. 
In EMEA, we continue to generate double-digit organic constant currency revenue growth overall, but our results would be better if not for the macro headwinds.  In APJ, we are now closing deals in China that were delayed from the first half. Japan is growing again, and overall, APJ is on track for decent growth for the year. 
But in the Americas, we are now seeing slower growth, and 3 factors that are contributing to this. First, we are seeing a little belt tightening and uncertainty on spending with some of our customers. Second, 95% of our revenue comes from our user base on average each year. The Americas' strong product revenue growth the past 2.5 years has added a lot of capacity to many of our customers, which gives them some flexibility as to when to add capacity especially in times of uncertainty. And third, the prior year comparables, such as the 28% revenue growth we had in Q3 last year. 
Although we experienced some minor lumpiness, overall, we believe these are the 3 key headwinds we saw in Q3 and also for what we are seeing in Q4 in the Americas.  
The Americas' third quarter revenue of $384 million was up 2% and up 3% in constant currency over prior year.  Year-to-date, revenue is up 15% as reported and also in constant currency. The win rates remained strong as evidenced with the Americas Q3 data warehouse new customer wins, which was the second highest for any quarter dating back to the year 2000. 
New customers joining Teradata included Fruit of the Womb, which will use our data warehouse to provide a consolidated view of the supply chain and financial metrics across all of their brands; Aviva, one of the fastest-growing life insurance companies in the U.S. which is adding Teradata for predictive analytics; 24/7 Media, which will use Teradata to power its digital forecasting solution; The Men's Wearhouse which will consolidate its data markets into an integrated data warehouse for improved analytics; and Monroe Energy, a new oil refining company that will use Teradata as its foundation for integrated data and analytics. 
Upgrades and expansions included Safeway, Symantec, CVS and a U.S. Government Law Enforcement Agency.  In addition, SaaS and Teradata teamed to establish an innovation lab with the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services. This lab will be used for predictive modeling to understand Medicare program trends and variations, and to test new risk approaches. 
Turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa, revenue of $156 million for the quarter was up 17% from the third quarter of 2011 and up 28% in constant currency. Year-to-date, revenue was up 14% as reported and up 23% in constant currency. 
New account wins included one of the largest electronics companies in the world, which will use Teradata to complement their ERP solution to get more granular analytics across the company on consumers, products, finance, HR and suppliers; and Samsung U.K., which selected Aprimo to manage its direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns.  Upgrades and expansions from existing customers included DHL, Maersk, Pakistan Telecom Mobile, the Swiss government and TeliaSonera. 
Asia Pacific and Japan delivered good revenue growth in Q3 with revenue of $107 million, which was up 14% over prior year, and up 16% in constant currency. New customer wins included PC Mall, the largest computer electronics retailer in China and is now our first Aprimo customer in China; SP AusNet, the leading Australian utility, which will use Teradata for smart network management, integrating data from over 600,000 smart meter and network monitors to help adjust to them and to give customers greater ability to manage their own power consumption; HTC, the smartphone manufacturer; and China Eastern Airlines, which will implement an enterprise data warehouse starting with Customer Relationship analytics.  Upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Standard Chartered Bank of Korea, Bank of Shanghai, Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation, Westpac Bank in Australia, Nakashima Co. [ph] in Japan and Yahoo! Japan. 
Teradata's focus today and going forward is centered on driving value from big data for our customers. We are doing this in 2 areas: one, by providing analytics for all data: big data, traditional data, any type of data; and two, by providing our customers the ability to leverage all channels to drive value, including social networks, the web and mobile. 
The key is to have all data and all channels working in concert, past, present and future. This is critical if corporations or government agencies are going to realize the full potential of the new big data.  And in the case of marketing, we are focused on providing an end-to-end solution for our customers, and a solution that is available on the cloud, on premise or both. 
Our Integrated Marketing Management solution encompasses marketing operations, analytics for all data, multichannel campaign management and the execution and delivery of marketing offers for all channels. 
We see marketing organizations as the key driver of the analytics today and that they will play an even bigger role in many corporations for the years to come. They are in the best position to enable corporations to gain competitive advantage from the new big data insights and the new big data channels. 
Last week, at our Annual Global Customer Conference, we had over 3,900 attendees with over 300 sessions and over 200 customer presentations, all focused on analytics and driving business value. There's no other event like this in the world. 
Key Teradata announcements included 3 centered on big data analytics. First, we launched our Unified Data Architecture, an integrated environment that brings together multiple data technologies. This foundation leverages the best of breed and complementary capabilities of Teradata, Aster and Hadoop. 
Second, we demonstrated our Aster Big Analytics Appliance, which is an industry first, bringing together Aster's SQL-MapReduce capabilities, the Hortonworks Data Platform for Hadoop and our Aster's Analytics Portfolio, which now has more than 50 prepackaged analytics built from used cases. 
The Aster Big Analytics Appliance is an integrated Hadoop-Aster environment supported by Teradata. 
It's the adoption of big data analytics and at a lower cost by allowing existing employees to use the same SQL BI tools and skill sets that they already use today for traditional data analytics. 
This is in contrast to hiring expensive and scarce engineering resources to do analytics on the multi-structured data coming from social media, the web, mobile, call centers and more in order to gain insights into customers from these new channels. 
Third, we announced significant advancements to our database technology including new workload management functionality and new tools to simplify and automate database management and to expand self-service capabilities for our customers. 
It is key that we continue to advance our active enterprise data warehouse capabilities to help our customers manage the ongoing data explosion. 
Data warehouse demands and scale are only going to get more and more challenging as evidenced by Teradata now having 34 customers with petabyte warehouses. 
We also made several Integrated Marketing Management's announcements at the conference. Two that were being data related were: our Digital Messaging Center. This solution comes from eCircle and is a comprehensive cloud-based solution for the next generation of digital marketing. It is a centralized hub where all cross-channel digital messaging activity can be managed. 
And second, we announced our new social network segmentation along with tighter inbound and outbound active marketing integration for our multichannel campaign management solution. 
Regarding our growth initiatives, we are attracting to reach the higher end of the 35 to 45 range per sales territory additions that we targeted for 2012. And we continue to invest in tools and service offers to help customers extract more value from their data and also to make us more efficient. However, our hiring has slowed from recent levels given our lower Consulting Services growth of 10% as reported and 13% in constant currency in the quarter. 
Turning to guidance, we now expect revenue growth for the full year to be at the lower end of our previous guidance ranges. And we expect earnings per share to be in the middle to higher end of our previous guidance ranges. 
Before I turn the call over to Steve, I want to summarize that I am confident that our competitive position has never been stronger. Our team continues to execute well and we are well positioned in 3 growing and strategic markets for the long-term. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for additional details. Steve?"

Teradata generated a third quarter revenue of $647 million, which was up 7% from the third quarter of 2011, up 10% in constant currency. We've invested a good result given the uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment. 
Revenue for the first 9 months of the year was up 14%, 17% in constant currency. 
Product revenue of $306 million was up 7% from the third quarter of 2011, up 9% in constant currency.  For the first 9 months of the year, product revenue was up 18%, up 21% in constant currency. In terms of linearity, product revenue in the quarter was more back-end loaded in Q3 2012. 
Services revenue of $341 million was up 8%, or up 12% in constant currency from the third quarter 2011. Year-to-date, services revenue was up 10%, up 13% in constant currency. Within services revenue for the quarter, Consulting Services revenue was up 10%, up 13% in constant currency. And Maintenance Services revenue was up 6%, up 9% in constant currency.  Year-to-date, Consulting Services revenue was up 11%, up 14% in constant currency, and Maintenance Services revenue was up 10%, 12% in constant currency. 
During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and special items. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures identifying these items is available in our earnings release and also on the Investor page of our website. 
We had solid operating execution and performance with gross and operating margin improvements, driven by disciplined operating fundamentals. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2012 improved 150 basis point to 56.9%. Product gross margin in the third quarter was very strong, 70.3%, up 340 basis points from the 66.9% in the third quarter of 2011, the second consecutive quarter of the team generating very strong product gross margin. The improvement was primarily driven by favorable revenue mix in Q3 2012, compared to the product revenue mix in Q3 2011. 
As a percentage of total revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q3 2012 was generally at the midpoint of the 10% to 15% expected range we have discussed previously. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was a solid 45%, slightly higher than the 44.9% in Q3 2011. 
Turning to our operating expense structure. SG&A expense of $163 million increased $9 million or 6% from Q3 2011, with the majority of the increase being in the selling expense. 
R&D, Research and Development, in the quarter was $40 million versus $39 million in the third quarter of 2011.  Year-to-date, R&D expense was $123 million, up 13% versus the prior period. 
As we mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of generally developed software, was approximately $60 million or approximately 20% of our product revenue.  This compares with approximately $55 million in Q3 2011. 
As a reminder, this capitalized cost, when amortized, are then added back to the income statement as product cost of revenue, which reduces product gross margin. 
Year-to-date, total R&D spend was $178 million or approximately 19% of our product revenue versus $161 million last year. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 25.6%, a 200 basis point increase over the 23.6% generated in Q3 2011. The contribution from the higher revenue and favorable revenue mix offset the increased operating investments. 
Year-to-date, operating margin improvement was even better, increasing 240 basis points or 26% for the first 9 months of 2012 versus 23.6% for the same period last year. 
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate in Q3 2012 was 27.3% versus 28.1% in Q3 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 28.3%, compared to 28.9% for the same period in 2011. 
Our year-to-date 2012 effective tax rate do not reflect the tax benefit related to the Federal R&D tax credit due to its current expiration. 
We continue to expect our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, and expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 28%, or 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate as the majority of the non-GAAP pretax items, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as the special items are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2012 assumes that the Federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively reinstated for the full year in Q4 of 2012. If the credit is not reinstated by the end of the year, our tax expense will be negatively impacted by approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
In terms of earnings per share, our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.60 versus $0.51 in Q3 2011. Noncash stock-based compensation expense is included in our GAAP EPS. 
During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.16 per share for the full year 2012. 
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $0.09 in Q3, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.69 in Q3 2012, compared to $0.59 in Q3 2011 for a year-over-year increase of 17%. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $107 million in Q3 2012 versus $102 million in the third quarter of 2011. 
After $40 million of capital expenditures, which include additions to capitalized software development cost and expenditures for property and equipment versus $27 million in the third quarter of 2011, we generated $67 million of free cash flow versus $75 million of free cash flow generated in Q3 of 2011. 
The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to increased investments in property and equipment and capitalized software development expenses in Q3 2012 versus the same period last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $342 million, increasing $42 million year-on-year. 
As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less cash expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had $909 million of cash, an $88 million increase from June 30, 2012. 
Approximately 50% of our cash balance is available in the U.S. with the remainder being held offshore. And as I said before, expect that the rate of our share repurchases will continue to fluctuate each quarter taking into account among other things, our working capital needs, our stock price, alternative uses of cash, our U.S. cash balances and economic and market conditions. 
With respect to accounts receivable. Day sales outstanding or DSO was 74 days as of September 30, 2012, relatively consistent with June 30, 2012, and September 30, 2011. 
Accounts Receivable increased 19% compared to revenue increase of 7%. 
The primary driver of the increase in accounts receivable was the timing of the product revenue transactions during Q3 2012, which were more back-end loaded when compared to Q3 2011. 
With respect to deferred revenue.  With the recent fluctuations in our deferred revenue, particularly as it relates to product transactions, which as I said in the past, can be inconsistent or lumpy quarter-over-quarter, we will be presenting the short-term and the long-term deferred revenue balances on our balance sheet.  My discussion that follows will address total deferred revenue. 
Total deferred revenue of $382 million as of September 30, 2012, was down $52 million from the June 30, 2012, and up $7 million from September 30, 2011. Deferred maintenance and subscription revenue continues to increase at a rate consistent with our expectations. 
As I said in the past, deferred revenue associated with maintenance and subscriptions generally account for greater than 3% [ph] of the deferred revenue balance. That said, over the past 16 quarter ends, deferred product transaction revenue has ranged from $70 million to $100 million. As of September 30, 2012, deferred revenue related to product transaction was in this historical range. The movement in product transaction deferred revenue is a direct reflection of the nature of our business model and revenue recognition practices, and does not reflect changes in backlog or expectations for the future periods. 
With respect to currency movement. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on our future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currencies impacted the third quarter of 2012. And now this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2012. 
Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of October and assuming the currency exchange rates do not change throughout the remainder of 2012, we expect a 2-point headwind from currency for the full year. We expect a 1-point headwind on our Q4 revenue comparison. 
Turning to guidance for the full year 2012 as it relates to revenue. As a result of the impact that the macroeconomic environment is having on overall business activity around the world and more specifically on CapEx expenditures, we now expect our growth and our reported revenue for the year to be at the low end of our prior guidance of 12% to 14%.  On a constant currency basis we now expect 2012 revenue at the low end of our prior guidance range of 14% to 16%. 
As it relates to EPS. We expect EPS to be in the middle to the high end of our previous guidance range of $2.34 to $2.44. This GAAP EPS is expected to include approximately the following: $0.16 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions, $0.14 a share of amortization of acquired intangible assets and $0.07 a share of transaction and integration costs. 
Excluding these nonoperational items, or special items, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the middle to the high end of our prior guidance range of $2.72 to $2.82 per share for the full year. 
In closing, we are pleased with our year-to-date results and we continue to deliver solid performance. Importantly, we realized growth across all our 3 geographical operating reporting regions despite continued uncertainty in the worldwide economy. We have done this by consistently investing in our solutions, services and our go-to-market strategy. And we will continue to be disciplined in managing our operations and capital. 
Teradata's unique combination of technology strength and differentiation, Consulting Services excellence and our global capability should enable us to deliver long-term sustainable increases in revenue, earnings and cash flow. 
Many of you attended our customers User Group Conference last week and experienced firsthand the strong and positive relationships that exist between Teradata, our customers and our partners. And many of you have commented that our customers repeatedly said that Teradata has true technology leadership in terms of integrating data for complex analytics, both structured and multi-structured data, scalability, concurrency, mixed workloads and workload management, as well as overall customer support. 
However, in the short-term, the global uncertainty may make it a little more difficult for our key cap investments to be approved. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So what happens is, as IT budgets and our customers and the user base get a little bit tighter with how they're spending money right now, the added capacity that we put out there over the past 2.5 years gives the customers more flexibility than they had, say, 1 year ago or 2 years ago. So they're able to optimize and figure out how to use the capacity that they do have because there's more of it for different functions. So there might be some users that are more strategic than other users, there might be different priorities they can give to different users and different types of applications and so forth. And it just gives them a little more flexibility to hold off and to add capacity at a later date. In terms of your question regarding, so how long might we see this, it's difficult to tell at this juncture. It's -- once again, it's related to the belt tightening. So if we don't have belt-tightening like we've run into right now, the impact of the added capacity we put up there is minimized. If we continue that belt-tightening, then this will linger on for a while. I think we'll be in a better position to answer that second part of the question when we get to the next earnings call early next year."

So we've been able to actually accelerate and step up our new customer wins in the Americas in 2011 and also in 2012 and actually increased it over the first half of this year, the one in Q2 and Q3. So that piece is going pretty well. There is an impact as it relates to new customer wins, but yes, the decisions get extended a little bit longer, so we've had a pipeline of new customers in play that we're always working from and will continue to materialize.

And it's a wonderful thing because the computing assets get utilized anywhere from 90% to 100% across our user base. So our enterprise data warehouses provide private cloud-like benefits to our customers because most corporations around the world, the computing assets are utilized 20% to 25% of the time. Now as it relates to this additional capacity that's been added and the flexibility, the customers will still find ways to use whatever capacity it is and optimize it to 90% to 100%, but they can scale back and their lower priorities on some types of work that they're doing and some types of workloads and just use what they have, there's more of it, more efficiently. I appreciate that's not exactly a clear answer, but if a customer has capacity there, they're going to use it one way or another. But some of that capacity that's being used, at times is more for luxury than mission-critical."

The Americas has been averaging 20%-plus revenue growth on average each quarter for the past 10 quarters and the product revenue has been higher than that.

So in the case of the Americas, we've run into this little bit of belt tightening which is different than what we've seen previously, and then we have the added dimension, updated capacity that we've put in there. And the other thing that happens is with this belt tightening and with the added capacity, the average deal size is smaller in the Americas and the amount of large deals is quite a bit lower in Q3 in the Americas and Q4. So now it's the second half versus what we saw in the first half of this year and versus the number of large deals that we saw in the second half of 2011.

So if you take a look at what we've done over the past 3 or 4 years with our workload specific platform family is we've taken on more of the customers' enterprise with data warehouse platforms that are optimized for specific workloads and captured more wallet share than we have previously. And I think that's reflected in the strong revenue growth we've had over the past 2 years. So the types of workload-specific platforms that we've come to market with have not cannibalized enterprise data warehouse and our product revenue growth for the enterprise data warehouse has -- the 6000 class machine has been very, very high this year as it was last year, all right? So Teradata went from advocating an architecture where everything should be integrated into an enterprise data warehouse in a corporation to one where we advocate integrating all the data that's relevant to the business and think of it as an integrated, active data warehouse for all the business to work from and have a single view of the customer and a single version of the truth and everything else. With the emergence of Hadoop, we see this as a best-in-class environment and at a low cost as you mentioned with the commodity hardware and open-source type software to ingest the huge amounts of data that are coming from the new big data sources and also to transform and store that data. So this is a net new opportunity and a net new technology for our customers to adopt and we advocate that they do adopt it. But then the question gets to, how do you add value or get value out all these massive multi-structured non-relational types of data and that's where Aster comes into play and doing it with SQL types of BI tools and the skill sets that most workers have in the mainstream market.

Overall, I was pleased with Teradata's execution in Q3 given the macroenvironment.  Revenue of $647 million was generally in line with what we had expected, growing 7% as reported and 10% in constant currency.  From a region perspective, EMEA and APJ came in higher than we had anticipated and the Americas lower.  
We had strong yield on revenue in Q3 with non-GAAP operating income of $166 million, which was up 16% over prior year, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.69, which was up 17%. 
Longer-term, we believe we are well positioned for a sustained double-digit revenue growth. We have market-leading technology and solutions to build upon in 3 large and growing markets: data warehousing, big data analytics and Integrated Marketing Management. These are market opportunities that will continue to be top priorities for corporations as they look to gain competitive advantage from big data and the big data channels such as social networks, the web, mobile and sensor. 
Shorter-term, we are feeling the impacts of the macroenvironment but to varying degrees in each of the 3 regions. 
In EMEA, we continue to generate double-digit organic constant currency revenue growth overall, but our results would be better if not for the macro headwinds.  In APJ, we are now closing deals in China that were delayed from the first half. Japan is growing again, and overall, APJ is on track for decent growth for the year. 
But in the Americas, we are now seeing slower growth and 3 factors that are contributing to this. First, we are seeing a little belt tightening and uncertainty on spending with some of our customers. Second, 95% of our revenue comes from our user base on average each year. The Americas' strong product revenue growth the past 2.5 years has added a lot of capacity to many of our customers, which gives them some flexibility as to when to add capacity, especially in times of uncertainty. And third, the prior year comparables, such as the 28% revenue growth we had in Q3 last year. 
Although we experienced some minor lumpiness, overall, we believe these are the 3 key headwinds we saw in Q3 and also for what we are seeing in Q4 in the Americas.  
The Americas' third quarter revenue of $384 million was up 2% and up 3% in constant currency over prior year.  Year-to-date, revenue was up 15% as reported and also in constant currency. The win rates remained strong as evidenced with the Americas Q3 data warehouse new customer wins, which was the second highest for any quarter dating back to the year 2000. 
New customers joining Teradata included Fruit of the Loom, which will use our data warehouse to provide a consolidated view of the supply chain and financial metrics across all of their brands; Aviva, one of the fastest-growing life insurance companies in the U.S., which is adding Teradata for predictive analytics; 24/7 Media, which will use Teradata to power its digital forecasting solution; The Men's Wearhouse which will consolidate its data markets into an integrated data warehouse for improved analytics; and Monroe Energy, a new oil refining company that will use Teradata as its foundation for integrated data and analytics. 
Upgrades and expansions included Safeway, Symantec, CVS and a U.S. Government law enforcement agency.  In addition, SaaS and Teradata teamed to establish an innovation lab with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This lab will be used for predictive modeling to understand Medicare program trends and variations and to test new risk approaches. 
Turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa, revenue of $156 million for the quarter was up 17% from the third quarter of 2011 and up 28% in constant currency. Year-to-date, revenue was up 14% as reported and up 23% in constant currency. 
New account wins included one of the largest electronics companies in the world, which will use Teradata to complement their ERP solution to get more granular analytics across the company on consumers, products, finance, HR and suppliers; and Samsung U.K., which selected Aprimo to manage its direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns.  Upgrades and expansions from existing customers included DHL, Maersk, Pakistan Telecom Mobile, the Swiss government and TeliaSonera. 
Asia Pacific and Japan delivered good revenue growth in Q3 with revenue of $107 million, which was up 14% over prior year and up 16% in constant currency. New customer wins included PC Mall, the largest computer electronics retailer in China and is now our first Aprimo customer in China; SP AusNet, the leading Australian utility, which will use Teradata for smart network management, integrating data from over 600,000 smart meters and network monitors to help adjust to them [ph] and to give customers greater ability to manage their own power consumption; HTC, the smartphone manufacturer; and China Eastern Airlines, which will implement an enterprise data warehouse starting with Customer Relationship analytics. Upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Standard Chartered Bank of Korea, Bank of Shanghai, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, Westpac Bank in Australia, Nakashimato [ph] in Japan and Yahoo! JAPAN. 
Teradata's focus today and going forward is centered on driving value from big data for our customers. We are doing this in 2 areas: one, by providing analytics for all data: big data, traditional data, any type of data; and two, by providing our customers the ability to leverage all channels to drive value, including social networks, the web and mobile. 
The key is to have all data and all channels working in concert, past, present and future. This is critical if corporations or government agencies are going to realize the full potential of the new big data.  And in the case of marketing, we are focused on providing an end-to-end solution for our customers and a solution that is available in the cloud, on premise or both. 
Our Integrated Marketing Management solution encompasses marketing operations, analytics for all data, multichannel campaign management and the execution and delivery of marketing offers for all channels. 
We see marketing organizations as the key driver of analytics today and that they will play an even bigger role in many corporations for the years to come. They are in the best position to enable corporations to gain competitive advantage from the new big data insights and the new big data channels. 
Last week, at our Annual Global Customer Conference, we had over 3,900 attendees with over 300 sessions and over 200 customer presentations, all focused on analytics and driving business value. There is no other event like this in the world. 
Key Teradata announcements included 3 centered on big data analytics. First, we launched our Unified Data Architecture, an integrated environment that brings together multiple data technologies. This foundation leverages the best of breed and complementary capabilities of Teradata, Aster and Hadoop. 
Second, we demonstrated our Aster Big Analytics Appliance, which is an industry first, bringing together Aster's SQL-MapReduce capabilities, the Hortonworks Data Platform for Hadoop and our Aster's Analytics Portfolio, which now has more than 50 prepackaged analytics built from use cases. 
The Aster Big Analytics Appliance is an integrated Hadoop-Aster environment supported by Teradata. 
It speeds the adoption of big data analytics and at a lower cost by allowing existing employees to use the same SQL BI tools and skill sets that they already use today for traditional data analytics. 
This is in contrast to hiring expensive and scarce engineering resources to do analytics on the multi-structured data coming from social media, the web, mobile, call centers and more in order to gain insights into customers from these new channels. 
Third, we announced significant advancements to our database technology, including new workload management functionality and new tools to simplify and automate database management and to expand self-service capabilities for our customers. 
It is key that we continue to advance our active enterprise data warehouse capabilities to help our customers manage the ongoing data explosion. 
Data warehouse demands and scale are only going to get more and more challenging as evidenced by Teradata now having 34 customers with petabyte data warehouses. 
We also made several Integrated Marketing Management announcements at the conference. Two that were being big data related were: our Digital Messaging Center. This solution comes from eCircle and is a comprehensive cloud-based solution for the next generation of digital marketing. It is a centralized hub where all cross-channel digital messaging activity can be managed. 
And second, we announced our new social network segmentation along with tighter inbound and outbound active marketing integration for our multichannel campaign management solution. 
Regarding our growth initiatives, we are attracting to reach the higher end of the 35 to 45 range for sales territory additions that we targeted for 2012. And we continue to invest in tools and service offers to help customers extract more value from their data and also to make us more efficient. However, our hiring has slowed from recent levels given our lower Consulting Services growth of 10% as reported and 13% in constant currency in the quarter. 
Turning to guidance. We now expect revenue growth for the full year to be at the lower end of our previous guidance ranges. And we expect earnings per share to be in the middle to higher end of our previous guidance ranges. 
Before I turn the call over to Steve, I want to summarize that I am confident that our competitive position has never been stronger. Our team continues to execute well, and we are well positioned in 3 growing and strategic markets for the long-term. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for additional details. Steve?"

Teradata generated a third quarter revenue of $647 million, which was up 7% from the third quarter of 2011, up 10% in constant currency. We view this as a good result given the uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment. 
Revenue for the first 9 months of the year was up 14%, 17% in constant currency. 
Product revenue of $306 million was up 7% from the third quarter of 2011, up 9% in constant currency.  For the first 9 months of the year, product revenue was up 18%, up 21% in constant currency. In terms of linearity, product revenue in the quarter was more back-end loaded in Q3 2012. 
Services revenue of $341 million was up 8% or up 12% in constant currency from the third quarter 2011. Year-to-date, services revenue was up 10%, up 13% in constant currency. Within services revenue for the quarter, Consulting Services revenue was up 10%, up 13% in constant currency. And Maintenance Services revenue was up 6%, up 9% in constant currency. Year-to-date, Consulting Services revenue was up 11%, up 14% in constant currency, and Maintenance Services revenue was up 10%, 12% in constant currency. 
During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and special items. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures identifying these items is available in our earnings release and also on the Investor page of our website. 
We had solid operating execution and performance with gross and operating margin improvements, driven by disciplined operating fundamentals. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2012 improved 150 basis point to 56.9%. Product gross margin in the third quarter was very strong, 70.3%, up 340 basis points from the 66.9% in the third quarter of 2011, the second consecutive quarter of the team generating very strong product gross margin. The improvement was primarily driven by favorable revenue mix in Q3 2012, compared to the product revenue mix in Q3 2011. 
As a percentage of total product [ph] revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q3 2012 was generally at the midpoint of the 10% to 15% expected range we have discussed previously. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was a solid 45%, slightly higher than the 44.9% in Q3 2011. 
Turning to our operating expense structure. SG&A expense of $163 million increased $9 million or 6% from Q3 2011, with the majority of the increase being in the selling expense. 
R&D, Research and Development, in the quarter was $40 million versus $39 million in the third quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, R&D expense was $123 million, up 13% versus the prior period. 
As we mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally developed software, was approximately $60 million or approximately 20% of our product revenue.  This compared to approximately $55 million in Q3 2011. 
As a reminder, these capitalized costs, when amortized, are then added back to the income statement as product costs over revenue, which reduces product gross margin. 
Year-to-date, total R&D spend was $178 million or approximately 19% of our product revenue versus $161 million last year. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 25.6%, a 200-basis-point increase over the 23.6% generated in Q3 2011. The contribution from higher revenue and favorable revenue mix offset the increased operating investments. 
Year-to-date, operating margin improvement was even better, increasing 240 basis points or 26% for the first 9 months of 2012 versus 23.6% for the same period last year. 
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate in Q3 2012 was 27.3% versus 28.1% in Q3 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 28.3%, compared to 28.9% for the same period in 2011. 
Our year-to-date 2012 effective tax rate did not reflect the tax benefit related to the Federal R&D tax credit due to its current expiration. 
We continue to expect our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27% and expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 28%, or 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate, as the majority of the non-GAAP pretax items, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as the special items are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2012 assumes that the Federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively reinstated for the full year in Q4 of 2012. If the credit is not reinstated by the end of the year, our tax expense will be negatively impacted by approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
In terms of earnings per share, our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.60 versus $0.51 in Q3 2011. Noncash stock-based compensation expense is included in our GAAP EPS. 
During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.16 per share for the full year 2012. 
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $0.09 in Q3, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.69 in Q3 2012, compared to $0.59 in Q3 2011 for a year-over-year increase of 17%. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $107 million in Q3 2012 versus $102 million in the third quarter of 2011. 
After $40 million of capital expenditures, which include additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment versus $27 million in the third quarter of 2011, we generated $67 million of free cash flow versus $75 million of free cash flow generated in Q3 of 2011. 
The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to increased investments in property and equipment and capitalized software development expenses in Q3 2012 versus the same period last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $342 million, increasing $42 million year-on-year. 
As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less cash expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had $909 million of cash, an $88 million increase from June 30, 2012. 
Approximately 50% of our cash balance is available in the U.S. with the remainder being held offshore. And as I said before, expect that the rate of our share repurchases will continue to fluctuate each quarter taking into account among other things, our working capital needs, our stock price, alternative uses of cash, our U.S. cash balances and economic and market conditions. 
With respect to accounts receivable. Day sales outstanding or DSO was 74 days at September 30, 2012, relatively consistent with June 30, 2012, and September 30, 2011. Accounts Receivable increased 19% compared to revenue increase of 7%. The primary driver of the increase in accounts receivable was the timing of the product revenue transactions during Q3 2012, which were more back-end loaded when compared to Q3 2011. 
With respect to deferred revenue. With the recent fluctuations in our deferred revenue, particularly as it relates to product transactions, which as I said in the past, can be inconsistent or lumpy quarter-over-quarter, we will be presenting the short-term and the long-term deferred revenue balances on our balance sheet.  My discussion that follows will address total deferred revenue. 
Total deferred revenue of $382 million as of September 30, 2012, was down $52 million from the June 30, 2012, and up $7 million from September 30, 2011. Deferred maintenance and subscription revenue continues to increase at a rate consistent with our expectations. 
As I said in the past, deferred revenue associated with maintenance and subscriptions generally account for greater than 3% [ph] of the deferred revenue balance. That said, over the past 16 quarter ends, deferred product transaction revenue has ranged from $70 million to $100 million. As of September 30, 2012, deferred revenue related to product transactions was in this historical range. The movement in product transaction deferred revenue is a direct reflection of the nature of our business model and our revenue recognition practices and does not reflect changes in backlog or expectations for the future periods. 
With respect to currency movement. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on our future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currencies impacted the third quarter of 2012 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2012. 
Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of October and assuming the currency exchange rates do not change throughout the remainder of 2012, we expect a 2-point headwind from currency for the full year. We expect a 1-point headwind on our Q4 revenue comparison. 
Turning to guidance for the full year 2012 as it relates to revenue. As a result of the impact that the macroeconomic environment is having on overall business activity around the world and more specifically on CapEx expenditures, we now expect our growth in our reported revenue for the year to be at the low end of our prior guidance of 12% to 14%.  On a constant currency basis, we now expect 2012 revenue at the low end of our prior guidance range of 14% to 16%. 
As it relates to EPS. We expect EPS to be in the middle to the high end of our previous guidance range of $2.34 to $2.44. This GAAP EPS is expected to include approximately the following: $0.16 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions, $0.14 a share of amortization of acquired intangible assets and $0.07 a share of transaction and integration costs. 
Excluding these nonoperational items, or special items, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the middle to the high end of our prior guidance range of $2.72 to $2.82 per share for the full year. 
In closing, we are pleased with our year-to-date results, and we continue to deliver solid performance. Importantly, we’ve realized growth across all our 3 geographical operating reporting regions, despite continued uncertainty in the worldwide economy. We have done this by consistently investing in our solutions, services and our go-to-market strategy. And we will continue to be disciplined in managing our operations and capital. 
Teradata's unique combination of technology strength and differentiation, Consulting Services excellence and our global capability should enable us to deliver long-term sustainable increases in revenue, earnings and cash flow. 
Many of you attended our customers User Group Conference last week and experienced firsthand the strong and positive relationships that exist between Teradata, our customers and our partners. And many of you have commented that our customers repeatedly said that Teradata has true technology leadership in terms of integrating data for complex analytics, both structured and multi-structured data, scalability, concurrency, mixed workloads and workload management, as well as overall customer support. 
However, in the short-term, the global uncertainty may make it a little more difficult for IT cap investments to be approved. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So where do you think we are with capacity utilization? Are we talking about 1 quarter or 2 of potential excess capacity? Or is this something that could pressure growth in 2013?"

So what happens is, as IT budgets and our customers and the user base get a little bit tighter with how they're spending money right now, the added capacity that we put out there over the past 2.5 years gives the customers more flexibility than they had, say, 1 year ago or 2 years ago. So they're able to optimize and figure out how to use the capacity that they do have because there's more of it for different functions. So there might be some uses that are more strategic than other uses, there might be different priorities they can give to different users and different types of applications and so forth. And it just gives them a little more flexibility to hold off and to add capacity at a later date. In terms of your question regarding, so how long might we see this, it's difficult to tell at this juncture. It's -- once again, it's related to the belt tightening. So if we don't have belt tightening like we've run into right now, the impact of the added capacity we’ve put out there is minimized. If we continue that belt tightening, then this will linger on for a while.

Everything that I just said in answer to Wamsi's question is related, Katy, specifically to the Americas, all right? So if we stay on the Americas as it relates to your question, regarding outside user base and the impacts of some of the belt tightening that we're seeing, in the Americas, we did have our second best new account win quarter -- of any quarter that we've had in the last 12 years. So we've been able to actually accelerate and step up our new customer wins in the Americas in 2011 and also in 2012 and actually increased it over the first half of this year, Q1 and Q2 and Q3. So that piece is going pretty well. There is an impact as it relates to the new customer wins that, yes, the decisions get extended a little bit longer, so we've had a pipeline of new customers in play that we're always working from and will continue to materialize. And also under some belt tightening, the size of the deals may be smaller than they would be when we're having -- for the new customer wins, that is, they might be smaller than when we're in a more robust type of economic environment.

However, we did decline in 2009, 3% as reported, 1% in constant currency. So we're not totally immune from a big downturn. And you've heard it before. Customers tend to prioritize, whether they’ve demonstrated, they’ll prioritize analytics, analytics, analytics in good times and in bad. And I think that holds true for us as well."

And to flush that out a little more, at this year's customer event, your customer event, rather, more customers that we talked to suggested Hadoop and running workloads on commodity hardware. I realize that Aster participates in that as well, but running Hadoop on commodity hardware. Hadoop World also occurred that same week, and we talked to customers and vendors there, and again, Hadoop seems to be getting a little more traction than we had anticipated. And when we look at your slide deck at present, versus the past few years, the EDW was the center of the universe, and now it seems that the EDW is an important node in the business analytics network. But the broader question, as you think about the macro slowdown, is there some share of wallet issue here, specifically for Hadoop, but perhaps even touching on Oracle's latest offering?"

So if you take a look at what we've done over the past 3 or 4 years with our workload-specific platform family is we've taken on more of the customers' enterprise with data warehouse platforms that are optimized for specific workloads and captured more wallet share than we have previously. And I think that's reflected in the strong revenue growth we've had over the past 2 years. So the types of workload-specific platforms that we've come to market with have not cannibalized our enterprise data warehouse, and our product revenue growth for the enterprise data warehouse has -- the 6000 class machine has been very, very high this year as it was last year, all right? So Teradata went from advocating an architecture where everything should be integrated into an enterprise data warehouse in a corporation to one where we advocate integrating all the data that's relevant to the business and think of it as an integrated, active data warehouse for all the business to work from and to have a single view of the customer and a single version of the truth and everything else. With the emergence of Hadoop, we see this as a best-in-class environment and at a low cost, as you mention with the commodity hardware and open-source type software, to ingest the huge amounts of data that are coming from the new big data sources and also to transform and store that data. So this is a net new opportunity and a net new technology for our customers to adopt, and we advocate that they do adopt it. But then the question gets to, how do you add value or get value out of all this massive multi-structured non-relational types of data? And that's where Aster comes into play and doing it with SQL types of BI tools and the skill sets that most workers have in the mainstream market, because to do the analytics with Hadoop takes very expensive and scarce engineering resources."

Overall, I was pleased with Teradata's execution in Q3 given the macro environment. Revenue of $647 million was generally in line with what we had expected, growing 7% as reported and 10% in constant currency. From a region perspective, EMEA and APJ came in higher than we had anticipated and the Americas lower. 
We had strong yield on revenue in Q3 with non-GAAP operating income of $166 million, which was up 16% over prior year, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.69, which was up 17%. 
Longer-term, we believe we are well positioned for a sustained double-digit revenue growth. We have market-leading technology and solutions to build upon in 3 large and growing markets: data warehousing, big data analytics and Integrated Marketing Management. These are market opportunities that will continue to be top priorities for corporations as they look to gain competitive advantage from big data and the big data channels such as social networks, the web, mobile and sensor. 
Shorter-term, we are feeling the impacts of the macro environment but to varying degrees in each of the 3 regions. 
In EMEA, we continue to generate double-digit organic constant currency revenue growth overall, but our results would be better if not for the macro headwinds. In APJ, we are now closing deals in China that were delayed from the first half. Japan is growing again, and overall, APJ is on track for decent growth for the year. 
But in the Americas, we are now seeing slower growth and 3 factors that are contributing to this. First, we are seeing a little belt tightening and uncertainty on spending with some of our customers. Second, 95% of our revenue comes from our user base on average each year. The Americas' strong product revenue growth the past 2.5 years has added a lot of capacity to many of our customers, which gives them some flexibility as to when to add capacity, especially in times of uncertainty. And third, the prior year comparables, such as the 28% revenue growth we had in Q3 last year. 
Although we experienced some minor lumpiness, overall, we believe these are the 3 key headwinds we saw in Q3 and also for what we are seeing in Q4 in the Americas. 
The Americas' third quarter revenue of $384 million was up 2% and up 3% in constant currency over prior year. Year-to-date, revenue was up 15% as reported and also in constant currency. The win rates remained strong as evidenced with the Americas Q3 data warehouse new customer wins, which was the second highest for any quarter dating back to the year 2000. 
New customers joining Teradata included Fruit of the Loom, which will use our data warehouse to provide a consolidated view of the supply chain and financial metrics across all of their brands; Aviva, one of the fastest-growing life insurance companies in the U.S., which is adding Teradata for predictive analytics; 24/7 Media, which will use Teradata to power its digital forecasting solution; The Men's Wearhouse which will consolidate its data markets into an integrated data warehouse for improved analytics; and Monroe Energy, a new oil refining company that will use Teradata as its foundation for integrated data and analytics. 
Upgrades and expansions included Safeway, Symantec, CVS and a U.S. Government law enforcement agency. In addition, SaaS and Teradata teamed to establish an innovation lab with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This lab will be used for predictive modeling to understand Medicare program trends and variations and to test new risk approaches. 
Turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa, revenue of $156 million for the quarter was up 17% from the third quarter of 2011 and up 28% in constant currency. Year-to-date, revenue was up 14% as reported and up 23% in constant currency. 
New account wins included one of the largest electronics companies in the world, which will use Teradata to complement their ERP solution to get more granular analytics across the company on consumers, products, finance, HR and suppliers; and Samsung U.K., which selected Aprimo to manage its direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns. Upgrades and expansions from existing customers included DHL, Maersk, Pakistan Telecom Mobile, the Swiss government and TeliaSonera. 
Asia Pacific and Japan delivered good revenue growth in Q3 with revenue of $107 million, which was up 14% over prior year and up 16% in constant currency. New customer wins included PC Mall, the largest computer electronics retailer in China and is now our first Aprimo customer in China; SP AusNet, the leading Australian utility, which will use Teradata for smart network management, integrating data from over 600,000 smart meters and network monitors to help adjust demand and give customers greater ability to manage their own power consumption; HTC, the smartphone manufacturer; and China Eastern Airlines, which will implement an enterprise data warehouse starting with Customer Relationship analytics. Upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Standard Chartered Bank of Korea, Bank of Shanghai, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, Westpac Bank in Australia, Nakashimato [ph] in Japan and Yahoo! JAPAN. 
Teradata's focus today and going forward is centered on driving value from big data for our customers. We are doing this in 2 areas: one, by providing analytics for all data: big data, traditional data, any type of data; and two, by providing our customers the ability to leverage all channels to drive value, including social networks, the web and mobile. 
The key is to have all data and all channels working in concert, past, present and future. This is critical if corporations or government agencies are going to realize the full potential of the new big data. And in the case of marketing, we are focused on providing an end-to-end solution for our customers and a solution that is available in the cloud, on premise or both. 
Our Integrated Marketing Management solution encompasses marketing operations, analytics for all data, multichannel campaign management and the execution and delivery of marketing offers for all channels. 
We see marketing organizations as the key driver of analytics today and that they will play an even bigger role in many corporations for the years to come. They are in the best position to enable corporations to gain competitive advantage from the new big data insights and the new big data channels. 
Last week, at our Annual Global Customer Conference, we had over 3,900 attendees with over 300 sessions and over 200 customer presentations, all focused on analytics and driving business value. There is no other event like this in the world. 
Key Teradata announcements included 3 centered on big data analytics. First, we launched our Unified Data Architecture, an integrated environment that brings together multiple data technologies. This foundation leverages the best of breed and complementary capabilities of Teradata, Aster and Hadoop. 
Second, we demonstrated our Aster Big Analytics Appliance, which is an industry first, bringing together Aster's SQL-MapReduce capabilities, the Hortonworks Data Platform for Hadoop and our Aster's Analytics Portfolio, which now has more than 50 prepackaged analytics built from use cases. 
The Aster Big Analytics Appliance is an integrated Hadoop-Aster environment supported by Teradata. 
It speeds the adoption of big data analytics and at a lower cost by allowing existing employees to use the same SQL BI tools and skill sets that they already use today for traditional data analytics. 
This is in contrast to hiring expensive and scarce engineering resources to do analytics on the multi-structured data coming from social media, the web, mobile, call centers and more in order to gain insights into customers from these new channels. 
Third, we announced significant advancements to our database technology, including new workload management functionality and new tools to simplify and automate database management and to expand self-service capabilities for our customers. 
It is key that we continue to advance our active enterprise data warehouse capabilities to help our customers manage the ongoing data explosion. 
Data warehouse demands and scale are only going to get more and more challenging as evidenced by Teradata now having 34 customers with petabyte data warehouses. 
We also made several Integrated Marketing Management announcements at the conference. Two that were being big data related were: our Digital Messaging Center. This solution comes from eCircle and is a comprehensive cloud-based solution for the next generation of digital marketing. It is a centralized hub where all cross-channel digital messaging activity can be managed. 
And second, we announced our new social network segmentation along with tighter inbound and outbound active marketing integration for our multichannel campaign management solution. 
Regarding our growth initiatives, we are attracting to reach the higher end of the 35 to 45 range for sales territory additions that we targeted for 2012. And we continue to invest in tools and service offers to help customers extract more value from their data and also to make us more efficient. However, our hiring has slowed from recent levels given our lower Consulting Services growth of 10% as reported and 13% in constant currency in the quarter. 
Turning to guidance. We now expect revenue growth for the full year to be at the lower end of our previous guidance ranges. And we expect earnings per share to be in the middle to higher end of our previous guidance ranges. 
Before I turn the call over to Steve, I want to summarize that I am confident that our competitive position has never been stronger. Our team continues to execute well, and we are well positioned in 3 growing and strategic markets for the long-term. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for additional details. Steve?"

Teradata generated a third quarter revenue of $647 million, which was up 7% from the third quarter of 2011, up 10% in constant currency. We view this as a good result given the uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment. 
Revenue for the first 9 months of the year was up 14%, 17% in constant currency. 
Product revenue of $306 million was up 7% from the third quarter of 2011, up 9% in constant currency. For the first 9 months of the year, product revenue was up 18%, up 21% in constant currency. In terms of linearity, product revenue in the quarter was more back-end loaded in Q3 2012. 
Services revenue of $341 million was up 8% or up 12% in constant currency from the third quarter 2011. Year-to-date, services revenue was up 10%, up 13% in constant currency. Within services revenue for the quarter, Consulting Services revenue was up 10%, up 13% in constant currency. And Maintenance Services revenue was up 6%, up 9% in constant currency. Year-to-date, Consulting Services revenue was up 11%, up 14% in constant currency, and Maintenance Services revenue was up 10%, 12% in constant currency. 
During my discussion today, except where otherwise noted, I'll be addressing margins and expenses on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation and special items. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures identifying these items is available in our earnings release and also on the Investor page of our website. 
We had solid operating execution and performance with gross and operating margin improvements, driven by disciplined operating fundamentals. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2012 improved 150 basis point to 56.9%. Product gross margin in the third quarter was very strong, 70.3%, up 340 basis points from the 66.9% in the third quarter of 2011, the second consecutive quarter of the team generating very strong product gross margin. The improvement was primarily driven by favorable revenue mix in Q3 2012, compared to the product revenue mix in Q3 2011. 
As a percentage of total product revenue, our 2000 series appliance revenue in Q3 2012 was generally at the midpoint of the 10% to 15% expected range we have discussed previously. 
Services gross margin in the quarter was a solid 45%, slightly higher than the 44.9% in Q3 2011. 
Turning to our operating expense structure. SG&A expense of $163 million increased $9 million or 6% from Q3 2011, with the majority of the increase being in the selling expense. 
R&D, Research and Development, in the quarter was $40 million versus $39 million in the third quarter of 2011. Year-to-date, R&D expense was $123 million, up 13% versus the prior period. 
As we mentioned before, we invest more in our R&D activity than what is reported on the R&D operating expense line on our income statement. Total R&D spend for the third quarter, which includes R&D expense plus the additions to capitalized software development cost from the cash flow statement, less capitalization of internally developed software, was approximately $60 million or approximately 20% of our product revenue. This compared to approximately $55 million in Q3 2011. 
As a reminder, these capitalized costs, when amortized, are then added back to the income statement as product costs over revenue, which reduces product gross margin. 
Year-to-date, total R&D spend was $178 million or approximately 19% of our product revenue versus $161 million last year. 
As a result of all these items, operating margin for the quarter was 25.6%, a 200 basis point increase over the 23.6% generated in Q3 2011. The contribution from higher revenue and favorable revenue mix offset the increased operating investments. 
Year-to-date, operating margin improvement was even better, increasing 240 basis points or 26% for the first 9 months of 2012 versus 23.6% for the same period last year. 
On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate in Q3 2012 was 27.3% versus 28.1% in Q3 2011. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 28.3%, compared to 28.9% for the same period in 2011. 
Our year-to-date 2012 effective tax rate did not reflect the tax benefit related to the Federal R&D tax credit due to its current expiration. 
We continue to expect our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 27% and expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 28%, or 1 percentage point higher than the associated GAAP effective tax rate, as the majority of the non-GAAP pretax items, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as the special items are weighted more to the U.S. The effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2012 assumes that the Federal R&D tax credit, which expired as of December 31, 2011, will be retroactively reinstated for the full year in Q4 of 2012. If the credit is not reinstated by the end of the year, our tax expense will be negatively impacted by approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
In terms of earnings per share, our Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.60 versus $0.51 in Q3 2011. Noncash stock-based compensation expense is included in our GAAP EPS. 
During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $0.04 per share. We expect stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $0.16 per share for the full year 2012. 
Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and other special items, which equated to $0.09 in Q3, our non-GAAP EPS was $0.69 in Q3 2012, compared to $0.59 in Q3 2011 for a year-over-year increase of 17%. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $107 million in Q3 2012 versus $102 million in the third quarter of 2011. 
After $40 million of capital expenditures, which include additions to capitalized software development costs and expenditures for property and equipment versus $27 million in the third quarter of 2011, we generated $67 million of free cash flow versus $75 million of free cash flow generated in Q3 of 2011. 
The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to increased investments in property and equipment and capitalized software development expenses in Q3 2012 versus the same period last year. 
On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $342 million, increasing $42 million year-on-year. 
As a reminder, Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less cash expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had $909 million of cash, an $88 million increase from June 30, 2012. 
Approximately 50% of our cash balance is available in the U.S. with the remainder being held offshore. And as I said before, expect that the rate of our share repurchases will continue to fluctuate each quarter taking into account among other things, our working capital needs, our stock price, alternative uses of cash, our U.S. cash balances and economic and market conditions. 
With respect to accounts receivable. Day sales outstanding or DSO was 74 days at September 30, 2012, relatively consistent with June 30, 2012, and September 30, 2011. Accounts Receivable increased 19% compared to revenue increase of 7%. The primary driver of the increase in accounts receivable was the timing of the product revenue transactions during Q3 2012, which were more back-end loaded when compared to Q3 2011. 
With respect to deferred revenue. With the recent fluctuations in our deferred revenue, particularly as it relates to product transactions, which as I said in the past, can be inconsistent or lumpy quarter-over-quarter, we will be presenting the short-term and the long-term deferred revenue balances on our balance sheet. My discussion that follows will address total deferred revenue. 
Total deferred revenue of $382 million as of September 30, 2012, was down $52 million from the June 30, 2012, and up $7 million from September 30, 2011. Deferred maintenance and subscription revenue continues to increase at a rate consistent with our expectations. 
As I said in the past, deferred revenue associated with maintenance and subscriptions generally account for greater than 3% [ph] of the deferred revenue balance. That said, over the past 16 quarter ends, deferred product transaction revenue has ranged from $70 million to $100 million. As of September 30, 2012, deferred revenue related to product transactions was in this historical range. The movement in product transaction deferred revenue is a direct reflection of the nature of our business model and our revenue recognition practices and does not reflect changes in backlog or expectations for the future periods. 
With respect to currency movement. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on our future revenue, we provide a schedule on our website detailing how currencies impacted the third quarter of 2012 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2012. 
Assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of October and assuming the currency exchange rates do not change throughout the remainder of 2012, we expect a 2-point headwind from currency for the full year. We expect a 1-point headwind on our Q4 revenue comparison. 
Turning to guidance for the full year 2012 as it relates to revenue. As a result of the impact that the macroeconomic environment is having on overall business activity around the world and more specifically on CapEx expenditures, we now expect our growth in our reported revenue for the year to be at the low end of our prior guidance of 12% to 14%. On a constant currency basis, we now expect 2012 revenue at the low end of our prior guidance range of 14% to 16%. 
As it relates to EPS. We expect EPS to be in the middle to the high end of our previous guidance range of $2.34 to $2.44. This GAAP EPS is expected to include approximately the following: $0.16 a share of stock-based compensation expense, $0.01 a share of estimated purchase accounting adjustments related to our previous acquisitions, $0.14 a share of amortization of acquired intangible assets and $0.07 a share of transaction and integration costs. 
Excluding these nonoperational items, or special items, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the middle to the high end of our prior guidance range of $2.72 to $2.82 per share for the full year. 
In closing, we are pleased with our year-to-date results, and we continue to deliver solid performance. Importantly, we’ve realized growth across all our 3 geographical operating reporting regions, despite continued uncertainty in the worldwide economy. We have done this by consistently investing in our solutions, services and our go-to-market strategy. And we will continue to be disciplined in managing our operations and capital. 
Teradata's unique combination of technology strength and differentiation, Consulting Services excellence and our global capability should enable us to deliver long-term sustainable increases in revenue, earnings and cash flow. 
Many of you attended our customers User Group Conference last week and experienced firsthand the strong and positive relationships that exist between Teradata, our customers and our partners. And many of you have commented that our customers repeatedly said that Teradata has true technology leadership in terms of integrating data for complex analytics, both structured and multi-structured data, scalability, concurrency, mixed workloads and workload management, as well as overall customer support. 
However, in the short-term, the global uncertainty may make it a little more difficult for IT cap investments to be approved. 
And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

So where do you think we are with capacity utilization? Are we talking about 1 quarter or 2 of potential excess capacity? Or is this something that could pressure growth in 2013?"

So what happens is, as IT budgets and our customers and the user base get a little bit tighter with how they're spending money right now, the added capacity that we put out there over the past 2.5 years gives the customers more flexibility than they had, say, 1 year ago or 2 years ago. So they're able to optimize and figure out how to use the capacity that they do have because there's more of it for different functions. So there might be some uses that are more strategic than other uses, there might be different priorities they can give to different users and different types of applications and so forth. And it just gives them a little more flexibility to hold off and to add capacity at a later date. In terms of your question regarding, so how long might we see this, it's difficult to tell at this juncture. It's -- once again, it's related to the belt tightening. So if we don't have belt tightening like we've run into right now, the impact of the added capacity we’ve put out there is minimized. If we continue that belt tightening, then this will linger on for a while. I think we'll be in a better position to answer that second part of the question when we get to the next earnings call early next year."

Everything that I just said in answer to Wamsi's question is related, Katy, specifically to the Americas, all right? So if we stay on the Americas as it relates to your question, regarding outside user base and the impacts of some of the belt tightening that we're seeing, in the Americas, we did have our second best new account win quarter -- of any quarter that we've had in the last 12 years. So we've been able to actually accelerate and step up our new customer wins in the Americas in 2011 and also in 2012 and actually increased it over the first half of this year, Q1 and Q2 and Q3. So that piece is going pretty well. There is an impact as it relates to the new customer wins that, yes, the decisions get extended a little bit longer, so we've had a pipeline of new customers in play that we're always working from and will continue to materialize. And also under some belt tightening, the size of the deals may be smaller than they would be when we're having -- for the new customer wins, that is, they might be smaller than when we're in a more robust type of economic environment.

Now as it relates to this additional capacity that's been added and the flexibility, the customers will still find ways to use whatever capacity it is and optimize it to 90% or 100%, but they can scale back and lower priorities on some types of work that they're doing and some types of the workloads and just use what they have, there's more of it, more efficiently. I appreciate that's not exactly a clear answer, but if a customer has capacity there, they're going to use it one way or another.

Those things in 2012 had come in a little better than what I've expected, again with our disciplined execution on the price on the cost -- or the purchasing side. Those disk drives came in and held the price pretty steady compared to some of the upside risk we were looking at. And then FAS 86 amortization came in less than I was looking at in 2012, primarily due to the timing of the releases. And so I'll have the FAS 86 amortization headwind in 2013 that we’ll address, but again, that product gross margin will still stay somewhat fluctuating."

The Americas has been averaging 20%-plus revenue growth on average each quarter for the past 10 quarters, and the product revenue has been higher than that. So the magnitude of product going into the customer user base in the Americas has been higher than in EMEA. So EMEA has also been dealing with a -- how should I say this? A steady state of uncertainty, and we continue to produce well right through that. So in the case of the Americas, we've run into this little bit of belt tightening, which is different than what we've seen previously, and then we have the added dimension of the added capacity that we've put in there. And the other thing that happens is with this belt tightening and with the added capacity, the average deal size is smaller in the Americas and the amount of large deals is quite a bit lower in Q3 in the Americas and Q4, so in other words, the second half versus what we saw in the first half of this year and versus the number of large deals that we saw in the second half of 2011. So in the Americas, we've seen a reduction to a degree in the number of large opportunities and more smaller opportunities, and we're not seeing that in EMEA. So that's another different dimension."

And to flush that out a little more, at this year's customer event, your customer event, rather, more customers that we talked to suggested Hadoop and running workloads on commodity hardware. I realize that Aster participates in that as well, but running Hadoop on commodity hardware. Hadoop World also occurred that same week, and we talked to customers and vendors there, and again, Hadoop seems to be getting a little more traction than we had anticipated. And when we look at your slide deck at present, versus the past few years, the EDW was the center of the universe, and now it seems that the EDW is an important node in the business analytics network. But the broader question, as you think about the macro slowdown, is there some share of wallet issue here, specifically for Hadoop, but perhaps even touching on Oracle's latest offering?"

So if you take a look at what we've done over the past 3 or 4 years with our workload-specific platform family is we've taken on more of the customers' enterprise with data warehouse platforms that are optimized for specific workloads and captured more wallet share than we have previously. And I think that's reflected in the strong revenue growth we've had over the past 2 years. So the types of workload-specific platforms that we've come to market with have not cannibalized our enterprise data warehouse, and our product revenue growth for the enterprise data warehouse has -- the 6000 class machine has been very, very high this year as it was last year, all right? So Teradata went from advocating an architecture where everything should be integrated into an enterprise data warehouse in a corporation to one where we advocate integrating all the data that's relevant to the business and think of it as an integrated, active data warehouse for all the business to work from and to have a single view of the customer and a single version of the truth and everything else. With the emergence of Hadoop, we see this as a best-in-class environment and at a low cost, as you mention with the commodity hardware and open-source type software, to ingest the huge amounts of data that are coming from the new big data sources and also to transform and store that data. So this is a net new opportunity and a net new technology for our customers to adopt, and we advocate that they do adopt it. But then the question gets to, how do you add value or get value out of all this massive multi-structured non-relational types of data? And that's where Aster comes into play and doing it with SQL types of BI tools and the skill sets that most workers have in the mainstream market, because to do the analytics with Hadoop takes very expensive and scarce engineering resources."
