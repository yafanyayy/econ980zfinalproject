Last night, we reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.82, up 15% from the prior year. EPS for the year was $2.97, up 19%. Cash flow from operations was $532 million for the quarter and $2.2 billion for the year.
Since our last call, we continue to make progress towards completing the Medco acquisition, including securing the remainder of the financing, obtaining shareholder approval and certifying our substantial compliance with the FTC second request.
As a result of this progress, we maintained high levels of project spending to free up capacity for integration activities in 2012 and delayed cost savings opportunity, keeping staffing at higher levels to support integration planning.
SG&A expense costs were up $17 million year-over-year, reflecting the increased spending in an accrual for tax items, partially offset by lower management compensation.
Despite this increased spending, gross profit margin was 7.4%, in line with last year's fourth quarter. EBITDA was up 8% over last year. EBITDA per adjusted Rx rose to $3.66, up 6%; and EPS grew 19% for the year.
Although EPS was strong, it was below our target due to lower claims volume driven by utilization and increased attrition as a result of poor economic environment. Increased spending on projects and higher staffing levels to prepare for integration and investing to support clients and members as they change retail pharmacies.
Because EPS was below target, management bonuses were 0 in 2011. During the quarter, we settled $725 million of the remaining $750 million accelerated share repurchase, resulting in a receipt of 2.1 million additional shares. These shares are excluded from our outstanding shares this quarter.
The ASRs have resulted in a retirement 33.4 million shares of this year. 
As we've been saying for the past several months, we plan to provide combined 2012 guidance after the closing of the transaction, when we have had a chance to review and consolidate our forecast for the year.
Our view of the transaction remains unchanged. We believe that the acquisition will be slightly accretive to adjusted EPS in the first full year after closing and moderately accretive once fully integrated. We expect to realize $1 billion in net synergies once fully integrated. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to George."

The actions we took in 2011 demonstrated our ability to advance healthcare to innovation, execute on our unwavering alignment with clients and position ourselves to address the national mandate for more affordable healthcare, higher quality healthcare to our merger with Medco.
We succeeded by helping our clients solve issues in an industry that's ever-changing and ever-challenging, which positions us well for 2012 and beyond. Our research in new solutions lab continues to deliver innovative products and solutions that addresses our clients' main points such as adherence, which leads to $300 billion in healthcare waste each year.
We launched screen Rx, a new product offering, were predictive modeling is employed to determine which numbers are likely to be non-adherent in the future and tailor and intervention to best suit each individual. We are setting a new standard in healthcare by fighting non-adherence before it begins. 
Another tool that continues to gain traction in the marketplace is special benefit services, and the innovative offering that addresses the skyrocketing cost of special specialty drugs across the pharmacy medical spectrum. We can forecast, guarantee and deliver measurable savings by proven tools for specialty drugs, regardless of where patients receive the medication.
Our innovative approach to the marketplace, ability to drive positive clinical behavior and unwavering commitment to alignment contribute to a strong selling season with 97% retention, 3 signature wins and positive script growth expected for 2012.
And as we expected that this momentum will continue into the current selling season, one reason for our confidence is successfully executing our retail strategy. With Planning and execution of significant client support, we execute the largest retail market share movement in the history of pharmacy. 
We accomplish this with very little disruption, while delivering savings to our clients and patients by eliminating a high cost provider from our network.
We continue to make progress towards closing the transition -- transaction with Medco. The combination of our complementary strengths will accelerate our clinical offerings, which will reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes.
By blending the combined clinical skill with the behavioral sciences, we will be able to accelerate efforts to promote greater efficiencies in the healthcare system and better protect American families from the rising cost of prescription medications.
Our shared vision is to increase therapy adherence, lower costs and drive the better health outcomes. At this point, we'll be happy to answer any questions."

Yes, as we ramped up our call centers associates, both in our from pharmacy helpdesk and our patient care advocates, significantly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Keep in mind, we had a huge wins in our Medicare clients that brought a lot of new lives into the fourth quarter. That, coupled with all the Medicare changes that normally take place, plus all the benefit design changes that occur on 11. And then quite frankly, roughly 20% of our book had been in Walgreens stores, and almost all of that was scheduled to move, and so we wanted to make sure that this 11 went flawlessly. We decided we would over expand in order to make sure that the client experience and the member experience was the best that we could have. And I think we are rather successful that and quite frankly, we did over staff. But again, I think it was the right answer. The clients, although very incredibly supportive. We have an obligation to them to make sure this went up without a hitch. And we needed to make sure that every member can call than that was looking for a convenient outlet or a way to process prescriptions whether it was a movement to mail or to another retailer that we would make sure we could handle that and give them top-class service. And our operations people executed in an exemplary manner. I would tell you that there was -- the movement has been very but good for us. It really does endorse the fact that specially narrower networks and in fact do work. At the end of the day, taking out large retailer like this, it effects to a narrow network. We don't have -- and 98.5%, 98.4%, somewhere in that range of our book is now in the narrow network, so we feel very good about it. Our clients are very supportive. I think what really speaks to it is the fact that this did go off. Nobody's -- our phones aren't ringing. People aren't -- our clients are not upset, so this has been, truly has been a good move for us and in our cost for our clients get better year-over-year. So we're excited about it not to the extent that Walgreens wants to come back, gnats to have a relationship, wants to help drive down the cost of healthcare, it can be -- I appreciate the fact that they are trying to do some very good things with respect to clinical offerings and other avenues to try to impact the overall healthcare spectrum. But quite frankly, that hasn't been proven to reduce costs. And many of the things that they're offering in the pharmacy are being offered by many others out there. So I don't see them as differentiated. And it just came with a good conscience, pay them a significant premium for something that everyone else is doing and doing this as well. So we are quite content where we sit today, and to the extent that they want to get the relationship and to be in line with the rest of healthcare costs and we're willing to entertain those conversations."

So people that are coming into we probably have eliminated some clients from an offering. I mean, something really gnats Walgreens, then call us up. But thousands and thousands of clients and millions and millions of Americans out there so there's markets pretty big enough. And the book we have certainly isn't overly cousins our isn't concerned. And I think the fact that we just picked up catalysts, I refer to that, picked up the client from catalysts in Maryland because of that publicly been put out there, speaks to the fact that people are willing to make those decisions if it saves money. This is a tough economy. And if you see your costs going up and somebody's giving been option, that can reduce your cost further without compromising healthcare outcomes or still improving health outcomes, why not take advantage of it? And I think that's what we offer and that's the same thing for even narrowing the weather network further is it does provide an opportunity to save money. And we may -- if you talk about scripts as being irrelevant, well, if you got 1 million script, that's $1 million a year. I would do some things for $1 million a year. I don't know by you, but that's a lot of money to me, and especially if I haven't done anything to compromise the outcomes. If everything is status quo, people still get thing pills, people are still getting their drugs, people are still have convenient access to pharmacists, what really the change? All we've done is put $1 million into our shareholders pockets that seems like a pretty smart thing to me. I don't laugh at $0.10 and $0.15 a script and especially when you start talking $1 script.

Let me answer that in a couple of ways. First of all, you're right. We feel ourselves to be very much accountable to our shareholders. And if we make statements that make projections and don't live up to them, we don't feel it's right to reward",549,"Well, yes. Let me answer that in a couple of ways. First of all, you're right. We feel ourselves to be very much accountable to our shareholders. And if we make statements that make projections and don't live up to them, we don't feel it's right to reward ourselves is management and have our shareholders missed out. So yes, we take our bonuses down accordingly when we miss, and this was a big issue for me personally. I thought the economy was turning in the first- fourth quarter of last year. Things were going to improve. I didn't think that we could see 3 or 4 years in a row of 0 utilization increases. I thought that I saw the climate trend starting to pick back but did not occur. So between utilization and member attrition inside of our current book of business because of the missed earnings, once we got into that situation, we have a tremendous opportunity such as Medco in front of us. We decided the right answer was to accelerate spending and get ahead of a lot of the Medicare and Health Care Reform projects that were staring us in the face. So we've significantly increased our IT budgets as I talked about a few minutes ago. We also got a lot of staff and make sure that we are ready for 11, we're prepared for the huge migration of members away from Walgreens. And so we're very well positioned for that, and I think it was the right thing to do. And likewise, we didn't take bonuses. As far as 2012 is concerned, for me, 2012 we're spending a lot of money trying to get ready for Medco. There's a lot of hidden money, if you will, that you don't see because we have consultants and we have our teams are working on projects. Normally, what we'd be doing, we'd be looking other opportunities but instead, people are focused on meetings around integration planning. So things are a little bit on the back burner. We also know the importance of client. So what we have a group of people that are focused on integration, we have to really double down on client service because we have to make sure our clients understand that this is going to be status quo for them to this integration, and that they will not miss a beat in service, while we integrate Medco into our books. So takes a lot of people in a lot of effort to get all those things done. On that note, we've put together a sketchy preliminary budget for 2012, which we have internally. That numbers what we will base our bonuses on unlikely event we didn't close Medco. We would release those numbers out to you if that event were to occur, but I don't see that as happening. Instead, as soon as we close and we get our numbers together, we will come forward with a combined budget. To me, coming out with the '12 numbers is fairly irrelevant because it's too much dependent upon money we're spending with -- without a return, without the Medco deal. So it's just all that relevant. It becomes relevant, obviously, if the deal doesn't close. So we, at that time, we would disclose it."

I think what we're seeing is that people are employing people, but they're doing it in a more on a temporary basis, consulting basis and not necessarily bringing people back into permanent positions the way we've seen our recession, what we've come out of a recession in the past. So employment pickup has not been overwhelmingly large in our book of businesses, and just haven't seen it. Likewise, utilization continues to be very concerning. It's concerning to me as a citizen of the United States because if people aren't taking their medications, we know people are getting skinnier, and we know they're not getting healthier. And if utilization is going up as the baby boomers are getting into those later years, there's some fundamentally wrong here, and all that is going to relate into higher ER visits and higher doctor and hospital costs in the future, which is not a good thing for our country, but that's what we're headed. So we remain for 2012 in our planning. We're assuming that the -- that job growth won't come about, but it's not going to decline. It's going to stay relatively flat, and the utilization trends are going to stay below 1% or right close to 1% for this year, which is, again, very concerning, but we figured that's the prudent thing to do at this juncture."

We often find out we lost business because we were $0.10 a script out of the market, and people move on $0.10. And so I sit there and I struggle with what does it really mean then when narrow network won't with it? If I'm going to move it disrupt my entire work of business and change formularies for $0.10, and I can save $0.50 to $2, depending on how narrow I want to make the network even more and there's a lot more and $0.10. So it's hard for me to get my arms around that issue. I think the concern, though, by many was if I'm going to save $1 by narrowing this network or $2 by narrowing the network, whatever the number is, is that enough because the was this feeling that the denying access to a given pharmacy may play haven't gone my HR department and what disruption this might be and how upset I am pleased going to be? Well, what we just figure out through this process was it was virtually none. That doesn't mean that somebody that wasn't tied to Walgreens is an individual that didn't have to run new pharmacists at Kroger or CBS or wherever then in that going and become friends with a new pharmacists and that is where it is. But it really did go up without a hitch. At the end of day, as I said earlier, next is LIPITOR is LIPITOR. Drugs are drugs and it shouldn't matter that much those I just believe that we should be able to make sure that would put the right person in front of the right costs and make sure that we serve our clients properly. Taking costs out of the healthcare system is of paramount importance to us and that's what were going to do. And I do think that the narrow network speak to that and serve that occasion. And depending on what happens with the economy. When the employee year is looking at laying off hundreds and hundreds of people HR director  and I come in with a proposal that saves a $1 million, how welcome is that going to be? Nobody. As a CEO, I don't particularly to lay off people. I'd don't think any of my peers like to lay off people. And we all have our demands and needs to meet our shareholders expectations, so there's a lot of pressure on the CEO. And if you can deliver them without disrupting your client base, I think that's critically important. So we are absolutely focused on that, and we believe that the community pharmacists severance a very important role in healthcare, that they do a tremendous amount. But we just don't see that 1 pharmacist does it -- does much better than another pharmacists at least, not by a change. So we're just not going to pay those premiums."

The FTC and doing their job. They're trying to make sure that the American public is going to do better because of this acquisition. And we're right there with them. We believe that this acquisition speaks to what this country needs more than anything, which is a reduction in the cost of healthcare and whether to show them previous acquisitions, that's occurred and through this acquisition, it will continue to occur. At the end of the day, that's a lot of pushback from the retail pharmacists because they're worried about as us the costs for reimbursement. Well, that's our job. The job is that the cost of branded products go up at roughly 10% a year. If we're not in there and try to negotiate part of that 10% for our clients, then all that goes back to the pharmacies. That can't occur. People can get a 10% per unit increase each and every year. It's okay if you can move people from brands to generics from a higher cost struggle or lower cost drug and save that patient money to make more money but not just by spending still. And all of a sudden, in December 31, I feel one 1 prescription January 2, I feel the next one, all of a sudden, I make 10% more. That just doesn't make any sense. And would have to be insulated, that filtered that takes of the equation get sit back to our clients, and that's a very important role. That's the problem with what we have with Walgreens in the situation is that they wanted us to hold rates flat and hold them flat over a 3-year period, and that can't occur. That lines the pockets of Walgreens by 10% increase each and every year ever, are currently entire than facing not only 10% in brand rents, do not getting the benefits from the generics hold those that as well. And they wanted to get all the utilization increases. And that's just -- we just can't stand there and allow that to happen. So our job is to make sure our clients to maintain reductions in prices. If you look at our industry, year in, year out, as clients come out for renewal, their prices come down. That's what we do. As we go out and get we get better discounts for our clients and I think it's an important role. As far as what we might have to do or anything else, that's not a pertinent question at that time because we're in the process of trying to solve and make sure that the government is comfortable with this with what we're doing and we're going to get through that first and we have any -- if there's anything we needed to discuss later, we'll be happy to make sure you are all informed of that.

Last night, we reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.82, up 15% from the prior year. EPS for the year was $2.97, up 19%.

Last night, we reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.82, up 15% from the prior year. EPS for the year was $2.97, up 19%. Cash flow from operations was $532 million for the quarter and $2.2 billion for the year.
Since our last call, we continue to make progress towards completing the Medco acquisition, including securing the remainder of the financing, obtaining shareholder approval and certifying our substantial compliance with the FTC's second request. As a result of this progress, we maintained high levels of project spending to free up capacity for integration activities in 2012, and delayed cost savings opportunity, keeping staffing at higher levels to support integration planning.
SG&A cost were up $17 million year-over-year, reflecting the increased spending and an accrual for tax items, partially offset by lower management compensation. Despite this increased spending, gross profit margin was 7.4%, in line with last year's fourth quarter. EBITDA was up 8% over last year. EBITDA per adjusted Rx rose to $3.66, up 6%, and EPS grew 19% for the year.
Although EPS was strong, it was below our target due to lower claims volume, driven by utilization and increased attrition as a result of poor economic environment, increased spending on projects and higher staffing levels to prepare for integration, and investing to support clients and members as they changed retail pharmacies. Because EPS was below target, management bonuses were 0 in 2011. During the quarter, we settled $725 million of the remaining $750 million accelerated share repurchase, resulting in the receipt of 2.1 million additional shares. These shares are excluded from our outstanding shares this quarter.
The ASRs have resulted in the retirement 33.4 million shares of this year. 
As we've been saying for the past several months, we plan to provide combined 2012 guidance after the closing of the transaction when we have had a chance to review and consolidate our forecast for the year.  Our view of the transaction remains unchanged. We believe the acquisition will be slightly accretive to adjusted EPS in the first full year after closing and moderately accretive once fully integrated. We expect to realize $1 billion in net synergies once fully integrated.
And at this point, I'll turn the call over to George."

The actions we took in 2011 demonstrated our ability to advance healthcare through innovation, execute on our unwavering alignment with clients and position ourselves to address the national mandate for more affordable healthcare, higher quality healthcare through our merger with Medco. We succeeded by helping our clients solve for issues in an industry that's ever-changing and ever-challenging, which positions us well for 2012 and beyond. Our research in new solutions lab continues to deliver innovative products and solutions that addresses our clients' pain points, such as poor adherence, which leads to $300 billion in healthcare waste each year. We launched Screen Rx, a new product offering, where predictive modeling is employed to determine which members are likely to be non-adherent in the future and tailor an intervention to best suit each individual. We are setting a new standard in healthcare by fighting non-adherence before it begins. 
Another tool that continues to gain traction in the marketplace to specially benefit services, and an innovative offering that addresses the skyrocketing cost of specialty drugs across the pharmacy/medical spectrum. We can forecast, guarantee and deliver measurable savings by applying proven tools for specialty drugs, regardless of where patients receive the medication.
Our innovative approach to the marketplace, ability to drive positive clinical behavior and unwavering commitment to alignment contribute to a strong selling season with 97% retention, 3 signature wins and positive script growth expected for 2012. And as we expect that this momentum will continue into the current selling season, one reason for our confidence is successfully had in executing our retail strategy. We're planning execution and significant client support, we execute the largest retail market share movement in the history of pharmacy. We accomplish this with very little disruption, while delivering savings to our clients and patients by eliminating a high cost provider from our network.
We continue to make progress towards closing the transition -- transaction with Medco. The combination of our complementary strengths will accelerate our clinical offerings, which will reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes. By blending the combined clinical skill with the behavioral sciences, we'll be able to accelerate efforts to promote greater efficiencies in the healthcare system and better protect American families from the rising cost of prescription medications. Our shared vision is to increase therapy adherence, lower costs and drive the better health outcomes.
At this point, we'll be happy to answer any questions."

If I miss something, just remind me. Yes, we ramped up our call center associates, both in our from pharmacy help desk and our patient care advocates, significantly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Keep in mind, we had a huge wins in our Medicare -- from our Medicare clients that brought a lot of new lives in, in the fourth quarter. That, coupled with all the Medicare changes that normally take place, plus all the benefit design changes that occur on 11. And then, quite frankly, roughly 20% of our book had been in Walgreens stores, and almost all of that was scheduled to move, and so we wanted to make sure that this 11 went flawlessly. We decided we would over expend in order to make sure that the client experience and the member experience was the best that we could have. And I think we were rather successful at that, and quite frankly, we did over staff. But again, I think it was the right answer. The clients, although very incredibly supportive. We had an obligation to them to make sure this went off without a hitch. And we needed to make sure that every member who calls in, that was looking for a convenient outlet or a way to process their prescriptions, whether it was a movement to mail or to another retailer, that we would make sure we could handle that and give them top-class service, and our operations people executed in an exemplary manner. I would tell you that there was -- the movement has been very good for us. It really does endorse the fact that, specially narrower networks, in fact do work. At the end of the day, taking out a large retailer like this, in effect speaks to a narrow network. We don't have them in. And 98.5%, 98.4%, somewhere in that range, of our book is now in a narrow network. So we feel very good about it. Our clients are very supportive. I think what really speaks to it is the fact that this did go off. Our phones aren't ringing. People aren't concerned, our clients aren't upset. So this has been a -- truly has been a good move for us, and in our cost for our clients, get better year-over-year. So we're excited about it. Now to the extent that Walgreens wants to come back, wants to have a relationship, wants to help drive down the cost of healthcare, it can't be -- I appreciate the fact that they are trying to do some very good things with respect to clinical offerings and other avenues to try to impact the overall healthcare spectrum. But quite frankly, that hasn't been proven to reduce cost. And many of the things that they're offering in the pharmacy are being offered by many others out there. So I don't see them as differentiated. And it just came with a good conscience, pay them a significant premium for something that everyone else is doing and doing this as well. So we are quite content where we sit today, and to the extent that they want to get a relationship and be in line with the rest of healthcare cost and we're willing to entertain those conversations."

So people that are coming to us -- we've probably have eliminated some clients from an offering. I mean, someone that really gnats Walgreens in isn't going to call us up. But there's thousands and thousands of clients and millions and millions of Americans out there, so the market's plenty, big enough. And the book we have certainly isn't concerned. And I think the fact that we just picked up catalysts, and I'll refer to that, I mean, have picked up the client from Catalyst in Maryland because that publicly have been put out there, speaks to the fact that people are willing to make those decisions if it saves money. This is a tough economy. And if you see your cost going up and somebody's giving you an option that can reduce your cost further without compromising healthcare outcomes or still improving health outcomes, why not take advantage of it? And I think that's what we offer and that's the same thing for even narrowing the network further. It does provide an opportunity to save money. And we may -- if you talk about a buck of scripts as being irrelevant, well, if you got 1 million scripts, that's $1 million a year. I would do a tremendous amount of things for $1 million a year. I don't know by you, but that's a lot of money to me. And especially if I haven't done anything to compromise the outcomes. If everything is status quo, people are still getting their pills, people are still getting their drugs, people still have convenient access to pharmacists. What have really the changed? All we've done is put $1 million into our shareholders pockets. That seems like a pretty smart thing to me. I don't laugh at $0.10 and $0.15 a script, and especially when you start talking $1 script. That's real money."

We feel ourselves to be very much accountable to our shareholders. And if we make statements that make projections and then don't live up to them, we don't feel it's right to reward ourselves, as management, and have our shareholders miss out. So yes, we take our bonuses down accordingly when we miss, and this was a big issue for me, personally. I thought the economy was turning in the fourth quarter of last year. Things were going to improve. I didn't think that we could see 3 or 4 years in a row of 0 utilization increases. I thought that I saw employment trends starting to pick back up. Bells did not occur. So between utilization and member attrition inside of our current book of business that caused us to miss earnings -- once we get into that situation, we have a tremendous opportunity, such as Medco in front of us, we decided the right answer was to accelerate spending and get ahead of a lot of the Medicare and Health Care Reform projects that were staring us in the face. So we've significantly increased our IT budgets, as I talked about a few minutes ago, we also added a lot of staff in to make and sure that we were ready for 11 and we're prepared for the huge migration of members away from Walgreens. And so we were very well positioned for that and I think it was the right thing to do, and likewise, we didn't take bonuses. As far as 2012 is concerned, for me, 2012 we're spending a lot of money trying to get ready for Medco. There's a lot of hidden money, if you will, that you don't see because we have consultants in, we have -- our teams are working on projects. Normally, we'd be looking at other opportunities, but instead, people are focused on meetings around integration planning and so things are a little bit on the back burner. We also know the importance of client. So while we have a group of people that are focused on integration, we have to really double-down on client service because we have to make sure our clients understand that this is going to be status quo for them through this integration, and that they will not miss a beat in service while we integrate Medco into our books. So it takes a lot of people and a lot of effort to get all those things done. On that note, we've put together a sketchy preliminary budget for 2012, which we have internally. That numbers, where we will base our bonuses on an unlikely event we didn't close Medco, we would release those numbers out to you if that event were to occur. But I don't see that as happening. Instead, as soon as we close and we get our numbers together, we will come forward with a combined budget. To me, coming out with the '12 numbers is fairly irrelevant because it's too much dependent upon money we're spending without a return, without the Medco deal. So it's just not all that relevant. It becomes relevant, obviously, if the deal doesn't close. So we, at that time, we would disclose it."

I think what we're seeing is that people are employing people, but they're doing it in a more on a temporary basis, consulting basis and not necessarily bringing people back into permanent positions the way we've seen on a recession -- when you come out of recession in the past. So employment pickups has not been overwhelmingly large in our book of businesses and just haven't seen it. Likewise, utilization continues to be very concerning. It's concerning to me as a citizen of the United States because if people aren't taking their medications, we know people aren't getting skinnier and we know they're not getting healthier, and if utilization isn't going up as the baby boomers are getting into those later years, there's something fundamentally wrong here. And all that is going to relate into higher ER visits and higher doctor and hospital costs in the future, which is not a good thing for our country, but that's what we're headed. So we remain, for our 2012 in our planning, we're assuming that job growth won't come about, but it's not going to decline. It's going to stay relatively flat. And the utilization trends are going to stay below 1% or right at close to 1% for this year which is, again, very concerning but we figured that's the prudent thing to do at this juncture."

As far as the -- the other question was around Walgreens -- oh, the staffing levels. Yes, what we do, over time -- is we wanted to make sure we cleared January 31 and got through all that. So once we got beyond that date, then we start to attrition and taking out the less productive employees and going on to giving people some time off and what-have-you. We also want to make sure we're probably geared up for the whole Medco integration situation. As you probably know when you go through a merger, a lot of people get nervous and they leave and so some employment trends can get hurt. And we just want to make sure we were properly staffed for that as well. So we're being cautious here as we progress through this year."

We often find out we lost business because we were $0.10 a script out of the market, and people move on $0.10. And so I sit there and I struggle with, what does it really mean then when narrow networks aren't worth it? If I'm willing to move and disrupt my entire book of business and change formularies for $0.10, if I can save $0.50 to $2 depending on how narrow I want to make the network or even more if I really narrow down the network, then that's a lot more than $0.10. And so it's hard for me to get my arms around that issue. I think the concern though, by many, was if I'm going to save $1 by narrowing this network or $2 by narrowing the network, whatever the number is, is that enough because there was this feeling that denying access to a given pharmacy may play havoc on my HR department and what disruption this might be and how upset are my employees going to be? Well, what we just figured out, through this process, was there virtually none. That doesn't mean that somebody that wasn't tied to Walgreens, an individual, didn't have to learn a new pharmacists at Kroger or CBS or wherever they ended up going and become friends with a new pharmacist, and that is where it is. But it really did go off without a hitch. At the end of day, as I said earlier, NEXIUM is NEXIUM, LIPITOR is LIPITOR, drugs are drugs and it shouldn't matter that much whose counting to 30. And I just believe that we should be able to make sure that we put the right person in front of the right cost and make sure that we serve our clients properly. Taking cost out of the healthcare system is of paramount importance to us and that's what were going to do. And I do think that the narrow networks speak to that and serve that occasion. And depending on what happens with the economy, when the employer is looking at laying off hundreds and hundreds of people, if I'm an HR director and I come in with a proposal that saves a $1 million, how welcome is that going to be? Nobody, as a CEO, I don't particularly like to lay off people. I don't think any of my peers like to lay off people. And we all have our demands and needs to meet our shareholders' expectations, so there's a lot of pressure on a CEO. And if you can deliver them without disrupting your client base, I think that's critically important. So we are absolutely focused on that and we believe that the community pharmacists severe a very important role in healthcare, that they do a tremendous amount. But we just don't see that 1 pharmacist does it that much better than another pharmacist, at least not by change. And so we're just not going to pay those premiums."

The FTC is doing their job. They're trying to make sure that the American public is going to do better because of this acquisition. And we're right there with them. We believe that this acquisition speaks to what this country needs more than anything, which is a reduction in the cost of healthcare. And we're there to show them that through our previous acquisitions, that has occurred, and through this acquisition, it will continue to occur. At the end of the day, that's a lot of pushback from the retail pharmacists because they're worried about us the cost of reimbursement. Well, that's our job. The job is that the cost of branded products go up at roughly 10% a year. If we're not in there and trying to negotiate part of that 10% for our clients, then all that goes back to the pharmacies. That can't occur. People can't get a 10% per unit increase each and every year. It's okay if you can move people from brands to generics from a higher cost drug to lower cost drug and save that patient money to make more money. But not just by standing still and all of a sudden, on December 31, I fill 1 prescription and then on January 2, I fill the next one and all of a sudden I make 10% more. That just doesn't make any sense. And had have to be that insulator, that filter that takes some of that inflation out of the equation, gives it back to our clients. And that's a very important role. That's the problem with what we had have with Walgreens in this situation, it is that they wanted us to hold rates flat and hold them flat over a 3-year period, and that can't occur. That lines the pockets of Walgreens by a 10% increase each and every year ever, at the time our clients are then facing not only a 10% on brand, they're not getting the benefits from the generics, because they wanted to hold those flat as well. And they also wanted to get all the utilization increases. And that's just -- we just can't stand there and allow that to happen. So our job is to make sure our clients can maintain reductions in prices. If you look at our industry, year in and year out, as clients come up for renewal, their prices come down. That's what we do. We go out and get we get better discounts for our clients and I think it's an important role. As far as what we might have to do or anything else, that's not a pertinent question at that time because we're in the process of trying to solve and make sure the government is comfortable with this, what we're doing, and we're going to get through that first.

Last night, we reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.82, up 15% from the prior year. EPS for the year was $2.97, up 19%.

Last night, we reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.82, up 15% from the prior year. EPS for the year was $2.97, up 19%. Cash flow from operations was $532 million for the quarter and $2.2 billion for the year.
Since our last call, we continue to make progress towards completing the Medco acquisition, including securing the remainder of the financing, obtaining shareholder approval and certifying our substantial compliance with the FTC's second request. As a result of this progress, we maintained high levels of project spending to free up capacity for integration activities in 2012, and delayed cost savings opportunity, keeping staffing at higher levels to support integration planning.
SG&A cost were up $17 million year-over-year, reflecting the increased spending and an accrual for tax items, partially offset by lower management compensation. Despite this increased spending, gross profit margin was 7.4%, in line with last year's fourth quarter. EBITDA was up 8% over last year. EBITDA per adjusted Rx rose to $3.66, up 6%, and EPS grew 19% for the year.
Although EPS was strong, it was below our target due to lower claims volume, driven by utilization and increased attrition as a result of poor economic environment, increased spending on projects and higher staffing levels to prepare for integration, and investing to support clients and members as they changed retail pharmacies. Because EPS was below target, management bonuses were 0 in 2011. During the quarter, we settled $725 million of the remaining $750 million accelerated share repurchase, resulting in the receipt of 2.1 million additional shares. These shares are excluded from our outstanding shares this quarter.
The ASRs have resulted in the retirement 33.4 million shares of this year. 
As we've been saying for the past several months, we plan to provide combined 2012 guidance after the closing of the transaction when we have had a chance to review and consolidate our forecast for the year.  Our view of the transaction remains unchanged. We believe the acquisition will be slightly accretive to adjusted EPS in the first full year after closing and moderately accretive once fully integrated. We expect to realize $1 billion in net synergies once fully integrated.
And at this point, I'll turn the call over to George."

The actions we took in 2011 demonstrated our ability to advance healthcare through innovation, execute on our unwavering alignment with clients and position ourselves to address the national mandate for more affordable healthcare, higher quality healthcare through our merger with Medco. We succeeded by helping our clients solve for issues in an industry that's ever-changing and ever-challenging, which positions us well for 2012 and beyond. Our research in new solutions lab continues to deliver innovative products and solutions that addresses our clients' pain points, such as poor adherence, which leads to $300 billion in healthcare waste each year. We launched Screen Rx, a new product offering, where predictive modeling is employed to determine which members are likely to be non-adherent in the future and tailor an intervention to best suit each individual. We are setting a new standard in healthcare by fighting non-adherence before it begins. 
Another tool that continues to gain traction in the marketplace to specially benefit services, and an innovative offering that addresses the skyrocketing cost of specialty drugs across the pharmacy/medical spectrum. We can forecast, guarantee and deliver measurable savings by applying proven tools for specialty drugs, regardless of where patients receive the medication.
Our innovative approach to the marketplace, ability to drive positive clinical behavior and unwavering commitment to alignment contribute to a strong selling season with 97% retention, 3 signature wins and positive script growth expected for 2012. And as we expect that this momentum will continue into the current selling season, one reason for our confidence is successfully had in executing our retail strategy. We're planning execution and significant client support, we execute the largest retail market share movement in the history of pharmacy. We accomplish this with very little disruption, while delivering savings to our clients and patients by eliminating a high cost provider from our network.
We continue to make progress towards closing the transition -- transaction with Medco. The combination of our complementary strengths will accelerate our clinical offerings, which will reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes. By blending the combined clinical skill with the behavioral sciences, we'll be able to accelerate efforts to promote greater efficiencies in the healthcare system and better protect American families from the rising cost of prescription medications. Our shared vision is to increase therapy adherence, lower costs and drive the better health outcomes.
At this point, we'll be happy to answer any questions."

If I miss something, just remind me. Yes, we ramped up our call center associates, both in our from pharmacy help desk and our patient care advocates, significantly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Keep in mind, we had a huge wins in our Medicare -- from our Medicare clients that brought a lot of new lives in, in the fourth quarter. That, coupled with all the Medicare changes that normally take place, plus all the benefit design changes that occur on 1/1. And then, quite frankly, roughly 20% of our book had been in the Walgreens stores, and almost all of that was scheduled to move, and so we wanted to make sure that this 11 went flawlessly. We decided we would over expend in order to make sure that the client experience and the member experience was the best that we could have. And I think we were rather successful at that, and quite frankly, we did over staff. But again, I think it was the right answer. The clients, although very incredibly supportive -- we had an obligation to them to make sure this went off without a hitch. And we needed to make sure that every member who calls in, that was looking for a convenient outlet or a way to process their prescriptions, whether it was a movement to mail or to another retailer, that we would make sure we could handle that and give them top-class service, and our operations people executed in an exemplary manner. I would tell you that there was -- the movement has been very good for us. It really does endorse the fact that, especially narrower networks, in fact do work. At the end of the day, taking out a large retailer like this, in effect speaks to a narrow network. We don't have them in. And 98.5%, 98.4%, somewhere in that range, of our book is now in a narrow network. So we feel very good about it. Our clients are very supportive. I think what really speaks to it is the fact that this did go off. Our phones aren't ringing. People aren't concerned, our clients aren't upset. So this has been a -- truly has been a good move for us, and in our cost for our clients, get better year-over-year. So we're excited about it. Now to the extent that Walgreens wants to come back, wants to have a relationship, wants to help drive down the cost of healthcare, it can't be -- I appreciate the fact that they are trying to do some very good things with respect to clinical offerings and other avenues to try to impact the overall healthcare spectrum. But quite frankly, that hasn't been proven to reduce cost. And many of the things that they're offering in the pharmacy are being offered by many others out there. So I don't see them as differentiated. And it just came with a good conscience, pay them a significant premium for something that everyone else is doing and doing it just as well. So we are quite content where we sit today, and to the extent that they want to get a relationship and be in line with the rest of healthcare cost then we're willing to entertain those conversations."

So people that are coming to us -- we've probably have eliminated some clients from an offering. I mean, someone that really gnats Walgreens in isn't going to call us up. But there's thousands and thousands of clients and millions and millions of Americans out there, so the market's plenty, big enough. And the book we have certainly isn't concerned. And I think the fact that we just picked up Catalyst, and I'll refer to that, I mean, have picked up the client from Catalyst in Maryland because that publicly have been put out there, speaks to the fact that people are willing to make those decisions if it saves money. This is a tough economy. And if you see your cost going up and somebody's giving you an option that can reduce your cost further without compromising healthcare outcomes or still improving health outcomes, why not take advantage of it? And I think that's what we offer and that's the same thing for even narrowing the network further. It does provide an opportunity to save money. And we may -- if you talk about a buck of scripts as being irrelevant, well, if you got 1 million scripts, that's $1 million a year. I would do a tremendous amount of things for $1 million a year. I don't know by you, but that's a lot of money to me. And especially if I haven't done anything to compromise the outcomes. If everything is status quo, people are still getting their pills, people are still getting their drugs, people still have convenient access to pharmacists. What have really the changed? All we've done is put $1 million into our shareholders pockets. That seems like a pretty smart thing to me. I don't laugh at $0.10 and $0.15 a script, and especially when you start talking $1 script. That's real money."

We feel ourselves to be very much accountable to our shareholders. And if we make statements that make projections and then don't live up to them, we don't feel it's right to reward ourselves, as management, and have our shareholders miss out. So yes, we take our bonuses down accordingly when we miss, and this was a big issue for me, personally. I thought the economy was turning in the fourth quarter of last year. Things were going to improve. I didn't think that we could see 3 or 4 years in a row of 0 utilization increases. I thought that I saw employment trends starting to pick back up. Bells did not occur. So between utilization and member attrition inside of our current book of business that caused us to miss earnings -- once we get into that situation, we have a tremendous opportunity, such as Medco in front of us, we decided the right answer was to accelerate spending and get ahead of a lot of the Medicare and Health Care Reform projects that were staring us in the face. So we've significantly increased our IT budgets, as I talked about a few minutes ago, we also added a lot of staff in to make and sure that we were ready for 11 and we're prepared for the huge migration of members away from Walgreens. And so we were very well positioned for that and I think it was the right thing to do, and likewise, we didn't take bonuses. As far as 2012 is concerned, for me, 2012 we're spending a lot of money trying to get ready for Medco. There's a lot of hidden money, if you will, that you don't see because we have consultants in, we have -- our teams are working on projects. Normally, we'd be looking at other opportunities, but instead, people are focused on meetings around integration planning and so things are a little bit on the back burner. We also know the importance of client. So while we have a group of people that are focused on integration, we have to really double-down on client service because we have to make sure our clients understand that this is going to be status quo for them through this integration, and that they will not miss a beat in service while we integrate Medco into our books. So it takes a lot of people and a lot of effort to get all those things done. On that note, we've put together a sketchy preliminary budget for 2012, which we have internally. That numbers is what we will base our bonuses on an unlikely event we didn't close Medco, we would release those numbers out to you if that event were to occur. But I don't see that as happening. Instead, as soon as we close and we get our numbers together, we will come forward with a combined budget. To me, coming out with the '12 numbers is fairly irrelevant because it's too much dependent upon money we're spending without a return, without the Medco deal. So it's just not all that relevant. It becomes relevant, obviously, if the deal doesn't close. So we, at that time, we would disclose it."

I think what we're seeing is that people are employing people, but they're doing it in a more --  on a temporary basis, consulting basis and not necessarily bringing people back into permanent positions the way we've seen on a recession -- when you come out of recession in the past. So employment pickups has not been overwhelmingly large in our book of businesses and I just haven't seen it. Likewise, utilization continues to be very concerning. It's concerning to me as a citizen of the United States because if people aren't taking their medications, we know people aren't getting skinnier and we know they're not getting healthier, and if utilization isn't going up as the baby boomers are getting into those later years, there's something fundamentally wrong here. And all that is going to relate into higher ER visits and higher doctor and hospital costs in the future, which is not a good thing for our country, but that's what we're headed. So we remain, for our 2012 in our planning, we're assuming that job growth won't come about, but it's not going to decline. It's going to stay relatively flat.

We also want to make sure we're probably geared up for the whole Medco integration situation.

We often find out we lost business because we were $0.10 a script out of the market, and people move on $0.10. And so I sit there and I struggle with, what does it really mean then when narrow networks aren't worth it? If I'm willing to move and disrupt my entire book of business and change formularies for $0.10, if I can save $0.50 to $2 depending on how narrow I want to make the network or even more if I really narrow down the network, then that's a lot more than $0.10. And so it's hard for me to get my arms around that issue. I think the concern though, by many, was if I'm going to save $1 by narrowing this network or $2 by narrowing the network, whatever the number is, is that enough because there was this feeling that denying access to a given pharmacy may play havoc on my HR department and what disruption this might be and how upset are my employees going to be? Well, what we just figured out, through this process, was there was virtually none. That doesn't mean that somebody that wasn't really tied to Walgreens, an individual, didn't have to learn a new pharmacists at Kroger or CVS or wherever they ended up going and become friends with a new pharmacist, and that is where it is. But it really did go off without a hitch. At the end of day, as I said earlier, NEXIUM is NEXIUM, LIPITOR is LIPITOR, drugs are drugs and it shouldn't matter that much whose counting to 30. And I just believe that we should be able to make sure that we put the right person in front of the right cost and make sure that we serve our clients properly. Taking cost out of the healthcare system is of paramount importance to us and that's what were going to do. And I do think that the narrow networks speak to that and serve that occasion. And depending on what happens with the economy, when the employer is looking at laying off hundreds and hundreds of people, if I'm an HR director and I come in with a proposal that saves a $1 million, how welcome is that going to be? Nobody, as a CEO, I don't particularly like to lay off people. I don't think any of my peers like to lay off people. And we all have our demands and needs to meet our shareholders' expectations, so there's a lot of pressure on a CEO. And if you can deliver them without disrupting your client base, I think that's critically important. So we are absolutely focused on that and we believe that the community pharmacists severe a very important role in healthcare, that they do a tremendous amount. But we just don't see that 1 pharmacist does it that much better than another pharmacist, at least not by change. And so we're just not going to pay those premiums."

We believe that this acquisition speaks to what this country needs more than anything, which is a reduction in the cost of healthcare. And we're there to show them that through our previous acquisitions, that has occurred, and through this acquisition, it will continue to occur. At the end of the day, there's a lot of pushback from the retail pharmacists because they're worried about us the cost of reimbursement. Well, that's our job. The job is that the cost of branded products go up at roughly 10% a year. If we're not in there trying to negotiate part of that 10% for our clients, then all that goes back to the pharmacies. That can't occur. People can't get a 10% per unit increase each and every year. It's okay if you can move people from brands to generics from a higher cost drug to lower cost drug and save that patient money to make more money. But not just by standing still and all of a sudden, on December 31, I fill 1 prescription and then on January 2, I fill the next one and all of a sudden I make 10% more. That just doesn't make any sense. And we had  to be that insulator, that filter that takes some of that inflation out of the equation, gives it back to our clients. And that's a very important role. That's the problem with what we had have with Walgreens in this situation, it is that they wanted us to hold rates flat and hold them flat over a 3-year period, and that can't occur. That lines the pockets of Walgreens by a 10% increase each and every year ever, at the time our clients are then facing not only a 10% on brand, they're not getting the benefits from the generics, because they wanted to hold those flat as well. And they also wanted to get all the utilization increases. And that's just -- we just can't stand there and allow that to happen. So our job is to make sure our clients can maintain reductions in prices. If you look at our industry, year in and year out, as clients come up for renewal, their prices come down. That's what we do. We go out and get we get better discounts for our clients and I think it's an important role. As far as what we might have to do or anything else, that's not a pertinent question at that time because we're in the process of trying to solve and make sure the government is comfortable with this, what we're doing, and we're going to get through that first. And we have any -- if there's anything we need to discuss later, we'll be happy to make sure you are all informed of that. But we feel good about where we stand and were going to move this to conclusion."

Last night, we reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.82, up 15% from the prior year. EPS for the year was $2.97, up 19%.

Last night, we reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.82, up 15% from the prior year. EPS for the year was $2.97, up 19%. Cash flow from operations was $532 million for the quarter and $2.2 billion for the year.
Since our last call, we continue to make progress towards completing the Medco acquisition, including securing the remainder of the financing, obtaining shareholder approval and certifying our substantial compliance with the FTC's second request. As a result of this progress, we maintained high levels of project spending to free up capacity for integration activities in 2012, and delayed cost savings opportunity, keeping staffing at higher levels to support integration planning.
SG&A cost were up $17 million year-over-year, reflecting the increased spending and an accrual for tax items, partially offset by lower management compensation. Despite this increased spending, gross profit margin was 7.4%, in line with last year's fourth quarter. EBITDA was up 8% over last year. EBITDA per adjusted Rx rose to $3.66, up 6%, and EPS grew 19% for the year.
Although EPS was strong, it was below our target due to lower claims volume, driven by utilization and increased attrition as a result of poor economic environment, increased spending on projects and higher staffing levels to prepare for integration, and investing to support clients and members as they changed retail pharmacies. Because EPS was below target, management bonuses were 0 in 2011. During the quarter, we settled $725 million of the remaining $750 million accelerated share repurchase, resulting in the receipt of 2.1 million additional shares. These shares are excluded from our outstanding shares this quarter.
The ASRs have resulted in the retirement 33.4 million shares of this year. 
As we've been saying for the past several months, we plan to provide combined 2012 guidance after the closing of the transaction when we have had a chance to review and consolidate our forecast for the year.  Our view of the transaction remains unchanged. We believe the acquisition will be slightly accretive to adjusted EPS in the first full year after closing and moderately accretive once fully integrated. We expect to realize $1 billion in net synergies once fully integrated.
And at this point, I'll turn the call over to George."

The actions we took in 2011 demonstrated our ability to advance healthcare through innovation, execute on our unwavering alignment with clients and position ourselves to address the national mandate for more affordable healthcare, higher quality healthcare through our merger with Medco. We succeeded by helping our clients solve for issues in an industry that's ever-changing and ever-challenging, which positions us well for 2012 and beyond. Our research in new solutions lab continues to deliver innovative products and solutions that addresses our clients' pain points, such as poor adherence, which leads to $300 billion in healthcare waste each year. We launched Screen Rx, a new product offering, where predictive modeling is employed to determine which members are likely to be non-adherent in the future and tailor an intervention to best suit each individual. We are setting a new standard in healthcare by fighting non-adherence before it begins. 
Another tool that continues to gain traction in the marketplace to specially benefit services, and an innovative offering that addresses the skyrocketing cost of specialty drugs across the pharmacy/medical spectrum. We can forecast, guarantee and deliver measurable savings by applying proven tools for specialty drugs, regardless of where patients receive the medication.
Our innovative approach to the marketplace, ability to drive positive clinical behavior and unwavering commitment to alignment contribute to a strong selling season with 97% retention, 3 signature wins and positive script growth expected for 2012. And as we expect that this momentum will continue into the current selling season, one reason for our confidence is successfully had in executing our retail strategy. We're planning execution and significant client support, we execute the largest retail market share movement in the history of pharmacy. We accomplish this with very little disruption, while delivering savings to our clients and patients by eliminating a high cost provider from our network.
We continue to make progress towards closing the transition -- transaction with Medco. The combination of our complementary strengths will accelerate our clinical offerings, which will reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes. By blending the combined clinical skill with the behavioral sciences, we'll be able to accelerate efforts to promote greater efficiencies in the healthcare system and better protect American families from the rising cost of prescription medications. Our shared vision is to increase therapy adherence, lower costs and drive the better health outcomes.
At this point, we'll be happy to answer any questions."

If I miss something, just remind me. Yes, we ramped up our call center associates, both in our from pharmacy help desk and our patient care advocates, significantly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Keep in mind, we had a huge wins in our Medicare -- from our Medicare clients that brought a lot of new lives in, in the fourth quarter. That, coupled with all the Medicare changes that normally take place, plus all the benefit design changes that occur on 1/1. And then, quite frankly, roughly 20% of our book had been in the Walgreens stores, and almost all of that was scheduled to move, and so we wanted to make sure that this 11 went flawlessly. We decided we would over expend in order to make sure that the client experience and the member experience was the best that we could have. And I think we were rather successful at that, and quite frankly, we did over staff. But again, I think it was the right answer. The clients, although very incredibly supportive -- we had an obligation to them to make sure this went off without a hitch. And we needed to make sure that every member who calls in, that was looking for a convenient outlet or a way to process their prescriptions, whether it was a movement to mail or to another retailer, that we would make sure we could handle that and give them top-class service, and our operations people executed in an exemplary manner. I would tell you that there was -- the movement has been very good for us. It really does endorse the fact that, especially narrower networks, in fact do work. At the end of the day, taking out a large retailer like this, in effect speaks to a narrow network. We don't have them in. And 98.5%, 98.4%, somewhere in that range, of our book is now in a narrow network. So we feel very good about it. Our clients are very supportive. I think what really speaks to it is the fact that this did go off. Our phones aren't ringing. People aren't concerned, our clients aren't upset. So this has been a -- truly has been a good move for us, and in our cost for our clients, get better year-over-year. So we're excited about it. Now to the extent that Walgreens wants to come back, wants to have a relationship, wants to help drive down the cost of healthcare, it can't be -- I appreciate the fact that they are trying to do some very good things with respect to clinical offerings and other avenues to try to impact the overall healthcare spectrum. But quite frankly, that hasn't been proven to reduce cost. And many of the things that they're offering in the pharmacy are being offered by many others out there. So I don't see them as differentiated. And it just came with a good conscience, pay them a significant premium for something that everyone else is doing and doing it just as well. So we are quite content where we sit today, and to the extent that they want to get a relationship and be in line with the rest of healthcare cost then we're willing to entertain those conversations."

So people that are coming to us -- we've probably have eliminated some clients from an offering. I mean, someone that really gnats Walgreens in isn't going to call us up. But there's thousands and thousands of clients and millions and millions of Americans out there, so the market's plenty, big enough. And the book we have certainly isn't concerned. And I think the fact that we just picked up Catalyst, and I'll refer to that, I mean, have picked up the client from Catalyst in Maryland because that publicly have been put out there, speaks to the fact that people are willing to make those decisions if it saves money. This is a tough economy. And if you see your cost going up and somebody's giving you an option that can reduce your cost further without compromising healthcare outcomes or still improving health outcomes, why not take advantage of it? And I think that's what we offer and that's the same thing for even narrowing the network further. It does provide an opportunity to save money. And we may -- if you talk about a buck of scripts as being irrelevant, well, if you got 1 million scripts, that's $1 million a year. I would do a tremendous amount of things for $1 million a year. I don't know by you, but that's a lot of money to me. And especially if I haven't done anything to compromise the outcomes. If everything is status quo, people are still getting their pills, people are still getting their drugs, people still have convenient access to pharmacists. What have really the changed? All we've done is put $1 million into our shareholders pockets. That seems like a pretty smart thing to me. I don't laugh at $0.10 and $0.15 a script, and especially when you start talking $1 script. That's real money."

We feel ourselves to be very much accountable to our shareholders. And if we make statements that make projections and then don't live up to them, we don't feel it's right to reward ourselves, as management, and have our shareholders miss out. So yes, we take our bonuses down accordingly when we miss, and this was a big issue for me, personally. I thought the economy was turning in the fourth quarter of last year. Things were going to improve. I didn't think that we could see 3 or 4 years in a row of 0 utilization increases. I thought that I saw employment trends starting to pick back up. Bells did not occur. So between utilization and member attrition inside of our current book of business that caused us to miss earnings -- once we get into that situation, we have a tremendous opportunity, such as Medco in front of us, we decided the right answer was to accelerate spending and get ahead of a lot of the Medicare and Health Care Reform projects that were staring us in the face. So we've significantly increased our IT budgets, as I talked about a few minutes ago, we also added a lot of staff in to make and sure that we were ready for 11 and we're prepared for the huge migration of members away from Walgreens. And so we were very well positioned for that and I think it was the right thing to do, and likewise, we didn't take bonuses. As far as 2012 is concerned, for me, 2012 we're spending a lot of money trying to get ready for Medco. There's a lot of hidden money, if you will, that you don't see because we have consultants in, we have -- our teams are working on projects. Normally, we'd be looking at other opportunities, but instead, people are focused on meetings around integration planning and so things are a little bit on the back burner. We also know the importance of client. So while we have a group of people that are focused on integration, we have to really double-down on client service because we have to make sure our clients understand that this is going to be status quo for them through this integration, and that they will not miss a beat in service while we integrate Medco into our books. So it takes a lot of people and a lot of effort to get all those things done. On that note, we've put together a sketchy preliminary budget for 2012, which we have internally. That numbers is what we will base our bonuses on an unlikely event we didn't close Medco, we would release those numbers out to you if that event were to occur. But I don't see that as happening. Instead, as soon as we close and we get our numbers together, we will come forward with a combined budget. To me, coming out with the '12 numbers is fairly irrelevant because it's too much dependent upon money we're spending without a return, without the Medco deal. So it's just not all that relevant. It becomes relevant, obviously, if the deal doesn't close. So we, at that time, we would disclose it."

I think what we're seeing is that people are employing people, but they're doing it in a more --  on a temporary basis, consulting basis and not necessarily bringing people back into permanent positions the way we've seen on a recession -- when you come out of recession in the past. So employment pickups has not been overwhelmingly large in our book of businesses and I just haven't seen it. Likewise, utilization continues to be very concerning. It's concerning to me as a citizen of the United States because if people aren't taking their medications, we know people aren't getting skinnier and we know they're not getting healthier, and if utilization isn't going up as the baby boomers are getting into those later years, there's something fundamentally wrong here. And all that is going to relate into higher ER visits and higher doctor and hospital costs in the future, which is not a good thing for our country, but that's what we're headed. So we remain, for our 2012 in our planning, we're assuming that job growth won't come about, but it's not going to decline. It's going to stay relatively flat. And the utilization trends are going to stay below 1% or right at close to 1% for this year which is, again, very concerning but we figured that's the prudent thing to do at this juncture."

First of all, when we're out competing for business. We often find out we lost business because we were $0.10 a script out of the market, and people move on $0.10. And so I sit there and I struggle with, what",518,"Well, let me answer that in a couple of ways. First of all, when we're out competing for business. We often find out we lost business because we were $0.10 a script out of the market, and people move on $0.10. And so I sit there and I struggle with, what does it really mean then when narrow networks aren't worth it? If I'm willing to move and disrupt my entire book of business and change formularies for $0.10, if I can save $0.50 to $2 depending on how narrow I want to make the network or even more if I really narrow down the network, then that's a lot more than $0.10. And so it's hard for me to get my arms around that issue. I think the concern though, by many, was if I'm going to save $1 by narrowing this network or $2 by narrowing the network, whatever the number is, is that enough because there was this feeling that denying access to a given pharmacy may play havoc on my HR department and what disruption this might be and how upset are my employees going to be? Well, what we just figured out, through this process, was there was virtually none. That doesn't mean that somebody that wasn't really tied to Walgreens, an individual, didn't have to learn a new pharmacists at Kroger or CVS or wherever they ended up going and become friends with a new pharmacist, and that is where it is. But it really did go off without a hitch. At the end of day, as I said earlier, NEXIUM is NEXIUM, LIPITOR is LIPITOR, drugs are drugs and it shouldn't matter that much whose counting to 30. And I just believe that we should be able to make sure that we put the right person in front of the right cost and make sure that we serve our clients properly. Taking cost out of the healthcare system is of paramount importance to us and that's what we’re going to do. And I do think that the narrow networks speak to that and serve that occasion. And depending on what happens with the economy, when the employer is looking at laying off hundreds and hundreds of people, if I'm an HR director and I come in with a proposal that saves a $1 million, how welcome is that going to be? Nobody, as a CEO, I don't particularly like to lay off people. I don't think any of my peers like to lay off people. And we all have our demands and needs to meet our shareholders' expectations, so there's a lot of pressure on a CEO. And if you can deliver them without disrupting your client base, I think that's critically important. So we are absolutely focused on that and we believe that the community pharmacists severe a very important role in healthcare, that they do a tremendous amount. But we just don't see that 1 pharmacist does it that much better than another pharmacist, at least not by change. And so we're just not going to pay those premiums."

The FTC is doing their job. They're trying to make sure that the American public is going to do better because of this acquisition. And we're right there with them. We believe that this acquisition speaks to what this country needs more than anything, which is a reduction in the cost of healthcare. And we're there to show them that through our previous acquisitions, that has occurred, and through this acquisition, it will continue to occur. At the end of the day, there's a lot of pushback from the retail pharmacists because they're worried about us the cost of reimbursement. Well, that's our job. The job is that the cost of branded products go up at roughly 10% a year. If we're not in there trying to negotiate part of that 10% for our clients, then all that goes back to the pharmacies. That can't occur. People can't get a 10% per unit increase each and every year. It's okay if you can move people from brands to generics from a higher cost drug to lower cost drug and save that patient money to make more money. But not just by standing still and all of a sudden, on December 31, I fill 1 prescription and then on January 2, I fill the next one and all of a sudden I make 10% more. That just doesn't make any sense. And we had  to be that insulator, that filter that takes some of that inflation out of the equation, gives it back to our clients. And that's a very important role. That's the problem with what we had have with Walgreens in this situation, it is that they wanted us to hold rates flat and hold them flat over a 3-year period, and that can't occur. That lines the pockets of Walgreens by a 10% increase each and every year ever, at the time our clients are then facing not only a 10% on brand, they're not getting the benefits from the generics, because they wanted to hold those flat as well. And they also wanted to get all the utilization increases. And that's just -- we just can't stand there and allow that to happen. So our job is to make sure our clients can maintain reductions in prices. If you look at our industry, year in and year out, as clients come up for renewal, their prices come down. That's what we do. We go out and get we get better discounts for our clients and I think it's an important role. As far as what we might have to do or anything else, that's not a pertinent question at that time because we're in the process of trying to solve and make sure the government is comfortable with this, what we're doing, and we're going to get through that first. And we have any -- if there's anything we need to discuss later, we'll be happy to make sure you are all informed of that. But we feel good about where we stand and were going to move this to conclusion."

On April 2, we completed the acquisition of Medco. In anticipation of closing, we maintained high levels of project spending to free up capacity for integration activities in the year and delayed cost savings opportunity, keeping staffing at higher levels to support integration planning. We also incurred additional expenses during the quarter to ensure a smooth transition for new clients and to accrue management bonuses, which were not paid in 2011.
Despite this increased spending, gross profit was up 11%, gross profit margin was 7.1%, up slightly from 7% in the first quarter of 2011. EBITDA was up 7% over last year, and EBITDA for adjusted Rx rose to $3.40, up 3%. First quarter earnings per share was $0.73, up 11% from prior year. Cash flow from operations was $530 million for the quarter, a 117% increase from $244 million last year. 
Turning to guidance. We expect EPS for the year, excluding transaction, integration and amortization expenses, to be in a range of $3.36 to $3.66, representing growth of 18% over 2011 at the midpoint. Consistent with last year, EPS is more back-end loaded due to timing of new generics, realization of synergy and client billings expected in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted claims are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion. Gross profit and gross profit margins are expected to improve sequentially as we move through the year. This guidance assumes that diluted shares outstanding will average 833 million for the next 3 quarters and total 750 million shares on a weighted average basis for 2012.
This share count will be affected by the amount and timing of legacy Medco options and Rx use exercise. They are approximately 48 million outstanding and we have assumed that about 1/3 of these are exercised over the course of the year. 
Since we issued shares in the second quarter to complete this transaction, earnings per share for each quarter will not add up to earnings per share for the year. The tax rate assumed in our forecast is 39% for the year. If the share count or tax rate changes from our assumptions, our EPS forecast would most likely change. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to confirm that our view on synergy and accretion has not changed. We continue to expect the transaction to be slightly accretive in the first full year and moderately accretive once fully integrated. That means we expect to achieve $1 million of synergy in 2014 and that the transaction will be moderately accretive to standalone 2014 earnings per share.
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

After months of rigorous review, the FTC allowed our acquisition of Medco to proceed without any stipulation. This merger represents the next chapter of our mission to lower cost, drive outlays, improve adherence and deliver better health outcomes. Bringing our 2 companies together, provides limitless opportunities to innovate and improve how healthcare is delivered. Our successful track record of acquisitions is based on a philosophy of taking the best-in-class of both organizations and combining them for the benefit of our clients, patients and stockholders. Building upon a platform of clinical expertise and applying our understanding of the behavioral sciences, we have an unprecedented opportunity to improve patient outcomes, drive down the cost prescription medications and eliminate the wasteful spending that burdens the pharmacy benefit. This will help us charge, of course, for continued growth with the creation of innovative solutions to [indiscernible] our country's most pressing healthcare challenges.
We are receiving great feedback from clients and prospects. Our breadth of services that span traditional PBM management, specialty management, Medicaid and Medicare is unmatched in the industry and position us well for client retention and new sales opportunity. Just last month, I met with many of our clients at our Annual Outcomes Conference, our first large event as a combined company. Overwhelmingly, our clients are supportive of our merger and share our enthusiasm about the enhanced services they will receive. Our clients also continue to voice strong support for our retail strategy. The conference [indiscernible] industry-leading Drug Trend Report, which put out cost cutting edge solutions for most effectively managing a pharmacy benefit. This year, we focused on the $408 billion of waste due to suboptimal pharmacy-related behavior. Non-adherence contributes over $300 billion of this waste. This is enough to cover the cost of healthcare for nearly 45 million uninsured Americans. Our breakthrough adherence solution, screen Rx combines early detection with tailored interventions, improving outcomes and lowering costs. And the wake of our merger with Medco, screen Rx is a prime example of how Express Scripts is headed, making it easier for patients to make decisions that improve their health and lower the cost of healthcare. We have an unprecedented opportunity to help make the use of medicine safer and more affordable. This is exactly what employers, health plans, unions and government agencies need now. 
At this point, we'd be happy to answer any of your questions."

What are we hired to do at the end of the day? Our job is to take the waste out of this system. As I said in my prepared comments, there is billions and billions of dollars that are being wasted in the healthcare benefit. To the extent those dollars can be captured, we reduced the cost of healthcare, we improve health outcomes and therefore, we deliver better product. That is our job. So what are our clients looking for? They're looking to spend money where it matters, and not just spend money where it doesn't matter. So again, if a cutting-edge new cancer agent comes in the market, very expensive, we put it on the formulary. We have to put it on the formulary. We want to put it on the formulary because it's going to help our patients health outcomes improve. By the same token, those components of the healthcare system, they'll only drive up cost and don't improve health outcomes, there's no place for that. Companies today are struggling in this economy with the uncertainty of our global economy, other things that are going on throughout our country and the rest of the world, companies can't afford to spend money on things that don't matter. Pharmacists are very important element of the healthcare delivery system. To the extent that they're helping to improve individual's health outcomes by focusing on adherence, the right drug at the right time, with the proper directions, that's all very important of things and that's what we want to pay for. Merely dispensing the drug itself is not a value-added endeavor. So again, to the extent somebody want to charge more money for that activity, there's no room in the equation for that, quite frankly. Those clients that want it, that want to pay for it, that want to have -- that are willing to pay for that convenience factor, they may want to do it and they may go somewhere else. But, quite frankly, we're very content and do what our clients are asking us to do and that is to take out those unnecessary cost out of the equation. And that's our focus. That message is very well-received. We believe we are well positioned, as you see our script counts grew last year, unlike some people thought they would decline. We're very well positioned. I think at the end of the day, the question is going to be on our ability to continue to innovate and deliver quality products that take out waste, and that's our mission.

You're going to have a much different answer than if you got a young population, if you're a professional firm which turns over young people rather frequently, with a high density of young people, that's going to be a different answer. So I think every client is different and so that's why it one size doesn't fit all within a PBMs to have its tools to be able to evaluate that. I will tell you though, some companies are very agnostic of regarding their offerings and we saw clients with two-tiered products of almost no differential in price between the first and second tier with very open formulary and open access standards. And that's not our sweet spot. And those clients don't really -- we have a hard time providing much of a value to them because we're not taking cost out of the equation. We're not actually improving their health outcomes. Our tools don't work as well there. So it's just depends on the situation. But again, from our perspective, we look at every drug on our formulary. We look at every access point in our network. And we look at every dollar we spend. I think any company that's well run looks at every penny it spends and determines whether that penny is adding value to it's shareholders. If it is, you spend it. If it isn't, why spend it? There's too many great opportunity to save jobs, to grow companies, to improve margins. You don't spend money for nothing, and I think that's the message we have to our clients.

On April 2, we completed the acquisition of Medco. In anticipation of closing, we maintained high levels of project spending to free up capacity for integration activities in the year and delayed cost savings opportunities, keeping staffing at higher levels to support integration planning. We also incurred additional expenses during the quarter to ensure a smooth transition for new clients and to accrue management bonuses, which were not paid in 2011.
Despite this increased spending, gross profit was up 11%, gross profit margin was 7.1%, up slightly from 7% in the first quarter of 2011. EBITDA was up 7% over last year, and EBITDA for adjusted Rx rose to $3.40, up 3%. First quarter earnings per share was $0.73, up 11% from prior year. Cash flow from operations was $530 million for the quarter, a 117% increase from $244 million last year.
Turning to guidance. We expect EPS for the year, excluding transaction, integration and amortization expenses, to be in a range of $3.36 to $3.66, representing growth of 18% over 2011 at the midpoint. Consistent with last year, EPS is more back-end loaded due to timing of new generics, realization of synergy and client billings expected in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted claims are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion. Gross profit and gross profit margins are expected to improve sequentially as we move through the year. This guidance assumes that diluted shares outstanding will average 833 million for the next 3 quarters and total 750 million shares on a weighted average basis for 2012. This share count will be affected by the amount and timing of legacy Medco options and RSUs exercised. There are approximately 48 million outstanding and we have assumed that about 1/3 of these are exercised over the course of the year. Since we issued shares in the second quarter to complete this transaction, earnings per share for each quarter will not add up to earnings per share for the year. The tax rate assumed in our forecast is 39% for the year. If the share count or tax rate changes from our assumptions, our EPS forecast would most likely change. I would also like to take this opportunity to confirm that our view on synergy and accretion has not changed. We continue to expect the transaction to be slightly accretive in the first full year and moderately accretive once fully integrated. That means we expect to achieve $1 million of synergy in 2014 and that the transaction will be moderately accretive to standalone 2014 earnings per share.
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

After months of rigorous review, the FTC allowed our acquisition of Medco to proceed without any stipulation. This merger represents the next chapter of our mission to lower cost, drive outlays, improve adherence and deliver better health outcomes. Bringing our 2 companies together, provides limitless opportunities to innovate and improve how health care is delivered. Our successful track record of acquisitions is based on a philosophy of taking the best-in-class of both organizations and combining them for the benefit of our clients, patients and stockholders. Building upon a platform of clinical expertise and applying our understanding of behavioral sciences, we have an unprecedented opportunity to improve patient outcomes, drive down the cost prescription medications and eliminate the wasteful spending that burdens the pharmacy benefit. This will help us chart a course for continued growth with the creation of innovative solutions to address our country's most pressing health care challenges.
We are receiving great feedback from clients and prospects. Our breadth of services that span traditional PBM management, specialty management, Medicaid and Medicare is unmatched in the industry and positions us well for client retention and new sales opportunities. Just last month, I met with many of our clients at our annual Outcomes Conference, our first large event as a combined company. Overwhelmingly, our clients are supportive of our merger and share our enthusiasm about the enhanced services they will receive. Our clients also continue to voice strong support for our retail strategy. The conference highlighted our industry-leading Drug Trend Report, which provided cost-cutting edge solutions for most effectively managing a pharmacy benefit. This year, we focused on the $408 billion of waste due to suboptimal pharmacy-related behavior. Non-adherence contributes over $300 billion of this waste. This is enough to cover the cost of health care for nearly 45 million uninsured Americans. Our breakthrough adherence solution, ScreenRx, combines early detection with tailored interventions, improving outcomes and lowering cost. In the wake of our merger with Medco, ScreenRx is a prime example of where Express Scripts is headed, making it easier for patients to make decisions that improve their health and lower the cost of health care. We have an unprecedented opportunity to help make the use of medicine safe and more affordable. This is exactly what employers, health plans, unions and government agencies need now.
At this point, we'd be happy to answer any of your questions."

What are we hired to do at the end of the day? Our job is to take the waste out of this system. As I said in my prepared comments, there is billions and billions of dollars that are being wasted in the health care benefit. To the extent those dollars can be captured, we reduced the cost of health care, we improve health outcomes and therefore, we deliver better product. That is our job. So what are our clients looking for? They're looking to spend money where it matters and not just spend money where it doesn't matter. So again, if a cutting-edge new cancer agent comes to market, very expensive, we put it on the formulary. We have to put it on the formulary. We want to put it on the formulary because it's going to help our patients health outcomes improve. By the same token, those components of the health care system that only drive up cost and don't improve health outcomes, there's no place for that. Companies today are struggling in this economy with the uncertainty of our global economy, other things that are going on throughout our country and the rest of the world. Companies can't afford to spend money on things that don't matter. Pharmacists are a very important element of the health care delivery system. To the extent that they're helping to improve individual's health outcomes by focusing on adherence, the right drug at the right time, with proper directions. That's all very important things and that's what we want to pay for. Merely dispensing the drug itself is not a value-added endeavor. So again, to the extent somebody want to charge more money for that activity, there's no room in the equation for that, quite frankly. Those clients that want it, that want to pay for it, that want to have -- that are willing to pay for that convenience factor, they may want to do it and they may go somewhere else. But, quite frankly, we're very content in doing what our clients are asking us to do, and that is to take out those unnecessary cost out of the equation. And that's our focus. That message is very well-received. We believe we are well positioned, as you see, our script counts grew last year, unlike some people thought they would decline. We're very well positioned. I think at the end of the day, the question is going to be on our ability to continue to innovate and deliver quality products that take out waste. And that's our mission, so we're pretty excited about that, Glen."

So I think what Jeff's saying is right. We certainly had a lot of ramp cost. Medco did note, towards the end of the quarter that the deal was -- when the deal was actually going to close. They had to be prepared to continue to operate and compete on a standalone basis, so there was a lot of cost being incurred on their side, as we also tried to get ready for integration and the combination of the companies.

Remember, when we were -- after we closed the WellPoint transaction, our sales activity wasn't as robust as historical because, again, people are a little less likely to want to look at you when you're in the middle of a transitional issue. Our job is to make sure that they feel comfortable with that and that's what our sales people are engaged to do. But with the SXC-Catalyst merger there's a lot more activity taking place this year on multiple fronts. So it's still early. Remember, keep in mind, we've only been 5 weeks into this transaction. I know there's been a tremendous amount of misinformation given out there, some people seem to think or seem to believe they know more about this business than we do, even though we own it. So there's very few contracts that actually have change of control provisions in them. But we're going through our process and I don't want to get into specific client conversations. We usually aim to keep 95% of our business for good reason. We think we had to continue to grow profit and at times, our model doesn't necessarily always fit with the clients we have. We've never had a 100% share. By definition, we will lose some clients over the course of the year and we'll gain others. And as the year unfolds and we get our arms better around the Medco situation, we'll be able to give much better guidance. We're just very early on into this process. Medco is big. We had our annual Outcomes Conference couple of weeks ago, Medco's is next week so we're headed down for that, and we'll get a better read then. But we feel very good about what we've seen, with been in front of -- I personally have been in front of the many, many of the Medco clients and I think they're excited about what we have to offer."

I think eliminating Walgreens from our network was better received, quite frankly, than we expected and the clients had virtually no disruption. So this is a very big home run for us and I think that opened up the flood gates. And I think what we're seeing is opportunities for employers to form special networks that are centered around their employee bases. So if you've got 5,000 employees, you really need a 60,000 store network and why not take advantage of concentrating all employees into a given set of stores that are large in your area, you can protect it with a wrap, with national network while are traveling. So they can still get it. It is a savings to the member and it's also a saving to the plan sponsor. Keep in mind that we don't -- the plan sponsor is the one that ultimately controls the cost, so we tell them what the cost differentials are and what the options are. And so as we do that, we can then evaluate the differences of cost versus access and then the plan sponsor can decide how much copay differential they want to allow the member to go through the premier stores and with that means for the plan sponsor."

All those addressing all those issues means significant changes to what we do today and how that's going to play out in the future. To the extent that we are nimble, that we are part of the solution, there is tremendous opportunity for us in the future.

It depends on the mix of business and whether or not -- if you've got high utilizers of specialty drug, you're going to have a much different answer than if you've got a young population, if you're a professional firm which turns over young people rather frequently with a high density of young people, that's going to be a different answer. So I think every client is different and so that's why one size doesn't fit all and a PBM has to have the tools to be able to go out evaluate that. I will tell you though, some companies are very agnostic of regarding their offerings and they've got -- we saw clients with two-tier products with almost no differential in price, between the first and second tier, with very open formulary and open access standards. And that's not our sweet spot. And those clients don't really -- we have a hard time providing much of a value to them because we're not taking cost out of the equation. We're not actually improving their health outcomes. Our tools don't work as well there. So it's just depends on the situation. But again, from our perspective, we look at every drug on our formulary. We look at every access point in our network and we look at every dollar we spend. I think any company that's well run looks at every penny it spends and determines whether or not that penny is adding value to it's shareholders. If it is, you spend it. If it isn't, why spend it? There's too many great opportunity to save jobs, to grow companies, to improve margins. You don't spend money for nothing and I think that's the message we have to our clients. Our clients, that resonates with, and it is proving fair dividend for us."

I think it's all about focus, at the end of the day, and we've never lost our focus on our patients and our clients.

On April 2, we completed the acquisition of Medco. In anticipation of closing, we maintained high levels of project spending to free up capacity for integration activities in the year and delayed cost savings opportunities, keeping staffing at higher levels to support integration planning. We also incurred additional expenses during the quarter to ensure a smooth transition for new clients and to accrue management bonuses which were not paid in 2011.
Despite this increased spending, gross profit was up 11%, gross profit margin was 7.1%, up slightly from 7% in the first quarter of 2011, EBITDA was up 7% over last year and EBITDA for adjusted Rx rose to $3.40, up 3%. First quarter earnings per share was $0.73, up 11% from prior year. Cash flow from operations was $530 million for the quarter, a 117% increase from $244 million last year.
Turning to guidance. We expect EPS for the year, excluding transaction, integration and amortization expenses, to be in a range of $3.36 to $3.66, representing growth of 18% over 2011 at the midpoint. Consistent with last year, EPS is more back-end-loaded due to timing of new generics, realization of synergies and client billings expected in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted claims are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion. Gross profit and gross profit margins are expected to improve sequentially as we move through the year. This guidance assumes that diluted shares outstanding will average 833 million for the next 3 quarters and total 750 million shares on a weighted average basis for 2012. This share count will be affected by the amount and timing of legacy Medco options and RSUs exercised. There are approximately 48 million outstanding, and we have assumed that about 1/3 of these are exercised over the course of the year. Since we issued shares in the second quarter to complete this transaction, earnings per share for each quarter will not add up to earnings per share for the year. The tax rate assumed in our forecast is 39% for the year. If the share count or tax rate changes from our assumptions, our EPS forecast would most likely change. I would also like to take this opportunity to confirm that our view on synergy and accretion has not changed. We continue to expect the transaction to be slightly accretive in the first full year and moderately accretive once fully integrated. That means we expect to achieve $1 billion of synergy in 2014 and that the transaction will be moderately accretive to standalone 2014 earnings per share.
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

After months of rigorous review, the FTC allowed our acquisition of Medco to proceed without any stipulation. This merger represents the next chapter of our mission to lower cost, drive outlays, improve adherence and deliver better health outcomes. Bringing our 2 companies together provides limitless opportunities to innovate and improve how health care is delivered. Our successful track record of acquisitions is based on a philosophy of taking the best in class of both organizations and combining them for the benefit of our clients, patients and stockholders. Building upon a platform of clinical expertise and applying our understanding of behavioral sciences, we have an unprecedented opportunity to improve patient outcomes, drive down the cost of prescription medications and eliminate the wasteful spending that burdens the pharmacy benefit. This will help us chart a course for continued growth with the creation of innovative solutions to address our country's most pressing health care challenges.
We are receiving great feedback from clients and prospects. Our breadth of services that span traditional PBM management, specialty management, Medicaid and Medicare is unmatched in the industry and positions us well for client retention and new sales opportunities. Just last month, I met with many of our clients at our annual Outcomes Conference, our first large event as a combined company. Overwhelmingly, our clients are supportive of our merger and share our enthusiasm about the enhanced services they will receive. Our clients also continue to voice strong support for our retail strategy. The conference highlighted our industry-leading Drug Trend Report, which provided cost -- cutting-edge solutions for most effectively managing a pharmacy benefit. This year, we focused on the $408 billion of waste due to suboptimal pharmacy-related behavior. Non-adherence contributes over $300 billion of this waste. This is enough to cover the cost of health care for nearly 45 million uninsured Americans. Our breakthrough adherence solution, ScreenRX, combines early detection with tailored interventions, improving outcomes and lowering cost. In the wake of our merger with Medco, ScreenRX is a prime example of where Express Scripts is headed, making it easier for patients to make decisions that improve their health and lower the cost of health care. We have an unprecedented opportunity to help make the use of medicine safer and more affordable. This is exactly what employers, health plans, unions and government agencies need now.
At this point, we'd be happy to answer any of your questions."

What are we hired to do at the end of the day? Our job is to take the waste out of this system. As I said in my prepared comments, there is billions and billions of dollars that are being wasted in the health care benefit. To the extent those dollars can be captured, we reduce the cost of health care, we improve health outcomes and, therefore, we deliver a better product. That is our job. So what are our clients looking for? They're looking to spend money where it matters and not spend money where it doesn't matter. So again, if a cutting-edge new cancer agent comes to market, very expensive, we put it on the formulary. We have to put it on the formulary. We want to put it on the formulary, because it's going to help our patients health outcomes improve. By the same token, those components of the health care system that only drive up cost and don't improve health outcomes, there's no place for that. Companies today are struggling in this economy.  With the uncertainty of our global economy, other things that are going on throughout our country and the rest of the world, companies can't afford to spend money on things that don't matter. Pharmacists are a very important element of the health care delivery system. To the extent that they're helping to improve individuals' health outcomes by focusing on adherence, the right drug at the right time, with proper direction, that's all very important things, and that's what we want to pay for. Merely dispensing the drug itself is not a value-added endeavor. So again, to the extent somebody want to charge more money for that activity, there's no room in the equation for that, quite frankly. Those clients that want it, that want to pay for it, that want to have -- that are willing to pay for that convenience factor, they may want to do it and they may go somewhere else. But, quite frankly, we're very content in doing what our clients are asking us to do, and that is to take out those unnecessary costs out of the equation. And that's our focus. That message is very well received. We believe we are well positioned, as you see, our script counts grew last year, unlike some people thought they would decline. We're very well positioned. I think at the end of the day, the question is going to be on our ability to continue to innovate and deliver quality products that take out waste. And that's our mission, so we're pretty excited about that, Glen."

I think what you'll see now as we add the 2 companies together, when we come out with Q2 -- obviously, now you're going to see combined Express Scripts/Medco numbers rolled up into Express, so we'll see those numbers come up in Q2, and then you'll see that the numbers start to decline over time as we begin to realize the synergies from this transaction."

And I think one of the qualities of Express Scripts is that we've been able to move quickly and do things efficiently. But there's a lot that's going to take place in '13 and '14 as we prepare for health care reform as the Supreme Court either upholds the current health care law, or even if they keep most of it, maybe the individual mandate, if that gets turned down and the rest of it stays, we're still going to have to be prepared for the exchanges. So I think what Jeff's saying is right. We certainly had a lot of ramp cost. Medco didn't know till towards the end of the quarter that the deal was -- when the deal was actually going to close. They had to be prepared to continue to operate and compete on a standalone basis, so there was a lot of cost being incurred on their side as we also tried to get ready for integration and the combination of the companies. But we still have to spend money in order to make sure that we have the premier offerings in 2014. So that's also included in our guidance, but it's something that we have to be prepared for."

Remember, when we were -- after we closed the WellPoint transaction, our sales activity wasn't as robust as historical, because, again, people are a little less likely to want to look at you when you're in the middle of a transitional issue. Our job is to make sure that they feel comfortable with that, and that's what our sales people are engaged to do. But with the SXC-Catalyst merger, there's a lot more activity taking place this year on multiple fronts. So it's still too early. Remember, keep in mind, we've only been 5 weeks into this transaction. I know there's been a tremendous amount of misinformation given out there.  Some people seem to think or seem to believe they know more about this business than we do, even though we own it. So there's very few contracts that actually have change-of-control provisions in them. But we're going through our process, and I don't want to get into specific client conversations. We usually aim to keep 95% of our business, for good reason. We think we had to continue to grow profits, and at times, our model doesn't necessarily always fit with the clients we have. We've never had a 100% share.  By definition, we will lose some clients over the course of the year, and we'll gain others. And as the year unfolds and we get our arms better around the Medco situation, we'll be able to give much better guidance. We're just very early on into this process. Medco is big. We had our annual Outcomes Conference a couple of weeks ago.  Medco's is next week, so we're headed down for that, and we'll get a better read then. But we feel very good about what we've seen.

I think eliminating Walgreens from our network was better received, quite frankly, than even we expected, and the clients had virtually no disruption. So this was a very big home run for us, and I think that opened up the flood gates. And I think what we're seeing is opportunities for employers to form special networks that are centered around their employee bases. So if you've got 5,000 employees, you really need a 60,000-store network.  And why not take advantage of concentrating all your employees into a given set of stores that are large in your area.  You can protect it with a wrap, with a national network while are traveling, so they can still get it. It is a savings to the member, and it's also a saving to the plan sponsor. Keep in mind that we don't -- the plan sponsor is the one that ultimately controls the cost, so we tell them what the cost differentials are and what the options are. And so as we do that, we can then evaluate the differences of cost versus access, and then the plan sponsor can decide how much copay differential they want to allow the member to go to the premier stores and with that means for the plan sponsor."

Because what that does is it sets a pricing level. And again, when you're paying one person a premium over others, you're, of course, putting price pressure on the entire network. So even if it's a few cents, it all matters. It's all relative to the value you're delivering. And I think that there's -- again, there's a pay-for-performance standard.

Again, because we had limited opportunity to plow through all the things we normally do, that's why we have a wide range. We are hopeful that we can do synergy acquisition faster, and that could drive us to the higher end of the range. But also there's a lot of cost here. We'd also have a lot of Medicare, Medicaid and exchange uncertainties that are facing us, and that's what drives us to the lower end of the range. So we've got a lot of work to do, and I think it's only prudent at this early stage to give a wide range. As we go through the year and we get our network strategy better finalized and understand the different options that we have -- and your point on Medicare is right on. Medicare is a fast-growing area. We are incredibly excited that we brought in Tim Wentworth and Glen Stettin from the Medco team to be part of my senior management team. And Tim heads up all of the account management and sales programs, and he's an ex-Medco guy, so you probably know him. And he's a wonderful addition to our team, and he's very much focused on growing the business on a profitable basis. So he's going to help us rationalize the Medco business with our business and figure out what's in our best interest and our clients' best interest and our patients' best interest. And at the same time, Glen is going to run our product portfolio for us, and so, looking at Medicare and Medicaid, the exchanges and all the options, he's very well equipped. He's a doctor by education, so he's very well equipped to come to the table and help us get the right offering. So we're very excited with where we sit."

I think that eliminates a tremendous amount of cost, it allows us to remain flexible, it gives us a standard offering across all of our books of business, investments that we are fixated and focused on. But there's always surprises when you start peeling those things back, and those are the headwinds. The tailwinds are a pretty powerful. We've got a tremendous synergy opportunity. Jeff talked about the $1 billion, and the timing of that gives us great tailwinds, and we've got a great product offering portfolio.

So I think every client is different, and so that's why one size doesn't fit all, and a PBM has to have the tools to be able to go out and evaluate that. I will tell you, though, some companies are very agnostic of regarding their offerings, and they've got -- we saw clients with two-tier products with almost no differential in price between the first and second tier with very open formularies and open access standards. And that's not our sweet spot. And those clients don't really -- we have a hard time providing much of a value to them, because we're not taking cost out of the equation. We're not actually improving their health outcomes. Our tools don't work as well there. So it's just depends on the situation. But again, from our perspective, we look at every drug on our formulary. We look at every access point in our network.  And we look at every dollar we spend. I think any company that's well run looks at every penny it spends and determines whether or not that penny is adding value to its shareholders. If it is, you spend it. If it isn't, why spend it? There's too many great opportunity to save jobs, to grow companies, to improve margins. You don't spend money for nothing, and I think that's the message we have to our clients.

If you look at a lot of the acquisitions that Medco did over in the past and a lot of their spend, I'm not sure they used the same rigor and discipline that Express Scripts uses in how we set rate of return targets and the thresholds we're looking for. I think it's all about focus at the end of the day, and we've never lost our focus on our patients and our clients.

These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. Company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our recent SEC filing.
For clarity purposes, all numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis.

On April 2, we completed the acquisition of Medco. In anticipation of closing, we maintained high levels of project spending to free up capacity for integration activities in the year and delayed cost savings opportunities, keeping staffing at higher levels to support integration planning. We also incurred additional expenses during the quarter to ensure a smooth transition for new clients and to accrue management bonuses which were not paid in 2011.
Despite this increased spending, gross profit was up 11%, gross profit margin was 7.1%, up slightly from 7% in the first quarter of 2011, EBITDA was up 7% over last year and EBITDA for adjusted Rx rose to $3.40, up 3%. First quarter earnings per share was $0.73, up 11% from prior year. Cash flow from operations was $530 million for the quarter, a 117% increase from $244 million last year.
Turning to guidance. We expect EPS for the year, excluding transaction, integration and amortization expenses, to be in a range of $3.36 to $3.66, representing growth of 18% over 2011 at the midpoint. Consistent with last year, EPS is more back-end-loaded due to timing of new generics, realization of synergies and client billings expected in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted claims are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion. Gross profit and gross profit margins are expected to improve sequentially as we move through the year. This guidance assumes that diluted shares outstanding will average 833 million for the next 3 quarters and total 750 million shares on a weighted average basis for 2012. This share count will be affected by the amount and timing of legacy Medco options and RSUs exercised. There are approximately 48 million outstanding, and we have assumed that about 1/3 of these are exercised over the course of the year. Since we issued shares in the second quarter to complete this transaction, earnings per share for each quarter will not add up to earnings per share for the year. The tax rate assumed in our forecast is 39% for the year. If the share count or tax rate changes from our assumptions, our EPS forecast would most likely change. I would also like to take this opportunity to confirm that our view on synergy and accretion has not changed. We continue to expect the transaction to be slightly accretive in the first full year and moderately accretive once fully integrated. That means we expect to achieve $1 billion of synergy in 2014 and that the transaction will be moderately accretive to standalone 2014 earnings per share.
And with that, I'll turn it over to George."

After months of rigorous review, the FTC allowed our acquisition of Medco to proceed without any stipulation. This merger represents the next chapter of our mission to lower cost, drive outlays, improve adherence and deliver better health outcomes. Bringing our 2 companies together provides limitless opportunities to innovate and improve how health care is delivered. Our successful track record of acquisitions is based on a philosophy of taking the best in class of both organizations and combining them for the benefit of our clients, patients and stockholders. Building upon a platform of clinical expertise and applying our understanding of behavioral sciences, we have an unprecedented opportunity to improve patient outcomes, drive down the cost of prescription medications and eliminate the wasteful spending that burdens the pharmacy benefit. This will help us chart a course for continued growth with the creation of innovative solutions to address our country's most pressing health care challenges.
We are receiving great feedback from clients and prospects. Our breadth of services that span traditional PBM management, specialty management, Medicaid and Medicare is unmatched in the industry and positions us well for client retention and new sales opportunities. Just last month, I met with many of our clients at our annual Outcomes Conference, our first large event as a combined company. Overwhelmingly, our clients are supportive of our merger and share our enthusiasm about the enhanced services they will receive. Our clients also continue to voice strong support for our retail strategy. The conference highlighted our industry-leading Drug Trend Report, which provided cost -- cutting-edge solutions for most effectively managing a pharmacy benefit. This year, we focused on the $408 billion of waste due to suboptimal pharmacy-related behavior. Non-adherence contributes over $300 billion of this waste. This is enough to cover the cost of health care for nearly 45 million uninsured Americans. Our breakthrough adherence solution, ScreenRX, combines early detection with tailored interventions, improving outcomes and lowering cost. In the wake of our merger with Medco, ScreenRX is a prime example of where Express Scripts is headed, making it easier for patients to make decisions that improve their health and lower the cost of health care. We have an unprecedented opportunity to help make the use of medicine safer and more affordable. This is exactly what employers, health plans, unions and government agencies need now.
At this point, we'd be happy to answer any of your questions."

What are we hired to do at the end of the day? Our job is to take the waste out of this system. As I said in my prepared comments, there is billions and billions of dollars that are being wasted in the health care benefit. To the extent those dollars can be captured, we reduce the cost of health care, we improve health outcomes and, therefore, we deliver a better product. That is our job. So what are our clients looking for? They're looking to spend money where it matters and not spend money where it doesn't matter. So again, if a cutting-edge new cancer agent comes to market, very expensive, we put it on the formulary. We have to put it on the formulary. We want to put it on the formulary, because it's going to help our patients health outcomes improve. By the same token, those components of the health care system that only drive up cost and don't improve health outcomes, there's no place for that. Companies today are struggling in this economy.  With the uncertainty of our global economy, other things that are going on throughout our country and the rest of the world, companies can't afford to spend money on things that don't matter. Pharmacists are a very important element of the health care delivery system. To the extent that they're helping to improve individuals' health outcomes by focusing on adherence, the right drug at the right time, with proper direction, that's all very important things, and that's what we want to pay for. Merely dispensing the drug itself is not a value-added endeavor. So again, to the extent somebody want to charge more money for that activity, there's no room in the equation for that, quite frankly. Those clients that want it, that want to pay for it, that want to have -- that are willing to pay for that convenience factor, they may want to do it and they may go somewhere else. But, quite frankly, we're very content in doing what our clients are asking us to do, and that is to take out those unnecessary costs out of the equation. And that's our focus. That message is very well received. We believe we are well positioned, as you see, our script counts grew last year, unlike some people thought they would decline. We're very well positioned. I think at the end of the day, the question is going to be on our ability to continue to innovate and deliver quality products that take out waste. And that's our mission, so we're pretty excited about that, Glen."

And I think one of the qualities of Express Scripts is that we've been able to move quickly and do things efficiently. But there's a lot that's going to take place in '13 and '14 as we prepare for health care reform as the Supreme Court either upholds the current health care law, or even if they keep most of it, maybe the individual mandate, if that gets turned down and the rest of it stays, we're still going to have to be prepared for the exchanges. So I think what Jeff's saying is right. We certainly had a lot of ramp cost. Medco didn't know till towards the end of the quarter that the deal was -- when the deal was actually going to close. They had to be prepared to continue to operate and compete on a standalone basis, so there was a lot of cost being incurred on their side as we also tried to get ready for integration and the combination of the companies. But we still have to spend money in order to make sure that we have the premier offerings in 2014. So that's also included in our guidance, but it's something that we have to be prepared for."

Remember, when we were -- after we closed the WellPoint transaction, our sales activity wasn't as robust as historical, because, again, people are a little less likely to want to look at you when you're in the middle of a transitional issue. Our job is to make sure that they feel comfortable with that, and that's what our sales people are engaged to do. But with the SXC-Catalyst merger, there's a lot more activity taking place this year on multiple fronts. So it's still too early. Remember, keep in mind, we've only been 5 weeks into this transaction. I know there's been a tremendous amount of misinformation given out there.  Some people seem to think or seem to believe they know more about this business than we do, even though we own it. So there's very few contracts that actually have change-of-control provisions in them. But we're going through our process, and I don't want to get into specific client conversations. We usually aim to keep 95% of our business, for good reason. We think we had to continue to grow profits, and at times, our model doesn't necessarily always fit with the clients we have. We've never had a 100% share.  By definition, we will lose some clients over the course of the year, and we'll gain others. And as the year unfolds and we get our arms better around the Medco situation, we'll be able to give much better guidance. We're just very early on into this process. Medco is big. We had our annual Outcomes Conference a couple of weeks ago.  Medco's is next week, so we're headed down for that, and we'll get a better read then. But we feel very good about what we've seen.

I think eliminating Walgreens from our network was better received, quite frankly, than even we expected, and the clients had virtually no disruption. So this was a very big home run for us, and I think that opened up the flood gates. And I think what we're seeing is opportunities for employers to form special networks that are centered around their employee bases. So if you've got 5,000 employees, you really need a 60,000-store network.  And why not take advantage of concentrating all your employees into a given set of stores that are large in your area.  You can protect it with a wrap, with a national network while are traveling, so they can still get it. It is a savings to the member, and it's also a saving to the plan sponsor. Keep in mind that we don't -- the plan sponsor is the one that ultimately controls the cost, so we tell them what the cost differentials are and what the options are. And so as we do that, we can then evaluate the differences of cost versus access, and then the plan sponsor can decide how much copay differential they want to allow the member to go to the premier stores and with that means for the plan sponsor."

So even if it's a few cents, it all matters. It's all relative to the value you're delivering. And I think that there's -- again, there's a pay-for-performance standard. If we can come up with ways to help actually drive down costs, improve adherence, do things that are out of the ordinary course of the book, we're willing to pay for those if our clients are willing to pay for those. But we're not just willing to pay for doing nothing special, for not doing anything different. So when we go out to the Medco clients, the Medco clients themselves as we're going through this process -- and again, we're very early on, here -- several of them have already selectively chosen to drop Walgreens themselves. That'll be occurring here shortly. And that's their decision. When that occurs, there doesn't have to be any notice, they just do it. If we were to decide to drop them, that would require notice, and we have to go through a process. We're still evaluating all that."

Again, because we had limited opportunity to plow through all the things we normally do, that's why we have a wide range. We are hopeful that we can do synergy acquisition faster, and that could drive us to the higher end of the range. But also there's a lot of cost here. We'd also have a lot of Medicare, Medicaid and exchange uncertainties that are facing us, and that's what drives us to the lower end of the range. So we've got a lot of work to do, and I think it's only prudent at this early stage to give a wide range. As we go through the year and we get our network strategy better finalized and understand the different options that we have -- and your point on Medicare is right on. Medicare is a fast-growing area. We are incredibly excited that we brought in Tim Wentworth and Glen Stettin from the Medco team to be part of my senior management team. And Tim heads up all of the account management and sales programs, and he's an ex-Medco guy, so you probably know him. And he's a wonderful addition to our team, and he's very much focused on growing the business on a profitable basis. So he's going to help us rationalize the Medco business with our business and figure out what's in our best interest and our clients' best interest and our patients' best interest. And at the same time, Glen is going to run our product portfolio for us, and so, looking at Medicare and Medicaid, the exchanges and all the options, he's very well equipped.

So I think every client is different, and so that's why one size doesn't fit all, and a PBM has to have the tools to be able to go out and evaluate that. I will tell you, though, some companies are very agnostic of regarding their offerings, and they've got -- we saw clients with two-tier products with almost no differential in price between the first and second tier with very open formularies and open access standards. And that's not our sweet spot. And those clients don't really -- we have a hard time providing much of a value to them, because we're not taking cost out of the equation. We're not actually improving their health outcomes. Our tools don't work as well there. So it's just depends on the situation. But again, from our perspective, we look at every drug on our formulary. We look at every access point in our network.  And we look at every dollar we spend. I think any company that's well run looks at every penny it spends and determines whether or not that penny is adding value to its shareholders. If it is, you spend it. If it isn't, why spend it? There's too many great opportunity to save jobs, to grow companies, to improve margins. You don't spend money for nothing, and I think that's the message we have to our clients.

Otherwise, it's really not in our bailiwick. So that's where we will continue to work."

In additio",495,"Thanks, David. Well, obviously we've had a few busy months here, including closing the Medco acquisition, executing our integration plan, migrating the first year of WAG, focusing on the selling season and signing a new contract with Walgreens. In addition, we are also reporting strong second quarter earnings and increasing guidance for the year. Adjusted claims for the quarter were 404.3 million, up 118% from last year. Our generics fill rate was 77.8%, up from 74% a year ago. In keeping with our model of alignment, as our clinical programs delivered savings to our clients, we also improved our gross profit. SG&A was up $80 million versus Q1 pro forma for the acquisition, as a result of an increase in management incentive compensation to reflect the increase in our expectations for the year and the reclassification of several Medco expenses from cost of goods sold to SG&A to conform with Express Scripts accounting methodology. 
EBITDA for the quarter was $1.5 billion and EBITDA per RX was up 14% versus prior year, again pro forma for the acquisition. Interest expense in the quarter was $169.5 million, as a result of the repayment of $1.5 billion of bonds at an average rate of 5.9% and continued low floating rates. Interest expense for 2012 is expected to be approximately $530 million. This quarter's effective tax rate, excluding nonrecurring items related to purchase accounting, was 42.1%. The higher rate for the quarter was a result of several factors related to the closing of the transaction and a necessary year-to-date true-up. 
We still expect our effective tax rate to be 39%, which means the tax rate for the second half is expected to be approximately 38%. EPS for the second quarter was $0.88, a 24% increase over last year. Cash from operations was $726 million, a 58% increase from last year. Including Medco's first quarter performance, year-to-date cash from operations is approximately $2 billion. 
As a result of strong performance in the first half of the year and the accelerated realization of synergies, we are increasing our guidance range for 2012. We now expect EPS for the year, excluding transaction, integration and amortization expenses, to be in the range of $3.60 to $3.75, representing growth of 24% over 2011 at the midpoint. As we have said before, this range assumes that shares outstanding for the year will be 750 million and the tax rate will be 39%. If the share count or tax rate changes from these assumptions, our EPS forecast could change. 
We are in the process of reviewing the strategic alternatives for several of our adjacent businesses, which are not core to our PBM offering. We do not expect the ultimate disposition of these businesses to have a material impact on our financial results. In summary, integration is proceeding well, and we continue to expect to complete the integration and achieve $1 billion of net synergies in 2014. At this point, I'll turn the call over to George."

As part of our integration, we are combining Medco's clinical approach through its therapeutic research centers and the use of specialized pharmacists with Consumerology, the application of behavioral sciences to health care. By blending the combined clinical skills with the behavioral sciences, we will be able to accelerate clinical offerings from greater efficiencies in the health care system and better protect American families from the rising cost of prescription medications. Our shared vision is to increase therapy adherence where appropriate, lower costs and drive a better health outcome. Our previous acquisitions have succeeded through a disciplined approach to integration, including clinical programs, rationalization of our footprint and system migration. We believe operating under one platform is imperative in offering best-in-class service and meeting the market challenges and opportunities presented by Healthcare Reform, Medicare and Medicaid expansion. 
Just last week, we successfully moved our first-year business to our destination operating platform. Our track record of successful integrations has allowed us to spend much more time this selling season discussing our innovative clinical offerings in cost savings opportunities, including our own network. SO2 general successful selling season. Retention rates for both Express Scripts and Medco's legacy book of business exceed 95%, which is consistent with historical norms. We have won over 125 clients to date, which is consistent with prior years. None of our wins or renewals for the year require specific pharmacies to be included in our retail network. And we have begun a successful selling season in presenting our own networks and offering will continue to gain traction. We recently entered into a multi-year pharmacy network agreement with Walgreens to participate in our broadest retail pharmacy network. We will continue to design benefit programs that meet our clients' needs, including narrow networks, primary management and other clinical tools. 
Our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the year reflects the strength of our value proposition, confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our business, and our unprecedented opportunity to make the use of medicine safer and more affordable, which is exactly what our current sponsors need now.

We have a very broad array of products and solutions for our customers so it really depends on what a customer is looking for and quite frankly, their economic conditions in which they find themselves. To the extent that a client needs significant savings on a relatively quick basis, we have everything from mandatory mail programs, mandatory generics programs, very, very limited networks that compete the pharmacy against each other in order to become the preferred pharmacy and drive down cost for those members, to a very open offering for those clients that are -- that have a different viewpoint with respect to the pharmacy offering, which you should also keep in mind that we had a very successful retention season similar to historical levels. And basically when we went out and had to resign these clients, none of them was offered Walgreens as an alternative, and yet we were still maintaining 95% of our book of business. So when you think about narrow networks, clearly without Walgreens in initially, that was our modus operandi at that point. So I think going forward now, we have the benefit of including them. They are part of our larger network so quite frankly, it's up to a client. If the client wants to see savings beyond, they could choose a more limited network. For those clients that want a broader network, they have that option. It's our job to provide a wide array of products and offerings that meet the clients' needs and that's our focus."

And they're willing to drop rates for that. In other markets where the competition may not be as strong and the client sees that they want that figure pharmacy chain in, it doesn't do a lot of good to exclude them. So I think it's really on a regional by regional basis but keep in mind, some people have talked about maybe going to save $1. Saving $1 per prescription is a tremendous amount of money. We're talking with Express Scripts processing 1.4 billion subscriptions per year, $1 is $1.4 billion. You tell me a company today that's running 1 billion prescriptions through their SG&A line but if they can save $1 billion doing something that doesn't cause a lot of disruption that they wouldn't do it. $0.50 is worth doing. As an x-CFO, when I go through our budgets, and I go through our forecast with my CFO, Jeff, we're confident looking for pennies. You got to start with pennies to get dollars. So everything is important that it really doesn't involve anything that has a material negative effect on your employees. We've been able to prove that limiting networks formularies changing access, putting in clinical programs, all those things can reach tremendous desired results without employee disruption.

From my perspective, net synergy means what we're bringing to you as our shareholders. So there's going to be numbers that we're going to gain and we're going to pass on for our clients and synergy takes a lot of different forms, to the extent that our product people develop new clinical programs that help lower costs and drive down waste, that can be considered a synergy. And we're constantly looking to do that. Obviously, the clients are going to gain the market share, the lion's share of those numbers. Our view today is that our operations people have worked very hard in order to make sure that as we came into this acquisition, we had a good idea where our staffing levels needed to be. As you know, last year, Medco had a bit of a tough year with the Calpers and SAP and some of the other situations and so our first drive was in order to rightsize the ship and get the right level of people to meet the service levels, which our clients need in order to meet their needs and at the same time, make sure that we have the right people in place to drive the company into the future. So that was our focus was because we were given an extended period of time by the government as they reviewed the acquisition, we had more time to plan and get things in place so once we closed the deal, we were able to go in and quickly prudently focus on getting it both rightsized, and we did that. So that accelerated SG&A savings and some DPC savings into the current year through the current quarter, which helped us. There's an awful lot that still needs to be done, whether it's contracting networks, whether it's getting the formularies put together, working with all the pharmaceutical manufacturers, on and on. I mean there's a whole lot of things that need to be done in order to put these 2 companies together, none of which, which is very large, of course is getting the one platforms. We are very proud and feel good about our employees' focus that we are able to get the first tier of our membership moves already to move the next just a couple of weeks, and so well on our path to continue those efforts. The sooner we can get that done, the sooner we can eliminate all the significant costs associated with multiple platforms and development regulatory costs and we're on that path. To revise the number, it gets kind of complicated, Larry just because we are -- we're all on the same business, so we start putting things together. Our people are very focused on continuing to drive value for our clients and the number starts to get a little more blinded together, if you will, so this is synergy versus what's truly just a pure operating gain because our operations people figured out a better way to present our prescriptions through our automated systems. Our systems people have a better methodology for processing claims. As we gain those opportunities on top of the combinations, the blurriness between the synergies gets a little bit confusing, if you will. So our view is, and I think we feel very good about the $1 billion, we'll continue to focus on that, but at the end of the day, the next quarter, 30, 90 days or so from now, we'll be in a position to give guidance into 2013. And that will be our indication that we'll give you some more -- better view on where we think the numbers are coming in."

The historically -- new wins are very important to us but quite frankly, retaining the business and growing what we do and adding value is the most important thing we can do. I think if you just focus purely on sales, especially when you get to a fairly large size because keep in mind, winning new business wit lower margins a lot of start up cost. There's a lot of effort that goes into that. That doesn't mean it's not worthwhile. But clearly, the focus has to be on maintaining what we have been growing and then bringing value to those clients. That's going to be the biggest drivers of value enhancement. And when we look out to the future, I would say we always want to have new wins because new wins that business principles and who we are. But it's also -- you are not really -- as you know, we always walk a very fine line between making sure that the value we add to our customers and the price we're going to deliver so that we can add value to our shareholders has to be balanced.

So we feel good about our selling season, and we feel good where we stand. And obviously this has been an interesting year without Walgreens early part of the year. There really wasn't a big negative really at the end of the day. As I said in the past, in certain areas such as managed care, it's a little bit hard because often, they have a different type of offering that they're selling our services out to the public. So that's a little tougher, which clearly on the commercial side, the commercial clients are really looking for savings and what's good for their membership.

So you really have to parse apart what's driving it.

More times than not, the company that's -- the buying company they had chosen who they wanted to work with, and so the survivors choose the winner. And that typically is what happens here. Now as you gain a whole bunch of scripts through that method, it's not net new business. This is a lot of people would count it that way.

I assume as the economy we've based it now for 3 years, kind of clutters a bit by surprise last year. We thought we saw in early in the year that trends were starting to warm up and things are starting to take off a little bit and then they fell back flat again. We're seeing it again this year. Trends, utilization trends are remaining relatively flat. At the same time, the manufacturers because they're not getting the pullthrough with all of the utilization historically we've seen have been raising prices on an unprecedented basis. And so both on solids and specialty products, we're seeing inflation rates that are quite large. And so we're doing everything we can to work with our clients to give them alternatives through clinical programs, therapies, primary management and other programs to try to help them combat the ever increasing cost of those drug therapies.

So something we're very focused on. As far as Walgreens is concerned, again this is like anything else, whether it's formulary or whatever. It's really a client-by-client decision. Our job is to go and suggest or force clients to choose mail, to choose formularies to do anything. Our job is to lay out choices. Our job is to just come in and lay down, say what is the need of the client? There are some companies the professional services business and you are highly contesting for employment, chances are you're going to have a pretty open of plan design.

And that's why it starts getting clouded when we look out into the next year because again, clients are going to -- a lot of it is going to depend on where the economy is as well. If the economy doesn't improve, things remain relatively tough, more and more clients are going to be looking at more and more options to drive out cost. As those realizations or those things, events become real, then they're going to be coming out to look for those opportunities and clearly narrower networks are going to be an option. So the question is it's very important for us to go in for the best pricing between the 2 different each of the contract with retail pharmacy A, we'd look at who's got the best deal and try to get all the business into the better deals. We're going to do that over time. In addition, that is also the new products that Glenn and his team are going to be rolling out and that we're going to be offering to our clients.

Well, thank you, everyone for joining us on today's second quarter earnings call. We're really excited about where we sit. We believe that as pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to raise prices, as clients continue to look for opportunities, what's really been fun I think over the last 14, 15 years that I've been here is to watch the clients as they've grown, and they've had a better understanding of value that comes through the PBM. And our tools have only gotten sharper and better and the clients have become more receptive years ago trying to roll out, go from 2-tier formularies to 3-tier formularies was a huge undertaking. Now, most plans have them. And when you look at narrower networks, or you look at mail programs or you look at other savings opportunities, the receptivity of our teams to roll out new and exciting engaging programs that help take down costs, while improving health outcomes, is growing with momentum, and we're excited about the position we sit in. We're excited about our future. We look forward to keeping continually updating you on our synergy quest, as well as our integration progress. So until next quarter, we'll talk again soon. Take care.

In additi",494,"Thanks, David. Well, obviously, we've had a few busy months here, including closing the Medco acquisition, executing our integration plan, migrating the first year of WAG, focusing on the selling season and signing a new contract with Walgreens. In addition, we're also reporting strong second quarter earnings and increasing guidance for the year. Adjusted claims for the quarter were 404.3 million, up 118% from last year. Our generic fill rate was 77.8%, up from 74% a year ago. In keeping with our model of alignment, as our clinical programs delivered savings to our clients, we also improved our gross profit. SG&A was up $80 million versus Q1 pro forma for the acquisition, as a result of an increase in management incentive compensation to reflect the increase in our expectations for the year and the reclassification of several Medco expenses from cost of goods sold to SG&A to conform with Express Scripts accounting methodology. 
EBITDA for the quarter was $1.5 billion, and EBITDA per RX was up 14% versus prior year, again pro forma for the acquisition. Interest expense in the quarter was $169.5 million, as a result of the repayment of $1.5 billion of bonds at an average rate of 5.9% and continued low floating rates. Interest expense for 2012 is expected to be approximately $530 million. This quarter's effective tax rate, excluding non-recurring items related to purchase accounting, was 42.1%. The higher rate for the quarter was the result of several factors related to the closing of the transaction and a necessary year-to-date true-up. 
We still expect our effective tax rate to be 39%, which means the tax rate for the second half is expected to be approximately 38%. EPS for the second quarter was $0.88, a 24% increase over last year. Cash from operations was $726 million, a 58% increase from last year. Including Medco's first quarter performance, year-to-date cash from operations is approximately $2 billion. 
As a result of strong performance in the first half of the year and the accelerated realization of synergies, we are increasing our guidance range for 2012. We now expect EPS for the year, excluding transaction, integration and amortization expenses, to be in the range of $3.60 to $3.75, representing growth of 24% over 2011 at the midpoint. As we have said before, this range assumes that shares outstanding for the year will be 750 million and the tax rate will be 39%. If the share count or tax rate changes from these assumptions, our EPS forecast could change. 
We are in the process of reviewing the strategic alternatives for several of our adjacent businesses, which are not core to our PBM offering. We do not expect the ultimate disposition of these businesses to have a material impact on our financial results. In summary, integration is proceeding well, and we continue to expect to complete the integration and achieve $1 billion of net synergies in 2014. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to George."

Four months post closing, we are more confident that the combination with Medco provides significant opportunities to innovate, drive out waste and improve how health care is delivered. As part of our integration, we are combining Medco's clinical approach through its therapeutic research centers and the use of specialized pharmacists with Consumerology, the application of behavioral sciences to health care. By blending the combined clinical skills with the behavioral sciences, we will be able to accelerate clinical offerings from our greater efficiencies in the health care system and better protect American families from the rising cost of prescription medications. Our shared vision is to increase therapy adherence where appropriate, lower costs and drive a better health outcome. Our previous acquisitions have succeeded through a disciplined approach to integration, including clinical programs, rationalization of our footprint and system migration. We believe operating on one platform is imperative in offering best-in-class service and meeting the market challenges and opportunities presented by Health Care Reform, Medicare and Medicaid expansion. 
Just last week, we successfully moved our first-year business to our destination operating platform. Our track record of successful integrations has allowed us to spend much more time this selling season discussing our innovative clinical offerings and cost-savings opportunities, including our own network. As such, we are enjoying a successful selling season. Retention rates for both Express Scripts and Medco's legacy book of business exceed 95%, which is consistent with historical norms. We have won over 125 clients to date, which is consistent with prior years. None of our wins or renewals for the year require specific pharmacies to be included in our retail network. And we have begun a successful selling season in presenting our own networks and believe this offering will continue to gain traction. We recently entered into a multi-year pharmacy network agreement with Walgreens to participate in our broadest retail pharmacy network. We will continue to design benefit programs that meet our clients' needs, including narrow networks, primary management and other clinical tools. 
Our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for the year reflects the strength of our value proposition, confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our business and our unprecedented opportunity to make the use of medicine safer and more affordable, which is exactly what our plan sponsors need now. 
At this point, I'd be happy to answer any questions."

We have a very broad array of products and solutions for our customers, so it really depends on what a customer is looking for in their, quite frankly, their economic conditions in which they find themselves. To the extent that a client needs significant savings on a relatively quick basis, we have everything from mandatory mail programs, mandatory generic programs, very, very limited networks that compete the pharmacy against each other in order to become the preferred pharmacy and drive down cost for those members, to a very open offering for those clients that are -- that have a different viewpoint with respect to the pharmacy offering, which you should also keep in mind that we had a very successful retention season similar to historical levels. And basically, when we went out and had to resign these clients, none of them was offered Walgreens as an alternative, and yet we were still maintaining 95% of our book of business. So when you think about narrow networks, clearly without Walgreens in initially, that was our modus operandi at that point. So I think going forward, now we have the benefit of including them. They are part of our larger network. So quite frankly, it's up to a client. If the client wants to see savings beyond, they could choose a more limited network. For those clients that want a broader network, they have that option. It's our job to provide a wide array of products and offerings that meet those clients' needs and that's our focus."

There's -- again, these aren't just simple answer. In the market, where you have very high competition between the retail pharmacies, excluding one, means that all those numbers can be now diverted to the other pharmacy. And they're willing to drop rates for that. In other markets, where the competition may not be as strong and the client sees that they want that bigger pharmacy chain in, that it doesn't realize that they'll exclude them. So I think it's really on a regional-by-regional basis. But keep in mind, some people have talked about maybe you can only save $1. Saving $1 per prescription is a tremendous amount of money. We're talking with Express Scripts processing 1.4 billion subscriptions per year. $1 is $1.4 billion. You tell me a company today that's running 1 million prescriptions through their SG&A line, that if they can save $1 billion doing something that doesn't cause a lot of disruption that they wouldn't do it, $0.50 is worth doing. As an ex-CFO, when I go through our budgets and I go through our forecast with my CFO, Jeff, we're confident looking for pennies. You got to start with pennies to get dollars. And so everything is important that really doesn't involve anything that has some material negative effect on your employees. We've been able to prove that, that limiting networks, limiting formularies, changing access, putting in clinical programs, all those things can reach tremendous desired results without employee disruption.

From my perspective of net synergy means what we're bringing to you as our shareholders. So there's going to be numbers that we're going to gain and that we're going to pass on for our clients. And synergy takes a lot of different forms, to the extent that our product people develop new clinical programs that help lower costs and drive down waste, that can be considered a synergy. And we're constantly looking to do that. Obviously, the clients are going to gain the market share -- the lion's share of those numbers. Our view today is that our operations people have worked very hard in order to make sure that as we came into this acquisition, we had a good idea where our staffing levels needed to be. As you know, last year, Medco had a bit of a tough year with the CalPERS and the FEP and some of the other situations. And so our first drive was in order to rightsize the ship and get the right level of people to meet the service levels, which our clients need in order to meet their needs and at the same time, make sure that we have the right people in place to drive the company into the future. So that was our -- that was where our focus was. Because we were given an extended period of time by the government as they reviewed the acquisition, we had more time to plan and get things in place. So once we closed the deal, we were able to go in and quickly prudently focus on getting it both rightsized, and we did that. So that accelerated the SG&A savings and some DPC savings into the current year -- into the current quarter, which helped us. There's an awful lot that still needs to be done, whether it's contracting networks, whether it's getting the formularies put together, working with all the pharmaceutical manufacturers, on and on. I mean there's a whole lot of things that need to be done in order to put these 2 companies together, none of which, which is very large, of course, is getting into one platform. We are very proud and feel great about our employees' focus that we're able to get the first tier of our membership move. We're ready to move the next tier in just a couple of weeks. And so we're well on our path continuing those efforts. The sooner we can get that done, the sooner we can eliminate all the significant costs associated with multiple platforms and development regulatory costs, and we're on that path. Now to revise the number, it gets kind of complicated, Larry, just because we are a -- we're all on the same business, so we start putting things together. Our people are very focused on continuing to drive value for our clients, and the number starts to get a little more blended together, if you will. So what the synergy versus what's truly just a pure operating gain because our operations people figured out a better way to present our prescriptions through our automated systems. Our systems people have a better methodology for processing claims. As we gain those opportunities on top of the combinations, the blurriness between the synergies gets a little bit confusing, if you will. So our view is, and I think we feel very good about the $1 billion, we'll continue to focus on that. But at the end of the day, the next quarter, 30, 90 days or so from now, we'll be in a position to give guidance into 2013. And that will be our indication, and we'll give you some more -- better view on where we think numbers are coming in."

The other thing we shouldn't lose sight of is joining me on my senior staff as part of the acquisition was 2 very, very sharp individuals from Medco, who grew up in a business that was very, very good at driving mail. And so both Glen and Tim have that focus. They know the value. They bring out fresh new look into how we can promote mail in front of our clients.

But quite frankly, retaining the business and growing what we do and adding value is the most important thing we can do.

As you know, we thought we saw in early in the year that trends were starting to warm up and things were starting to take off a little bit and then they fell back flat again. We're seeing it again this year. Trends are -- utilization trends are remaining relatively flat. At the same time, the manufacturers, because they're not getting the pull-through with all of the utilization we've historically seen, have been raising prices on an unprecedented basis. And so both in oral solids and in specialty products, we're seeing inflation rates that are quite large. And so we're doing everything we can to work with our clients to give them alternatives through clinical programs, prior authorizations, step therapies, primary management and other programs to try to help them combat the ever-increasing cost of those drug therapies.

And that as a result, the second quarter had some year-to-date catch-up, some other purchase accounting related items in it, which forced the rate up, which means to get 39% for the year, we end up with kind of 37.5% to 38% in the back half.

And that's why it starts getting clouded when we look out into the next year because again, clients are going to -- a lot of it is going to depend on where the economy is as well. If the economy doesn't improve, things remain relatively tough. More and more clients are going to be looking at more and more options to drive out cost. As those realizations or those things -- events become real, then they're going to be coming out to look for those opportunities. And clearly, narrower networks are going to be an option. So the question is it's very important for us to go and look for the best pricing between the 2 different [indiscernible] type of contract with retail pharmacy, a, we look at who's got the best deal and try to get all the business into the better deals. We're going to do that over time. In addition to that is also the new products that Glenn and his team are going to be rolling out and that we're going to be offering to our clients.

All right. Well, thank you, all -- everyone for joining us on today's second quarter earnings call. We're really excited about where we sit. We believe that as pharmaceutical manufacturers have continued to raise prices, as clients continue to look for opportunities, what's really been fun, I think, over the last 14, 15 years that I've been here is to watch the clients as they've grown, and they've had a better understanding of value that comes through the PBM. And our tools have only gotten sharper and better, and the clients have become more receptive. Years ago, trying to roll out, go from 2-tier formularies to 3-tier formularies, was a huge undertaking. Now most plans have them. And when you look at narrower networks or you look at mail programs or you look at other savings opportunities, the receptivity of our teams to roll out new and exciting engaging programs that help take down costs, while improving health outcome, is growing with momentum. And we're excited about the position we sit in. We're excited about our future. We look forward to keeping -- continually updating you on our synergy quest, as well as our integration progress.

In additi",494,"Thanks, David. Well, obviously, we've had a few busy months here, including closing the Medco acquisition, executing our integration plan, migrating the first year of WAG, focusing on the selling season and signing a new contract with Walgreens. In addition, we're also reporting strong second quarter earnings and increasing guidance for the year. Adjusted claims for the quarter were 404.3 million, up 118% from last year. Our generic fill rate was 77.8%, up from 74% a year ago. In keeping with our model of alignment, as our clinical programs delivered savings to our clients, we also improved our gross profit. SG&A was up $80 million versus Q1 pro forma for the acquisition, as a result of an increase in management incentive compensation to reflect the increase in our expectations for the year and the reclassification of several Medco expenses from cost of goods sold to SG&A to conform with Express Scripts accounting methodology. 
EBITDA for the quarter was $1.5 billion, and EBITDA per RX was up 14% versus prior year, again pro forma for the acquisition. Interest expense in the quarter was $169.5 million, as a result of the repayment of $1.5 billion of bonds at an average rate of 5.9% and continued low floating rates. Interest expense for 2012 is expected to be approximately $530 million. This quarter's effective tax rate, excluding non-recurring items related to purchase accounting, was 42.1%. The higher rate for the quarter was the result of several factors related to the closing of the transaction and a necessary year-to-date true-up. 
We still expect our effective tax rate to be 39%, which means the tax rate for the second half is expected to be approximately 38%. EPS for the second quarter was $0.88, a 24% increase over last year. Cash from operations was $726 million, a 58% increase from last year. Including Medco's first quarter performance, year-to-date cash from operations is approximately $2 billion. 
As a result of strong performance in the first half of the year and the accelerated realization of synergies, we are increasing our guidance range for 2012. We now expect EPS for the year, excluding transaction, integration and amortization expenses, to be in a range of $3.60 to $3.75, representing growth of 24% over 2011 at the midpoint. As we have said before, this range assumes that shares outstanding for the year will be 750 million and the tax rate will be 39%. If the share count or tax rate changes from these assumptions, our EPS forecast could change. 
We are in the process of reviewing the strategic alternatives for several of our adjacent businesses, which are not core to our PBM offering. We do not expect the ultimate disposition of these businesses to have a material impact on our financial results. In summary, integration is proceeding well, and we continue to expect to complete the integration and achieve $1 billion of net synergies in 2014. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to George."

Four months post closing, we are more confident that the combination with Medco provides significant opportunities to innovate, drive out waste and improve how health care is delivered. As part of our integration, we are combining Medco's clinical approach through its therapeutic resource centers and the use of specialized pharmacists with Consumerology, the application of behavioral sciences to health care. By blending the combined clinical skills with the behavioral sciences, we will be able to accelerate clinical offerings from our greater efficiencies in the health care system and better protect American families from the rising cost of prescription medications. Our shared vision is to increase therapy adherence where appropriate, lower costs and drive a better health outcome. Our previous acquisitions have succeeded through a disciplined approach to integration, including clinical programs, rationalization of our footprint and system migration. We believe operating on one platform is imperative in offering best-in-class service and meeting the market challenges and opportunities presented by Health Care Reform, Medicare and Medicaid expansion. 
Just last week, we successfully moved our first-tier business to our destination operating platform. Our track record of successful integrations has allowed us to spend much more time this selling season discussing our innovative clinical offerings and cost-savings opportunities, including narrow network. As such, we are enjoying a successful selling season. Retention rates for both Express Scripts and Medco's legacy book of business exceed 95%, which is consistent with historical norms. We have won over 125 clients to date, which is consistent with prior years. None of our wins or renewals for the year require specific pharmacies to be included in our retail network. And we have begun a successful selling season in presenting narrow networks and believe this offering will continue to gain traction. We recently entered into a multi-year pharmacy network agreement with Walgreens to participate in our broadest retail pharmacy network. We will continue to design benefit programs that meet our clients' needs, including narrow networks, primary management and other clinical tools. 
Our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for the year reflects the strength of our value proposition, confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our business and our unprecedented opportunity to make the use of medicine safer and more affordable, which is exactly what our plan sponsors need now.

We have a very broad array of products and solutions for our customers, so it really depends on what a customer is looking for in their, quite frankly, their economic conditions in which they find themselves. To the extent that a client needs significant savings on a relatively quick basis, we have everything from mandatory mail programs, mandatory generic programs, very, very limited networks that compete the pharmacy against each other in order to become the preferred pharmacy and drive down cost for those members, to a very open offering for those clients that are -- that have a different viewpoint with respect to the pharmacy offering, which you should also keep in mind that we had a very successful retention season similar to historical levels. And basically, when we went out and had to resign these clients, none of them was offered Walgreens as an alternative, and yet we were still maintaining 95% of our book of business. So when you think about narrow networks, clearly without Walgreens in initially, that was our modus operandi at that point. So I think going forward, now we have the benefit of including them. They are part of our larger network. So quite frankly, it's up to a client. If the client wants to see savings beyond, they could choose a more limited network. For those clients that want the broader networks, they have that option. It's our job to provide a wide array of products and offerings that meet those clients' needs and that's our focus."

If there's -- again, these aren't just simple answer. In the market, where you have very high competition between the retail pharmacies, excluding one, means that all those numbers can be now diverted to the other pharmacy. And they're willing to drop rates for that. In other markets, where the competition may not be as strong and the client sees that they want that bigger pharmacy chain in, then it doesn't do you a lot of good to exclude them. So I think it's really on a regional-by-regional basis. But keep in mind, some people have talked about maybe you can only save $1. Saving $1 per prescription is a tremendous amount of money. We're talking with Express Scripts processing 1.4 billion prescriptions per year. $1 is $1.4 billion. You tell me a company today that's running 1 million prescriptions through their SG&A line, that if they can save $1 billion doing something that doesn't cause a lot of disruption that they wouldn't do it, $0.50 is worth doing. As an ex-CFO, when I go through our budgets and I go through our forecast with my CFO, Jeff, we're constantly looking for pennies. You got to start with pennies to get dollars. And so everything is important that really doesn't involve anything that has some material negative effect on your employees.

From my perspective of net synergy means what we're bringing to you as our shareholders. So there's going to be numbers that we're going to gain and that we're going to pass on for our clients. And synergy takes a lot of different forms, to the extent that our product people develop new clinical programs that help lower costs and drive down waste, that can be considered a synergy. And we're constantly looking to do that. Obviously, the clients are going to gain the market share -- the lion's share of those numbers. Our view today is that our operations people have worked very hard in order to make sure that as we came into this acquisition, we had a good idea where our staffing levels needed to be. As you know, last year, Medco had a bit of a tough year with the CalPERS and the FEP and some of the other situations. And so our first drive was in order to rightsize the ship and get the right level of people to meet the service levels, which our clients need in order to meet their needs and at the same time, make sure that we have the right people in place to drive the company into the future. So that was our -- that was where our focus was. Because we were given an extended period of time by the government as they reviewed the acquisition, we had more time to plan and get things in place. So once we closed the deal, we were able to go in and quickly prudently focus on getting it both rightsized, and we did that. So that accelerated the SG&A savings and some DPC savings into the current year -- into the current quarter, which helped us. There's an awful lot that still needs to be done, whether it's contracting networks, whether it's getting the formularies put together, working with all the pharmaceutical manufacturers, on and on. I mean there's a whole lot of things that need to be done in order to put these 2 companies together, one of which, which is very large, of course, is getting to one platform. We are very proud and feel great about our employees' focus that we're able to get the first tier of our membership move. We're ready to move the next tier in just a couple of weeks. And so we're well on our path continuing those efforts. The sooner we can get that done, the sooner we can eliminate all the significant costs associated with multiple platforms and development regulatory costs, and we're on that path. Now to revise the number, it gets kind of complicated, Larry, just because we are a -- we're all in the same business, so we start putting things together. Our people are very focused on continuing to drive value for our clients, and the number starts to get a little more blended together, if you will. So what the synergy versus what's truly just a pure operating gain because our operations people figured out a better way to present our prescriptions through our automated systems. Our systems people have a better methodology for processing claims. As we gain those opportunities on top of the combinations, the blurriness between the synergies gets a little bit confusing, if you will. So our view is, and I think we feel very good about the $1 billion, we'll continue to focus on that. But at the end of the day, the next quarter, 30, 90 days or so from now, we'll be in a position to give guidance into 2013. And that will be our indication, and we'll give you some more -- a better view on where we think numbers are coming in."

So those are all very positive things. The other thing, which we already talked about, was our operations people are very diligent. Pat McNamee brought his team together and made sure that we were focused on day 1 of getting this -- the right people and the right job and the right headcount, and we've been working very diligently at that. So as we bring out -- as we rightsize the boat again, it took a lot of cost out of the equation and allowed us to bring down our TPC cost, again, which I guess, clearly, is synergistic. But it's also things we do constantly to make sure that we're on the right track here. So that's going to continue to be our focus, as we continue to look forward and drive numbers.

There's no question our services, undeniably the best in the industry, and as we lever that to provide the value back to the membership, they've taken advantage of that, and that's driven mail. The other thing we shouldn't lose sight of is joining me on my senior staff as part of the acquisition was 2 very, very sharp individuals from Medco, who grew up in a business that was very, very good at driving mail. And so both Glen and Tim have that focus. They know the value. They bring a fresh new look into how we can promote mail in front of our clients. And so it fell through the account management and sales side, as well as the product development side.

But quite frankly, retaining the business and growing what we do and adding value is the most important thing we can do. I think it's always a little dangerous if you just focus purely on sales, especially when you get to a fairly large size. Because keep in mind, winning new business, there's lower margin.

That really wasn't a big negative, though, at the end of the day. For -- as I said in the past, in certain areas such as managed care, it's a little bit harder because often, they have a different type of offering that they're reselling our services out to the public. So that's a little tougher, which clearly on the commercial side, the commercial clients are really looking for savings and what's good for their membership.

We're seeing it again this year. Trends are -- utilization trends are remaining relatively flat. At the same time, the manufacturers, because they're not getting the pull-through with all of the utilization we've historically seen, have been raising prices on an unprecedented basis. And so both in oral solids and in specialty products, we're seeing inflation rates that are quite large. And so we're doing everything we can to work with our clients to give them alternatives through clinical programs, prior authorizations, step therapies, primary management and other programs to try to help them combat the ever-increasing cost of those drug therapies. So it's a good and it's bad. Obviously, our tools are needed more than ever to help clients to control their costs.

So it's something we're very focused on. As far as Walgreens is concerned, again, this is like anything else, whether it's formulary or whatever. It's really a client-by-client decision. Our job isn't to go to in and suggest or force clients to choose mail, to choose formularies, to do anything. Our job is to lay out choices. Our job is to just come in and lay down -- here's, okay, what is the need of the client? There are some companies that are in the professional services business and you are highly contesting for employment. Chances are you're going to have a pretty open flexible plan design. If you're in a very difficult business facing tremendous competition and your margins are declining, then you're going to be much more focused on cost. So our job is to roll out and give clients the option to make the decisions they need to meet their cost objectives. So again, the answer is different for every client.

If the economy doesn't improve, things remain relatively tough. More and more clients are going to be looking at more and more options to drive out cost. As those realizations or those things -- events become real, then they're going to be coming out to look for those opportunities. And clearly, narrower networks are going to be an option. So the question is it's very important for us to go and look for the best pricing between the 2 different, so if we each have a contract with retail pharmacy, a, we look at who's got the best deal and try to get all the business into the better deals.

All right. Well, thank you, all -- everyone for joining us on today's second quarter earnings call. We're really excited about where we sit.

And our tools have only gotten sharper and better, and the clients have become more receptive. Years ago, trying to roll out, go from 2-tier formularies to 3-tier formularies, was a huge undertaking. Now most plans have them. And when you look at narrower networks or you look at mail programs or you look at other savings opportunities, the receptivity of our teams to roll out new and exciting engaging programs that help take down costs, while improving health outcome, is growing with momentum.

Our third quarter results continued the trend of strong operating financial performance. In keeping with our model of alignment, the increase in generic fill rate resulted in significant savings to our clients and our gross profit margin was up 30 basis points sequentially. Integration, including the migration of lives to our Destination platform, continues successfully. Synergies continue to be accelerated into 2012, which contributed to strong earnings for the quarter and the increase in our guidance range. Cash flows were strong, and we made good progress towards realizing our cash flow synergy and delevering our balance sheet. 
We reported third quarter earnings per share of $1.02, up 29% from the same quarter last year. Home delivery and specialty claims were $39.8 million, up 199% from the same quarter last year. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition, organic or same-store equivalent home delivery claims would have grown approximately 3% over last year. 
SG&A expenses declined $94 million sequentially from the second quarter as results of the accelerated realization on synergy. We expect SG&A to increase in the fourth quarter, reflecting normal seasonal expenses and preparation for implementation. EBITDA was $1.6 billion, up 136% from last year, while EBITDA per adjusted script was up 9%. 
During the quarter, we repaid $1.1 billion of debt, which included Medco's $600 million accounts receivable financing facility which we have terminated, continuing our plan to quickly delever. We now expect EPS for the year, including deal-related cost and amortization and other nonrecurring items, to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75, representing growth of 25% over 2011 at the midpoint, an increase of $0.19 from our original midpoint as the result of the acceleration on synergy. This range now assumes a 39% tax rate, which is an increase from our previous guidance, which assumed a 39% rate. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be 39%.

We remain confident that we are well-positioned for growth and remain bullish on the PBM business. Although we are not prepared to provide 2013 guidance this morning, I will provide more clarity into our future outlook. There are a number of positives that will provide tailwinds for our business. The integration of Medco remains on track, and we are meeting or exceeding our key targets. 
Last week we successfully migrated our fourth tier of clients to our destination platform and have made considerable progress in rationalizing our operational footprint. As a result, certain synergies originally expected in 2013 were realized in 2012. This is contributing to a strong 2012 results. This acceleration of synergies reduces the incremental synergies in 2013. 
Our pipeline of products is resonating in the marketplace. Clients have a thirst to better manage cost and they appreciate the science behind our evidence-based approach to managing the pharmacy benefit. We will help clients and members navigate the complexity of Healthcare Reform and we will enhance our leading position in management of the cost and quality of care for specialty medication. 
Our cash flows remained strong and our timing for expected realization of cash flow synergies is accelerating. Now that we're seeing these recent successes, the economic environment outlook is presenting some near-term challenges. Over the last few weeks as part of our forecasting process, we spoke to many of our health employee clients and large employer clients. What we learned is that our clients have unprecedented concerns about our country's economic outlook. This lackluster economy is taking its toll in several areas. In aggregate, our health point clients are expecting membership production in 2013. Large employers have pulled back on hiring plans using contractors and part time employees where necessary. Small employers are cutting back or postponing health care coverage decisions while waiting for more clarity on Healthcare Reform. And we continue to see low rates of drug utilization as individuals deal with uncertainty at the household level. 
As a result, the current weak business climate and the unemployment outlook will likely result in a significant in-group member attrition in 2013, continuing low utilization rates and increased client demands and expectations. We had a successful sales season, adding approximately 215 new accounts, which exceeded our sales targets. We operate in a very competitive environment, but we remain disciplined in our approach to pricing and profitability. We project that our retention rate will be approximately 94%. In addition, the transitioning book of business to OptimRx throughout 2013 will reduce plan comparisons in 2013 versus 2012 and 2014 versus 2013. The adjusted Rx reduction will result in economies of scale until the book is fully transitioned. 
In spite of these near-term headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment, we expect to grow earnings per share and EBITDA in 2013. In fact, we expect to grow gross profit per adjusted Rx in the high single digit range and EBITDA per adjusted Rx in the mid-teens next year. However, with the acceleration of synergies in '12, which translates in the lower incremental synergies in '13, along with lower volume expectations, we view current consensus estimates for '13 as overly aggressive. 
In early January we'll receive actual enrollment data from all of our clients and see initial Rx volume. This will provide more clarity to our expected financial performance. Therefore, on a go-forward basis we will provide annual guidance when we release our year end financial results. As such, we will give our 2013 guidance in February. Express Scripts will continue to develop and offer innovative solutions that will protect American families from our rising cost of health care. We have an unprecedented opportunity to help make the use of prescription drugs safer and more affordable for tens of millions Americans that will translate into strong value for our clients and patients and continue to grow for our stockholders. 
At this point, operator, we'll be happy to answer any questions."

Th",459,"So, no one size fits all, of course. And what we're seeing is, and you see it everyday in the Wall Street Journal, yesterday there was a headline article about how employers are looking at the impact of Healthcare Reform and what actions they may take. There's articles in today's papers, there was -- this is a constant theme. And I believe employers are concerned about the economic outlook. And it's tough going through 9 and 10. Employers had to make very difficult decisions about workforce levels. And nobody enjoys doing layoffs. It's something that has to be done to protect the shareholder base and something to be done to protect the rest of the employees and to stay profitable. But having gone through that, people don't like -- CEOs don't really like doing that. And so companies have been very slow to bring back employment. We saw that throughout last year's numbers as well. The difference is we had significant Medco synergies that accelerated in the years that helped offset a lot of the attrition that we saw throughout the course of the year. Employers when you see the unemployment numbers that are coming out of the federal numbers when they're released, people are hiring. But that doesn't mean they're hiring people and giving them benefit coverage. A lot of employers are hiring part-time workers, people that keeps hours to below 30%. Other employers are hiring contractors and using contractors to do the work. Some of the jobs unfortunately are going offshore. And so we're seeing those trends existing in our marketplace. I would tell you it's worse today. At least the outlook is. The reason we're not going to give you a hard number is nobody really knows, right? There's still a month to go and 2 months to go before the end of the year. We don't know exactly what's going to happen. I don't want to throw a number out there based on some numbers that are coming into us and not be accurate when in 2 short months, we're going to have a very strong number. On January 1, actually it's before then, we will get the enrollment files from our clients. Every one of them sends a new enrollment file.

I'll do my best here, again, I'm not providing earnings guidance. So I just want to make sure we're clear on that. But from a overall perspective, addressing the second half first, yes, we're continuing to pull in our synergies, and we are still working with our clients in order to promote mail as Jeff said in his prepared comments that mail year-over-year is up 3% on an equivalent basis. And we're continuing to sell our clinical programs. These things are all driving down the cost of health care for our plans and our members and increasing profitability for us. Those trends will continue into next year. And our belief is that we will grow gross margin and EBITDA per script. Obviously, gross margin grows because of getting more pull through in our client base, better pull through in our client base of our programs and generics and mail and all those type of things. And on the other side of the coin, EBITDA per script will continue to grow because of reductions in our cost structures. And that's including some of these economies of scale that are occurring with respect to UnitedHealth this is going on. So even with those economies, we believe we can grow EBITDA per script in the mid-teens. As far as what was the first part of your question again."

The tax rate's gone up, and we're still exceeding our numbers. So that takes additional synergies to make that happen as well. So the synergy pull through has been good. And get stuff on I think Jeff made this point after we closed the NextRx acquisition. As you know, there's an Express Scripts run rate number, there's a Medco wrote run rate number and then we believe we can take each of those and get a synergy out of it. But when you actually start putting the books together, last week on November 1, we moved our largest tier ever of clients, thousands and thousands of daily prescriptions were moved into the new platform. Then when we do that, we come up with the best rebate programs, the best network opportunities, and we start the pull through. We at the same time, our supply chain people are out trying to negotiate better discounts on both the network pharmacy prices, as well as the rebates. Those are coming together. How much of that is synergy versus what we have already got. That becomes very difficult. The ability to say what would have Express Scripts grown on a standalone basis versus how much is synergy, every day we move away from closing, becomes more and more clouded. We feel very good of where we're at. But let me just say it another way. If we would go back to the 3% trends that we would have realized before the economy has slowed down, that actually we're now in negative trends this year, utilization trends, and we would have realized -- so therefore, our groups would have grown adding more lives. This may be a whole different conversation. But that's not the world we live in. The world we live in as people are taking less medications this year than they took last year and our membership and our plans aren't growing. That's what's causing the issue. This is a volume issue, not an earnings per Rx issue."

I believe we have many tools in order to help drive down their cost, Consumerology, the TRCs to the clinical programs we're running that allow us to meet the needs of our clients and maintain our price. I would tell you, Lisa, pricing is incredibly competitive, but at the same time, we can offset that otherwise, EBITDA per script would not be raising. It would be declining.

Profitability or profit, gross margin per script is almost irrelevant when it comes to diseconomies of scale. There's a cost structure that has to support that business. So we have lots of people that work on that account. Whether you're taking off $0.05 script you're taking off $5 script, gets you still have a cost structure. And so what's occurring is your spreading more and more of those costs against less and less of those scripts, no matter what the gross margin is. And therefore, you're having diseconomies of scale as those scripts runoff. And to learn a position to be able to redeploy all of those people and either jobs or unfortunately take them out we are not going to realize the cost reductions lockstep with the runoff of the revenues. Just how the business works."

I'm not saying that this is all a story. I'm just telling you based on what we heard from our client base is what we thought that we think that the numbers out there are overly aggressive. When you look at employment data, and you see employment trends, you've got to go deeper than just what the employment rate is as you know. You got to understand whether or not those jobs that are being added to the economy are actually getting provided health care coverage. And if they're not being provided health care coverage, then the small employer number as you know, they get added into the annual employment number or the monthly employment numbers is a guesstimate. And that's why they always true it up a month later because of they take a set number and they add it to the best guess because of this no way to get those numbers from small employers year ago showed of him a player, and you come up with a number. Small employers are necessarily having health care coverage right now. See what's happening. So as the economy starts to heat up and the small employer job start to be created and the economy starts to grow, the question is will they add employment. And the second question is in 2014, people are going to get covered. So in '14, we're going to see all the people that don't have coverage today or are being put on the sidelines without coverage will have access to coverage. All those people will what roles I don't know if that's 30 million, 40 million or 50 million by then, but it's going to be some number. And that's an opportunity for us. That's an opportunity to work with our health plans to go get those people and provide the coverage. All we're saying is that the role up of our client base is more pessimistic. And we don't know and what we will do is once we get the employment numbers in, once we get enrollment numbers in January, we'll refine it, we'll work with it, we'll see all of January's results. So we'll know what script counts are to the month of January, and I think will be in pretty good position to give pretty accurate guidance in February of 2013. And I hope like crazy that the economy is really strong. I'm a big patriot, and I love this country, and there's nothing more than I would like to see then strong employment trends, people adding to the ranks in our health plans are growing.

Let's say Express Scripts had rebates per script of $1 and Medco has rebates per script of $1.10. One very simple synergy is to move all of the Express Scripts numbers into the Medco formularies provided plans are allow you to do that. And if they do, then you would end up in $1.10 or $0.10 a script on the Express Scripts numbers. That would, in my mind, would be considered a synergy. In addition to that brand prices go up 10% a year. So it's Kris Houston's job and her team that work in our supply chain to go out and try to capture that 10% growth as an increase in our rebate numbers. When you have a drug that's the exclusive in class, that's a very difficult thing to do. When you have 3 or 4 competing drugs in the class, it's much more easier to do. And so it adds a question of how much of that price increase can we gain back for our clients and for our shareholders. The synergy calculation becomes mixed because what ends up happening is as we move the 2 plans together, we've got one  platform,  one rebate -- one formulary calculation of what the rebates are, and when we do that, then so if we had $1, $1.10 and next year is $1.12 how much of that synergy and how much of that is going to grow? We really can't determine that any longer because all the numbers are getting comingled thickness of the only point we are trying to make, is that we go in with the what we think we should be we put that out in specific targets to our members. And as long as we're achieving this targets then we are hitting our growth off our base business, as well as our synergy targets, and we monitor that, we not in a position to give that information out."

If we can offer better formulary decisions, better clinical programs, better options, then it doesn't have to come out of our pocket. And we still achieve the desired results that they need, and that's our job. And that's across the entire book. Again, this is a environment but I don't -- we feel good about where we sit. And the fact that gross margin per script can go up next year should speak to the pricing environment in my mind."

Our third quarter results continue to trend at strong operating and financial performance. In keeping with our model of alignment, the increase in generic fill rate resulted in significant savings to our clients, and our gross profit margin was up 30 basis points sequentially. Integration, including the migration of lives to our destination platform, continues successfully. Synergies continue to be accelerated into 2012, which contributed to strong earnings for the quarter and the increase in our guidance range. Cash flows were strong, and we made good progress towards realizing our cash flow synergy and delevering our balance sheet.
We reported third quarter earnings per share of $1.02, up 29% from the same quarter last year. Home delivery and specialty claims were $39.8 million, up 199% from the same quarter last year. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition, organic or same-store equivalent home delivery claims would have grown approximately 3% over last year.
SG&A expenses declined $94 million sequentially from the second quarter as a result of the accelerated realization of synergies. We expect SG&A to increase in the fourth quarter, reflecting normal seasonal expenses and preparation for one-one implementation. EBITDA was $1.6 billion, up 136% from last year, while EBITDA per adjusted script was up 9%.
During the quarter, we repaid $1.1 billion of debt, which included Medco's $600 million accounts receivable financing facility which we have terminated, continuing our plan to quickly delever. We now expect EPS for the year, including deal-related cost and amortization and other nonrecurring items, to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75, representing growth of 25% over 2011 at the midpoint, an increase of $0.19 from our original midpoint as a result of the acceleration of synergy. This range now assumes a 39% tax rate, which is an increase from our previous guidance, which assumed a 39% rate. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be 39%.

We remain confident that we are well-positioned for growth and remain bullish on the PBM business. Although we are not prepared to provide 2013 guidance this morning, I will provide more clarity into our future",665,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We remain confident that we are well-positioned for growth and remain bullish on the PBM business. Although we are not prepared to provide 2013 guidance this morning, I will provide more clarity into our future outlook. There are a number of positives that will provide tailwinds for our business. The integration of Medco remains on track, and we are meeting or exceeding our key targets.
Last week, we successfully migrated our fourth tier of clients to our destination platform and have made considerable progress in rationalizing our operational footprint. As a result, certain synergies originally expected in 2013 were realized in 2012. This is contributing to a strong 2012 results. This acceleration of synergies reduces the incremental synergies in 2013.
Our pipeline of products is resonating in the marketplace. Clients have a thirst to better manage cost, and they appreciate the science behind our evidence-based approach to managing the pharmacy benefit. We will help clients and members navigate the complexity of Health Care Reform, and we will enhance our leading position in management of the cost and quality of care for specialty medications.
Our cash flows remained strong, and our timing for expected realization of cash flow synergies is accelerating. Now that we're seeing these recent successes, the economic environmental outlook is presenting some near-term challenges. Over the last few weeks as part of our forecasting process, we spoke to many of our health claim clients and large employer clients. What we learned is that our clients have unprecedented concerns about our country's economic outlook. This lackluster economy is taking its toll in several areas. In aggregate, our health claim clients are expecting membership reductions in 2013. Large employers have pulled back on hiring plans, using contractors and part-time employees when necessary. Mid to small employers are cutting back or postponing health care coverage decisions while waiting for more clarity on Health Care Reform. And we continue to see low rates of drug utilization as individuals deal with uncertainty at the household level.
As a result, the current weak business climate and the unemployment outlook will likely result in significant in-group member attrition in 2013, continuing low utilization rates and increased client demands and expectations. We had a successful sales season, adding approximately 215 new accounts, which exceeded our sales targets. We operate in a very competitive environment, but we remain disciplined in our approach to pricing and profitability. We project that our retention rate will be approximately 94%. In addition, the transition of the UnitedHealth book of business to OptumRx throughout 2013 will reduce claim comparisons in 2013 versus 2012 and 2014 versus 2013. The adjusted Rx reduction will result in diseconomies of scale until the book is fully transitioned.
In spite of these near-term headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment, we expect to grow earnings per share and EBITDA in 2013. In fact, we expect to grow gross profit per adjusted Rx in the high single-digit range and EBITDA per adjusted Rx in the mid-teens next year. However, with the acceleration of synergies in '12, which translates into lower incremental synergies in '13, along with lower volume expectations, we view current consensus estimates for '13 as overly aggressive.
In early January, we'll receive the actual enrollment data from all of our clients and see initial Rx volume. This will provide more clarity to our expected financial performance. Therefore, on a go-forward basis, we will provide annual guidance when we release our year-end financial results. As such, we will give our 2013 guidance in February. Express Scripts will continue to develop and offer innovative solutions that will protect American families from the rising cost of health care. We have an unprecedented opportunity to help make the use of prescription drugs safer and more affordable for tens of millions Americans that will translate into strong value for our clients and patients and continued growth for our stockholders.
At this point, operator, we'll be happy to answer any questions."

The",466,"So, no one size fits all, of course. And what we're seeing, and you see it everyday, in the Wall Street Journal yesterday, there was a headline article about how employers are looking at the impact of Health Care Reform and what actions they may take. There's articles in today's papers, there was -- this is a constant theme. And I believe employers are concerned about the economic outlook. And it was tough going through '09 and '10. Employers had to make very difficult decisions about workforce levels. And nobody enjoys doing layoffs. It's something that has to be done to protect the shareholder base and something to be done to protect the rest of the employees and to stay profitable. But having gone through that, people don't like -- CEOs don't really like doing that. And so companies have been very slow to bring back employment. We saw that throughout last year's numbers as well. The difference is we had significant Medco synergies that accelerated in the years that helped offset a lot of the attrition that we saw throughout the course of the year. Employers, when you see the unemployment numbers that are coming out of the federal numbers when they're released, people are hiring. But that doesn't mean they're necessarily hiring people and giving them benefit coverage. A lot of the employers are hiring part-time workers, people that keeps throwing hours to below 30%. Other employers are hiring contractors and using contractors to do the work. Some of the jobs, unfortunately, are going offshore. And so we're seeing those trends existing in our marketplace. I would tell you, it's worse today, at least the outlook is. Now the reason we're not going to give you a hard number is nobody really knows, right? There's still a month to go, 2 months to go before the end of the year. We don't know exactly what's going to happen. I don't want to throw a number out there based on some numbers that are coming into us and not be accurate when in 2 short months, we're going to have a very strong number. On January 1, actually it's before then, we'll get the enrollment files from all of our clients. Every one of them sends in a new enrollment file. They do it constantly but, of course, we'll get the January 1 numbers, which will be the starting point for next year. Those stayed pretty consistent through the course of the year. And we'll know where we stand. We'll know what the success of our health plan selling seasons are. We'll know the success of their retention endeavors. We'll see where the numbers are at. And we'll be prepared in February to give accurate guidance, which is much better than we could do today."

I'll do my best here, again, I'm not providing earnings guidance. So I just want to make sure we're clear on that. But from an overall perspective, addressing the second half first, yes, we're continuing to pull in our synergies. And we are still working with our clients in order to promote mail, as Jeff said in his prepared comments that mail year-over-year is up 3% on an equivalent basis. And we're continuing to sell our clinical programs. These things are all driving down the cost of health care for our plans and our members and increasing profitability for us. Those trends will continue into the next year. And our belief is that we will grow gross margin and EBITDA per script. Obviously, gross margin grows because of getting more pull through in our client base, better pull through in our client base of our programs and generics and mail and all those type of things. And on the other side of the coin, EBITDA per script will continue to grow because of reductions in our cost structures.

The tax rate's gone up, and we're still exceeding our numbers. So that takes additional synergies to make that happen as well. So the synergy pull through has been good. Where it gets tough, and I think Jeff made this point after we closed the NextRx acquisition, is there's an Express Scripts run rate number, there's a Medco run rate number, and then we believe we can take each of those and get a synergy out of it. But when you actually start putting the books together -- last week on November 1, we moved our largest tier ever of clients. Thousands and thousands of daily prescriptions were moved into the new platform. Then when we do that, we come up with the best rebate programs, the best network opportunities, and we start the pull through. We, at the same time, our supply chain people are out trying to negotiate better discounts on both the network pharmacy prices, as well as the rebates. Those are coming together. How much of that is synergy versus what we would have already got, that becomes very difficult. The ability to say what would have Express Scripts grown on a standalone basis versus how much is synergy, every day we move away from closing, becomes more and more clouded. We feel very good of where we're at. But let me just say it another way. If we would go back to the 3% trends that we would have realized before the economy has slowed down, that actually now we're in a negative trend this year, utilization trend, and we would have realized -- so therefore, our groups would have grown, they would have been adding more lives. This may be a whole different conversation. But that's not the world we live in. The world we live in is people are taking less medications this year than they took last year and our membership and our plans aren't growing. That's what's causing the issue. This is a volume issue, not an earnings per Rx issue."

What we're saying is what our clients are telling us their thoughts are. And so if in fact our clients -- our health plans stays stable on employment, , if in fact our employer groups hire more people because they get optimistic about the Christmas season and the holiday season and then next year, there could be a significant upside. I'm not saying that this is all a doom and gloom story. I'm just telling you based on what we've heard from our client base is what we thought that we think that the numbers out there are overly aggressive. When you look at employment data, and you see employment trends, you've got to go deeper than just what the employment rate is. As you know, you got to understand whether or not those jobs that are being added to the economy are actually getting provided health care coverage. And if they're not being provided health care coverage, then that's -- small employer number as you know, they get added into the annual employment number, or the monthly employment numbers is a guesstimate. And that's why they always true it up a month later because they take a set number and they add it to the best guess because there's no way to get those numbers from small employers. They'd showed a month later, and you come out with a number. Small employers aren't necessarily having health care coverage right now. They're waiting to see what's happening. So as the economy starts to heat up and the small employer jobs start to be created and the economy starts to grow, the question is, will they add employment. And the second question is in 2014, all these people are going to get covered. So in '14, we're going to see all the people that don't have coverage today or that are being put on the sidelines without coverage will have access to coverage. All those people will know their roles, I don't know if that's 30 million, 40 million or 50 million by then, but it's going to be some number. And that's an opportunity for us. That's an opportunity to work with our health plans to go get those people and provide the coverage. All we're saying is that the role off of our client base is more pessimistic. And we don't know -- and what we will do is once we get the employment numbers in, once we get enrollment numbers in, in January, we'll refine it, we'll work with it, we'll see all of January's results. So we'll know what script counts are through the month of January. And I think we'll be in pretty good position to give pretty accurate guidance in February of 2013. And I hope like crazy that the economy is really strong. I'm a big patriot, and I love this country, and there's nothing more than I would like to see than strong employment trends, people adding people to the ranks and our health plans are all growing. That will be amazing. And let's keep our fingers crossed that, that's what we're reporting on in February."

What I was trying to say was let's assume, let's just make up simple numbers. Let's say Express Scripts had rebates per script of $1, and Medco has rebates per script of $1.10. One very simple synergy is to move all of the Express Scripts members into the Medco formularies provided their plans will allow you to do that. And if they do, then you would end up in $1.10 or $0.10 a script on the Express Scripts numbers. That would, in my mind, would be considered a synergy. Now in addition to that, brand prices go up 10% a year. So it's Chris Houston's job and her team that work in our supply chain to go out and try to capture that 10% growth as an increase in our rebate numbers. When you have a drug that's the exclusive in a class, that's a very difficult thing to do. When you have 3 or 4 competing drugs in the class, it's much more easier to do. And so it's a question of how much of that price increase can we gain back for our clients and for our shareholders. The synergy calculation becomes mixed because what ends up happening is as we move the 2 plans together, we're going to one platform, one rebate -- one formulary calculation of what the rebates are, and when we do that, then -- so if we had $1, $1.10 and next year is $1.12, how much of that synergy and how much of that is in-group growth. We really can't determine that any longer because all the numbers are getting co-mingled. That's the only point we're trying to make, is that we go in with what we think we should be, we put that out in specific targets to our members, and as long as we're achieving those targets and we're hitting our in-group growth of our base business as well as our synergy targets and we monitor that, we're not in a position to give that information out."

And the question is how do you meet those cost reductions that they're looking for. If you don't have any tools, it comes out of your pocket. If we can offer better formulary decisions, better clinical programs, better options, then it doesn't have to come out of our pocket, and we still achieve the desired results that they need. And that's our job. And that's mixed across the entire book. Again, it's a competitive environment but I don't -- we feel good about where we sit.

Our third quarter results continue to trend a strong operating and financial performance. In keeping with our model of alignment, the increase in generic fill rate resulted in significant savings to our clients, and our gross profit margin was up 30 basis points sequentially. Integration, including the migration of lives to our destination platform, continues successfully. Synergies continue to be accelerated into 2012, which contributed to strong earnings for the quarter and the increase in our guidance range. Cash flows were strong, and we made good progress towards realizing our cash flow synergy and delevering our balance sheet.
We reported third quarter earnings per share of $1.02, up 29% from the same quarter last year. Home delivery and specialty claims were $39.8 million, up 199% from the same quarter last year. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition, organic or same-store equivalent home delivery claims would have grown approximately 3% over last year.
SG&A expenses declined $94 million sequentially from the second quarter as a result of the accelerated realization of synergies. We expect SG&A to increase in the fourth quarter, reflecting normal seasonal expenses and preparation for one-one implementations. EBITDA was $1.6 billion, up 136% from last year, while EBITDA per adjusted script was up 9%.
During the quarter, we repaid $1.1 billion of debt, which included Medco's $600 million accounts receivable financing facility which we have terminated, continuing our plan to quickly delever. We now expect EPS for the year, including deal-related cost and amortization and other nonrecurring items, to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75, representing growth of 25% over 2011 at the midpoint, an increase of $0.19 from our original midpoint as a result of the acceleration of synergy. This range now assumes a 39% tax rate, which is an increase from our previous guidance, which assumed a 39% rate. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be 39%.

We remain confident that we are well-positioned for growth and remain bullish on the PBM business. Although we are not prepared to provide 2013 guidance this morning, I will provide more clarity into our future outlook. There are a number of positives that will provide tailwinds for our business. The integration of Medco remains on track, and we are meeting or exceeding our key targets.
Last week, we successfully migrated our fourth tier of clients to our destination platform and have made considerable progress in rationalizing our operational footprint. As a result, certain synergies originally expected in 2013 were realized in 2012. This is contributing to a strong 2012 results. This acceleration of synergies reduces the incremental synergies in 2013.
Our pipeline of products is resonating in the marketplace. Clients have a thirst to better manage cost, and they appreciate the science behind our evidence-based approach to managing the pharmacy benefit. We will help clients and members navigate the complexity of Health Care Reform, and we will enhance our leading position in management of the cost and quality of care for specialty medications.
Our cash flows remain strong, and our timing for expected realization of cash flow synergies is accelerating. Notwithstanding these recent successes, the economic environmental outlook is presenting some near-term challenges. Over the last few weeks, as part of our forecasting process, we spoke to many of our health claim clients and large employer clients. What we learned is that our clients have unprecedented concerns about our country's economic outlook. This lackluster economy is taking its toll in several areas. In aggregate, our health claim clients are expecting membership reductions in 2013. Large employers have pulled back on hiring plans, using contractors and part-time employees when necessary. Mid- to small employers are cutting back or postponing health care coverage decisions while waiting for more clarity on Health Care Reform. And we continue to see low rates of drug utilization as individuals deal with uncertainty at the household level.
As a result, the current weak business climate and the unemployment outlook will likely result in significant in-group member attrition in 2013, continued low utilization rates and increased client demands and expectations. We had a successful sales season, adding approximately 215 new accounts, which exceeded our sales targets. We operate in a very competitive environment, but we remain disciplined in our approach to pricing and profitability. We project that our retention rate will be approximately 94%. In addition, the transition of the UnitedHealth book of business to OptumRx throughout 2013 will reduce claim comparisons in 2013 versus 2012 and 2014 versus 2013. The adjusted Rx reduction will result in diseconomies of scale until the book is fully transitioned.
In spite of these near-term headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment, we expect to grow earnings per share and EBITDA in 2013. In fact, we expect to grow gross profit per adjusted Rx in the high-single-digit range and EBITDA per adjusted Rx in the mid-teens next year. However, with the acceleration of synergies in '12, which translates into lower incremental synergies in '13, along with lower volume expectations, we view current consensus estimates for '13 as overly aggressive.
In early January, we'll receive the actual enrollment data from all of our clients and see initial Rx volume. This will provide more clarity to our expected financial performance. Therefore, on a go-forward basis, we will provide annual guidance when we release our year-end financial results. As such, we will give our 2013 guidance in February. Express Scripts will continue to develop and offer innovative solutions that will protect American families from the rising cost of health care. We have an unprecedented opportunity to help make the use of prescription drugs safer and more affordable for tens of millions Americans.  That will translate into strong value for our clients and patients and continued growth for our stockholders.
At this point, operator, we'll be happy to answer any questions."

And what we're seeing, and you see it every day in the Wall Street Journal.  Yesterday, there was a headline article about how employers are looking at the impact of Health Care Reform and what actions they may take. There's articles in today's papers, there was -- this is a constant theme. And I believe employers are concerned about the economic outlook. And it was tough going through '09 and '10. Employers had to make very difficult decisions about workforce levels. And nobody enjoys doing layoffs. It's something that has to be done to protect the shareholder base and something to be done to protect the rest of the employees and to stay profitable. But having gone through that, people don't like -- CEOs don't really like doing that. And so companies have been very slow to bring back employment. We saw that throughout last year's numbers as well. The difference is we had significant Medco synergies that accelerated in the years that helped offset a lot of the attrition that we saw throughout the course of the year. Employers, when you see the unemployment numbers that are coming out of the federal numbers when they're released, people are hiring. But that doesn't mean they're necessarily hiring people and giving them benefit coverage. A lot of employers are hiring part-time workers, people that keeps throwing hours [ph] to below 30%. Other employers are hiring contractors and using contractors to do the work. Some of the jobs, unfortunately, are going offshore. And so we're seeing those trends existing in our marketplace. I would tell you it's worse today, at least the outlook is. Now the reason we're not going to give you a hard number is nobody really knows, right? There's still a month to go, 2 months to go before the end of the year. We don't know exactly what's going to happen. I don't want to throw a number out there based on some numbers that are coming into us and not be accurate when in 2 short months, we're going to have a very strong number. On January 1, actually it's before then, we'll get the enrollment files from all of our clients. Every one of them sends in a new enrollment file. They do it constantly, but, of course, we'll get the January 1 numbers, which will be the starting point for next year. Those stayed pretty consistent through the course of the year. And we'll know where we stand. We'll know what the success of our health plan selling seasons are. We'll know the success of the retention endeavors. We'll see where the numbers are at. And we'll be prepared in February to give accurate guidance, which is much better than we could do today."

Again, I'm not providing earnings guidance. So I just want to make sure we're clear on that. But from an overall perspective, addressing the second half first, yes, we're continuing to pull in our synergies. And we are still working with our clients in order to promote mail, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, that mail year-over-year is up 3% on an equivalent basis. And we're continuing to sell our clinical programs. These things are all driving down the cost of health care for our plans and our members and increasing profitability for us. Those trends will continue into the next year. And our belief is that we will grow gross margin and EBITDA per script. Obviously, gross margin grows because of getting more pull-through in our client base, better pull-through in our client base of our programs and generics and mail and all those type things. And on the other side of the coin, EBITDA per script will continue to grow because of reductions in our cost structures. And that's including some diseconomies of scale that are occurring with respect to the UnitedHealth business going off. So even with those diseconomies, we believe we can grow EBITDA per script in the mid-teens. As far as -- what was the first part of your question again?"

The tax rate's gone up, and we're still exceeding our numbers. So that takes additional synergies to make that happen as well. So the synergy pull-through has been good. Where it gets tough, and I think Jeff made this point after we closed the NextRx acquisition, is there's an Express Scripts run rate number, there's a Medco run rate number, and then we believe we can take each of those and get a synergy out of it. But when you actually start putting the books together -- last week on November 1, we moved our largest tier ever of clients. Thousands and thousands of daily prescriptions were moved into the new platform. Then when we do that, we come up with the best rebate programs, the best network opportunities, and we start the pull-through. We, at the same time, our supply chain people are out trying to negotiate better discounts on both the network pharmacy prices as well as the rebates. Those are coming together. How much of that is synergy versus what we would have already got, that becomes very difficult. The ability to say what would have  Express Scripts grown on a standalone basis versus how much is synergy, every day we move away from closing becomes more and more clouded. We feel very good of where we're at. But let me just say it another way. If we would go back to the 3% trends that we would have realized before the economy has slowed down, that actually now we're in a negative trend this year, utilization trend, and we would have realized -- so therefore, our groups would have grown, they would have been adding more lives. This may be a whole different conversation. But that's not the world we live in. The world we live in is people are taking less medications this year than they took last year, and our membership and our plans aren't growing. That's what's causing the issue. This is a volume issue, not a earnings per Rx issue."

I believe we have many tools in order to help drive down their cost, from Consumerology to the TRCs to the clinical programs we're running, that allow us to meet the needs of our clients and maintain our price. I would tell you, Lisa, pricing is incredibly competitive, but at the same time, we can offset that. Otherwise, EBITDA per script would not be rising.  It would be declining. And so it's not that this is an easy walk, it's just that we have a lot of tools and opportunities to help control that. And I still believe that we have the best offering out there.

And so if, in fact, our clients -- our health plans stay stable on employment; if, in fact, our employer groups hire more people because they get optimistic about the Christmas season and the holiday season and then next year, there could be a significant upside. I'm not saying that this is all a doom-and-gloom story. I'm just telling you based on what we've heard from our client base is what we thought, that we think that the numbers out there are overly aggressive. When you look at employment data and you see employment trends, you've got to go deeper than just what the employment rate is. As you know, you got to understand whether or not those jobs that are being added to the economy are actually getting provided health care coverage. And if they're not being provided health care coverage, then that's -- the small employer number, as you know, that get added into the annual employment number as a monthly employment numbers is a guesstimate. And that's why they always true it up a month later, because they take a set number and they add it to the best guess, because there's no way to get those numbers from small employers. They true it up a month later, and you come out with a number. Well, small employers aren't necessarily having health care coverage right now. They're waiting to see what's happening. So as the economy starts to heat up and the small employer jobs start to be created and the economy starts to grow, the question is, will they add employment?  And the second question is in 2014, all these people are going to get covered. So in '14, we're going to see all the people that don't have coverage today or that are being put on the sidelines without coverage will have access to coverage. All those people will know their roles, I don't know if that's 30 million, 40 million or 50 million by then, but it's going to be some number. And that's an opportunity for us. That's an opportunity to work with our health plans to go get those people and provide the coverage. All we're saying is that the roll-off of our client base is more pessimistic. And we don't know -- and what we will do is once we get the employment numbers in, once we get enrollment numbers in, in January, we'll refine it, we'll work with it, we'll see all of January's results. So we'll know what script counts are through the month of January. And I think we'll be in pretty good position to give pretty accurate guidance in February of 2013. And I hope like crazy that the economy is really strong. I'm a big patriot, and I love this country, and there's nothing more than I would like to see than strong employment trends, people adding people to the ranks and our health plans all growing. That will be amazing. And let's keep our fingers crossed that that's what we're reporting on in February."

I guess I really don't understand that. And the reason I'm bringing it up, is when I look at consensus EBITDA estimates, they're really high, and they're really all over the place. And I have a feeling that people are putting a same-store EBITDA growth on your business and then adding what they think the synergies are and x-ing out UNH. So I guess my question is, I know maybe you don't want to break out what the synergy number is versus what real same-store EBITDA growth was in the quarter, but directionally, can you give us what you think the PBM business is growing on a same-store basis? Is it growing mid-single-digits, is it going high single-digits, is it growing low double-digits? Because I think that would reduce some of the overestimates out there, especially with EBITDA."

What I was trying to say was let's assume, let's just make up simple numbers. Let's say Express Scripts had rebates per script of $1, and Medco has rebates per script of $1.10. One very simple synergy is to move all of the Express Scripts members into the Medco formularies, provided their plans will allow you to do that. And if they do, then you would end up at $1.10 or $0.10 a script on the Express Scripts numbers. That would, in my mind, would be considered a synergy. Now in addition to that, brand prices go up 10% a year. So it's Chris Houston's job and her team that work in our supply chain to go out and try to capture that 10% growth as an increase in our rebate numbers. When you have a drug that's the exclusive in a class, that's a very difficult thing to do. When you have 3 or 4 competing drugs in a class, it's much more easier to do. And so it's a question of how much of that price increase can we gain back for our clients and for our shareholders?  The synergy calculation becomes mixed, because what ends up happening is as we move the 2 plans together, we go into one platform, one rebate -- one formulary calculation of what the rebates are, and when we do that, then -- so if we had $1, $1.10 and next year it's $1.12, how much of that synergy and how much of that is in-group growth [ph]?  You really can't determine that any longer, because all the numbers are getting co-mingled. That's the only point we're trying to make, is that we go in with where we think we should be, we put that out in specific targets to our members, and as long as we're achieving those targets and we're hitting our in-group growth off our base business as well as our synergy targets and we monitor that.  We're not in a position to give that information out."

We both have clients in a large employer group and the health plan group. I think what our teams try to do is that there were certain things that Express Scripts did better than Medco and vice versa. So they're looking for upon renewal is because of the cost of inflation and all the other pieces and the rising cost of health care, they look at the prices to come down. And the question is how do you meet those cost reductions that they're looking for?  If you don't have any tools, it comes out of your pocket. If we can offer better formulary decisions, better clinical programs, better options, then it doesn't have to come out of our pocket and we still achieve the desired results that they need. And that's our job. And that's mixed across the entire book. Again, it's a competitive environment, but I don't -- we feel good about where we sit. And the fact that gross margin for scripts can go up next year should speak to the pricing environment, in my mind."
