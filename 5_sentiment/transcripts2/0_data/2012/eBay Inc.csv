We're delivering on our commitments in our vision of enabling commerce. Our 2011 results h",1425,"Thanks, Jenny. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 and full year earnings call. We had a strong fourth quarter and a strong finish to an excellent year. We're delivering on our commitments in our vision of enabling commerce. Our 2011 results highlight the competitive portfolio of global commerce businesses that comprise our company today. eBay, PayPal, GSI and X.commers are reinventing how people shop and pay. And we are positioning ourselves as an effective partner to retailers of all sizes. 
2011 marked an inflection point for shopping. Online and offline retail are rapidly blending into a seamless multichannel world. Consumers are driving this change and technology is enabling it. In this new retail world, our company has powerful global commerce platforms to deliver technology-driven innovation to retailers and consumers. 
We're leveraging shopping technology such as Milo, Ware and RedLaser with a strong leadership position in mobile commerce and payments, and we're innovating and social and mobile commerce. 
For consumers and retailers, we intend to make shopping more locally convenient and more globally accessible. This means enabling retailers of all sizes to reach consumers when, where and how those consumers want to shop. New retail at anytime anywhere. And in this fluid environment, we will help retailers compete but we will never compete with them. 
At the beginning of last year, we laid out bold 3-year growth goals. Our strong performance in 2011 was a big down payment for these goals and we have increased confidence in our outlook. I will talk more about what this means for 2012 and 2013 in his remarks. 
Now let's take a look at our results for Q4. We had a strong close to the year. Q4 revenue grew 35% and non-GAAP EPS was up 17%. All of our businesses performed well. 
PayPal had another strong quarter. EBay had solid growth in its core markets and GSI had a great holiday season driving strong growth for its merchant clients. Both PayPal and eBay now have over 100 million active accounts and active users. And during this holiday season, both PayPal and eBay set new records during peak shopping periods. 
For example, on Cyber Monday, PayPal sold more than 10,000 transactions per minute during peak periods, a new record for us. We also had our biggest mobile holiday shopping season yet with consumer spending $180 per second through our eBay mobile apps. 
Let's take a look at the results for each business unit. PayPal is becoming an increasingly global business. Q4 marked the first time that more than 1/2 of PayPal's revenues came from outside the U.S. Consumers and merchants around the world are responding to the benefits PayPal offers and this business has a tremendous opportunity globally. 
In Merchant Services, TPV was up 29%. PayPal added more than 1 million new active users each month in Q4 ending the year with more than $106 million globally. And PayPal customers continue to steadily increase the number of times they use PayPal with Q4 transactions increasing 30% year-over-year. PayPal TPV and eBay was up 16% for the quarter as penetration on eBay accelerated more than 1 point for Q3, or 74%. And PayPal's Mobile Payment business ended the year with strong momentum. For the year, our mobile payment volume hit $4 billion, more than 5x the volume of the year before. The number of PayPal customers regularly making a purchase through their mobile phone more than doubled during the second half of the year. And during the holiday season, mobile payment volume increased more than 500% on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Simply put, consumers are shopping more frequently via mobile and merchants who adopt PayPal mobile Express Checkout are seeing significantly higher conversion. We expect PayPal's mobile growth to continue with mobile volume in 2012 estimated to hit $7 billion. 
Meanwhile, PayPal continues to generate excitement around our plans to extend PayPal as a point-of-sale retail locations. We anticipate this will be give consumers better shopping experiences and more flexible payment choices. As for retailers, we believe this will give them opportunities to not only engage consumers at checkout but also throughout their entire multichannel shopping experience. 
Since we opened it in November, over 100 retailers have visited PayPal's shopping showcase in New York, where our new payment innovations are being demonstrated in retail-like environments. And in Q4, we began a limited in-store test with Home Depot, our first national retail partner. And later this week, we'll be launching a pilot to 51 Home Depot stores primarily in the Bay Area. 
PayPal customers will be able to easily and quickly pay for purchases in these stores by either swiping their PayPal card or simply entering their mobile phone number and PIN. You can shop without your wallet, without your credit cards or even your mobile phone, just pay with PayPal. We're excited about our partnership with Home Depot and we'll continue to be focused on delivering the best, possible product experience for consumers and retailers as we expand with Home Depot and other national retailers later this year. 
Turning to Marketplaces. eBay had a solid quarter. Marketplaces revenue grew 16% with core GMV up 10% and marketing services up 24%. Let me talk a little more about GMV. 
Core GMV grew 10% both in the U.S. and internationally. Fixed price, which now accounts for 64% of total GMV, grew 14% globally and 15% in e-commerce, in line or in the U.S., in line with e-commerce. Today, eBay offers consumers more inventory than ever with approximately 300 million listings available at any given time. The site is cleaner, easier and faster to shop than ever before and our most trusted sellers continue to win. 
In Q4, nearly 1/2 of all GMV on eBay in the U.S. came from top-rated sellers, a reflection of the trusted retail-like experience they're offering shoppers today. Same-store sales for top-rated sellers grew 19% in the quarter, outpacing e-commerce. And eBay sellers offered free shipping on more items this holiday season representing 43% of transactions, up 14 points over the prior year. 
eBay also continued its strong mobile commerce leadership, ending the year with $5 billion of mobile volume. That's more than double 2010. And in 2012, we expect eBay mobile volume to grow to $8 billion. Mobile can make any moment conveniently shopable and consumers love having their favorite store, eBay, in their pocket. 
And mobile is driving more than just shopping on eBay. In 2011, eBay acquired more than 1 million new active users via mobile devices. And each week, eBay sellers are now uploading on average more than 1 million listings through our mobile apps with each listing taking an average of 60 seconds or less to complete. 
We also stepped up our marketing in Q4 and we are pleased with how our Buy It New, Buy It Now Consumer Campaign is beginning to change consumer perception in the U.S. Early feedback shows the campaign has been successful in helping to drive brand awareness and position eBay as the destination with a great selection of new merchandise at fixed prices. 
Turning to our new business unit, GSI had a great holiday season, driving a 26% increase in same-store sales for its merchants. And we're making great progress in the second half of last year in our integration efforts. We're capturing synergies across the portfolio and ended the year with 13 GSI merchants selling on eBay. 
In Q4, we also launched X.commerce. We're excited about the enthusiastic response to X.commerce and the potential for this open commerce ecosystem to drive innovation for merchants and third-party developers. Today, we already have 800,000 developers, merchants and users on the X.commerce platform. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our fourth quarter performance, our progress over the past 12 months and our progress in delivering against our 3-year growth outlook we announced last February. In a dynamic and rapidly changing environment, we are operating with discipline and clarity. We have a strong bench of management talent and we will not skip a beat as we manage the transition at PayPal. Across the company, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to execute. 
We are a different eBay today; technology-driven and customer-focused with a portfolio of commerce, platforms and products that engage consumers and benefit retailers. We're no longer just an e-commerce leader but a stronger, more diverse global commerce company shaping the future of shopping payments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide more details on Q4 and the full year before we take questions."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Before I go to the results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to put some perspective on the full year. As John mentioned earlier, c",1944,"Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Before I go to the results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to put some perspective on the full year. 
As John mentioned earlier, commerce is at an inflection point. Technology-led innovation, driven by the wide adoption of eBay and other applications on smartphones and tablets is changing the way people shop. Retail is becoming multichannel and merchants of all sizes must keep up with changing consumer behavior. They have been reaching out to us for help and we are responding. 
Today, eBay is focused on enabling global commerce by investing in new products and services that extend our capabilities and put us in a position to meet the evolving needs of both merchants and consumers. Simply put, this is the essence of our 3-year plan we outlined at Analyst Day earlier last year. And we've now completed the first year of our 3-year journey. 
Overall, the first year was an excellent one for eBay. We grew the company's top line 27%, delivered EPS growth of 17% and generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow. And our platforms enabled nearly $150 billion of commerce volume for our customers. 
First is the guidance we gave you back in January of 2011, we are $1 billion larger and approximately $100 million better on net income with the balance sheet as strong as ever. We feel great about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal is adding merchants and consumers while investing in the next-generation payment capabilities. The Marketplaces' core business overall is healthy and investments in new features and functionality continue to make the site even better. And GSI is focused on helping larger retailers succeed in a multichannel world. 
One year into our 3-year plan, we are ahead of our expectations and we are increasingly confident about the future. Now let's take a look at the results from the fourth quarter. 
Q4 was a great quarter for our company and PayPal, Marketplaces and GSI all performed well. Revenue increased 35%. Non-GAAP EPS grew 17% and operating margins accelerated across all 3 segments. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we closed the sale of our remaining investment in Skype for $2.3 billion. We completed 3 product-enhancing acquisitions and we repurchased approximately 8 million shares. We had a strong finish to a great year and we'll carry that momentum into 2012 and 2013. 
In Q4, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.4 billion, up 35%. Organic revenue growth of 19% and the inclusion of recently closed acquisition increased our growth by approximately 16 points. 
Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.60, a 17% increase year-over-year. Solid top line growth drove our outperformance relative to guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.7%, down 80 basis points from Q4 2010. This was driven by operating leverage offset by business mix and the impact of recently completed acquisition. We generated strong free cash flow of $691 million in the fourth quarter with CapEx at roughly 9% of revenues. Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. 
PayPal posted another great quarter. Revenue growth was 28% and total payment volume increased to $33.4 billion, up 24%. We continue to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 33% and comprising 47% of overall TPV in the quarter. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. The number of payments grew 30%, a 1 point acceleration versus the third quarter. On eBay TPV grew 16% on FX neutral basis, driven by a 10% increase in GMV and a 4 point increase in PayPal penetration on eBay. 
Merchant Services TPV grew 29% on an FX neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion on PayPal merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of checkout. While growth was strong, we decelerated 4 points in the quarter. The deceleration was driven by softness in cross-border trade, particularly to Europe, and declines in average payment size from strong growth and low price categories as well as holiday discounting. Transaction margin was 64.8% in Q4, up 130 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense as a result of the Durbin amendment. 
PayPal's segment margin was 24.7% in the quarter, up 260 basis points from last year and at the highest level over the past 5 years. Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. 
Bill Me Later's TPV was up 44%, driven by a continued strong penetration on and off eBay. BML penetration in the U.S. on eBay and in the PayPal Wallet has increased in the past year to more than 1.6% in the fourth quarter. This penetration reduces our funding costs as consumers shift away from credit cards to Bill Me Later. 
Risk-adjusted margins in the quarter was 16.9%, up 250 basis points over last year. Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. 
Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 17% on an FX neutral basis. This was driven by transaction revenue growth of 15% and marketing services revenue growth of 24% from our adjacent format. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Sold items grew 11%, approximately 2 point acceleration from Q3 driven by growth in the U.K., China and the U.S. U.S. GMV grew 10%, driven by strong active user growth and category sales in fashion and parts and accessories. 
While growth was solid, GMV decelerated 4 points as exports to Europe slowed and ASPs declined, primarily driven by gold prices on the platform.  From a format perspective, U.S. fixed price growth was strong at 15% while auctions grew 2%. International FX neutral GMV grew 10%, driven by acceleration in APAC, strong and stable performance in the U.K. and continued sluggish growth in Germany. Marketplaces segment margin was 40.6% in the quarter, up 140 basis points from operating leverage. Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. 
GSI had a great quarter. Revenue was $364 million, up 11%, which was driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Adjusting for the impact of the continued shift of clients to the service fee model, year-over-year growth would have been 15%. Global e-commerce Merchandise Sales, or GMS, grew 26% on a same-store sales basis, which was driven by strong performance in toys and health and beauty verticals. And GSI marketing services, which is primarily demand-generation activities accounted for nearly 20% of GSI revenue and was up 35% in the quarter. 
A quick update on the unit, on the GSI integration. GSI's profitability is improving as we capitalize on the synergies we laid out earlier last year. The number of GSI merchant selling on eBay platform is now 13 and we have added 8 new merchants to the eBay platform since the acquisition. And we are increasing PayPal's ubiquity with 89% coverage of GSI volume and 13% share of checkout. We are 6 months post the acquisition of GSI and we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead. 
Turning to operating expenses. For the fourth quarter, there were 42% of revenue, slightly lower on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by the impact of GSI as well as improved productivity from operational excellence initiatives offset by investment in product and the customer experience. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we generated strong free cash flow of $2.3 billion in 2011, including almost $700 million in the fourth quarter. We've improved our financial flexibility by funding approximately 50% of the U.S. Bill Me Later loan receivables portfolio with our offshore cash. 
During the year, we invested approximately $3.4 billion to strengthen our portfolio with 3 acquisitions closing in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased 33.6 million shares for a total of 1.1 billion. 
We ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $7.5 billion, including approximately $1 billion in the U.S. Now let me turn to guidance. 
From a macro perspective, we are assuming a relatively stable outlook for the global economy. Current foreign exchange rates and a continued low interest rate environment. While we remain anxious about the European economy and the impact of weaker European currencies on a cross-border volume, we are bullish about growth prospects for web-enabled commerce overall and e-commerce in particular. 
From an operating perspective, we expect continued strong performance in PayPal, solid performance in Marketplaces with continued investment and platform in new products, strong performance at GSI driven by top line growth and synergy realization, and our effective tax rate to be at the 18.5% to 19.5% range for the year. For the full year 2012, we expect revenue of $13.7 billion to $14 billion, representing growth of 18% to 20%. 
We anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30, representing growth of 11% to 13%. Our non-GAAP EPS growth of 12% is driven by several factors. First, we are expecting strong operating earnings growth of approximately 15% with improving segment margins at PayPal and GSI and stable margins at Marketplaces. Second, we've made several acquisitions in 2011 that we expect to contribute 4 points to the top line and 1 point of growth to earnings. Third, the strong U.S. dollar will negatively impact top and bottom line by approximately 3 points. Lastly, the low interest rate environment and the loss of our 30% portion of Skype's income will negatively impact our EPS growth by approximately 1 point. 
In summary, strong top and bottom line growth will be tempered by a stronger dollar and a weak interest rate environment. For the first quarter, we expect revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, representing growth of 20% to 24%. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.51, representing growth of 7% to 9%. EPS will grow slower in the first quarter than the full year due to a more seasonal business magnified by the addition of GSI and higher investments in the first half of the year. 
Let me take a minute and go back to our Analyst Day of a year ago. You may recognize Slide 19 from the Analyst Day deck where we initially laid out our expectations for 2013. I've updated this outlook to reflect our current view. 
First, we had strong momentum coming out of 2011. And secondly, we're expecting continued momentum in 2012 with a more diversified portfolio and a stronger set of assets. This has given us the confidence to raise the midpoint of our 2013 revenue guidance by approximately $550 million. Additionally, we are also increasing PayPal segment margin by 1 point to 25% to 26%. 
As a result of the strong top line growth and improved PayPal margins, we are raising the midpoint of our 3-year non-GAAP EPS CAGR by 1 point to 14% to 16%. 
So in summary, we had a strong close to a great year and are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead in the external environment. We exceeded the commitments we laid out for you at the beginning of the year. PayPal continues its strong growth. Core eBay is healthy and getting stronger and the GSI integration is going well. 
We are executing our strategies with a sharp focus on operational excellence that's enabling us to deliver on our commitments while reinvesting in commerce innovation and the customer experience. We allocated our capital with discipline, closing 13 acquisitions, repurchasing 34 million shares and selling our remaining minority stake in Skype. And finally, we are more confident in our 3-year operating plan and are increasing the midpoint of our 2013 numbers. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

And it's 2 fundamental things: one, transaction margins continue to improve and stay well above that 60% level that we laid out 3 years ago; and secondly, we're beginning to get the benefits of the operating leverage without constraining investments in new products and capabilities. So those are the 2 primary drivers. In terms of sustainability, implied in our guidance both for '12 and 2013 is PayPal's margins will continue to expand. Marketplaces margins will continue to stay relatively stable, consistent with 38% to 42% range that we provided at the beginning of last year and our expectations at GSI margins will continue to grow as well with leverage on existing infrastructure, a better mix with its fast-growing marketing services and the synergies that we're able to generate with GSI's part of the eBay portfolio."

And I'm not sure there's anything any of our metrics change business unit by business unit. But here's what I'm focusing on, which is, are we helping our customers win. So for instance, we know that when PayPal merchants at PayPal  Express Checkout or increasingly add Mobile Express PayPal  check out, they grow faster than their competition, they grew faster than the market. So we got a capability that's helping them compete and win in this new environment. I'm thrilled to see the GSI in the fourth quarter, GSI clients grew 26% same-store sales. So GSI clients grew more than 50% faster than the market. So our technology, GSI technology capabilities and services are helping its clients win. On eBay, particularly in the fourth quarter around top-rated sellers because the fourth quarter is a heavy fixed price is kind of a gift-giving quarter, right? And the consumers want to be able to get a gift off and the new item in that fixed price format and our top-rated sellers grew 19% in the fourth quarter. So if you hear me talking about our senior leadership team, I'm talking about are we helping our customers and clients win as their technology partner across all of our assets.

We are as you said correctly, our existing users have carried a lot of the turnaround that they've increased their frequency per user, their purchase per user, so we know we are happy with our site. Our customer loyalty is up. Our NPS is up and now. As we've been bring new users into the site, we're trying to ensure that we get them to make that first transaction and the second and the third. And as we learn with them and as we try to market to them and drive that cycle, we'll let you know. But I would be lying to you if I could tell you we understood the class curves as what we call them for the new sets of users and what we had a focus on adding new users and we're increasingly confident in our ability to grow their share of wallet on eBay."

It doesn't include point-of-sale and the part of mobile games that I think is very interesting is as merchants and retailers are adding PayPal Mobile Express Checkout to their application or to their HTML 5 stie or even to a core website that gets pulled up into a mobile device, conversion is increasing because we know consumers don't like to enter their credit card information. And therefore, ever they see that PayPal exchange but not on the phone and we're getting a higher share of checkout and higher conversion for those retailers. And they're noticing. And that's what's involved in the $7 billion. Look. Point-of-sale, the real goal for point-of-sale, I like in this back to what we've done in Merchant Services, where last year was the year of planning and beginning to build the product. This year is a year of learning and adjusting. And next year is the year of scaling. And so this year, I look to get the product rolled out to retailers, to get early consumer adoption and to get a product that can be rolled out to every vertical around the world so that we can build another business of point-of-sale not being built into Merchant Services environment."

On your second question, just cross-border trade, again, just to remind you, cross-border is a significant component of both the Marketplaces and the PayPal business, representing almost 20% of Marketplaces and approximately 25% of PayPal. So we continue to get better and better about managing cross-border and our community of users, both buyers and sellers, leverage our platforms to access to take their goods into global developed economies. So it's a significant portion of our business. That being said, there are still opportunities for us to get better and better about enabling the great deals from weaker currency markets for access to consumers from stronger currency markets. And that, and I characterized why we made the progress that still is an opportunity for us to get better and better and we'll be working on that in both of the businesses in 2012."

On free shipping, it's quite clear that for retail-like transactions, consumer expectations are and they want price transparency and free shipping.

And so earlier this year, we changed our pricing in the U.S. in a way that would take rate neutral but incented sellers to be very transparent about pricing and shipping costs, and wherever possible, to offer free shipping. And the results are clear as I said earlier that the number of items that are free shipping on the eBay business in the U.S. was up significantly over the year, which is meeting those consumer needs. I know there's been lots of questions about what would be the impact of that on your financials. I would say it was immaterial globally and accounted for roughly 1%, less than 1% growth of the growth in the U.S. So it's the right thing to do.

So no dramatic differences Q1 versus full year. Secondly, operating margins will be lower in the first quarter versus the full year and it's primarily driven by 2 things. First, GSI, much more seasonal business, lower volume and therefore, lower margins in the first quarter and it wasn't part of the portfolio on last year. So that will have an impact. Secondly, we will be increasing our investments earlier in the year this year to ensure that additional feature and functionality across all 3 platforms is ready before we go into the end of the holiday season. So that's what's resulted in earnings growth, the gap between earnings growth and top line growth in the first quarter. That being said, again, I'll go back to kind of segment margins on a year-over-year basis. And what you can expect to see is PayPal continuing to improve, GSI continuing to improve and Marketplaces remaining relatively stable within that 32% to 42% range we gave you. We will be able a more seasonal business than we have been historically with the addition of GSI. Just lastly, no dramatic change in tax rate on a year-over-year basis."

If you look at that leadership team, we have attracted -- first of all, you step back over the last 3 years, I've replaced 75 of the top 100 people in this company. We have rebuilt the leadership teams across all of our businesses including PayPal. And we have attracted over the last 24 to 30 months an excellent team in PayPal. We have no problem attracting top talent. Let me give it 3 or 4 recent examples. Clark joined us last year. She was a senior line management of Wachovia, Chief Operating Officer of Western Union and she's now running marketing and data analytics and PayPal. Rupert Keely, large parts of Visa and Asia with a the #2. He's now running PayPal and Asia. Don Kingsborough is by all accounts or many accounts the single best guy in the retail point-of-sale world having the Blackhawk Network. Zong, David Mark is one of the best digital mobile payments guys in the industry, big innovator. He's not running all mobile commerce and payments. And so I've spent a lot of time with this PayPal leadership team over the last few weeks. And I can tell you that they feel enormous ownership over the PayPal vision, that they develop and enormous commitment over the plan and they will not miss a beat. I feel better about that leadership team than at any time in our history. And so I think we have a strong defense there and I look forward to strong execution by the PayPal team."

To refresh your memory, Europe is the biggest cross-border trade quarter from Asia and the U.S. for our businesses. And as I indicated earlier, cross-border is a big chunk of PayPal's growth. Secondly, when European currency gets weaker, it does impact, all it does impact cross-border trade. And likewise, when European currencies get stronger, all else equal, you see an acceleration in growth for the PayPal and for the Marketplaces business to for that matter. So currencies does have an impact. All that being said, as we look forward to 2012 and 2013, the PayPal businesses are strong as it's ever been. We're getting a more expanded global footprint on merchant sites. We're getting an increase consumer share of checkout. We had new features and functionality online and we're expanding our served market offline. And implied in the guidance we gave was that we're more confident on the growth rate of PayPal as we think about '12 and '13 than we were simply a year ago.

And as I say, that's going to be available in 51 stores later this week. It's built into the existing hardware, 53 retailers. It's as fast or faster than swiping your card, doesn't require you to have your wallet or phone with you. By the way, for those who like to swipe, we'll have a PayPal card you could use.

The other thing is retailers looking for is growing globally, growing outside the U.S. And eBay is obviously almost 60% of our businesses outside the U.S. and so they can reach customers outside the U.S. without having to build assets. That's attractive. Interestingly, Macy's came in and Macy's saw that the euro -- the Australian dollar was very strong. The Australian consumers very open to import and they are looking for brands. And Macy's opened up a store in eBay Australia and so they're not reaching eBay but they're not reaching consumers in Australia on the eBay platform without having to have add assets in the rest of the country.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 and full year earnings call. We had a strong fourth quarter and a strong finish to an excellent year. We're delivering on our commitments and our vision of enabling commerce. Our 2011 results",1425,"Thanks, Jenny. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 and full year earnings call. We had a strong fourth quarter and a strong finish to an excellent year. We're delivering on our commitments and our vision of enabling commerce. Our 2011 results highlight the competitive portfolio of global commerce businesses that comprise our company today. eBay, PayPal, GSI and X.commerce are reinventing how people shop and pay. And we're positioning ourselves as an effective partner to retailers of all sizes. 
2011 marked an inflection point for shopping. Online and offline retail are rapidly blending into a seamless multichannel world. Consumers are driving this change and technology is enabling it. In this new retail world, our company has powerful global commerce platforms to deliver technology-driven innovation to retailers and consumers. 
We're leveraging shopping technologies, such as Milo, Where and RedLaser, with a strong leadership position in mobile commerce and payments, and we're innovating in social and local commerce. 
For consumers and retailers, we intend to make shopping more locally convenient and more globally accessible. This means enabling retailers of all sizes to reach consumers when, where and how those consumers want to shop. New retail at anytime, anywhere. And in this fluid environment, we will help retailers compete but we will never compete with them. 
At the beginning of last year, we laid out bold 3-year growth goals. Our strong performance in 2011 was a big down payment for these goals and we have increased confidence in our outlook. I will talk more about what this means for 2012 and 2013 in these remarks. 
Now let's take a look at our results for Q4. We had a strong close to the year. Q4 revenue grew 35% and non-GAAP EPS was up 17%. All of our businesses performed well. 
PayPal had another strong quarter, eBay had solid growth in its core markets and GSI had a great holiday season driving strong growth for its merchant clients. Both PayPal and eBay now have over 100 million active accounts and active users. And during this holiday season, both PayPal and eBay set new records during peak shopping periods. 
For example, on Cyber Monday, PayPal sold more than 10,000 transactions per minute during peak periods, a new record for us. We also had our biggest mobile holiday shopping season yet with consumer spending $180 per second through our eBay mobile apps. 
Let's take a look at the results for each business unit. PayPal is becoming an increasingly global business. Q4 marked the first time that more than half of PayPal's revenues came from outside the U.S. Consumers and merchants around the world are responding to the benefits PayPal offers, and this business has tremendous opportunity globally. 
In Merchant Services, TPV was up 29%. PayPal added more than 1 million new active users each month in Q4 ending the year with more than $106 million globally. And PayPal customers continue to steadily increase the number of times they use PayPal with Q4 transactions increasing 30% year-over-year. PayPal's TPV on eBay was up 16% for the quarter, as penetration on eBay accelerated more than 1 point from Q3 to over 74%. And PayPal's mobile payment business ended the year with strong momentum. For the year, our mobile payment volume hit $4 billion, more than 5x the volume of the year before. The number of PayPal customers regularly making a purchase through their mobile phone more than doubled during the second half of the year. And during the holiday season, mobile payment volume increased more than 500% on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Simply put, consumers are shopping more frequently via mobile and merchants who adopt PayPal Mobile Express Checkout are seeing significantly higher conversion. We expect PayPal's mobile growth to continue with mobile volume in 2012 estimated to hit $7 billion. 
Meanwhile, PayPal continues to generate excitement around our plans to extend PayPal to point-of-sale retail locations. We anticipate this will give consumers better shopping experiences and more flexible payment choices. And for retailers, we believe this will give them opportunities to not only engage consumers at checkout but also throughout their entire multichannel shopping experience. 
Since we opened it in November, over 100 retailers have visited PayPal's Shopping Showcase in New York where our new payment innovations are being demonstrated in retail-like environments. And in Q4, we began a limited in-store test with Home Depot, our first national retail partner. And later this week, we'll be launching a pilot to 51 Home Depot stores, primarily in the Bay Area. 
PayPal customers will be able to easily and quickly pay for purchases in these stores by either swiping their PayPal card or simply entering their mobile phone number and PIN. You can shop without your wallet, without your credit cards or even your mobile phone, just pay with PayPal. We're excited about our partnership with Home Depot, and we'll continue to be focused on delivering the best possible product experience for consumers and retailers as we expand with Home Depot and other national retailers later this year. 
Turning to Marketplaces. eBay had a solid quarter. Marketplaces revenue grew 16% with core GMV up 10% and marketing services up 24%. Let me talk a little more about GMV. 
Core GMV grew 10%, both in the U.S. and internationally. Fixed price, which now accounts for 64% of total GMV, grew 14% globally and 15% in e-commerce, in line -- or in the U.S., in line with e-commerce. Today, eBay offers consumers more inventory than ever with approximately 300 million listings available at any given time. The site is cleaner, easier and faster to shop than ever before and our most trusted sellers continue to win. 
In Q4, nearly half of all GMV on eBay in the U.S. came from top-rated sellers, a reflection of the trusted retail-like experience they're offering shoppers today. Same-store sales for top-rated sellers grew 19% in the quarter, outpacing e-commerce. And eBay sellers offered free shipping on more items this holiday season representing 43% of transactions, up 14 points over the prior year. 
eBay also continued its strong mobile commerce leadership, ending the year with $5 billion of mobile volume. That's more than double 2010. And in 2012, we expect eBay mobile volume to grow to $8 billion. Mobile can make any moment conveniently shoppable and consumers love having their favorite store, eBay, in their pocket. 
And mobile is driving more than just shopping on eBay. In 2011, eBay acquired more than 1 million new active users via mobile devices. And each week, eBay sellers are now uploading on average more than 1 million listings through our mobile apps with each listing taking an average of 60 seconds or less to complete. 
We also stepped up our marketing in Q4, and we're pleased with how our Buy It New, Buy It Now consumer campaign is beginning to change consumer perception of eBay in the U.S. Early feedback shows the campaign has been successful in helping to drive brand awareness and position eBay as the destination with a great selection of new merchandise at fixed prices. 
Turning to our new business unit. GSI had a great holiday season, driving a 26% increase in same-store sales for its merchants. And we're making great progress in the second half of last year in our integration efforts. We're capturing synergies across the portfolio and ended the year with 13 GSI merchants selling on eBay. 
In Q4, we also launched X.commerce. We're excited about the enthusiastic response to X.commerce and the potential for this open commerce ecosystem to drive innovation for merchants and third-party developers. Today, we already have 800,000 developers, merchants and users on the X.commerce platform. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our fourth quarter performance, our progress over the past 12 months and our progress in delivering against our 3-year growth outlook we announced last February. In a dynamic and rapidly changing environment, we are operating with discipline and clarity. We have a strong bench of management talent and we will not skip a beat as we manage the transition at PayPal. Across the company, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to execute. 
We are a different eBay today; technology-driven and customer-focused with a portfolio of commerce, platforms and products that engage consumers and benefit retailers. We're no longer just an e-commerce leader but a stronger, more diverse global commerce company shaping the future of shopping and payments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide more details on Q4 and the full year before we take questions."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Before I go to the results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to put some perspective on the full year. As John mentioned earlier, c",1952,"Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Before I go to the results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to put some perspective on the full year. 
As John mentioned earlier, commerce is at an inflection point. Technology-led innovation, driven by the wide adoption of eBay and other applications on smartphones and tablets, is changing the way people shop. Retail is becoming multichannel and merchants of all sizes must keep up with changing consumer behavior. They have been reaching out to us for help and we are responding. 
Today, eBay is focused on enabling global commerce by investing in new products and services that extend our capabilities and put us in a position to meet the evolving needs of both merchants and consumers. Simply put, this is the essence of our 3-year plan we outlined at Analyst Day earlier last year. And we've now completed the first year of our 3-year journey. 
Overall, the first year was an excellent one for eBay. We grew the company's top line 27%, delivered EPS growth of 17% and generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow. And our platforms enabled nearly $150 billion of commerce volume for our customers. 
First, with the guidance we gave you back in January of 2011, we are $1 billion larger and approximately $100 million better on net income with the balance sheet as strong as ever. We feel great about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal is adding merchants and consumers while investing in the next generation of payment capabilities. The Marketplaces' core business overall is healthy, and investments in new features and functionality continue to make the site even better. And GSI is focused on helping larger retailers succeed in a multichannel world. 
One year into our 3-year plan, we are ahead of our expectations and we are increasingly confident about the future. Now let's take a look at the results from the fourth quarter. 
Q4 was a great quarter for our company, and PayPal, Marketplaces and GSI all performed well. Revenue increased 35%, non-GAAP EPS grew 17% and operating margins accelerated across all 3 segments. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we closed the sale of our remaining investment in Skype for $2.3 billion, we completed 3 product-enhancing acquisitions and we repurchased approximately 8 million shares. We had a strong finish to a great year and we'll carry that momentum into 2012 and 2013. 
In Q4, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.4 billion, up 35%; organic revenue with 19%; and the inclusion of recently closed acquisitions increased our growth by approximately 16 points. 
Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.60, a 17% increase year-over-year. Solid top line growth drove our out-performance relative to guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.7%, down 80 basis points from Q4 2010. This was driven by operating leverage, offset by business mix and the impact of recently completed acquisitions. We generated strong free cash flow of $691 million in the fourth quarter with CapEx at roughly 9% of revenues. Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. 
PayPal posted another great quarter. Revenue growth was 28% and total payment volume increased to $33.4 billion, up 24%. We continue to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 33% and comprising 47% of overall TPV in the quarter. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. The number of payments grew 30%, a 1 point acceleration versus the third quarter. On eBay, TPV grew 16% on an FX neutral basis, driven by a 10% increase in GMV and a 4-point increase in PayPal penetration on eBay. 
Merchant Services TPV grew 29% on an FX neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion on PayPal merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of checkout. While growth was strong, we decelerated 4 points in the quarter. The deceleration was driven by softness in cross-border trade, particularly to Europe, and declines in average payment size from strong growth and low price categories as well as holiday discounting. Transaction margin was 64.8% in Q4, up 130 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense as a result of the Durbin amendment. PayPal's segment margin was 24.7% in the quarter, up 260 basis points from last year and at the highest level over the past 5 years. Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. 
Bill Me Later's TPV was up 44%, driven by a continued strong penetration on and off eBay. BML penetration in the U.S. on eBay and in the PayPal wallet has increased in the past year to more than 1.6% in the fourth quarter. This penetration reduces our funding cost as consumers shift away from credit cards to Bill Me Later. Risk-adjusted margins in the quarter was 16.9%, up 250 basis points over last year. Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. 
Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 17% on an FX neutral basis. This was driven by a transaction revenue growth of 15% and marketing services revenue growth of 24% from our adjacent format. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Sold items grew 11%, approximately a 2-point acceleration from Q3, driven by growth in the U.K., China and the U.S. U.S. GMV grew 10%, driven by a strong active user growth in category sales in fashion and parts and accessories. 
While growth was solid, GMV decelerated 4 points as exports to Europe slowed and ASPs declined, primarily driven by gold prices on the platform.  From a format perspective, U.S. fixed price growth was strong at 15% while auctions grew 2%. International FX neutral GMV grew 10%, driven by acceleration in APAC, strong and stable performance in the U.K. and continued sluggish growth in Germany. Marketplaces segment margin was 40.6% in the quarter, up 140 basis points from operating leverage. Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. 
GSI had a great quarter. Revenue was $364 million, up 11%, which was driven by a strong volume growth, partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Adjusting for the impact of the continued shift of clients to the service fee model, year-over-year growth would have been 15%. Global e-commerce merchandise sales or GMS grew 26% on a same-store sales basis, which was driven by a strong performance in toys and health and beauty verticals. And GSI Marketing Services, which is primarily demand-generation activities, accounted for nearly 20% of GSI revenue and was up 35% in the quarter. 
A quick update on the unit -- on the GSI integration. GSI's profitability is improving, as we capitalize on the synergies we laid out earlier last year. The number of GSI merchants selling on the eBay platform is now 13, and we have added 8 new merchants to the eBay platform since the acquisition. And we are increasing PayPal's ubiquity with 89% coverage of GSI volume and 13% share of checkout. We are 6 months post the acquisition of GSI, and we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead. 
Turning to operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, there were 42% of revenue, slightly lower on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by the impact of GSI as well as improved productivity from operational excellence initiatives offset by investments in product and the customer experience. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we generated strong free cash flow of $2.3 billion in 2011, including almost $700 million in the fourth quarter. We've improved our financial flexibility by funding approximately 50% of the U.S. Bill Me Later loan receivables portfolio with our offshore cash. 
During the year, we invested approximately $3.4 billion to strengthen our portfolio with 3 acquisitions closing in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased 33.6 million shares for a total of 1.1 billion. We ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $7.5 billion, including approximately $1 billion in the U.S. Now let me turn to guidance. 
From a macro perspective, we are assuming a relatively stable outlook for the global economy, current foreign exchange rates and a continued low interest rate environment. While we remain anxious about the European economy and the impact of weaker European currencies on our cross-border volume, we are bullish about growth prospects for web-enabled commerce overall and e-commerce, in particular. 
From an operating perspective, we expect continued strong performance in PayPal, solid performance in Marketplaces with continued investment and platform in new products, strong performance at GSI driven by top line growth and synergy realization and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the 18.5% to 19.5% range for the year. For the full year 2012, we expect revenue of $13.7 billion to $14 billion, representing growth of 18% to 20%. 
We anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30, representing growth of 11% to 13%. Our non-GAAP EPS growth of 12% is driven by several factors. First, we are expecting strong operating earnings growth of approximately 15% with improving segment margins at PayPal and GSI and stable margins at Marketplaces. Second, we've made several acquisitions in 2011 that we expect to contribute 4 points to the top line and 1 point of growth to earnings. Third, the strong U.S. dollar will negatively impact top and bottom line by approximately 3 points. Lastly, the low interest rate environment and the loss of our 30% portion of Skype's income will negatively impact our EPS growth by approximately 1 point. 
In summary, strong top and bottom line growth will be tempered by a stronger dollar and a weak interest rate environment. For the first quarter, we expect revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, representing growth of 20% to 24%. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.51, representing growth of 7% to 9%. EPS will grow slower in the first quarter than the full year due to a more seasonal business magnified by the addition of GSI and higher investments in the first half of the year. 
Let me take a minute and go back to our Analyst Day of a year ago. You may recognize Slide 19 from the Analyst Day deck where we initially laid out our expectations for 2013. I've updated this outlook to reflect our current view. 
First, we had strong momentum coming out of 2011. And secondly, we're expecting continued momentum in 2012 with a more diversified portfolio and a stronger set of assets. This has given us the confidence to raise the midpoint of our 2013 revenue guidance by approximately $550 million. Additionally, we are also increasing PayPal's segment margin by 1 point to 25% to 26%. 
As a result of the strong top line growth and improved PayPal margins, we are raising the midpoint of our 3-year non-GAAP EPS CAGR by 1 point to 14% to 16%. 
So in summary, we had a strong close to a great year and are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead in the external environment. We exceeded the commitments we laid out for you at the beginning of the year. PayPal continues its strong growth, core eBay is healthy and getting stronger and the GSI integration is going well. 
We are executing our strategies with a sharp focus on operational excellence that's enabling us to deliver on our commitments while reinvesting in commerce innovation and the customer experience. We allocated our capital with discipline, closing 13 acquisitions, repurchasing 34 million shares and selling our remaining minority stake in Skype. And finally, we are more confident in our 3-year operating plan and are increasing the midpoint of our 2013 numbers. 
And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

And secondly, we're beginning to get the benefits of the operating leverage without constraining investments in new products and capabilities. So those are the 2 primary drivers. In terms of sustainability, implied in our guidance, both for '12 and 2013, is PayPal's margins will continue to expand; Marketplaces margins will continue to stay relatively stable, consistent with the 38% to 42% range that we provided at the beginning of last year; and our expectations at GSI margins will continue to grow as well with leverage on existing infrastructure, a better mix with its fast-growing marketing services and the synergies that we're able to generate with GSI's part of the eBay portfolio."

That's not going to happen overnight. I am pleased that we added more new users in the fourth quarter to eBay than we've done in several years in that 6% growth, but we're just getting started. I'm sitting next to Devin Wenig, who's the new President of Marketplace division. He's made adding new users, one of its key tenets, both in our existing markets and in new markets.

And I'm not sure there's anything -- any of our metrics change business unit by business unit. But here's what I'm focusing on, which is, are we helping our customers win? So for instance, we know that when PayPal merchants at PayPal Express Checkout or increasingly add Paypal Mobile Express Checkout, they grow faster than their competition, they grow faster than the market. So we got a capability that's helping them compete and win in this new environment. I'm thrilled to see the GSI in the fourth quarter. GSI clients grew 26% same-store sales. So GSI clients grew more than 50% faster than the market. So our technology of GSI technology capabilities and services are helping its clients win. On eBay, I feel -- just particularly in the fourth quarter around top-rated sellers because the fourth quarter is a heavy fixed price. It's kind of a gift-giving quarter, right? And consumers want to be able to get a gift off and a new item in a fixed price format, and our top-rated sellers grew 19% in the fourth quarter. So if you hear me talking about our senior leadership team, I'm talking about, are we helping our customers and clients win as their technology partner across all of our assets? With respect to adding new -- the marketing campaign and adding new users and what the -- I think you're sort of asking what's the cycle of usage for the new users. To be honest, it's too early to tell. We are -- as you said correctly, our existing users have carried a lot of a turnaround, that they've increased their frequency per user, their purchase per user, so we know they're happy with our site. Our customer loyalty is up. Our NPS is up. And now to bring new users into the site, we're trying to ensure that we get them to make that first transaction, then a second and a third. And as we learn with them and as we try to market to them and drive that cycle, we'll let you know.

I'd say a couple of quick things. One, you're correct. It doesn't include point-of-sale, and the part of mobile payments that I think is very interesting is, as merchants and retailers are adding PayPal Mobile Express Checkout to their application or to their HTML 5 site or even to a core website that gets pulled up into a mobile device, conversion is increasing because we know consumers don't like to enter in their credit card information to a phone. And they see that PayPal Express Checkout button on a phone, and we're getting a higher share of checkout and higher conversion for those retailers and they're noticing. And that's what's involved in the $7 billion. Point-of-sale, the real goal for point-of-sale, I like in this back to what we've done in Merchant Services where last year was the year of planning and beginning to build the product, this year is a year of learning and adjusting and next year is the year of scaling. And so this year, I look to us to get a product rolled out to retailers, to get early consumer adoption and to get a product that can be rolled out to every vertical around the world so that we can build another business at point-of-sale like being built in the Merchant Services environment."

On your second question, just cross-border trade, again, just to remind you, the cross-border is a significant component of both the Marketplaces and the PayPal business, representing almost 20% of Marketplaces and approximately 25% of PayPal. So we continue to get better and better about managing cross-border; and our community of users, both buyers and sellers, leverage our platforms to access to take their goods into global developed economies so it's a significant portion of our business. That being said, there are still opportunities for us to get better and better about enabling the great deals from weaker currency markets for access to consumers from stronger currency markets. And that -- and I'd characterize, while we've made a progress, that still is an opportunity for us to get better and better, and we'll be working on that in both of the businesses in 2012."

And so earlier this year, we changed our pricing in the U.S. in a way that would take rate neutral but incented sellers to be very transparent about pricing and shipping costs and wherever possible to offer free shipping. And the results are clear. As I said earlier, that the number of items that are on free shipping on the eBay business in the U.S. was up significantly over the year, which is meeting those consumer needs. I know there's been lots of questions about what was the impact of that on your financials.

Secondly, operating margins will be lower in the first quarter versus the full year, and it's primarily driven by 2 things. First, GSI, a much more seasonal business, lower volume and, therefore, lower margins in the first quarter. And it wasn't part of the portfolio on last year so that will have an impact. Secondly, we will be increasing our investments earlier in the year this year to ensure that additional feature and functionality across all 3 platforms is ready before we go into the holiday season. So that's what's resulting in earnings growth, the gap between earnings growth and top line growth in the first quarter. That being said, again, I'll go back to kind of segment margins on a year-over-year basis. And what you can expect to see is PayPal continuing to improve, GSI continuing to improve and Marketplaces remaining relatively stable within that 32% to 42% range we gave you. We will be a more seasonal business than we have been historically with the addition of GSI. Just lastly, no dramatic change in tax rate on a year-over-year basis."

If you look at that leadership team, we have attracted -- first of all, you step back, over the last 3 years, I've replaced 75 of the top 100 people in this company. We have rebuilt the leadership teams across all of our businesses, including PayPal. And we have attracted over the last 24 to 30 months a excellent team at PayPal. We have no problem attracting top talent. Let me give you 3 or 4 recent examples. Ranjana Clark joined us last year. She was a Senior Line Manager at Wachovia, Chief Operating Officer at Western Union. She's now running Marketing and Data Analytics at PayPal. Rupert Keeley builds large parts of Visa and Asia, was the #2 guy of Asia. He's now running PayPal and Asia. Don Kingsborough is by all accounts or in many accounts the single best guy in the retail point-of-sale world having built the Blackhawk Network. We bought Zong. David Marcus is one of the best digital Mobile Payments guys in the industry, big innovator. He's now running all mobile commerce and payments. And so I've spent a lot of time with this PayPal leadership team over the last 2 weeks. And I can tell you that they feel enormous ownership over the PayPal vision, that they -- and they developed enormous commitment over the plans and they will not miss a beat. I feel better about that leadership team than at any time in our history. And so I think we have a strong defense there, and I look forward to strong execution by the PayPal team."

To refresh your memory, Europe is the biggest cross-border trade quarter from Asia and the U.S. for our business. And as I indicated earlier, cross-border is a big chunk of PayPal's growth. Secondly, when European currency gets weaker, it does impact, all else equal, it does impact cross-border trade. And likewise, when European currencies get stronger, all else equal, you see an acceleration in growth for the PayPal and for the Marketplace business for that matter. So currencies does have an impact. All that being said, as we look forward to 2012 and 2013, the PayPal businesses are strong as it's ever been. We're getting a more expanded global footprint on merchant sites, we're getting increased consumer share of checkout, we add new features and functionality online and we're expanding our served market offline. And implied in the guidance we gave was that we're more confident on the growth rate of PayPal as we think about '12 and '13 than we were simply a year ago. So we -- currencies are going to move and it will impact the flow of goods for us, but the business is as healthy or healthier than it's ever been.

E-mail to my e-mail account, texted to my mobile phone and I walked out. So it was a beautiful experience. And as I say, that's going to be available in 51 stores later this week. It's built into the existing hardware at these retailers. It's as fast or faster than swiping your card, doesn't require you to have your wallet or phone with you. By the way, for those that like to swipe, we'll have a PayPal card you can use. And so I'm very excited about this. I think, as I said, it's going to be a learning year.

And so whether it's retailers like Neiman Marcus, it's brands that are looking at it. And so far, as Bob said earlier, we're in the learning. The other thing these retailers are looking for is growing globally, growing outside the U.S. And eBay is obviously almost 60% of our businesses outside the U.S. And so if they can reach customers outside the U.S. without having to build assets, that's attractive. Interestingly, Macy's came and Macy's saw that the euro -- the Australian dollar was very strong. The Australian consumers are very open to import and they're looking for brands. And Macy's opened up a store in eBay Australia. And so they're not reaching eBay, but they're not reaching consumers in Australia on the eBay platform without having to have add assets resident in the country. So that's the kind of opportunity, a need these retailers have. And we're working hard to try to find ways to use the eBay platform to meet those needs, help them grow their business better."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 and full year earnings call. We had a strong fourth quarter and a strong finish to an excellent year. We're delivering on our commitments and our vision of enabling commerce. Our 2011 results",1424,"Thanks, Jenny. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 and full year earnings call. We had a strong fourth quarter and a strong finish to an excellent year. We're delivering on our commitments and our vision of enabling commerce. Our 2011 results highlight the competitive portfolio of global commerce businesses that comprise our company today. eBay, PayPal, GSI and X.commerce are reinventing how people shop and pay. And we're positioning ourselves as an effective partner to retailers of all sizes.  
2011 marked an inflection point for shopping. Online and offline retail are rapidly blending into a seamless multichannel world. Consumers are driving this change and technology is enabling it. In this new retail world, our company has powerful global commerce platforms to deliver technology-driven innovation to retailers and consumers. We're leveraging shopping technologies, such as Milo, Where and RedLaser, with a strong leadership position in mobile commerce and payments, and we're innovating in social and local commerce. 
For consumers and retailers, we intend to make shopping more locally convenient and more globally accessible. This means enabling retailers of all sizes to reach consumers when, where and how those consumers want to shop. New retail is anytime, anywhere. And in this fluid environment, we will help retailers compete, but we will never compete with them. 
At the beginning of last year, we laid out bold 3-year growth goals. Our strong performance in 2011 was a big down payment toward these goals. And we have increased confidence in our outlook. I will talk more about what this means for 2012 and 2013 in these remarks. 
Now let's take a look at our results for Q4. We had a strong close to the year. Q4 revenue grew 35% and non-GAAP EPS was up 17%. All of our businesses performed well. PayPal had another strong quarter, eBay had solid growth in its core markets and GSI had a great holiday season driving strong growth for its merchant clients. Both PayPal and eBay now have over 100 million active accounts and active users. And during this holiday season, both PayPal and eBay set new records during peak shopping periods. 
For example, on Cyber Monday, PayPal saw more than 10,000 transactions per minute during peak periods, a new record for us. We also had our biggest mobile holiday shopping season yet, with consumer spending $180 per second through our eBay mobile apps. 
Let's take a look at the results for each business unit. PayPal is becoming an increasingly global business. Q4 marked the first time that more than half of PayPal's revenues came from outside the U.S. Consumers and merchants around the world are responding to the benefits PayPal offers, and this business has tremendous opportunity globally. 
In Merchant Services, TPV was up 29%. PayPal added more than 1 million new active users each month in Q4, ending the year with more than $106 million globally. And PayPal customers continue to steadily increase the number of times they use PayPal, with Q4 transactions increasing 30% year-over-year. PayPal's TPV on eBay was up 16% for the quarter, as penetration on eBay accelerated more than 1 point from Q3 to over 74%. And PayPal's mobile payments business ended the year with strong momentum. 
For the year, our mobile payment volume hit $4 billion, more than 5x the volume of the year before. The number of PayPal customers regularly making a purchase through their mobile phone more than doubled during the second half of the year. And during the holiday season, mobile payment volume increased more than 500% on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Simply put, consumers are shopping more frequently via mobile and merchants who adopt PayPal Mobile Express Checkout are seeing significantly higher conversion. We expect PayPal's mobile growth to continue with mobile volume in 2012 estimated to hit $7 billion. 
Meanwhile, PayPal continues to generate excitement around our plans to extend PayPal to point-of-sale retail locations. We anticipate this will give consumers better shopping experiences and more flexible payment choices. And for retailers, we believe this will give them opportunities to not only engage consumers at checkout, but also throughout their entire multichannel shopping experience. 
Since we opened it in November, over 100 retailers have visited PayPal's Shopping Showcase in New York, where our new payment innovations are being demonstrated in retail-like environments. And in Q4, we began a limited in-store test with Home Depot, our first national retail partner. And later this week, we'll be launching a pilot to 51 Home Depot stores, primarily in the Bay Area. 
PayPal customers will be able to easily and quickly pay for purchases in these stores, by either swiping their PayPal card, or simply entering their mobile phone number and PIN. You can shop without your wallet, without your credit cards or even your mobile phone, just pay with PayPal. We're excited about our partnership with Home Depot, and we'll continue to be focused on delivering the best possible product experience for consumers and retailers as we expand with Home Depot and other national retailers later this year. 
Turning to Marketplaces. eBay had a solid quarter. Marketplaces revenue grew 16%, with core GMV up 10% and marketing services up 24%. Let me talk a little more about GMV. 
Core GMV grew 10%, both in the U.S. and internationally. Fixed price, which now accounts for 64% of total GMV, grew 14% globally and 15% in e-commerce, in line -- or in the U.S., in line with e-commerce. Today, eBay offers consumers more inventory than ever with approximately 300 million listings available at any given time. The site is cleaner, easier and faster to shop than ever before. And our most trusted sellers continue to win. 
In Q4, nearly half of all GMV on eBay in the U.S. came from top-rated sellers, a reflection of the trusted retail-like experience they're offering shoppers today. Same-store sales for top-rated sellers grew 19% in the quarter, outpacing e-commerce. And eBay sellers offered free shipping on more items this holiday season, representing 43% of transactions, up 14 points over the prior year. 
eBay also continued its strong mobile commerce leadership, ending the year with $5 billion of mobile volume. That's more than double 2010. And in 2012, we expect eBay mobile volume to grow to $8 billion. Mobile can make any moment conveniently shoppable and consumers love having their favorite store, eBay, in their pocket. 
And mobile is driving more than just shopping on eBay. In 2011, eBay acquired more than 1 million new active users via mobile devices. And each week, eBay sellers are now uploading on average more than 1 million listings through our mobile apps with each listing taking an average of 60 seconds or less to complete. 
We also stepped up our marketing in Q4, and we're pleased with how our Buy It New, Buy It Now consumer campaign is beginning to change consumer perception of eBay in the U.S. Early feedback shows the campaign’s been successful in helping to drive brand awareness and position eBay as the destination with a great selection of new merchandise at fixed prices. 
Turning to our new business unit. GSI had a great holiday season, driving a 26% increase in same-store sales for its merchants. And we're making great progress in the second half of last year in our integration efforts. We're capturing synergies across the portfolio and ended the year with 13 GSI merchants selling on eBay. 
In Q4, we also launched X.commerce. We're excited about the enthusiastic response to X.commerce and the potential for this open commerce ecosystem to drive innovation for merchants and third-party developers. Today, we already have 800,000 developers, merchants and users on the X.commerce platform. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our fourth quarter performance, our progress over the past 12 months and our progress in delivering against our 3-year growth outlook we announced last February. In a dynamic and rapidly changing environment, we are operating with discipline and clarity. We have a strong bench of management talent and we will not skip a beat as we manage the transition at PayPal. Across the company, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to execute. 
We are a different eBay today; technology-driven and customer-focused, with a portfolio of commerce, platforms and products that engage consumers and benefit retailers. We're no longer just an e-commerce leader but a stronger, more diverse global commerce company shaping the future of shopping and payments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide more details on Q4 and the full year before we take questions."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Before I go to the results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to put some perspective on the full year. As John mentioned earlier, c",1955,"Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Before I go to the results for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to put some perspective on the full year. 
As John mentioned earlier, commerce is at an inflection point. Technology-led innovation, driven by the wide adoption of eBay and other applications on smartphones and tablets, is changing the way people shop. Retail is becoming multichannel and merchants of all sizes must keep up with changing consumer behavior. They have been reaching out to us for help and we are responding. 
Today, eBay is focused on enabling global commerce by investing in new products and services that extend our capabilities and put us in a position to meet the evolving needs of both merchants and consumers. Simply put, this is the essence of our 3-year plan we outlined at Analyst Day earlier last year. And we've now completed the first year of our 3-year journey. 
Overall, the first year was an excellent one for eBay. We grew the company's top line 27%, delivered EPS growth of 17% and generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow. And our platforms enabled nearly $150 billion of commerce volume for our customers. 
First, is the guidance we gave you back in January of 2011. We are $1 billion larger and approximately $100 million better on net income with a balance sheet as strong as ever. We feel great about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal is adding merchants and consumers while investing in the next generation of payment capabilities. The Marketplaces' core business overall is healthy, and investments in new features and functionality continue to make the site even better. And GSI is focused on helping larger retailers succeed in a multichannel world. 
One year into our 3-year plan, we are ahead of our expectations and we are increasingly confident about the future. Now let's take a look at the results from the fourth quarter. 
Q4 was a great quarter for our company, and PayPal, Marketplaces and GSI all performed well. Revenue increased 35%, non-GAAP EPS grew 17% and operating margins accelerated across all 3 segments. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we closed the sale of our remaining investment in Skype for $2.3 billion, we completed 3 product-enhancing acquisitions and we repurchased approximately 8 million shares. We had a strong finish to a great year and we'll carry that momentum into 2012 and 2013. 
In Q4, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.4 billion, up 35%; organic revenue growth was 19%; and the inclusion of recently closed acquisitions increased our growth by approximately 16 points. 
Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.60, a 17% increase year-over-year. Solid top line growth drove our out-performance relative to guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.7%, down 80 basis points from Q4 2010. This was driven by operating leverage, offset by business mix and the impact of recently completed acquisitions. We generated strong free cash flow of $691 million in the fourth quarter with CapEx at roughly 9% of revenues. Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. 
PayPal posted another great quarter. Revenue growth was 28% and total payment volume increased to $33.4 billion, up 24%. We continue to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 33% and comprising 47% of overall TPV in the quarter. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. The number of payments grew 30%, a 1 point acceleration versus the third quarter. On eBay, TPV grew 16% on an FX neutral basis, driven by a 10% increase in GMV and a 4-point increase in PayPal penetration on eBay. 
Merchant Services TPV grew 29% on an FX neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion on PayPal merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of checkout. While growth was strong, we decelerated 4 points in the quarter. The deceleration was driven by softness in cross-border trade, particularly to Europe, and declines in average payment size from strong growth and low priced categories as well as holiday discounting. Transaction margin was 64.8% in Q4, up 130 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense as a result of the Durbin amendment. PayPal's segment margin was 24.7% in the quarter, up 260 basis points from last year and at the highest level over the past 5 years. Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. 
Bill Me Later's TPV was up 44%, driven by a continued strong penetration on and off eBay. BML penetration in the U.S., on eBay and in the PayPal wallet, has increased in the past year to more than 1.6% in the fourth quarter. This penetration reduces our funding cost as consumers shift away from credit cards to Bill Me Later. Risk-adjusted margins in the quarter were at 16.9%, up 250 basis points over last year. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 17% on an FX neutral basis. This was driven by a transaction revenue growth of 15% and marketing services revenue growth of 24% from our adjacent format. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Sold items grew 11%, approximately a 2-point acceleration from Q3, driven by growth in the U.K., China and the U.S. U.S. GMV grew 10%, driven by a strong active user growth in category sales in fashion and parts and accessories. 
While growth was solid, GMV decelerated 4 points as exports to Europe slowed and ASPs declined, primarily driven by gold prices on the platform. From a format perspective, U.S. fixed price growth was strong at 15% while auctions grew at 2%. International FX neutral GMV grew 10%, driven by acceleration in APAC, strong and stable performance in the U.K. and continued sluggish growth in Germany. Marketplaces segment margin was 40.6% in the quarter, up 140 basis points from operating leverage. 
Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. GSI had a great quarter. Revenue was $364 million, up 11%, which was driven by a strong volume growth, partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Adjusting for the impact of the continued shift of clients to the service fee model, year-over-year growth would have been 15%. Global e-commerce merchandise sales, or GMS. grew 26% on a same-store sales basis, which was driven by a strong performance in toys and health and beauty verticals. And GSI Marketing Services, which is primarily demand-generation activities, accounted for nearly 20% of GSI revenue and was up 35% in the quarter. 
A quick update on the unit -- on the GSI integration. GSI's profitability is improving, as we capitalize on the synergies we laid out earlier last year. The number of GSI merchants selling on the eBay platform is now 13, and we have added 8 new merchants to the eBay platform since the acquisition. And we are increasing PayPal's ubiquity with 89% coverage of GSI volume and 13% share of checkout. We are 6 months post the acquisition of GSI, and we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead. 
Turning to operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, they were 42% of revenue, slightly lower on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by the impact of GSI, as well as improved productivity from operational excellence initiatives offset by investments in product and the customer experience. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we generated strong free cash flow of $2.3 billion in 2011, including almost $700 million in the fourth quarter. We've improved our financial flexibility by funding approximately 50% of the U.S. Bill Me Later loan receivables portfolio with our offshore cash. 
During the year, we invested approximately $3.4 billion to strengthen our portfolio with 3 acquisitions closing in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased 33.6 million shares. for a total of 1.1 billion. We ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $7.5 billion, including approximately $1 billion in the U.S. Now let me turn to guidance. 
From a macro perspective, we are assuming a relatively stable outlook for the global economy, current foreign exchange rates and a continued low interest rate environment. While we remain anxious about the European economy and the impact of weaker European currencies on our cross-border volume, we are bullish about growth prospects for web-enabled commerce overall and e-commerce, in particular. 
From an operating perspective, we expect continued strong performance in PayPal, solid performance in Marketplaces with continued investment and platform in new products, strong performance at GSI driven by top line growth and synergy realization and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the 18.5% to 19.5% range for the year. For the full year 2012, we expect revenue of $13.7 billion to $14 billion, representing growth of 18% to 20%. 
We anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30, representing growth of 11% to 13%. Our non-GAAP EPS growth of 12% is driven by several factors. First, we are expecting strong operating earnings growth of approximately 15% with improving segment margins at PayPal and GSI and stable margins at Marketplaces. Second, we've made several acquisitions in 2011 that we expect to contribute 4 points to the top line and 1 point of growth to earnings. Third, the strong U.S. dollar will negatively impact top and bottom line by approximately 3 points. Lastly, the low interest rate environment and the loss of our 30% portion of Skype's income will negatively impact our EPS growth by approximately 1 point. 
In summary, strong top and bottom line growth will be tempered by a stronger dollar and a weak interest rate environment. For the first quarter, we expect revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, representing growth of 20% to 24%. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.51, representing growth of 7% to 9%. EPS will grow slower in the first quarter than the full year due to a more seasonal business magnified by the addition of GSI and higher investments in the first half of the year. 
Let me take a minute and go back to our Analyst Day of a year ago. You may recognize Slide 19 from the Analyst Day deck where we initially laid out our expectations for 2013. I've updated this outlook to reflect our current view. 
First, we had strong momentum coming out of 2011. And secondly, we're expecting continued momentum in 2012, with a more diversified portfolio and a stronger set of assets. This has given us the confidence to raise the midpoint of our 2013 revenue guidance by approximately $550 million. Additionally, we are also increasing PayPal's segment margin by 1 point to 25% to 26%. 
As a result of the strong top line growth and improved PayPal margins, we are raising the midpoint of our 3-year non-GAAP EPS CAGR by 1 point to 14% to 16%. 
So in summary, we had a strong close to a great year and are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead in the external environment. We exceeded the commitments we laid out for you at the beginning of the year. PayPal continues its strong growth, core eBay is healthy and getting stronger and the GSI integration is going well. 
We are executing our strategies with a sharp focus on operational excellence that's enabling us to deliver on our commitments while reinvesting in commerce innovation and the customer experience. We allocated our capital with discipline, closing 13 acquisitions, repurchasing 34 million shares and selling our remaining minority stake in Skype. And finally, we are more confident in our 3-year operating plan and are increasing the midpoint of our 2013 numbers. 
And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

And it's 2 fundamental things. One, transaction margins continue to improve and stay well above that 60% level that we laid out 3 years ago. And secondly, we're beginning to get the benefits of operating leverage without constraining investments in new products and capabilities. So those are the 2 primary drivers. In terms of sustainability implied in our guidance, both for '12 and 2013, is: PayPal's margins will continue to expand; Marketplaces margins will continue to stay relatively stable, consistent with the 38% to 42% range that we provided at the beginning of last year; and our expectations at GSI margins will continue to grow as well, with leverage on existing infrastructure, a better mix with its fast-growing marketing services and the synergies that we're able to generate with GSI's part of the eBay portfolio."

That's not going to happen overnight. I am pleased that we added more new users in the fourth quarter to eBay than we've done in several years in that 6% growth, but we're just getting started. I'm sitting next to Devin Wenig, who's the new President of Marketplace division. He's made adding new users, one of his key tenets, both in our existing markets and in new markets.

And I'm not sure there's anything -- any of our metrics change business unit by business unit. But here's what I'm focusing on, which is, are we helping our customers win? So for instance, we know that when PayPal merchants add PayPal Express Checkout or increasingly add Paypal Mobile Express Checkout, they grow faster than their competition, they grow faster than the market. So we got a capability that's helping them compete and win in this new environment. I'm thrilled to see the GSI in the fourth quarter. GSI clients grew 26% same-store sales. So GSI clients grew more than 50% faster than the market. So our technology -- GSI technology capabilities and services are helping its clients win. On eBay, I feel -- just particularly in the fourth quarter around top-rated sellers because the fourth quarter is a heavy fixed price, it's kind of a gift-giving quarter, right? And consumers want to be able to get a gift off and a new item in a fixed price format, and our top-rated sellers grew 19% in the fourth quarter. So if you hear me talking about our senior leadership team, I'm talking about, are we helping our customers and clients win as their technology partner across all of our assets? With respect to adding new -- the marketing campaign and adding new users and what the -- I think you're sort of asking what's the cycle of usage for the new users. To be honest, it's too early to tell. We are -- as you said correctly, our existing users have carried a lot of a turnaround, that they've increased their frequency per user, their purchase per user, so we know they're happy with our site. Our customer loyalty is up. Our NPS is up. And now to bring new users into the site, we're trying to ensure that we get them to make that first transaction, then a second and a third. And as we learn with them, and as we try to market to them and drive that cycle, we'll let you know. But I will be lying to you if I can tell you we understood the class curves, as what we call them, for the new sets of users and -- but we have a focus on adding new users, and we're increasingly confident in our ability to grow their share of wallet on eBay."

I'd say a couple of quick things. One, you're correct. It doesn't include point-of-sale. And the part of mobile payments that I think is very interesting is, as merchants and retailers are adding PayPal Mobile Express Checkout to their application or to their HTML 5 site, or even to a core website that gets pulled up into a mobile device,. Conversion is increasing because we know consumers don't like to enter in their credit card information to a phone. And they see that PayPal Express Checkout button on a phone, and we're getting higher share of checkout and higher conversion for those retailers, and they're noticing. And that's what's involved in the $7 billion. Point-of-sale, the real goal for point-of-sale, I liken this back to what we've done in Merchant Services, where last year was the year of planning and beginning to build the product, this year is a year of learning and adjusting and next year is the year of scaling. And so this year, I look to us to get a product rolled out to retailers, to get early consumer adoption and to get a product that can be rolled out to every vertical around the world, so that we can build another business at point-of-sale like being built in the Merchant Services environment."

So it's not a -- we're still going to wait and see in terms of what that could mean for the overall business. It's not a big part of the $6.5 billion to $7 billion business in 2013. On your second question, just cross-border trade, again, just to remind you, the cross-border is a significant component of both the Marketplaces and the PayPal business, representing almost 20% of Marketplaces and approximately 25% of PayPal. So we continue to get better and better about managing cross-border and our community of users, both buyers and sellers, leverage our platforms to access -- to take their goods into global developed economies so it's a significant portion of our business. That being said, there is still opportunities for us to get better and better about enabling the great deals from weaker currency markets for access to consumers from stronger currency markets. And that -- and I'd characterize, while we've made a progress, that still is an opportunity for us to get better and better, and we'll be working on that in both of the businesses in 2012."

And so earlier this year, we changed our pricing in the U.S. in a way that would take rate neutral but incented sellers to be very transparent about pricing and shipping costs and wherever possible to offer free shipping. And the results are clear. As I said earlier, that the number of items that have free shipping on the eBay business in the U.S. was up significantly over the year, which is meeting those consumer needs. I know there's been lots of questions about what was the impact of that on your financials.

Secondly, operating margins will be lower in the first quarter versus the full year, and it's primarily driven by 2 things. First, GSI, a much more seasonal business, lower volume and, therefore, lower margins in the first quarter. And it wasn't part of the portfolio on last year, so that will have an impact. Secondly, we will be increasing our investments earlier in the year this year, to ensure that additional feature and functionality across all 3 platforms is ready before we go into the holiday season. So that's what's resulting in earnings growth, the gap between earnings growth and top line growth in the first quarter. That being said, again, I'll go back to kind of segment margins on a year-over-year basis. And what you can expect to see is PayPal continuing to improve, GSI continuing to improve and Marketplaces remaining relatively stable within that 32% to 42% range we gave you. We will be a more seasonal business than we have been historically with the addition of GSI. Just lastly, no dramatic change in tax rate on a year-over-year basis."

If you look at that leadership team, we have attracted -- first of all, you step back, over the last 3 years, I've replaced 75 of the top 100 people in this company. We have rebuilt the leadership teams across all of our businesses, including PayPal. And we have attracted over the last 24 to 30 months a excellent team at PayPal. We have no problem attracting top talent. Let me give you 3 or 4 recent examples. Ranjana Clark joined us last year. She was a Senior Line Manager at Wachovia, Chief Operating Officer at Western Union. She's now running Marketing and Data Analytics at PayPal. Rupert Keeley built large parts of Visa in Asia, was the #2 guy of Asia. He's now running PayPal in Asia. Don Kingsborough is by all accounts, or in many accounts, the single best guy in the retail point-of-sale world having built the Blackhawk Network. We bought Zong. David Marcus is one of the best digital Mobile Payments guys in the industry, big innovator. He's now running all mobile commerce and payments. And so I've spent a lot of time with this PayPal leadership team over the last 2 weeks. And I can tell you that they feel enormous ownership over the PayPal vision, that they -- and they developed enormous commitment over the plans and they will not miss a beat. I feel better about that leadership team than at any time in our history. And so I think we have a strong defense there, and I look forward to strong execution by the PayPal team."

To refresh your memory, Europe is the biggest cross-border trade quarter from Asia and the U.S. for our business. And as I indicated earlier, cross-border is a big chunk of PayPal's growth. Secondly, when European currency gets weaker, it does impact, all else equal, it does impact cross-border trade. And likewise, when European currencies get stronger, all else equal, you see an acceleration in growth for the PayPal and for the Marketplace business, for that matter. So currencies does have an impact. All that being said, as we look forward to 2012 and 2013, the PayPal businesses are as strong as it's ever been. We're getting a more expanded global footprint on merchant sites, we're getting increased consumer share of checkout, we adding new features and functionality online and we're expanding our served market offline. And implied in the guidance we gave was that we're more confident on the growth rate of PayPal as we think about '12 and '13 than we were simply a year ago.

The other thing these retailers are looking for is growing globally, growing outside the U.S. And eBay is obviously -- almost 60% of our businesses outside the U.S. And so if they can reach customers outside the U.S. without having to build assets, that's attractive. Interestingly, Macy's came and Macy's saw that the euro -- the Australian dollar was very strong. The Australian consumers are very open to import and they're looking for brands. And Macy's opened up a store in eBay Australia.

We had a strong first quarter and an excellent start to the year driven by strong performance across eBay, PayPal and GSI. Our portfolio is enabling commerce around the world and we're excited about our future. We're building a set of capabilities that is reshaping how people shop and pay. 
We're helping merchants of all sizes compete in a rapidly changing multichannel retail environment and we will never compete with them. And we are creating compelling and engaging experiences for consumers all over the world. 
At the beginning of last year, we laid out 4, 3-year growth goals. And our strong performance in 2011 was a big down payment toward achieving those goals. And our first quarter results of 2012 continued that momentum. 
First quarter revenue grew 29% and non-GAAP EPS was up 18%. All of our businesses performed well. First, let's take a look at PayPal. 
We see enormous opportunity for PayPal, online, on mobile devices and increasingly, in the off-line environment as well. And PayPal is delivering this innovation on a global scale. In fact, for the second consecutive quarter, more than 1/2 of PayPal's  revenue came from outside the U.S. highlighting PayPal's expanding global footprint as people around the world look for a safer, easier way to pay in their domestic markets and across borders. Paypal TPV on eBay was up 18% for the quarter on an FX neutral basis. This is driven by strong market basis performance and increasing penetration on eBay to nearly 76%. That's 1 point above the prior quarter and achieves PayPal's 2013 on eBay penetration goal a year ahead of plan. 
In Merchant Services, TPV grew 28% on an FX neutral basis as more retailers and consumers chose PayPal online. PayPal continue to add more than 1 million new active accounts per month in Q1, ending the quarter with almost 110 million active accounts. 
Innovation is an essential focus for PayPal in 2012. During Q1, PayPal launched its first major point-of-sale product at a Home Depot. And today, that product is now available at nearly 2,000 Home Depot stores across the country. This enables PayPal's customers to pay in Home Depot stores by simply swiping a PayPal card or entering their mobile telephone number and PIN. Customers can shop without their wallets, credit cards or even their mobile phones, just pay with PayPal. And this is just the beginning. 
We have signed contracts to several additional retailers and we will begin deploying these retailers over the remainder of this year. We also launched a new point-of-sale product for small businesses called PayPal Here. 
PayPal Here offers small businesses a fully encrypted card reader for Android devices and iPhones, and it accepts all types of payment options. And unlike other solutions in the market, it's global, available in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Hong Kong at launch. The response thus far has been fantastic. More than 200,000 merchants have signed up to receive PayPal Here, which we expect to be widely available in Q2. 
The use of PayPal in mobile applications is also growing. For example, retail of in, recently introduced an app known as SmartPay, Boston area convenience store locations. You can now start the gas pump from your smart phone and pay for your gas safely with PayPal. 
As you know, I recently named David Marcus as President of PayPal. David has a successful technology entrepreneur with a real passion for innovation, great products and consumer engagement. He leads with the founder's perspective. And I look forward to closely working with David to help define the future of money and PayPal. 
PayPal also has a strong leadership team. And I want to thank the entire PayPal team for their leadership as we manage through this transition. PayPal didn't skip a beat and we had great momentum going into Q2 and for the rest of the year. 
Now let's turn to Marketplaces. Our Marketplaces business has turned the corner, shifting from defense to offense, and is delivering accelerated results. Our efforts to make the shopping experience on eBay faster and easier are paying off. We added more than 2 million new active users in Q1, the largest increase in 3 years. 
On an FX neutral basis, Marketplaces core GMV growth accelerated 3 points to 13%, both in the U.S. and internationally in the first quarter. Fixed price, which accounted for 64% of our GMV, grew 18%, up 4 points from the prior quarter and Auctions grew 3%. We're seeing great results from our investments in tailored and trusted shopping experiences. Fashion, parts and accessories and ticket categories all delivered strong double-digit growth rates. And we continue to improve trust on our sites with nearly 1/2 of U.S. GMV come from top-rated sellers during Q1. 
Same-store sales for these top-rated sellers also grew in the U.S., up 22% in the quarter, significantly outpacing e-commerce. And eBay sellers are offering free shipping more than ever on eBay. And free shipping now represents 45% of transactions in Q1, up 16 points year-over-year. 
On the mobile front, we continue to deliver innovative shopping experiences. In March, we launched Watch with eBay, our first iPad app that combines shopping and entertainment. Watch with eBay services merchandise related to what you're watching on TV, enabling you to shop based on inspiration from your favorite TV shows. And in Q1 alone, there were 12 million downloads of eBay mobile apps, bringing total downloads to 78 million since the launch of eBay mobile. 
We're also excited about StubHubs international expansion into the U.K. during Q1. StubHub now offers tickets to popular music, sporting and entertainment events across the U.K. with all-in pricing at the point of purchase. This is a first for the U.K. tickets industry, underscoring StubHub's strong commitment to innovation and a great fan experience. 
Let me share some of the Q1 highlights from GSI and our X.commerce platform. As a reminder, both GSI and X.commerce enable merchants of all sizes to compete in this new commerce environment. GSI focusing on larger merchants, X.commerce on smaller. GSI had another strong quarter, driving a 26% increase in same-store sales for its clients, again, outpacing e-commerce. During the quarter, GSI signed or extended 29 client contracts across their suite of services. 
And in Q2, we're planning a limited rollout of the next-generation of GSI's web service technology, or the V11 platform, which will give clients even more flexibility and control over their multichannel commerce experience. 
And X.commerce, our open commerce ecosystem, launched 2,000 new apps for businesses of all sizes during the first quarter. In all, we feel confident about our continued progress at GSI and X.commerce and the synergies that cut across our businesses and platforms. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our strong Q1 performance and our great start to 2012. With our focus on enabling commerce, we're delivering innovative products and great shopping experiences. We're a diverse global commerce company and we continue to operate with discipline and clarity, leveraging our scale, technologies and capabilities to shape the future of shopping and payments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide more details on Q1 and our outlook for Q2 and the full year."
27862,171897850,285222,"eBay Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2012",2012-04-18,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John.

As John indicated, Q1 was a great quarter for the company and a strong start to the second year of our 3-year journey. PayPal, Marketplaces an",1399,"Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. As John indicated, Q1 was a great quarter for the company and a strong start to the second year of our 3-year journey. PayPal, Marketplaces and GSI all performed well. 
Revenue increased 29% and non-GAAP EPS grew 18%. From a capital allocation standpoint, we announced 2 acquisitions and the divestiture of rent.com. And we repurchased approximately 7 million shares of stock. We feel great about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal continues its strong trajectory while innovating on the next-generation of payment capabilities. The Marketplaces core business overall is healthy and investments in new features and functionality continue to make the customer experience even better. And GSI is focused on helping large -- larger retailers succeed in the multichannel world. As a result of our strong first quarter operating performance, we are increasing our outlook for the full year. 
In Q1, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.3 billion, up 29%. Organic revenue growth was 18% and the inclusion of acquisitions closed in the last 12 months, increased our growth by approximately 11 points. 
First quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.55, an 18% increase year-over-year. Strong top line growth drove our outperformance relative to guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9%, down 250 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. The decrease was mainly due to acquisitions and business mix. 
We generated free cash flow of $289 million in the quarter, which was reduced by a one-time tax payment of approximately $300 million related to the gain on the sale of our remaining equity interest in Skype in the fourth quarter.  CapEx was 7% of revenue in the quarter. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had another strong quarter. Revenue reached $1.3 billion and total payment volume increased to $33.9 billion, up 31% and 25%, respectively, on an FX neutral basis. We continued to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 30% and today comprises 46% of overall TPV. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. The net number of payments grew 31%, a 1 point acceleration versus fourth quarter. On eBay TPV grew 18% on an FX neutral basis, driven by a strong eBay GMV growth and a 480 basis point increase in PayPal penetration. 
Merchant Services TPV grew 28% on an FX neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion of PayPal on merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of Checkout. 
Transaction margin was 65.6% in the quarter, up 190 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense. 
PayPal's segment margin committed 26.4% in the quarter, up 410 basis points from last year. This improvement was mainly due to transaction margin expansion and operating leverage from strong top line growth. PayPal's transaction segment margins are at the highest level in the last 5 years, while we continue to make significant investments to position for long-term growth. 
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. More consumers are turning to BML for both convenience and choice. BML's TPV was up 51% in Q1, driven by continued strong penetration on and off eBay. At Bill Me Later penetration, the U.S. on eBay and in the PayPal Wallet is increased in the past year to more than 1.6% in the quarter. While small compared to other funding choices, this penetration helped to reduce our funding cost. 
Risk-adjusted margin for the quarter was 16.8%, up 211 basis points year-over-year. Now let's move into the Marketplaces business. 
Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.7 billion, up 13% on an FX neutral basis. This was driven by FX neutral transaction revenue growth of 12% and marketing services revenue growth of 16% from our adjacent formats. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Sold items grew 17%, a 6-point acceleration from Q4 driven by strong growth in the U.K., China, U.S. and Korea. U.S. non-vehicles GMV grew 13%, driven by a strong growth in active users and category sales in fashion, tickets and parts and accessories. International FX neutral non-vehicles GMV grew 13%, driven by accelerating growth in APAC, strong performance in the U.K. and continued stable growth in Germany. 
From a format perspective, fixed price, a good proxy to compare e-commerce growth, grew 18% on an FX neutral basis. Marketplaces segment margin was 38.7 in the quarter, down 180 basis points due primarily to increased investments in technology and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. GSI had a strong quarter. Revenue for Q1 was $237 million, up 15% driven by strong volume growth partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Adjusting for the impact of the continued shift of clients to the service fee model, year-over-year growth would have been 19%. GSI's global e-commerce merchandise sales, or GMS, grew 26% on a same-store sales basis, our great result for GSI merchant who have successfully enabled strong e-commerce businesses, utilizing GSI's technology platforms and complementary services. GSI marketing services, which is primarily demand generation activities, grew 30% and accounted for 23% of GSI revenue in Q1. 
GSI's profitability is improving as we capitalize on the synergies we laid out at the time of the acquisition, resulting in a segment margin of 9.5%. The GSI integration continues on plan. We expect to begin a limited rollout of the V11 platform during the second quarter. And we are confident that the new platform will provide more flexibility to GSI merchants and give them greater control over their multichannel experiences. 
We are 9 months post the acquisition of GSI and continue to be excited about the opportunities ahead to help large retailers succeed in commerce both on and off-line. 
Turning to operating expenses. In Q1, there were 44% of revenue, slightly higher on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by increased investments in product and the customer experience as well as acquisitions, offset by trust improvements and lower buyer protection expense. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated free cash flow of $289 million in Q1. We've improved our financial flexibility by funding approximately 50% of the U.S. BML loan receivables portfolio with offshore cash. We closed 1 acquisition and we repurchased 7 million shares for $240 million. 
And we announced an agreement to divest rent.com because it has limited synergies with our core business. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents in nonequity investments of $7.8 billion, including approximately $1.1 billion in the U.S. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We feel great about the start of the year and we are increasing our full year guidance by $100 million on the top line and $0.05 on the bottom line. Let me provide you a little more context. 
First, we're increasing our expectations through a strong operating performance by approximately 2 points to reflect the strong results. Second, we have reduced the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar by 1 point to reflect a more stable currency environment versus our expectations back in January. And finally, we are increasing full year non-GAAP tax rate to 19% to 20% to account for some one-time discrete items in the first quarter and expectations for stronger growth in North America for the full year. 
For the full year 2012, we now expect revenues of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion representing growth of 18% to 21%. And we now anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $2.30 to $2.35 representing growth of 13% to 16%. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenues of $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion representing growth of 18% to 21%. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 to $0.55, representing growth of 10% to 15%. 
In summary, we had a strong beginning of the year and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. PayPal continues its trajectory. The core vision is strong and we are driving innovations, both on and off-line. The Marketplaces business is doing well. More users are coming to the site and we continue to invest in search, mobile, local and social to enhance the platform capabilities. And GSI is performing well. We are investing in our business for the long term and we are focused on delivering the next generation of global commerce and payments capabilities.

It expands PayPal served market from $500 million market to the $10 trillion market. And if we just capture 2% of the off-line retail, it's another PayPal. So we're treating this with the same kind of seriousness we give in the Merchant Services business 5 years ago. And frankly using a little bit of the similar playbook. So as you know, our focus in 2011 was to build a set of products that could work in large, small and medium-sized off-line retailers. And 2012 is all about piloting, testing and learning. This is not a scaling year, it's about piloting, testing and learning. And so in the first quarter, we got the product into Home Depot. And as you know, it works with the existing hardware point of sale. And it works. We worked with Home Depot on scalability and reliability to the point where they were confident of the end of quarter of rolling it out to all 2,000 stores nationwide. And thus far, we've done no marketing to consumers. Frankly, the only people using it thus far is eBay and Home Depot employees and others that have happened to have seen it. We're now working with Home Depot to start a phase of marketing to consumers, which will come and in the May, June time frame. And you'll see them and you'll probably see some signage in the Home Depot stores. They will be doing some mailings to their customers. We'll be doing mailings to ours. And that's when we'll really begin to focus on trying to get some consumer engagement around it. And so a good part of the summer will be working on that things. Now on the interim, we continue to have a pipeline, Don Kingsborough and his team have been working on signing up other retailers. We have several under contract. And during the second half of the year, we will be bringing those live to site. But again, with very much of the test and learn mindset really, we're trying to get some retailers in different segments to learn. So I feel very good about our progress. And this year is a test and learn year and so that we'll be ready and 2013 and '14 to rollout across different industry categories and globally. And then the last piece, which we didn't really talk about until we announced it was our off-line product, PayPal Here, focused on smaller off-line retailers and merchants. And that we're very excited about. I think it's a very innovative product. It's a product that we can go global with. And our biggest problem there is we're not sure we can manufacture enough devices in the next 60 days to meet up with the demand. But that's the kind of problem we want to have. So all in all, it's a test and learn year for off-line and we feel good about the progress."

We have seen expansion during the course of the year and on the year-over-year basis, it's up roughly 24 bps. And it's really driven by 3 factors, 2 that are sustainable and one that's a bit of a wildcard. The sustainable component is first our Bill Me Later growth. As we continue to grow the Bill Me Later portfolio that we monetize in a different way, we expect our take rate to continue to go up in conjunction with the Bill Me Later's component of the overall portfolio. That will continue. Secondly, as you know, we got a significant cross-border trade business in PayPal. It's roughly 25% of our total volume. And we've made some very modest changes into FX fees over the course of the last year to have a competitive offering but tweaked up slightly. And small little tweaks in that big cross-border business has a positive impact on our take rate. Those 2, Bill Me Later growth and buyer FX fees will continue. The third is just the gains on the hedges that we have in place, the revenue hedges that we have in place to flow to the PayPal line. That obviously is more dependent on how currencies go. And I wouldn't be counting on that one. It's an ongoing core piece of the business. So some sustainable, some not but good continued performance, primarily Bill Me Later growth. Second questions, Marketplace operating margin. I mean as we said 4 years ago, 35 to 45; and the year ago, 38% to 42%, we feel very good about that range. And then the natural dynamics for us are usually comes down a little bit in Q1 and Q2 and Q3 as we invest ahead of the back-to-school and holiday season and then goes up in Q4. So I would say that this year will be no different than prior years. And as we indicated back in January, we still feel good about our 38% to 42% operating margin next year as well."

And maybe I'm going to just elaborate a bit because the frequency in which we gets asked -- we get asked this question is higher. And the practical reality is we don't consider it that big of a deal but let me elaborate a little bit. First, to your point, yes. ACH is one of the multiple funding sources in the PayPal wallet. And relatively speaking, it is a fairly low-cost funding source. So it's an important part of our business. Secondly, I think as you know, yes, that kind of sets the rates and charges financial institutions see the process of those payments. And we do not expect the Fed or the governor of the network to make any changes to rates. If anything, we would expect the trend going down to continue. The third trend is then the financial institutions pass on a rates to their clients. And on that front, this is a fairly competitive world and lots of the banks provide this service. And for us, we go through a very competitive process, leveraging our scale. eBay Inc. as a whole and our scale within PayPal to get very competitive rates in a very competitive environment on behalf of our merchants and our consumers. So given that we -- lastly, I should say, we have 4 more years left on our contract. And within that contract, we're not -- we're well protected for any inflationary pressures that may come along the way that we don't think are going to happen. So I think we feel pretty good about that as a funding source in the wallet and that its cost will stay relatively low. All that said, let me maybe put this into context a little bit. Even though we don't expect any inflationary pressures, if our ACH cost went up 5x of where they are today, it's less than 1 point of operating margin on PayPal. So we don't expect them to go up. We'll contract that for 4 more years. And our wildest imaginations that they go up 5x is less than 1 point of operating profit today. And much less than 1 point 4 years from now when our contract expires. So, yes, it's a good question. I apologize for the lengthy answer. But the frequency that we get asked, I think is important for us to just elaborate on that one little bit."

And under Devon's leadership over the last really, 6 months, we have really ramped that up. As you know, we did a brand campaign in the fourth quarter and we're starting to start marketing. And Devon and I were just sitting down here showing you some data yesterday, where our active buyer growth is up 9.5% in the core Marketplace business. So we're beginning to reach out to people that haven't used eBay in a while or never used eBay and they're responding. And they like what they see. So I think that's adding to the growth and that's adding to our optimism. And then as you said another focus Devon's is the focus on the BRIC markets. And we are going through some data just some of the act, with the user growth and the buyer growth in some of the BRIC markets, in India and Brazil and Russia Eastern Europe and in China. And they're very significant user growth rates. Now they're under relatively small basis. And right now, they're importing product. But as large numbers of new users come online in the BRIC markets and in the emerging markets, they won't have a local e-commerce market first. And they're going to be looking to kind of global e-commerce sites that specialize in cross-border trade. That, of course, is what we do. eBay does it. PayPal enables it. And so again, I think that we'll see increased focus and we'll increase focus on bringing buyers to the site both in the U.S. and around the globe and then try to deliver great experience so that we'll retain those buyers. And you add that together and that's why we're optimistic. I'll also say we had a couple of a nice recent product enhancements during the year. You're going to see some really, really good stuff around the checkout experience on eBay. We're finally going to given the fact that we own eBay and PayPal, we're going to bring the checkout experience on eBay. You're going to see some search improvements. You're going to see some fun areas and discovery. And so things, more to come on a steady stream of product enhancements on eBay. So all in all, we're feeling good about that business."

I think you're going to see more on that some of the stuff I'm really personally excited about is some of the stuff that Steven Dyer and Mitch and the mobile team are doing around visual recognition and search, which is sort of how you want to engage with a fashion experience. And then Consumer Electronics is the category that lends itself to catalog issue. As you said, as you saw, we've rolled out the product-based experience and consumer electronics. The kinds of things that are on the to-do list going forward, it varies a little bit by market but collectibles. You'll see us do some things in collectibles. Sporting goods and baby goods are 2 sort of subcategories, where we're working hard to bring the right inventory on and provide a good experience. With respect to search, Mark and his team have done a great job of some of the vertical shopping experiences and different search algorithms by vertical. They're now building the underlying search platform, which we'll roll out during this year. And the implication of that we called the Pasini internally. It is historically the search on eBay has been matching keyword match in the title and that's really how we recall search on eBay. What Pasini will now do is will search the entire listing for search terms and match the search query with that. So we think that will improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of search recall. And lastly, on first quarter, Bob can probably comment on specific thing and I'll note is e-commerce is growing. I mean mobile is having a big impact on the e-commerce market. The e-commerce that came out yesterday in the U.S., they were up a couple points for the month of March at 17%. And we're benefiting from that. And frankly, I think our mobile apps are helping to drive that. So..."

First, as you may remember from a year ago, for different reasons that the same impact, growth from China and Korea was relatively slow. In China because we took some actions to ensure the volume coming from our greater Chinese sellers were providing great experiences for our consumers in our developed markets. Growth slowed until they can adjust their business model to provide great experiences. So in China, we saw a real healthy growth on volume and sold items. I think sellers have really responded to the increased expectations of consumers. That was one. I think too, in Korea, a little bit of the same. Our competitive position in Korea is getting stronger. We're investing more behind it and our sold item growth is accelerating because our business is stronger and our comps are relatively easy. I think on the U.S., John covered it. On U.K., this has been a very good strong suit for us for a long period now. It's the market that Scott, as you know, we did -- there was a launch from a lot of the innovations that we do.

O",451,"Great question. First, let me make a little bit of context. As we indicated early last year, our expectations for PayPal over the 3-year timeframe is we have roughly doubled the size of the business. And that would really come in 3 different components. One, we continue to grow on eBay in the mid-couple single digits. Secondly, Bill Me Later would grow north of 40%. And third, to your question, Merchant Services will grow over that 3-year timeframe of 25% to 30%. Those 3 components are what will drive the doubling of PayPal from essentially 2010 to 2013. So we said 25% to 30% for Merchant Services. Last year, Merchant Services performed much higher than that. It was up in the mid-30s, about 34%. So we're off to a great start one year in. And we increased the guidance in effect for the 3-year journey the beginning of this year. This quarter, another good strong quarter of Merchant Services TPV is 28% growth, which keeps us well on track, maybe even a little bit ahead of our 3-year plan. So we feel very good about where we are. In terms of maybe context around the deceleration that happened last year, I'd say 2 things. One, while changes in currencies particularly for European impacts our cross-border trade and that started to happen in Q3. And again, in Q4 and that was a big component of the deceleration. Currency from Q4 to Q1 had been relatively stable. And therefore, our business -- sorry, Merchant Services has remained relatively stable growth from Q4 to Q1 because there's no wildcards. I think underneath the covers a little bit, European growth is slower. The growth in Europe, we had a great quarter as a company. eBay in Europe was very strong. PayPal growth in Europe slowed. And when we look at same-store sales for our merchants in Europe, we're contending with some slowness. We would say it's really more economy centric than the progress that our teams are making, getting new merchants and more consumer share of wallet. So 25% to 30% is what we said, 5 quarters in our 12-quarter journey, we're in a very good shape. Some things working for us, some things working against but we feel very good about the plan we laid out. And then as John mentioned, one last thing. In that 3-year plan, we didn't include anything in the off-line world. And the ambitions are to take what we did in the online world, take them into the off-line world for small, medium and large merchants, and dramatically increase the denominator of the served market to accelerate growth even more as we exit 2013 and into 2014 and beyond."

So I think location-based payments is something that you will see a lot of innovation around. And just as we in PayPal Here, you see us using the check-in feature and location base payments to be quite powerful, the GPS device and smartphones. But again, it's not dependent upon on NFC to the last inch. So I don't know. I think you'll see more and I think it's going to be at least a couple years before you see widespread adoption of NFC in large retailers all over the world. There'll be some examples of innovation but I think the real innovation that we'll be driving are in the actual consumer experience and the merchant experience."

And I'm thrilled we're at the front end of that in sort of 2 ways. One having applications products that allow you to actually close the transaction on a mobile device. And so eBay mobile volume continues to just be on fire. PayPal mobile payments volume continues to be on fire. And so consumers are using their mobile devices to shop and to pay and our applications are compelling. And I think we will certainly beat some of the goals we set out for the year on those 2 fronts. The other story though is consumers are using mobile devices as part of their shopping experience even if they don't actually close the transaction on a mobile device. And some of the innovations that we're driving and doing a thing I think are quite interesting in that front. I'll highlight 2 or 3 really. One is what we're doing around local commerce with RedLaser, Milo and PayPal, right, which we believe is providing an experience that will help drive foot traffic into large retailers. And we're working with retailers like Toys""R""Us and Best Buy and others to make that a compelling experience. Second example on the iPad is this notion of shop while you're watching TV. I think Nielsen produced a report that says something like 80% of smartphone and iPad or tablet users use their devices while watching TV. And so our mobile team came up with this application where while you're watching TV with the eBay iPad app, you enter whatever channel you're watching and the TV show that you're watching, eBay inventory associated with that TV show pops up. And it's a very compelling experience. And now we're doing some experimentation with some celebrity juration and other things. So this whole notion of a dual-device experience having an iPad or a smartphone in your lap while you're watching TV. I think you'll see a lot of shopping innovation around that. And again, we hope to be enabling that. The last thing I'd say then is the -- I think the innovation around mobile is actually just beginning. It's some of the location-based capabilities that these mobile devices enable are going to have impact on shopping and paying. PayPal Here, that check-in feature, which allows the small retailer or small merchant to know you by name and by face when you come in. I think that visual search capabilities that an additional recognition will have an impact on our fashion experience and on shopping. And so we are doubling down on our mobile investment and feel very good about the innovations that are happening. And are finding a growing number of retailers and merchants are coming to us saying, ""Can you help us in this mobile world?"" So it's fun and it's not going away."

Number one in the Marketplace side, John. I guess I'm curious. How much of the improvement there do you attribute to the specific changes you outlined that you're making to the Marketplace versus perhaps just a natural equilibrium point setting in for eBay, which would suggest growth in line with e-commerce regardless of the conscious changes you're making? And then secondly, on PayPal. Just looking at the growth and accounts and the spread there versus the growth in the number of payments, we see users are paying with PayPal more frequently. So I wonder if that higher engagement is coming from the incremental growth on mobile or perhaps more or broader acceptance of PayPal on e-commerce sites or something else if you could talk about that."

And now, Devon and his team are trying to build off of that new equilibrium. Our inspiration is now going to be about e-commerce. And so over time that will be what we'll be driving toward. So I feel that the Marketplace is in a strong and sustainable place today that we'll build off of. And then PayPal, I think mobile is enhancing the engagement and the ubiquity of PayPal. And when you look at the ubiquity on the web, we continue to sign additional merchants around the world up for where they're putting PayPal and their online site. PayPal on the mobile device is proven to have higher conversion and so more people are putting PayPal checkout on their mobile applications. And then moving into the off-line world is that third leg of ubiquity, both with large merchants and small merchants with our point-of-sale product in PayPal Here. And our strategy is quite clearly if PayPal is everywhere, that's going to increase the likelihood that consumers engage with it, which is good for the business both online and off. So I guess the answer to your question is yes on both fronts.

We had a strong first quarter and an excellent start to the year driven by strong performance across eBay, PayPal and GSI. Our portfolio is enabling commerce around the world, and we're excited about our future. We're building a set of capabilities that is reshaping how people shop and pay. 
We're helping merchants of all sizes compete in a rapidly changing multichannel retail environment, and we will never compete with them. And we're creating compelling and engaging experiences for consumers all over the world. 
At the beginning of last year, we laid out bold 3-year growth goals. And our strong performance in 2011 was a big down payment toward achieving those goals. And our first quarter results of 2012 continued that momentum. 
First quarter revenue grew 29%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 18%. All of our businesses performed well. First, let's take a look at PayPal. 
We see enormous opportunity for PayPal, online, on mobile devices and, increasingly, in the off-line environment as well. And PayPal is delivering this innovation on a global scale. In fact, for the second consecutive quarter, more than half of PayPal's revenue came from outside the U.S., highlighting PayPal's expanding global footprint as people around the world look for a safer, easier way to pay in their domestic markets and across borders. 
Paypal's TPV on eBay was up 18% for the quarter on an FX-neutral basis. This was driven by strong Marketplaces performance and increasing penetration on eBay to nearly 76%. That's a point above the prior quarter and achieves PayPal's 2013 on eBay penetration goal a year ahead of plan. 
In Merchant Services, TPV grew 28% on an FX-neutral basis as more retailers and consumers chose PayPal online. PayPal continued to add more than 1 million new active accounts per month in Q1, ending the quarter with almost 110 million active accounts. 
Innovation is a central focus for PayPal in 2012. During Q1, PayPal launched its first major point-of-sale product at Home Depot. And today, that product is now available at nearly 2,000 Home Depot stores across the country. This enables PayPal's customers to pay in Home Depot stores by simply swiping a PayPal card or entering their mobile telephone number and PIN. Customers can shop without their wallets, credit cards or even their mobile phones, just pay with PayPal. And this is just the beginning. We have signed contracts with several additional retailers and will begin deploying these retailers over the remainder of this year. 
We also launched a new point-of-sale product for small businesses called PayPal Here. PayPal Here offers small businesses a fully encrypted card reader for Android devices and iPhones, and it accepts all types of payment options. And unlike other solutions in the market, it's global, available in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Hong Kong at launch. The response thus far has been fantastic. More than 200,000 merchants have signed up to receive PayPal Here, which we expect to be widely available in Q2. 
The use of PayPal in mobile applications is also growing. For example, retailer Cumberland Farms, recently introduced an app known as SmartPay at 50 of its Boston area convenience store locations. You can now start the gas pump from your smartphone and pay for your gas safely with PayPal. 
As you know, I recently named David Marcus as President of PayPal. David is a successful technology entrepreneur with a real passion for innovation, great products and consumer engagement. He leads with a founder's perspective, and I look forward to closely working with David to help define the future of money and PayPal. 
PayPal also has a strong leadership team, and I want to thank the entire PayPal team for their leadership as we manage through this transition. PayPal didn't skip a beat, and we had great momentum going into Q2 and for the rest of the year. 
Now let's turn to Marketplaces. Our Marketplaces business has turned the corner, shifting from defense to offense, and is delivering accelerating results. Our efforts to make the shopping experience on eBay faster and easier are paying off. We added more than 2 million new active users in Q1, the largest increase in 3 years. 
On an FX-neutral basis, Marketplaces' core GMV growth accelerated 3 points to 13%, both in the U.S. and internationally, in the first quarter. Fixed price, which accounted for 64% of our GMV, grew 18%, up 4 points from the prior quarter and auctions grew 3%. We're seeing great results from our investments in tailored and trusted shopping experiences. Fashion, parts and accessories and ticket categories all delivered strong double-digit growth rates. And we continue to improve trust on our sites with nearly half of U.S. GMV coming from top-rated sellers during Q1. 
Same store sales for these top-rated sellers also grew in the U.S., up 22% in the quarter, significantly outpacing e-commerce. And eBay sellers are offering free shipping more than ever on eBay, and free shipping now represents 45% of transactions in Q1, up 16 points year-over-year. 
On the mobile front, we continue to deliver innovative shopping experiences. In March, we launched Watch With eBay, our first iPad app that combines shopping and entertainment. Watch With eBay services merchandise related to what you're watching on TV, enabling you to shop based on inspiration from your favorite TV shows. And in Q1 alone, there were 12 million downloads of eBay Mobile apps, bringing total downloads to 78 million since the launch of eBay Mobile. 
We're also excited about StubHub's international expansion into the U.K. during Q1. StubHub now offers tickets to popular music, sporting and entertainment events across the U.K. with all-in pricing at the point of purchase. This is a first for the U.K. tickets industry, underscoring StubHub's strong commitment to innovation and a great fan experience. 
Let me share some of the Q1 highlights from GSI and our X.commerce platform. As a reminder, both GSI and X.commerce enable merchants of all sizes to compete in this new commerce environment, GSI focusing on larger merchants, X.commerce on smaller. GSI had another strong quarter, driving a 26% increase in same store sales for its clients, again outpacing e-commerce. During the quarter, GSI signed or extended 29 client contracts across their suite of services. 
And in Q2, we're planning a limited rollout of the next generation of GSI's web service technology, or the V11 platform, which will give clients even more flexibility and control over their multichannel commerce experience. And X.commerce, our open commerce ecosystem, launched 2,000 new apps for businesses of all sizes during the first quarter. 
In all, we feel confident about our continued progress at GSI and X.commerce and the synergies that cut across our businesses and platforms. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our strong Q1 performance and our great start to 2012. With our focus on enabling commerce, we're delivering innovative products and great shopping experiences. We're a diverse global commerce company, and we continue to operate with discipline and clarity, leveraging our scale, technologies and capabilities to shape the future of shopping and payments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide more details on Q1 and our outlook for Q2 and the full year."
27862,171897850,285272,"eBay Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2012",2012-04-18,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. As John indicated, Q1 was a great quarter for the company and a strong start to the second year of our 3-year journey. PayPal, Marketplaces",1396,"Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
As John indicated, Q1 was a great quarter for the company and a strong start to the second year of our 3-year journey. PayPal, Marketplaces and GSI all performed well. 
Revenue increased 29% and non-GAAP EPS grew 18%. From a capital allocation standpoint, we announced 2 acquisitions and the divestiture of Rent.com. And we repurchased approximately 7 million shares of stock. We feel great about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal continues its strong trajectory while innovating on the next generation of payment capabilities; the Marketplaces core business overall is healthy, and investments in new features and functionality continue to make the customer experience even better; and GSI is focused on helping large -- larger retailers succeed in a multichannel world. As a result of our strong first quarter operating performance, we are increasing our outlook for the full year. 
In Q1, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.3 billion, up 29%. Organic revenue growth was 18%, and the inclusion of acquisitions closed in the last 12 months increased our growth by approximately 11 points. 
First quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.55, an 18% increase year-over-year. Strong topline growth drove our outperformance relative to guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9%, down 250 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. The decrease was mainly due to acquisitions and business mix. 
We generated free cash flow of $289 million in the quarter, which was reduced by a onetime tax payment of approximately $300 million related to the gain on the sale of our remaining equity interest in Skype in the fourth quarter.  CapEx was 7% of revenue in the quarter. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had another strong quarter. Revenue reached $1.3 billion, and total payment volume increased to $33.9 billion, up 31% and 25%, respectively, on an FX-neutral basis. We continued to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 30% and today comprises 46% of overall TPV. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. The net number of payments grew 31%, a 1 point acceleration versus fourth quarter. On eBay TPV grew 18% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by a strong eBay GMV growth and a 480-basis-point increase in PayPal penetration. 
Merchant Services' TPV grew 28% on an FX-neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion of PayPal on merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of checkout. 
Transaction margin was 65.6% in the quarter, up 190 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense. 
PayPal's segment margin came in a 26.4% in the quarter, up 410 basis points from last year. This improvement was mainly due to transaction margin expansion and operating leverage with some strong topline growth. PayPal's transaction segment margins are at the highest level in the last 5 years, while we continue to make significant investments to position for long-term growth. 
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. More consumers are turning to BML for both convenience and choice. BML's TPV was up 51% in Q1, driven by continued strong penetration on and off eBay. And Bill Me Later penetration in the U.S. on eBay and in the PayPal wallet has increased in the past year to more than 1.6% in the quarter. While small compared to other funding choices, this penetration helped to reduce our funding costs. 
Risk-adjusted margin for the quarter was 16.8%, up 211 basis points year-over-year. 
Now let's move in the Marketplaces business. 
Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.7 billion, up 13% on an FX-neutral basis. This was driven by FX-neutral transaction revenue growth of 12% and marketing services revenue growth of 16% from our adjacent formats. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces' operational metrics. Sold items grew 17%, a 6-point acceleration from Q4, driven by strong growth in the U.K., China, U.S. and Korea. U.S. non-vehicle GMV grew 13%, driven by a strong growth in active users and category sales in fashion, tickets and parts and accessories. International FX-neutral non-vehicles GMV grew 13%, driven by accelerating growth in APAC, strong performance in the U.K. and continued stable growth in Germany. 
From a format perspective, fixed price, a good proxy to compare e-commerce growth, grew 18% on an FX-neutral basis. Marketplaces' segment margin was 38.7% in the quarter, down 180 basis points due primarily to increased investments in technology and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. GSI had a strong quarter. Revenue for Q1 was $237 million, up 15%, driven by strong volume growth partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Adjusting for the impact of the continued shift of clients to the service fee model, year-over-year growth would have been 19%. 
GSI's global e-commerce merchandise sales, or GMS, grew 26% on a same store sales basis, a great result for GSI merchants who have successfully enabled strong e-commerce businesses, utilizing GSI's technology platforms and complementary services. GSI marketing services, which is primarily demand generation activities, grew 30% and accounted for 23% of GSI revenue in Q1. GSI's profitability is improving as we capitalize on the synergies we laid out at the time of the acquisition, resulting in a segment margin of 9.5%. 
The GSI integration continues on plan. We expect to begin a limited rollout of the V11 platform during the second quarter. And we are confident that the new platform will provide more flexibility to GSI merchants and give them greater control over their multichannel experiences. We are 9 months post the acquisition of GSI and continue to be excited about the opportunities ahead to help large retailers succeed in both -- in commerce both on and off-line. 
Turning to operating expenses. In Q1, they were 44% of revenue, slightly higher on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by increased investments in product and the customer experience as well as acquisitions, offset by trust improvements and lower buyer protection expense. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we generated free cash flow of $289 million in Q1. We've improved our financial flexibility by funding approximately 50% of the U.S. BML loan receivables portfolio with offshore cash. We closed 1 acquisition, and we repurchased 7 million shares for $240 million. 
And we announced an agreement to divest Rent.com because it has limited synergies with our core business. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $7.8 billion, including approximately $1.1 billion in the U.S. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We feel great about the start of the year, and we are increasing our full year guidance by $100 million on the topline and $0.05 on the bottom line. Let me provide you a little more context. 
First, we're increasing our expectations for a strong operating performance by approximately 2 points to reflect the strong results. Second, we have reduced the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar by 1 point to reflect a more stable currency environment versus our expectations back in January. And finally, we are increasing full year non-GAAP tax rate to 19% to 20% to account for some onetime discrete items in the first quarter and expectations for stronger growth in North America for the full year. 
For the full year 2012, we now expect revenues of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion, representing growth of 18% to 21%. And we now anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $2.30 to $2.35, representing growth of 13% to 16%. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenues of $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, representing growth of 18% to 21%. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 to $0.55, representing growth of 10% to 15%. 
In summary, we had a strong beginning to the year and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. PayPal continues its trajectory. The core business is strong, and we are driving innovations, both on and off-line. The Marketplaces business is doing well. More users are coming to the site, and we continue to invest in search, mobile, local and social to enhance the platform capabilities. And GSI is performing well. We are investing in our business for the long term, and we are focused on delivering the next generation of global commerce and payments capabilities.

It expands PayPal's served market from $500 million market to a $10 trillion market. And if we just capture 2% of the off-line retail, it's another PayPal. So we're treating this with the same kind of seriousness we did the Merchant Services business 5 years ago and, frankly, using a little bit of a similar playbook. So as you know, our focus in 2011 was to build a set of products that could work in large, small and medium-size off-line retailers. And 2012 is all about piloting, testing and learning. This is not a scaling year, it's about piloting, testing and learning. And so in the first quarter, we got the product into Home Depot. As you know, it works with the existing hardware point of sale. And it worked. We work with Home Depot on scalability and reliability to the point where they were confident by the end of the quarter of rolling it out to all 2,000 stores nationwide. And thus far, we've done no marketing to consumers. Frankly, the only people using it thus far are eBay and Home Depot employees and others that have happened to have seen it. We're now working with Home Depot to start a phase of marketing to consumers, which will come in the May-June timeframe, and you'll see that. Now you'll probably see some signage in the Home Depot stores. They will be doing some mailing to their customers. We'll be doing mailings to ours. And that's when we'll really begin to focus on trying to get some consumer engagement around it. And so a good part of the summer will be working on that phase of things. Now in the interim, we've continued to have a pipeline. Don Kingsborough and the team have been working hard signing up other retailers. We had several under contract and, during the second half of the year, we'll be bringing those live to site. But again, with very much of a test and learn mindset really, we're trying to get some retailers in different segments to learn. So I feel very good about our progress. And this year is a test and learn year and so that we'll be ready in 2013 and '14 to roll out across different industry categories and globally. And then the last piece, which we didn't really talk about until we announced it, was our off-line product, PayPal Here, focused on smaller off-line retailers and merchants. And that, we're very excited about. And I think it's a very innovative product, I think a product that we can go global with. And the -- our biggest problem there is we're not sure we can manufacture enough devices in the next 60 days to meet up with the demand. But that's the kind of problem we want to have. So all in all, it's a test and learn year for off-line, and we feel good about the progress."

And it's really driven by 3 factors, 2 that are sustainable and one that's a bit of a wild card.",343,"Spencer, thanks. First, on the PayPal take rate. We have seen expansion during the course of the year. And on a year-over-year basis, it's up roughly 24 bps. And it's really driven by 3 factors, 2 that are sustainable and one that's a bit of a wild card. The sustainable component is our first Bill Me Later growth. As we continue to grow the Bill Me Later portfolio that we monetize in a different way, we expect our take rate to continue to go up in conjunction with Bill Me Later's component of the overall portfolio. That will continue. Secondly, as you know, we got a significant cross-border trade business in PayPal. It's roughly 25% of our total volume. And we've made some very modest changes into FX fees over the course of the last year to have a competitive offering but tweaked up slightly. And small, little tweaks on that big cross-border business has a positive impact on our take rate. Those 2, Bill Me Later growth and buyer FX fees, will continue. The third is just the gains on the hedges that we have in place, the revenue hedges that we have in place to flow to the PayPal line. That obviously is more dependent on how currencies go, and I wouldn't be counting on that one. It's a ongoing core piece of the business. So some sustainable, some not, but good, continued performance, primarily Bill Me Later growth. Second question's Marketplace operating margin. I mean, as we said 4 years ago, 35% to 45%; and a year ago, 38% to 42%. We feel very good about that range. And the natural dynamics for us are usually it comes down a little bit in Q1 and Q2 and Q3 as we invest ahead of the back-to-school and holiday season, and then goes up in Q4. So I would say that this year will be no different than prior years. And as we indicated back in January, we still feel good about our 38% to 42% operating margin next year as well."

And maybe, I'm going to just elaborate a bit because the frequency in which we gets asked -- we get asked this question is higher. And the practical reality is we don't consider it that big a deal, but let me elaborate a little bit. First, to your point, yes, ACH is one of the multiple funding sources in the PayPal wallet. And relatively speaking, it is a fairly low-cost -- a low-cost funding source. So it's an important part of our business. Secondly, I think as you know, the Fed kind of sets the rates and charges financial institutions a fee to process those payments. And we do not expect the Fed or the governor of the network to make any changes to rates. If anything, we would expect the trend of going down to continue. The third then has been the financial institutions pass on any rates to their clients. And on that front, this is a fairly competitive world and lots of the banks provide this service. And for us, we go through a very competitive process, leveraging our scale, eBay Inc. as a whole and our scale within PayPal, to get very competitive rates in a very competitive environment on behalf of our merchants and our consumers. So given that we -- lastly, I should say, we have 4 more years left on our contract. And within that contract, we're not -- we're well protected for any inflationary pressures that may come along the way that we don't think are going to happen. So I think we feel pretty good about that as a funding source in the wallet and that its cost will stay relatively low. All that said, let me maybe put this into context a little bit. Even though we don't expect any inflationary pressures, if our ACH costs went up 5x of where they are today, it's less than 1 point of operating margin on PayPal. So we don't expect them to go up. We're contractually locked out for 4 more years. And our wildest imagine -- imagination is if they go up 5x, it's less than 1 point of operating profit today and much less than 1 point 4 years from now when our contract expires. So it's -- yes, it's a good question. I apologize for the lengthy answer, but the frequency that we get asked, I think, is important enough for us to just elaborate on that one a little bit."

The -- well, the nice thing about the first quarter results are frankly that they are an accumulation of the hard work we've been doing over the last 3 or 4 years to improve the user experience, both the product experience, the trust, the quality of products on the site, the quality of sellers. And so the data I look at is buyer retention. And buyer retention is up in the U.S. and across the globe. The second thing, as you know over the last several years, people have been saying, ""When are we going to start marketing to bring back inactive users or bring new users to the site?"" And under Devin's leadership over the last really 6 months, we have really ramped that up. As you know, we did a brand campaign in the fourth quarter, and we're starting to start marketing. And Devin and I were just sitting down here. He was showing me some data yesterday where our active buyer growth is up 9.5% in the core Marketplace business. So we're beginning to reach out to people that haven't used eBay in a while or never used eBay, and they're responding. And they like what they see. So I think that's adding to the growth and that's adding to our optimism. And then as you said, another focus Devin has brought is the focus on the BRIC markets. And we were going through some data, just some of the fact that -- the user growth, the buyer growth in some of the BRIC markets, in India, in Brazil and Russia, in Eastern Europe and in China. And they're very significant user growth rates. Now they're under relatively small bases. And right now, they're importing product. But as large numbers of new users come online in the BRIC markets and in the -- and in emerging markets, they won't have a local e-commerce market at first, and they're going to be looking to kind of global e-commerce sites that specialize in cross-border trade. That, of course, is what we do. eBay does it, PayPal enables it. And so again, I think that we'll see increased focus, and we'll increase focus on bringing buyers to the site, both in the U.S. and around the globe, and then try to deliver a great experience so that we retain those buyers. And you add that together and that's why we're optimistic. I'll also say we have a couple of -- a nice series of product enhancements during the year. You're going to see some really, really good stuff around the checkout experience on eBay. We're finally going to -- given the fact that we own eBay and PayPal, we're going to improve the checkout experience on eBay. You're going to see some search improvements. You're going to see some fun areas and discovery. And so things -- more to come on a steady stream of product enhancements on eBay. So all in all, we're feeling good about that business."

I think you're going to see even more on that, like some of the stuff I'm really personally excited about is some of the stuff that Steve Yankovich and our mobile team are doing around visual recognition and search, which is sort of how you want to engage with a fashion experience. And then consumer electronics is a category that lends itself to catalog issue. As you said which you saw, we've rolled out the product-based experience in consumer electronics. The kinds of things that are on the to-do list going forward, it varies a little bit by market. But collectibles, I -- you'll see us do some things in collectibles. Sporting goods and baby goods are 2 sort of subcategories, where we're working hard to bring the right inventory on and provide a good experience. With respect to search, Mark Carges and the team of -- have done a great job with some of the vertical shopping experiences and different search algorithms by vertical. They're now building the underlying search platform, which we'll roll out during this year. And the implication of that is that we call the Cassini internally. And historically, the search on eBay has been matching keyword match in the title, and that's really how we recall search on eBay. What Cassini will now do is we'll search the entire listing for search terms and match the search query with that. So we think that will improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of search recall. And lastly, on first quarter, I -- Bob can probably comment on specific things. The thing I'll note is e-commerce is growing. I mean, mobile is having a big impact on the e-commerce market. The e-commerce stats came out yesterday in the U.S., and they were up a couple of points in -- for the month of March, 17%, and we're benefiting from that. And frankly, I think our mobile apps are helping to drive that. So..."

First, as you may remember from a year ago, for different reasons but the same impact, growth from China and Korea was relatively slow. In China, because we took some actions to ensure that the volume coming from our greater Chinese sellers were providing great experiences for our consumers in our developed markets, growth slowed until they could adjust their business models to provide great experiences. So in China, we saw a real healthy growth on volume in sold items because their sellers have really responded to the increased expectations of consumers. So that was one. I think, two, in Korea, a little bit of the same. Our competitive position in Korea is getting stronger. We're investing more behind it, and our sold item growth is accelerating because our business is stronger and our comps are relatively easy. I think on the U.S., John covered it. On U.K., this has been a very good, strong suit for us for a long period now. It's the market that Scott, as you know, we did our -- there was a launch from a lot of the innovations that we do.

One,",462,"Yes, great question. First, maybe a little bit of context. As we indicated early last year, our expectations for PayPal over the 3-year time frame is we'll roughly double the size of the business. And that would really come in 3 different components. One, we continue to grow on eBay in the mid to upper single digits. Secondly, Bill Me Later would grow north of 40%. And third, to your question, Merchant Services will grow over that 3-year time frame of 25% to 30%. Those 3 components are what would drive the doubling of PayPal from essentially 2010 to 2013. So we said 25% to 30% for Merchant Services. Last year, Merchant Services performed much higher than that. It was up in the mid-30s, about 34%. So we're off to a great start one year in. And we increased the guidance in effect for the 3-year journey at the beginning of this year. This quarter, another good, strong quarter. Merchant Services' TPV had 28% growth, which keeps us well on track, maybe even a little bit ahead of our 3-year plan. So we feel very good about where we are. In terms of maybe context around the deceleration that happened last year, I'd say 2 things. One, wild changes in currencies, particularly for European, impacts our cross-border trade, and that started to happen in Q3 and again in Q4 and that was a big component of the deceleration. Currency from Q4 to Q1 had been relatively stable. And therefore, our business -- sorry, Merchant Services has remained relatively stable growth from Q4 to Q1 because there's no wild cards. I think underneath the covers a little bit, European growth is slower. The growth in Europe, we had a great quarter as a company. eBay in Europe was very strong. PayPal growth in Europe slowed. And when we look at same store sales for our merchants in Europe, we're contending with some slowness, what we would say is really more economy-centric than the progress that our teams are making, getting new merchants and more consumer share of wallet. So 25% to 30% is what we said 5 quarters into our 12-quarter journey. We're in a -- we're in very good shape, some things working for us, some things working against, but we feel very good about the plans we laid out. And then as John mentioned, one last thing. In that 3-year plan, we didn't include anything in the off-line world. And the -- our ambitions are to take what we did in the online world, take them into the off-line world for small, medium and large merchants and dramatically increase the denominator of the served market to accelerate growth even more in -- as we exit 2013 and into 2014 and beyond."

So I think location-based payments is something that you'll see a lot of innovation around. And just as we -- in PayPal Here, you see us using the check-in feature on location-based payment fees to be quite powerful, the GPS devices and smartphones. But again, it's not dependent upon an NFC for the last inch. So I don't know. I think you'll see more -- and I think it's going to be at least a couple years before you see widespread adoption of NFC in large retailers all over the world. There'll be some examples of innovation, but I think the real innovation that we'll be driving are in the actual consumer experience and the merchant experience."

And I'm thrilled we're at the front end of that in sort of 2 ways. One, having applications and products that allow you to actually close the transaction on a mobile device. And so eBay Mobile volume continues to just be on fire. PayPal mobile payments volume continues to be on fire. And so consumers are using their mobile devices to shop and to pay. And our applications are compelling, and I think we will certainly beat some of the goals we set out for the year on those 2 fronts. The other story, though, is consumers are using mobile devices as part of their shopping experience even if they don't actually close the transaction on a mobile device. And some of the innovations that we're driving and doing, I think, are quite interesting in that front. I'll highlight 2. One -- or 3 really. One is what we're doing around local commerce with RedLaser, Milo and PayPal, right, which we believe is providing an experience that will help drive foot traffic into large retailers. And we're working with retailers like Toys R Us and Best Buy and others to make that a compelling experience. Second example on the iPad is this notion of shop while you're watching TV. I think Nielsen produced a report that says something like 80% of smartphone and iPad or tablet users use their devices while watching TV. And so our Mobile team came up with this application where while you're watching TV with the eBay iPad app, you enter whatever channel you're watching and the TV show that you're watching. eBay inventory associated with that TV show pops up. And it's a very compelling experience. And now we're doing some experimentation with some celebrity juration and other things. So this whole notion of a dual-device experience, having an iPad or a smartphone in your lap while you're watching TV, I think you'll see a lot of shopping innovation around that. And again, we're -- we hope to be enabling that. The last thing I'd say then is the -- I think some -- the innovation around mobile is actually just beginning. It's -- some of the location-based capabilities that these mobile devices enable are going to have impact on shopping and paying. PayPal Here, that check-in feature, which allows the small retailer or small merchant to know you by name and by face when you come in. I think that visual search capabilities that -- and additional recognition will have an impact on our fashion experience and on shopping. And so we're doubling down on our mobile investment and feel very good about the innovations that are happening and are finding a growing number of retailers and merchants who are coming to us saying, ""Can you help us in this mobile world?"" So it's fun and it's not going away."

I think 2 things. I think the answer to both of your questions is both. I think the changes we've made were essential. I think the marketplace would not have turned around. It wouldn't be where it is today without the changes we've driven. It's a more trusted, better experience. And I believe we're at a new equilibrium. And now, Devin and his team are trying to build off of that new equilibrium. Our aspiration is now going to be about e-commerce. So -- and over time that's what we'll be driving toward. So I feel that the marketplace is in a strong and sustainable place today that we'll build off of. And in PayPal, I think mobile is enhancing the engagement and the ubiquity of PayPal. And when you look at ubiquity on the web, we continue to sign additional merchants around the world up where they're putting PayPal on their online site. PayPal on a mobile device is proven to have higher conversion, and so more and more people are putting PayPal checkout on their mobile applications. And then moving into the off-line world is that third leg of ubiquity, both with large merchants and small merchants, with our point-of-sale product in PayPal Here. And our strategy is quite clearly if PayPal is everywhere, that's going to increase the likelihood that consumers engage with it, which is good for the business, both online and off. So I guess the answer to your question is yes on both fronts. 
All right, everyone, thank you very much and we'll talk to you again in 3 months."

Our portfolio is enabling commerce around the world, a",1209,"Thanks, Jenny. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 earnings call. We had a strong first quarter and an excellent start to the year driven by strong performance across eBay, PayPal and GSI. Our portfolio is enabling commerce around the world, and we're excited about our future. We're building a set of capabilities that is reshaping how people shop and pay. 
We're helping merchants of all sizes compete in a rapidly changing multichannel retail environment, and we will never compete with them. And we're creating compelling and engaging experiences for consumers all over the world. 
At the beginning of last year, we laid out bold 3-year growth goals, and our strong performance in 2011 was a big down payment toward achieving those goals. And our first quarter results of 2012 continued that momentum. 
First quarter revenue grew 29%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 18%. All of our businesses performed well. First, let's take a look at PayPal. 
We see enormous opportunity for PayPal online, on mobile devices and, increasingly, in the off-line environment as well. And PayPal is delivering this innovation on a global scale. In fact, for the second consecutive quarter, more than half of PayPal's revenue came from outside the U.S., highlighting PayPal's expanding global footprint as people around the world look for a safer, easier way to pay in their domestic markets and across borders. 
Paypal's TPV on eBay was up 18% for the quarter on an FX-neutral basis. This was driven by strong Marketplaces performance and increasing penetration on eBay to nearly 76%. That's a point above the prior quarter and achieves PayPal's 2013 on eBay penetration goal a year ahead of plan. 
In Merchant Services, TPV grew 28% on an FX-neutral basis as more retailers and consumers chose PayPal online. PayPal continued to add more than 1 million new active accounts per month in Q1, ending the quarter with almost 110 million active accounts. 
Innovation is a central focus for PayPal in 2012. During Q1, PayPal launched its first major point-of-sale product at a Home Depot. And today, that product is now available at nearly 2,000 Home Depot stores across the country. This enables PayPal's customers to pay in Home Depot stores by simply swiping a PayPal card or entering their mobile telephone number and PIN. Customers can shop without their wallets, credit cards or even their mobile phones; just pay with PayPal. And this is just the beginning. We have signed contracts with several additional retailers and will begin deploying these retailers over the remainder of this year. 
We also launched a new point-of-sale product for small businesses called PayPal Here. PayPal Here offers small businesses a fully encrypted card reader for Android devices and iPhones, and it accepts all types of payment options. And unlike other solutions in the market, it's global; available in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Hong Kong at launch. The response thus far has been fantastic. More than 200,000 merchants have signed up to receive PayPal Here, which we expect to be widely available in Q2. 
The use of PayPal in mobile applications is also growing. For example, retailer Cumberland Farms recently introduced an app known as SmartPay at 50 of its Boston area convenience store locations. You can now start the gas pump from your smartphone and pay for your gas safely with PayPal. 
As you know, I recently named David Marcus as President of PayPal. David is a successful technology entrepreneur with a real passion for innovation, great products and consumer engagement. He leads with a founder's perspective, and I look forward to closely working with David to help define the future of money and PayPal. 
PayPal also has a strong leadership team, and I want to thank the entire PayPal team for their leadership as we manage through this transition. PayPal didn't skip a beat, and we had great momentum going into Q2 and for the rest of the year. 
Now let's turn to Marketplaces. Our Marketplaces business has turned the corner, shifting from defense to offense, and is delivering accelerating results. Our efforts to make the shopping experience on eBay faster and easier are paying off. We added more than 2 million new active users in Q1, the largest increase in 3 years. 
On an FX-neutral basis, Marketplaces' core GMV growth accelerated 3 points to 13%, both in the U.S. and internationally in the first quarter. Fixed price, which accounted for 64% of our GMV, grew 18%, up 4 points from the prior quarter and auctions grew 3%. We're seeing great results from our investments in tailored and trusted shopping experiences. Fashion, parts and accessories and ticket categories all delivered strong double-digit growth rates. And we continue to improve trust on our sites with nearly half of U.S. GMV coming from top-rated sellers during Q1. 
Same store sales for these top-rated sellers also grew in the U.S., up 22% in the quarter, significantly outpacing e-commerce. And eBay sellers are offering free shipping more than ever on eBay, and free shipping now represents 45% of transactions in Q1, up 16 points year-over-year. 
On the mobile front, we continue to deliver innovative shopping experiences. In March, we launched Watch With eBay, our first iPad app that combines shopping and entertainment. Watch With eBay services merchandise related to what you're watching on TV, enabling you to shop based on inspiration from your favorite TV shows. And in Q1 alone, there were 12 million downloads of eBay Mobile apps, bringing total downloads to 78 million since the launch of eBay Mobile. 
We're also excited about StubHub's international expansion into the U.K. during Q1. StubHub now offers tickets to popular music, sporting and entertainment events across the U.K. with all-in pricing at the point of purchase. This is a first for the U.K. tickets industry, underscoring StubHub's strong commitment to innovation and a great fan experience. 
Let me share some of the Q1 highlights from GSI and our X.commerce platform. As a reminder, both GSI and X.commerce enable merchants of all sizes to compete in this new commerce environment, GSI focusing on larger merchants, X.commerce on smaller. GSI had another strong quarter, driving a 26% increase in same store sales for its clients, again outpacing e-commerce. During the quarter, GSI signed or extended 29 client contracts across their suite of services. 
And in Q2, we're planning a limited rollout of the next generation of GSI's web service technology, or the V11 platform, which will give clients even more flexibility and control over their multichannel commerce experience. And X.commerce, our open commerce ecosystem, launched 2,000 new apps for businesses of all sizes during the first quarter. 
In all, we feel confident about our continued progress at GSI and X.commerce and the synergies that cut across our businesses and platforms. 
In summary, I'm pleased with our strong Q1 performance and our great start to 2012. With our focus on enabling commerce, we're delivering innovative products and great shopping experiences. We're a diverse global commerce company, and we continue to operate with discipline and clarity, leveraging our scale, technologies and capabilities to shape the future of shopping and payments. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide more details on Q1 and our outlook for Q2 and the full year."
27862,171897850,285325,"eBay Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2012",2012-04-18,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. As John indicated, Q1 was a great quarter for the company and a strong start to the second year of our 3-year journey. PayPal, Marketplaces",1397,"Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
As John indicated, Q1 was a great quarter for the company and a strong start to the second year of our 3-year journey. PayPal, Marketplaces and GSI all performed well. 
Revenue increased 29% and non-GAAP EPS grew 18%. From a capital allocation standpoint, we announced 2 acquisitions and the divestiture of Rent.com. And we repurchased approximately 7 million shares of stock. We feel great about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal continues its strong trajectory while innovating on the next generation of payment capabilities; the Marketplaces core business overall is healthy, and investments in new features and functionality continue to make the customer experience even better; and GSI is focused on helping large -- larger retailers succeed in a multichannel world. As a result of our strong first quarter operating performance, we are increasing our outlook for the full year. 
In Q1, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.3 billion, up 29%. Organic revenue growth was 18%, and the inclusion of acquisitions closed in the last 12 months increased our growth by approximately 11 points. 
First quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.55, an 18% increase year-over-year. Strong top line growth drove our outperformance relative to guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9%, down 250 basis points from the first quarter of 2011. The decrease was mainly due to acquisitions and business mix. 
We generated free cash flow of $289 million in the quarter, which was reduced by a onetime tax payment of approximately $300 million related to the gain on the sale of our remaining equity interest in Skype in the fourth quarter.  CapEx was 7% of revenue in the quarter. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had another strong quarter. Revenue reached $1.3 billion, and total payment volume increased to $33.9 billion, up 31% and 25% respectively on an FX-neutral basis. We continued to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 30% and today comprises 46% of overall TPV. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. The net number of payments grew 31%, a 1-point acceleration versus fourth quarter. On eBay TPV grew 18% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by a strong eBay GMV growth and a 480-basis-point increase in PayPal penetration. 
Merchant Services' TPV grew 28% on an FX-neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion of PayPal on merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of checkout. 
Transaction margin was 65.6% in the quarter, up 190 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense. 
PayPal's segment margin came in a 26.4% in the quarter, up 410 basis points from last year. This improvement was mainly due to transaction margin expansion and operating leverage with some strong top line growth. PayPal's transaction segment margins are at the highest level in the last 5 years, while we continue to make significant investments to position for long-term growth. 
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. More consumers are turning to BML for both convenience and choice. BML's TPV was up 51% in Q1, driven by continued strong penetration on and off eBay. And Bill Me Later penetration in the U.S. on eBay and in the PayPal wallet has increased in the past year to more than 1.6% in the quarter. While small compared to other funding choices, this penetration helped to reduce our funding costs. Risk-adjusted margin for the quarter was 16.8%, up 211 basis points year-over-year. 
Now let's move to the Marketplaces business. Overall, Marketplaces achieved net revenues of $1.7 billion, up 13% on an FX-neutral basis. This was driven by FX-neutral transaction revenue growth of 12% and marketing services revenue growth of 16% from our adjacent formats. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces' operational metrics. Sold items grew 17%, a 6-point acceleration from Q4, driven by strong growth in the U.K., China, U.S. and Korea. U.S. non-vehicle GMV grew 13%, driven by strong growth in active users and category sales in fashion, tickets and parts and accessories. International FX-neutral non-vehicles GMV grew 13%, driven by accelerating growth in APAC, strong performance in the U.K. and continued stable growth in Germany. 
From a format perspective, fixed price, a good proxy to compare e-commerce growth, grew 18% on an FX-neutral basis. Marketplaces' segment margin was 38.7% in the quarter, down 180 basis points due primarily to increased investments in technology and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. GSI had a strong quarter. Revenue for Q1 was $237 million, up 15%, driven by strong volume growth partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Adjusting for the impact of the continued shift of clients to the service fee model, year-over-year growth would have been 19%. 
GSI's global e-commerce merchandise sales, or GMS, grew 26% on a same store sales basis, a great result for GSI merchants who have successfully enabled strong e-commerce businesses utilizing GSI's technology platforms and complementary services. GSI marketing services, which is primarily demand generation activities, grew 30% and accounted for 23% of GSI revenue in Q1. GSI's profitability is improving as we capitalize on the synergies we laid out at the time of the acquisition, resulting in a segment margin of 9.5%. 
The GSI integration continues on plan. We expect to begin a limited rollout of the V11 platform during the second quarter. And we are confident that the new platform will provide more flexibility to GSI merchants and give them greater control over their multichannel experiences. We are 9 months post the acquisition of GSI and continue to be excited about the opportunities ahead to help large retailers succeed in both -- in commerce both on and off-line. 
Turning to operating expenses. In Q1, they were 44% of revenue, slightly higher on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by increased investments in product and the customer experience as well as acquisitions, offset by trust improvements and lower buyer protection expense. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we generated free cash flow of $289 million in Q1. We've improved our financial flexibility by funding approximately 50% of the U.S. BML loan receivables portfolio with offshore cash. We closed one acquisition, and we repurchased 7 million shares for $240 million. And we announced an agreement to divest Rent.com because it has limited synergies with our core business. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $7.8 billion, including approximately $1.1 billion in the U.S. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We feel great about the start of the year, and we are increasing our full year guidance by $100 million on the top line and $0.05 on the bottom line. Let me provide you a little more context. 
First, we're increasing our expectations for a strong operating performance by approximately 2 points to reflect the strong results. Second, we have reduced the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar by 1 point to reflect a more stable currency environment versus our expectations back in January. And finally, we are increasing full year non-GAAP tax rate to 19% to 20% to account for some onetime discrete items in the first quarter and expectations for stronger growth in North America for the full year. 
For the full year 2012, we now expect revenues of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion, representing growth of 18% to 21%. And we now anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $2.30 to $2.35, representing growth of 13% to 16%. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenues of $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, representing growth of 18% to 21%. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 to $0.55, representing growth of 10% to 15%. 
In summary, we had a strong beginning to the year and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. PayPal continues its trajectory. The core business is strong and we are driving innovations, both on and off-line. The Marketplaces business is doing well, more users are coming to the site and we continue to invest in search, mobile, local and social to enhance the platform capabilities. And GSI is performing well. We are investing in our business for the long term, and we are focused on delivering the next generation of global commerce and payments capabilities.

It expands PayPal's served market from a $500 million market to a $10 trillion market. And if we just capture 2% of the off-line retail, it's another PayPal. So we're treating this with the same kind of seriousness we did the Merchant Services business 5 years ago and frankly, using a little bit of a similar playbook. So as you know, our focus in 2011 was to build a set of products that could work in large, small and medium-size off-line retailers. And 2012 is all about piloting, testing and learning. This is not a scaling year, it's about piloting, testing and learning. And so in the first quarter, we got the product into Home Depot. As you know, it works with the existing hardware point of sale. And it worked. We worked with Home Depot on scalability and reliability to the point where they were confident by the end of the quarter of rolling it out to all 2,000 stores nationwide. And thus far, we've done no marketing to consumers. Frankly, the only people using it thus far are eBay and Home Depot employees and others that have happened to have seen it. We're now working with Home Depot to start a phase of marketing to consumers, which will come in the May-June time frame, and you'll see that. Now you'll probably see some signage in the Home Depot stores. They will be doing some mailing to their customers. We'll be doing mailings to ours. And that's when we'll really begin to focus on trying to get some consumer engagement around it. And so a good part of the summer will be working on that phase of things. Now in the interim, we've continued to have a pipeline. Don Kingsborough and the team have been working hard signing up other retailers. We have several under contract and during the second half of the year, we'll be bringing those live to site. But again, with very much of a test and learn mindset really, we're trying to get some retailers in different segments to learn. So I feel very good about our progress. And this year is a test and learn year and so that we'll be ready in 2013 and '14 to roll out across different industry categories and globally. And then the last piece, which we didn't really talk about until we announced it, was our off-line product, PayPal Here, focused on smaller off-line retailers and merchants and that we're very excited about. I think it's a very innovative product, it's a product that we can go global with. And the -- our biggest problem there is we're not sure we can manufacture enough devices in the next 60 days to meet up with the demand. But that's the kind of problem we want to have. So all in all, it's a test and learn year for off-line, and we feel good about the progress."

We have seen expansion during the course of the year. And on a year-over-year basis, it's up roughly 24 bps. And it's really driven by 3 factors, 2 that are sustainable and 1 that's a bit of a wild card. The sustainable component is our first Bill Me Later growth. As we continue to grow the Bill Me Later portfolio that we monetize in a different way, we expect our take rate to continue to go up in conjunction with Bill Me Later's component of the overall portfolio. That will continue. Secondly, as you know, we got a significant cross-border trade business in PayPal. It's roughly 25% of our total volume. And we've made some very modest changes into FX fees over the course of the last year to have a competitive offering, but tweaked up slightly. And small little tweaks on that big cross-border business has a positive impact on our take rate. Those 2, Bill Me Later growth and buyer FX fees, will continue. The third is just the gains on the hedges that we have in place, the revenue hedges that we have in place that flow to the PayPal line. That obviously is more dependent on how currencies go, and I wouldn't be counting on that one. It's a ongoing core piece of the business. So some sustainable, some not, but good, continued performance, primarily Bill Me Later growth. Second question's Marketplace operating margin. I mean, as we said 4 years ago, 35% to 45%; and a year ago, 38% to 42%. We feel very good about that range. And the natural dynamics for us are usually it comes down a little bit in Q1 and Q2 and Q3 as we invest ahead of the back-to-school and holiday season, and then goes up in Q4. So I would say that this year will be no different than prior years. And as we indicated back in January, we still feel good about our 38% to 42% operating margin next year as well."

Do you -- are you concerned that as you continue to grow at these rates, banks that operate the ACH and participate in it will try to impede your access to it by either increasing your prices or charging consumers for linking their PayPal accounts to their checking accounts?"

And maybe, I'm going to just elaborate a bit because the frequency in which we gets asked -- we get asked this question is higher. And the practical reality is we don't consider it that big a deal, but let me elaborate",419,"I guess, Gil, it's a good question. And maybe, I'm going to just elaborate a bit because the frequency in which we gets asked -- we get asked this question is higher. And the practical reality is we don't consider it that big a deal, but let me elaborate a little bit. First, to your point, yes, ACH is one of the multiple funding sources in the PayPal wallet. And relatively speaking, it is a fairly low-cost -- a low-cost funding source. So it's an important part of our business. Secondly, I think as you know, the Fed kind of sets the rates and charges financial institutions a fee to process those payments. And we do not expect the Fed or the governor of the network to make any changes to rates. If anything, we would expect the trend of going down to continue. The third then has been the financial institutions pass on any rates to their clients. And on that front, this is a fairly competitive world and lots of the banks provide this service. And for us, we go through a very competitive process, leveraging our scale, eBay Inc. as a whole and our scale within PayPal, to get very competitive rates in a very competitive environment on behalf of our merchants and our consumers. So given that we -- lastly, I should say, we have 4 more years left on our contract. And within that contract, we're not -- we're well protected for any inflationary pressures that may come along the way that we don't think are going to happen. So I think we feel pretty good about that as a funding source in the wallet and that its cost will stay relatively low. All that said, let me maybe put this into context a little bit. Even though we don't expect any inflationary pressures, if our ACH costs went up 5x of where they are today, it's less than 1 point of operating margin on PayPal. So we don't expect them to go up. We're contractually locked out for 4 more years. And our wildest imagine -- imagination is if they go up 5x, it's less than 1 point of operating profit today and much less than 1 point 4 years from now when our contract expires. So it's -- yes, it's a good question. I apologize for the lengthy answer, but the frequency that we get asked, I think, is important enough for us to just elaborate on that one a little bit."

The -- well, the nice thing about the first quarter results are frankly that they are an accumulation of the hard work we've been doing over the last 3 or 4 years to improve the user experience, both the product experience, the trust, the quality of products on the site, the quality of sellers. And so the data I look at is buyer retention. And buyer retention is up in the U.S. and across the globe. The second thing, as you know over the last several years, people have been saying, ""When are we going to start marketing to bring back inactive users or bring new users to the site?"" And under Devin's leadership over the last really 6 months, we have really ramped that up. As you know, we did a brand campaign in the fourth quarter, and we're starting to start marketing. And Devin and I were just sitting down; he was showing me some data yesterday where our active buyer growth is up 9.5% in the core Marketplace business. So we're beginning to reach out to people that haven't used eBay in a while or never used eBay, and they're responding. And they like what they see. So I think that's adding to the growth and that's adding to our optimism. And then as you said, another focus Devin's brought is the focus on the BRIC markets. And we were going through some data, just some of the fact that -- the user growth, the buyer growth in some of the BRIC markets, in India, in Brazil and Russia, in Eastern Europe and in China. And they're very significant user growth rates. Now they're under relatively small bases. And right now, they're importing product. But as large numbers of new users come online in the BRIC markets and in the -- and in emerging markets, they won't have a local e-commerce market at first, and they're going to be looking to kind of global e-commerce sites that specialize in cross-border trade. That, of course, is what we do. eBay does it, PayPal enables it. And so again, I think that we'll see increased focus and we'll increase focus on bringing buyers to the site, both in the U.S. and around the globe, and then try to deliver a great experience so that we retain those buyers. And you add that together and that's why we're optimistic. I'll also say we have a couple of -- a nice series of product enhancements during the year. You're going to see some really, really good stuff around the checkout experience on eBay. We're finally going to -- given the fact that we own eBay and PayPal, we're going to improve the checkout experience on eBay. You're going to see some search improvements. You're going to see some fun areas and discovery, and so things -- more to come on a steady stream of product enhancements on eBay. So all in all, we're feeling good about that business."

I think you're going to see even more on that, and some of the stuff I'm really personally excited about is some of the stuff that Steve Yankovich and our mobile team are doing around visual recognition and search, which is sort of how you want to engage with a fashion experience. And then consumer electronics is a category that lends itself to catalog issue. As you said which you saw, we've rolled out the product-based experience in consumer electronics. The kinds of things that are on the to-do list going forward, it varies a little bit by market. But collectibles, I -- you'll see us do some things in collectibles. Sporting goods and baby goods are 2 sort of subcategories where we're working hard to bring the right inventory on and provide a good experience. With respect to search, Mark Carges and the team of -- have done a great job with some of the vertical shopping experiences and different search algorithms by vertical. They're now building the underlying search platform, which we'll roll out during this year. And the implication of that is that we call the Cassini internally. And historically, the search on eBay has been matching keyword match in the title, and that's really how we recall search on eBay. What Cassini will now do is will search the entire listing for search terms and match the search query with that. So we think that will improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of search recall. And lastly, on first quarter, I -- Bob can probably comment on specific things. The thing I'll note is e-commerce is growing. I mean, mobile is having a big impact on the e-commerce market. The e-commerce stats came out yesterday in the U.S., and they were up a couple of points in -- for the month of March 17%, and we're benefiting from that. And frankly, I think our mobile apps are helping to drive that. So..."

First, as you may remember from a year ago, for different reasons but the same impact, growth from China and Korea was relatively slow. In China, because we took some actions to ensure that the volume coming from our greater Chinese sellers were providing great experiences for our consumers in our developed markets, growth slowed until they could adjust their business models to provide great experiences. So in China, we saw a real healthy growth on volume in sold items because our sellers have really responded to the increased expectations of consumers. So that was one. I think, two, in Korea, a little bit of the same. Our competitive position in Korea is getting stronger. We're investing more behind it, and our sold item growth is accelerating because our business is stronger and our comps are relatively easy. I think on the U.S., John covered it.

One,",462,"Yes, great question. First, maybe a little bit of context. As we indicated early last year, our expectations for PayPal over the 3-year time frame is we'll roughly double the size of the business. And that would really come in 3 different components. One, we continue to grow on eBay in the mid to upper single digits. Secondly, Bill Me Later would grow north of 40%. And third, to your question, Merchant Services would grow over that 3-year time frame of 25% to 30%. Those 3 components are what would drive the doubling of PayPal from essentially 2010 to 2013. So we said 25% to 30% for Merchant Services. Last year, Merchant Services performed much higher than that. It was up in the mid-30s, about 34%. So we're off to a great start one year in. And we increased the guidance in effect for the 3-year journey at the beginning of this year. This quarter, another good, strong quarter. Merchant Services' TPV had 28% growth, which keeps us well on track, maybe even a little bit ahead of our 3-year plan. So we feel very good about where we are. In terms of maybe context around the deceleration that happened last year, I'd say 2 things. One, wild changes in currencies, particularly for Europeans, impacts our cross-border trade, and that started to happen in Q3 and again in Q4 and that was a big component of the deceleration. Currency from Q4 to Q1 had been relatively stable. And therefore, our business -- sorry, Merchant Services has remained relatively stable growth from Q4 to Q1 because there's no wild cards. I think underneath the covers a little bit, European growth is slower. The growth in Europe, we had a great quarter as a company. eBay in Europe was very strong. PayPal growth in Europe slowed. And when we look at same store sales for our merchants in Europe, we're contending with some slowness, what we would say is really more economy-centric than the progress that our teams are making, getting new merchants and more consumer share of wallet. So 25% to 30% is what we said 5 quarters into our 12-quarter journey. We're in a -- we're in very good shape, some things working for us, some things working against, but we feel very good about the plans we laid out. And then as John mentioned, one last thing. In that 3-year plan, we didn't include anything in the off-line world. And the -- our ambitions are to take what we did in the online world, take them into the off-line world for small, medium and large merchants and dramatically increase the denominator of the served market to accelerate growth even more in -- as we exit 2013 and into 2014 and beyond."

So I think location-based payments is something that you'll see a lot of innovation around. And just as we -- in PayPal Here, you see us using the check-in feature on location-based payment fees to be quite powerful, the GPS devices and smartphones. But again, it's not dependent upon an NFC for the last inch. So I don't know.

And I'm thrilled we're at the front end of that in sort of 2 ways. One, having applications and products that allow you to actually close a transaction on a mobile device. And so eBay Mobile volume continues to just be on fire. PayPal mobile payments volume continues to be on fire. And so consumers are using their mobile devices to shop and to pay. And our applications are compelling, and I think we will certainly beat some of the goals we set out for the year on those 2 fronts. The other story, though, is consumers are using mobile devices as part of their shopping experience even if they don't actually close the transaction on a mobile device. And some of the innovations that we're driving and doing, I think, are quite interesting on that front. I'll highlight 2. One -- or 3 really. One is what we're doing around local commerce with RedLaser, Milo and PayPal, right, which we believe is providing an experience that will help drive foot traffic into large retailers. And we're working with retailers like Toys R Us and Best Buy and others to make that a compelling experience. Second example on the iPad is this notion of shop while you're watching TV. I think Nielsen produced a report that says something like 80% of smartphone and iPad or tablet users use their devices while watching TV. And so our Mobile team came up with this application where while you're watching TV with the eBay iPad app, you enter whatever channel you're watching and the TV show that you're watching. eBay inventory associated with that TV show pops up, and it's a very compelling experience. And now we're doing some experimentation with some celebrity curation and other things. So this whole notion of a dual-device experience, having an iPad or a smartphone in your lap while you're watching TV, I think you'll see a lot of shopping innovation around that. And again, we're -- we hope to be enabling that. The last thing I'd say then is the -- I think some -- the innovation around mobile is actually just beginning. It's -- some of the location-based capabilities that these mobile devices enable are going to have impact on shopping and paying. PayPal Here, that check-in feature, which allows the small retailer or small merchant to know you by name and by face when you come in. I think that visual search capabilities that -- and additional recognition will have an impact on our fashion experience and on shopping. And so we're doubling down on our mobile investment and feel very good about the innovations that are happening and are finding a growing number of retailers and merchants who are coming to us saying, ""Can you help us in this mobile world?"" So it's fun and it's not going away."

Number one, in the Marketplace side, John, I guess I'm curious. How much of the improvement there do you attribute to the specific changes you've outlined that you're making to the marketplace versus perhaps just a natural equilibrium point setting in for eBay, which would suggest growth in line with e-commerce regardless of the conscious changes you're making? And then secondly, on PayPal. Just looking at the growth in accounts and the spread there versus the growth in the number of payments, we see users are paying with PayPal more frequently. So I wonder if that's -- if the higher engagement is coming from the incremental growth on mobile or perhaps more or broader acceptance of PayPal on e-commerce sites or something else. If you could talk about that."

I think 2 things. I think the answer to both of your questions is both. I think the changes we've made were essential. I think the marketplace would not have turned around. It wouldn't be where it is today without the changes we've driven. It's a more trusted, better experience. And I believe we're at a new equilibrium. And now, Devin and his team are trying to build off of that new equilibrium. Our aspiration is now going to be above e-commerce. So -- and over time that's what we'll be driving toward. So I feel that the marketplace is in a strong and sustainable place today that we'll build off of. And in PayPal, I think mobile is enhancing the engagement and the ubiquity of PayPal. And when you look at ubiquity on the web, we continue to sign additional merchants around the world up where they're putting PayPal on their online site. PayPal on a mobile device is proven to have higher conversion, and so more and more people are putting PayPal checkout on their mobile applications. And then moving into the off-line world is that third leg of ubiquity, both with large merchants and small merchants, with our point-of-sale product in PayPal Here. And our strategy is quite clearly if PayPal is everywhere, that's going to increase the likelihood that consumers engage with it, which is good for the business, both online and off. So I guess the answer to your question is yes on both fronts. 
All right, everyone, thank you very much and we'll talk to you in 3 months."

In the se",1252,"Thanks, Tracy, and good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our Q2 earnings call. We had another great quarter. Every part of our company showed strength and we feel good about our momentum as we reshaped how people around the world shop and pay. In the second quarter, revenue is up 23% and non-GAAP EPS is up 16%, a strong finish to the first half of the year. 
As we consistently execute against our 3-year growth plans, there's no question that an inflection point is occurring in retail. Mobile is revolutionizing how people shop and pay, becoming the digital nexus of consumers' lives. They want what they want, when they want it, anywhere, any time. We now expect eBay and PayPal Mobile to each handle over $10 billion in volume transacted this year, a stunning surge in purchases and payments on devices that did not even exist just a few short years ago. Online and  offline commerce is becoming seamless and global, and retailers of all sizes need a partner who will help them navigate in this new world, compete effectively and deeply engage their consumers. And this is our focus: enabling commerce, helping consumers shop any time, anywhere and helping retailers of all sizes compete and win in this new commerce environment, and we will not compete with them. 
With our strong portfolio, each quarter, we're demonstrating our capabilities, our focus on innovation and our commitment to delivering against the bold goals we set for ourselves. I'm pleased with where we are and excited about what's to come. 
Now let's take a look at the quarter, starting with PayPal. This business continues to generate enormous opportunity and drive strong performance. PayPal is delivering real innovation, not just promises, to all segments of the market on a global scale, from small businesses to large retailers, to consumers everywhere. PayPal's global reach is a competitive advantage, and for the third consecutive quarter, more than half of PayPal's revenue came from outside the U.S. We're enabling safer, easier and more convenient ways to pay for consumers and merchants around the world. 
PayPal's TPV on eBay was up 18% for the quarter on an FX-neutral basis. This is driven by strong Marketplaces performance and increasing penetration on eBay, which was up 420 basis points year-over-year. In Merchant Services, TPV grew 26% on an FX-neutral basis. PayPal continued to add more than 1 million new active accounts per month in Q2, ending the quarter with over 113 million active accounts. 
PayPal continues to innovate. In Q2, we announced 15 retailers in addition to Home Depot, who will be implementing our point-of-sale product. Two of them are already live. Abercrombie and Fitch beta tested and began rolling out PayPal point-of-sale to over 900 stores across the U.S. in just 4 weeks, in time for the critical back-to-school shopping season. And in Q2, men's retailer, Joseph A. Banks, begun expanding its pilot to a full national rollout of over 550 stores. In addition, Office Depot recently not only signed up for PayPal's point-of-sale but also signed up for PayPal Online and PayPal Mobile. This is a great example of how we can provide comprehensive, innovative multichannel support to retailers, and how we can drive growth in our core business while expanding PayPal's presence off-line. 
Our small business product, PayPal Here, the only global product of its kind, is also generating strong interest. PayPal Here has been introduced in 4 markets, and in Q2, we announced the joint venture with SOFTBANK in Japan, which will bring PayPal Here to the world's third largest economy. And as of this week, we're pleased to announce general availability of PayPal Here on iPhone and Android to any merchant in the U.S. and Hong Kong who applies, including the over 300,000 customers who have signed up for our waiting list since announcement. 
As I mentioned in my opening, PayPal Mobile has strong momentum. Our new estimate of $10 billion in payment volume transacted for 2012 is up 150% over last year. Through PayPal Mobile, consumers increasingly have a more convenient way to pay in a growing number of everyday situations. For example, in Q2, 4 major high-speed retailers in the U.K. began accepting payments using a new PayPal in- after. And Starbucks added PayPal to the Android version of their app in the U.S. 
Now, let's turn to Marketplaces. Simply put, eBay had a great Q2, the best we've seen in years. In fact, on an FX-neutral basis, this was eBay's strongest quarter of year-over-year organic core GMV growth since 2006. Our multiyear focus to transform and reposition this business for the future is paying off. eBay is revitalized. We're more relevant today than ever to buyers and sellers globally. We've improved trust, enhanced value and selection, built better product experiences and become more customer-focused. And it's working. We believe the best is yet to come as we continue to drive innovation to serve our customers in a seamless multichannel retail environment and tap the full potential of eBay. 
In Q2, GMV, excluding vehicles, accelerated 2 points on an FX-neutral basis to 15%. Sold items also accelerated as did growth in active users, demonstrating that our improved eBay Marketplace is attracting more new users. And our fixed price format continues to be strong, growing 20% in the quarter on an FX-neutral basis. Fixed price is now consistently well over 60% of FX-neutral GMV, underscoring what a different and more relevant marketplace eBay it today for buyers and sellers. 
Top-rated sellers generated more than half of U.S. GMV and their same-store sale grew 18% in the quarter. And our sellers are offering more free shipping than ever. During Q2, 48% of transactions shipped free, up 11 points over the prior year. And Mobile continues to be a game changer, and eBay Mobile continues to be a leader with transacted mobile volume expected to double in 2012. 
Our mobile apps have been downloaded nearly 90 million times, and we're seeing incredible velocity steps. For example, sellers are listing almost 2 million items on mobile devices each week. A woman's handbag is purchased on eBay Mobile every 30 seconds. More than 8,000 cars and 340,000 car parts are sold each week before eBay -- through eBay mobile apps. And Mobile continues to attract new customers. In Q2, 600,000 new customers made their first purchase on eBay through our mobile apps. 
So again, a great quarter for eBay with strong momentum. We believe this business will continue to deliver strong, steady sustainable growth. 
Let me briefly share some Q2 highlights from GSI. GSI had another strong quarter, driving at 21% increase in same-store sales for its clients, once again outpacing e-commerce. A year after completing this acquisition, we feel very good about the synergies of GSI in our portfolio and the momentum and potential of this business. GSI is an essential part of enabling us to partner with large retailers and brands and drive multichannel commerce. 
In summary, our company had a strong second quarter and strong first half to 2012. We have a strong global portfolio, we are well-positioned to enable the future of commerce and lead through the dynamic changes occurring in how people shop and pay. We're focused on innovation and on serving our customers, and we will continue to operate with discipline, clarity, and we're committed to achieving our long-term objectives. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob who'll provide more details on Q2 and on our outlook for Q3 and the full year."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
Q2 was a great quarter for the company. Revenue increased 23%, margins expanded for each of our 3 businesses versus last year and non-GAAP EPS grew 16%. We feel excellent about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal continues its strong growth while innovating on the next-generation of payment capabilities. The Marketplaces businesses is healthy and getting stronger and GSI continues to help large retailers succeed in a multichannel world. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we generated $411 million of free cash flow. We repurchased approximately 9 million shares of common stock and announced the $2 billion increase to our stock buyback program. We feel confident about our performance and are maintaining guidance for the full year. 
In Q2, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.4 billion, up 23%. Organic revenue growth was 18%, foreign currency movements decreased growth by roughly 3 points and the inclusion of recently closed acquisitions increased growth by roughly 8 points. 
Second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.56, a 16% increase year-over-year. Strong top line growth drove our outperformance relative to guidance. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.3%, down 30 basis points from the second quarter 2011. The decrease was mainly due to acquisitions and business mix. 
Let me provide a little more context on our Q2 results. Compared to the guidance we gave back in April, there are 3 things we're highlighting that impacted our actual performance. First, and most importantly, better performance from our businesses, primarily Marketplaces, generating approximately $70 million in revenue and contributing an additional $0.02 of earnings. Second, a favorable ruling related to an indirect tax position in Korea positively impacted international Marketplaces transaction revenue by approximately $29 million and non-GAAP EPS by $0.02. And third, a higher sequential non-GAAP tax rate due to onetime adjustment of reserves related to U.S. taxation of certain foreign earnings from prior periods negatively impacted non-GAAP EPS by $0.02. 
In summary, there's several moving parts in the quarter, but overall, very strong results and a very strong first half to the year. 
We generated free cash flow of $411 million in the quarter. CapEx was 10% of revenues due primarily to investments in technology and infrastructure. We expect full year CapEx in the range of 8% to 10% of revenue. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a strong quarter. Revenue reached $1.4 billion and total payment volume increased to $34.5 billion, up 27% and 23% respectively on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 24% and comprising 47% of overall TPV in the quarter. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. The net number of payments grew 31%, flat with the first quarter. On eBay TPV grew 18% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by strong eBay non-vehicles GMV growth and a 420 basis point increase in PayPal penetration. 
Merchant Services TPV grew 26% on an FX-neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion of PayPal on merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of checkout. The deceleration versus Q1 was due to macro pressure in the Eurozone and softness in cross-border trade to Europe. Transaction margin was 66.3% in the quarter, up 270 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense. And PayPal's segment margin came in at 25.8%, up 390 basis points from last year. The improvement was mainly due to transaction margin expansion and operating leverage. 
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. More consumers are turning to BML for both convenience and choice. BML's TPV was up 39% in the quarter, driven by continued strong penetration on and off eBay. And Bill Me Later penetration in the U.S. on eBay and in the PayPal wallet increased to approximately 1.8% in the quarter. While small compared to other funding choices, this penetration helps to reduce our funding cost. Risk-adjusted margin for the quarter was 15.5%, down one point over last year due primarily to a higher loss rate. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Marketplaces had a strong quarter, with net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 14% on an FX-neutral basis. This was driven by FX-neutral transaction revenue growth of 14%, and marketing services revenue growth of 11% from our adjacent formats. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces' operational metrics. Sold items grew 20%, a 3-point acceleration from Q1, driven by strong double-digit growth across all our major markets. U.S. non-vehicles GMV grew 14%, up from 13% last quarter, driven by accelerating growth in active users and strong performance in category sales in fashion, tickets and products and accessories. 
The user experience on eBay continues to improve, driving a robust domestic business. This more than offset the impact from weaker cross-border trade activity, which negatively impacted the U.S. growth rate. International FX-neutral non vehicles GMV grew 16%, a 3-point acceleration. Performance was driven by strong growth in both APAC and the EU. 
Take rate, excluding vehicles, StubHub and the onetime item was flat versus last year. In Marketplaces, segment margin was 39.6% in the quarter, up 80 basis points primarily due to the benefit from indirect taxes partially offset by increased investments in technology and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. GSI had a good quarter. Revenue for Q2 was $221 million, up 9%, driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Adjusting for the impact of the continued shift of clients to the service fee model, year-over-year growth would have been 12%. Global e-commerce merchandise sales or GMS grew 21% on a same-store sales basis. GSI marketing services, which is primarily demand generation activities, grew 27% and accounted for 26% of GSI's revenues in the quarter. And GSI's profitability is improving as we capitalize on the synergies we laid out at the time of the acquisition, resulting in a segment margin of 4.7% for the quarter. The margin is down versus the prior quarter due to seasonality and investments in the B11 platform. 
Q2 marks the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of GSI, and we have made great progress in realizing the operating synergies of the businesses. PayPal's share of checkout on GSI's volume in the quarter was 13%, up from 12% last quarter. And GSI's marketing products and solutions have been integrated into Magento, part of our X.commerce business. 
B11's platform is progressing, but not as fast as we would like. We expect merchant deployment to begin after the upcoming peak holiday season, further testing is required to meet our highest expectations of the product for our clients. 
We are leveraging GSI's expertise in serving large merchants to deliver -- to help us deliver commerce solutions across all of our platforms. We're making great progress, and we have further opportunities ahead. 
Turning to operating expenses, in Q2, there were 45% of revenue, slightly lower on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by operating leverage. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated free cash flow of $411 million in the quarter. We've improved our financial flexibility by funding approximately 53% of the U.S. Bill Me Later loan receivables portfolio with offshore cash. We closed one acquisition and one disposition, and we repurchased 9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $350 million. And today, we also announce the $2 billion increased to our stock buyback program for the purposes of managing dilution from stock-based compensation. 
We end the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and not equity investments of $7.6 billion, including approximately $700 million in the U.S. We have a strong balance sheet and free cash flow, which should allow us to finance our organic needs and stock buyback programs over the near to medium term, and we do not anticipate meaningful M&A activity in the near term. However, most of our cash is generated and resides offshore. We will remain opportunistic when assessing sources of additional liquidity, and to the extent we increase current levels, we expect it will negatively impact our net income and earnings per share. 
Now, let me turn to guidance. We feel great about the first half of the year. Despite significant macro headwinds in the second half of the year, we are maintaining the full year guidance we provided back in April. 
For the full year 2012, we continue to expect revenue of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion, representing growth of 18% to 21%. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $2.30 to $2.35, representing growth of 13% to 16%. 
Let me provide a little more clarity. First, our North America business is performing stronger than our expectations, and we continue to gain operating leverage on our cost base. Second, Europe and European currencies remain under pressure. This is impacting PayPal Europe organic growth, cross-border trade to Europe and translation of foreign revenue into U.S. dollars. And third, we continue to invest in marketing and technology and new growth opportunities such as emerging markets, offline and mobile. 
Our expected full year non-GAAP tax rate remains in the range of 19% to 20%, and we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. We are increasingly confident in our outlook for 2012 and our plans for 2013. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, representing growth of 11% to 15% and we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 to $0.55, representing growth of 10% to 15%. 
In summary, we feel good about our performance and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. As PayPal continues its strong growth with increasing focus on simplifying and improving financial products and the consumer experience, the Marketplaces business is thriving, with strength across all geographies driven by improvements in buyer experience from our investments. And GSI is performing in line with our expectations as it continues to build its client portfolio and help eBay deliver commerce solutions for large merchants, leveraging our portfolio of assets. We're investing in our business through the long-term, and we are focused on delivering the next generation of global commerce and payments capabilities.

The second would be the recent marketing campaign, third would be mobile engagement and fourth would be potentially skew growth from large merchants in the fashion inventory that you've added, which is improved selections. I'm just wondering, John, if you can rank order those in terms of their effects on this change in frequency of purchase or any other factors that would've driven it and how sustainable that you think that is."

As you said, the way I look at it, there's really 2 things going on here. One, we've made an enormous amount of change to the site in the past years, including trust and search, including bringing more selection. And that was clearly driving greater frequency of our existing users or more transactions per user. And that continues to be the case. Starting 9 months ago was really the first time we began marketing to new users, right, starting fourth quarter last year, By It New, Buy It Now. And we're seeing nice response in new users coming. And when we poll them, they like what they're seeing and they're doing a second and third transaction. And then the thing that I think underlines both is Mobile because if you think about it, 4 years ago, the only time you can access eBay is when you are in front of a laptop or in front of a desktop, which is maybe a couple of hours a day. Now, you can access eBay seven days a week, 24 hours a day with your mobile device. And that's helping with existing users and it's helping acquire new users as you saw. 600,000 new users in Q2 alone. So to be honest, even our internal metrics, we can't tease these out separately to force rank them, but I'll say the way I'm thinking about it is our existing users like it. MPS is going up and they're buying more. And the new news really in the last 9 months isn't an accelerating growth rate of new users who are trying us whether it's through mobile or through the web. They like what they see and they're coming back. And we want to keep pouring kerosene on that ladder fire to keep it going."

I wonder if you can talk about what you suggest specifically driving this growth, for example Marketplaces of the people are carrying the phones into their stores or is it perhaps tablets who are seeing couch commerce become more impactful. And then related to PayPal, roughly how much of the mobile volume is related to eBay transactions versus the other applications of PayPal in the phones?"

What's interesting is our analysis indicates that at least that much of volume that closes on the web, their consumer access to mobile device at some point in the shopping experience. So as you said, mobile is impacting a significant portion of eBay's business, either at some point in the shopping experience and/or the transaction closes on it. The kinds of things we're seeing that's interesting on eBay Mobile is, let me just take the Parts category, the Motor Parts category referenced earlier, I just said 340,000 parts a day are being closed. As we unpack that, we're finding more and more users, in this case, our target motorist buyer, which is a male, 30 to 50 years old, they're actually using the mobile device while they're under the hood. And they can scan the code and take the picture of the back of the car. And when they see the parts they want, they do a search on their mobile device while under the car, our search results only show them parts that fit their car. And so that they're ordering right there on the spot. So similarly, as you described it, we are seeing consumers go into stores or walk down the street, use their mobile device out there to do their investigation or in some cases, to shop. So what we're certain about is mobile is having a profound impact in consumer behavior. And we are aggressively driving innovation, both to close transactions on mobile but also to enhance the shopping experience, even if the transaction doesn't close on mobile. In many ways, PayPal is the same thing. If you look at PayPal Here, it's a great example of driving new use used cases where PayPal can be used. So to your direct question, PayPal is used as the way to pay on a significant portion of the eBay transactions closed on mobile devices but not all. But what's really growing is PayPal off of eBay on the mobile arena, because retailers and merchants are finding when they put PayPal Mobile Express Checkout on their app or on their website, they're seeing significantly increased conversion. And what we know in both business units is mobile shoppers and mobile payers are 3 to 4x more valuable than web-only, simply because they're more engaged in their products and they're buying more. So it's I can't underestimate the importance of mobile to what we see as the future of commerce and payments."

Just given more high-profile brands and retail are on the site now. The sweet spot for eBay historically hasn't been new in season merchandise.

But new items is absolutely our sweet spot. And retailers and brands are finding new items that may be one season out of season, or 2 seasons out of season, all the way through liquidation stock. That's their sweet spot for eBay. So we estimate over 70% of the items are new on eBay. And buyers are responding to expanding selection because what you're having is more and more sellers, be they retailers or be they traditional eBay sellers, are bringing more of their new but somewhat out of season inventory on to eBay. There's one other category. It's interesting that's kind of evolving, which is the scarce category. eBay has always been the place where something may be new and scarce and so the auction format is really an interesting vehicle for that. And recently, we just announced a holiday collective of designers who are designing exclusive goods for the Holiday on eBay. The recent designers love it and goes directly to consumers and that will create scarcity value. So that I would say a small but growing category of goods on eBay."

I think one of the decisions we've made early on in mobile that has served us very well is it from the beginning, we said, ""We're not going to worry if it's incremental or not."" And so it's a kind of thing we could've spent years having our financial analysts figuring out is this incremental, is mobile profitable, dot, dot, dot. We said mobile is a movement that consumers want. And we've invested heavily in that. Now when we sit down with a retailer or, what we can say is, ""When you put mobile Express Checkout on your mobile website or on a mobile app, cart conversion will go up because it's very proven that consumers don't want to enter in their credit card information into a mobile device, and PayPal is the safest way to pay."" And we think conversion can go up to 10%, 20%, 30%. We've not released statistics verified by retailer, other but I think retailers find their cart version goes up when they put Mobile Express Checkout on their mobile web or app. And by the way, Mobile Express Checkout is the same integration as Express Checkout. So and what it's doing is for the retailers is the same thing I described it was doing for eBay earlier. It allows the retailer to extend their reach outside the limitations of their store. And so now, you have here a retailer like Office Depot, who just signed with PayPal. No longer will the only way time you reach your consumers be when they're in the Office Depot store or when they're on the Office Depot website, but through mobile, Office Depot can be reaching their consumers 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. So retailers see the value of mobile and increasingly they're embracing PayPal Mobile in aggressive ways."

But there's no, I'd say, no standout patterns or standout differences in the pattern between the 2. And with respect to online sales tax, our position is the same as it has been for years now, that our focus is on protecting small business from undue taxation or taxation that it's differentially difficult for them to handle administratively. And so while online sales tax will probably happen at some point in the future, our focus is it to do nationally what we did last year in California where we worked with the California legislature and created a small business exclusion where a small business that sold less than $1 million in California didn't have to collect cross state sales tax. And that -- it's a burden an administrative burden I can't handle. So we'll continue to do that to protect the smallest of our sellers."

And now we're adding those merchants with mobile and with offline. So that you begin to see PayPal everywhere  So kind of Ubiquity. Then, we're trying to focus on building great products so that it increases more volume per user. People are using PayPal more and you see that happening. Today, we're adding digital uses, we are adding BML uses, we're adding mobile uses. And then the third area where there's actual absolutely more focus and David Marcus has brought more focus is adding more consumers to the top of the funnel. The truth is we've been adding sort of a million, roughly a million new consumers a month for the last 3 years, and as the denominator gets bigger, our active user growth rate is coming down a little bit. And Dave has really brought an increased focus on the product experience for new users signing up to streamline registration flows, allow someone to sign up on a mobile device. You may have seen we brought Card IO yesterday. You can envision a world in the not-so-distant future where you just frankly take a snapshot of your drivers license and credit cards to form of PayPal account. So I think one of the pieces of the PayPal play book that I think you'll see increased focus on is just consumer acquisition, which then again leads to consumer engagement, which leads to which is supported by the merchant ubiquity. And as you said, we're growing. We think we're going 2 to 3x faster than the markets. We're clearly gaining share in the web. We're gaining share in mobile, and our aspirations in offline is so we can get a little piece of the  offline market. We think that can really add to our business."

We expect a little more impact in the quarter as a whole. So that's why Q3 is a little bit lower. I would just say by business units in our Q2 results, Marketplaces, despite the relative headwinds we're dealing with in the macro environment, Europe Marketplaces had a great quarter across-the-board in Europe.

What's also happening is auction growth rates are coming back a little bit and simply, the mix of fixed-price and auction are such that our blended growth rate, GMV growth rate this quarter is 15%. So we actually think the marketplace grew roughly at e-commerce growth rates in Q2. Where all the dialogue for us is going forward and kind of focus when it's bringing to the marketplace is how do we build on top of that? And who's got focus on how we leverage our data more effectively, strong multiyear focus on leveraging our data and he brings some great and experience on Reuters leveraging data cross-platform. How do we expand more aggressively to BRIC markets, initially with cross-border and then overtime with domestic. Again, the second big multiyear initiative.

We had another great quarter. Every part of our company showed strength and we feel good about our momentum as we reshape how people around the world shop and pay. In the s",1255,"Thanks, Tracey, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q2 earnings call. We had another great quarter. Every part of our company showed strength and we feel good about our momentum as we reshape how people around the world shop and pay. In the second quarter, revenue is up 23% and non-GAAP EPS is up 16%, a strong finish to the first half of the year. 
As we consistently execute against our 3-year growth plans, there is no question that an inflection point is occurring in retail. Mobile is revolutionizing how people shop and pay, becoming the digital nexus of consumers' lives. They want what they want, when they want it, anywhere, any time. We now expect eBay and PayPal Mobile to each handle over $10 billion in volume transacted this year, a stunning surge in purchases and payments on devices that did not even exist just a few short years ago. Online and  offline, commerce is becoming seamless and global, and retailers of all sizes need a partner who will help them navigate in this new world, compete effectively and deeply engage their consumers. And this is our focus: enabling commerce, helping consumers shop any time, anywhere and helping retailers of all sizes compete and win in this new commerce environment, and we will not compete with them. 
With our strong portfolio, each quarter, we're demonstrating our capabilities, our focus on innovation and our commitment to delivering against the bold goals we set for ourselves. I'm pleased with where we are and excited about what's to come. 
Now let's take a look at the quarter, starting with PayPal. This business continues to generate enormous opportunity and drive strong performance. PayPal is delivering real innovation, not just promises, to all segments of the market on a global scale, from small businesses to large retailers, to consumers everywhere. PayPal's global reach is a competitive advantage, and for the third consecutive quarter, more than half of PayPal's revenue came from outside the U.S. We're enabling safer, easier and more convenient ways to pay for consumers and merchants around the world. 
PayPal's TPV on eBay was up 18% for the quarter on an FX-neutral basis. This is driven by strong Marketplaces performance and increasing penetration on eBay, which was up 420 basis points year-over-year. In Merchant Services, TPV grew 26% on an FX-neutral basis. PayPal continued to add more than 1 million new active accounts per month in Q2, ending the quarter with over 113 million active accounts. 
PayPal continues to innovate. In Q2, we announced 15 retailers in addition to Home Depot, who will be implementing our point-of-sale product. Two of them are already live. Abercrombie & Fitch beta tested and began rolling out PayPal point-of-sale to over 900 stores across the U.S. in just 4 weeks, in time for the critical back-to-school shopping season. And in Q2, men's retailer, Joseph A. Banks, begun expanding its pilot to a full national rollout of over 550 stores. In addition, Office Depot recently, not only signed up for PayPal's point-of-sale, but also signed up for PayPal Online and PayPal Mobile. This is a great example of how we can provide comprehensive, innovative multichannel support to retailers, and how we can drive growth in our core business while expanding PayPal's presence off-line. 
Our small business product, PayPal Here, the only global product of its kind, is also generating strong interest. PayPal Here has been introduced in 4 markets, and in Q2, we announced the joint venture with Softbank in Japan, which will bring PayPal Here to the world's third largest economy. And as of this week, we're pleased to announce general availability of PayPal Here on iPhone and Android to any merchant in the U.S. and Hong Kong who applies, including the over 300,000 customers who have signed up for our waiting list since announcement. 
As I mentioned in my opening, PayPal Mobile has strong momentum. Our new estimate of $10 billion in payment volume transacted for 2012 is up 150% over last year. Through PayPal Mobile, consumers increasingly have a more convenient way to pay in a growing number of everyday situations. For example, in Q2, 4 major High Street retailers in the U.K. began accepting payments using a new PayPal in-store app. And Starbucks added PayPal to the Android version of their app in the U.S. 
Now, let's turn to Marketplaces. Simply put, eBay had a great Q2, the best we've seen in years. In fact, on an FX-neutral basis, this was eBay's strongest quarter of year-over-year organic core GMV growth since 2006. Our multiyear focus to transform and reposition this business for the future is paying off. eBay is revitalized. We're more relevant today than ever to buyers and sellers globally. We've improved trust, enhanced value and selection, built better product experiences and become more customer-focused, and it's working. We believe the best is yet to come as we continue to drive innovation to serve our customers in a seamless multichannel retail environment and tap the full potential of eBay. 
In Q2, GMV, excluding vehicles, accelerated 2 points on an FX-neutral basis to 15%. Sold items also accelerated as did growth in active users, demonstrating that our improved eBay Marketplace is attracting more new users. And our fixed price format continues to be strong, growing 20% in the quarter on an FX-neutral basis. Fixed price is now consistently well over 60% of FX-neutral GMV, underscoring what a different and more relevant marketplace eBay is today for buyers and sellers. 
Top-rated sellers generated more than half of U.S. GMV and their same-store sales grew 18% in the quarter. And our sellers are offering more free shipping than ever. During Q2, 48% of transactions shipped free, up 11 points over the prior year. And Mobile continues to be a game changer, and eBay Mobile continues to be a leader with transacted mobile volume expected to double in 2012. 
Our mobile apps have been downloaded nearly 90 million times, and we're seeing incredible velocity steps. For example, sellers are listing almost 2 million items on mobile devices each week. A woman's handbag is purchased on eBay Mobile every 30 seconds. More than 8,000 cars and 340,000 car parts are sold each week before eBay -- through eBay mobile apps. And Mobile continues to attract new customers. In Q2, 600,000 new customers made their first purchase on eBay through our mobile apps. 
So again, a great quarter for eBay with strong momentum. We believe this business will continue to deliver strong, steady sustainable growth. 
Let me briefly share some Q2 highlights from GSI. GSI had another strong quarter, driving a 21% increase in same-store sales for its clients, once again outpacing e-commerce. A year after completing this acquisition, we feel very good about the synergies of GSI in our portfolio and the momentum and potential of this business. GSI is an essential part of enabling us to partner with large retailers and brands and drive multichannel commerce. 
In summary, our company had a strong second quarter and strong first half to 2012. We have a strong global portfolio, we are well positioned to enable the future of commerce and lead through the dynamic changes occurring in how people shop and pay. We're focused on innovation and on serving our customers, and we will continue to operate with discipline, clarity, and we're committed to achieving our long-term objectives. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob who'll provide more details on Q2 and on our outlook for Q3 and the full year."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
Q2 was a great quarter for the company. Revenue increased 23%, margins expanded for each of our 3 businesses versus last year and non-GAAP EPS grew 16%. We feel excellent about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal continues its strong growth while innovating on the next-generation of payment capabilities. The Marketplaces business is healthy and getting stronger, and GSI continues to help large retailers succeed in a multichannel world. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we generated $411 million of free cash flow. We repurchased approximately 9 million shares of common stock and announced the $2 billion increase to our stock buyback program. We feel confident about our performance and are maintaining guidance for the full year. 
In Q2, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.4 billion, up 23%. Organic revenue growth was 18%, foreign currency movements decreased growth by roughly 3 points and the inclusion of recently closed acquisitions increased growth by roughly 8 points. 
Second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.56, a 16% increase year-over-year. Strong top line growth drove our outperformance relative to guidance. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.3%, down 30 basis points from the second quarter 2011. The decrease was mainly due to acquisitions and business mix. 
Let me provide a little more context on our Q2 results. Compared to the guidance we gave back in April, there are 3 things we're highlighting that impacted our actual performance. First, and most importantly, better performance from our businesses, primarily Marketplaces, generated an approximately $70 million and -- $70 million in revenue and contributing an additional $0.02 of earnings. Second, a favorable ruling related to an indirect tax position in Korea positively impacted international Marketplaces transaction revenue by approximately $29 million and non-GAAP EPS by $0.02. And third, a higher sequential non-GAAP tax rate due to onetime adjustment of reserves related to U.S. taxation of certain foreign earnings from prior periods negatively impacted non-GAAP EPS by $0.02. 
In summary, there are several moving parts in the quarter, but overall, very strong results and a very strong first half to the year. 
We generated free cash flow of $411 million in the quarter. CapEx was 10% of revenues due primarily to investments in technology and infrastructure. We expect full year CapEx in the range of 8% to 10% of revenue. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a strong quarter. Revenue reached $1.4 billion and total payment volume increased to $34.5 billion, up 27% and 23% respectively on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 24% and comprising 47% of overall TPV in the quarter. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. The net number of payments grew 31%, flat with the first quarter. On eBay TPV grew 18% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by strong eBay non-vehicles GMV growth and a 420 basis point increase in PayPal penetration. 
Merchant Services TPV grew 26% on an FX-neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion of PayPal on merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of checkout. The deceleration versus Q1 was due to macro pressure in the euro zone and softness in cross-border trade to Europe. Transaction margin was 66.3% in the quarter, up 270 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense. And PayPal's segment margin came in at 25.8%, up 390 basis points from last year. The improvement was mainly due to transaction margin expansion and operating leverage. 
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. More consumers are turning to BML for both convenience and choice. BML's TPV was up 39% in the quarter, driven by a continued strong penetration on and off eBay. And Bill Me Later penetration in the U.S. on eBay and in the PayPal wallet increased to approximately 1.8% in the quarter. While small compared to other funding choices, this penetration helps to reduce our funding cost. Risk-adjusted margin for the quarter was 15.5%, down one point over last year due primarily to a higher loss rate. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Marketplaces had a strong quarter, with net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 14% on an FX-neutral basis. This was driven by FX-neutral transaction revenue growth of 14%, and marketing services revenue growth of 11% from our adjacent formats. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces' operational metrics. Sold items grew 20%, a 3-point acceleration from Q1, driven by a strong double-digit growth across all our major markets. U.S. non-vehicles GMV grew 14%, up from 13% last quarter, driven by accelerating growth in active users and strong performance in category sales in fashion, tickets and parts and accessories. 
The user experience on eBay continues to improve, driving a robust domestic business. This more than offset the impact from weaker cross-border trade activity, which negatively impacted the U.S. growth rate. International FX-neutral non-vehicles GMV grew 16%, a 3-point acceleration. Performance was driven by a strong growth in both APAC and the EU. 
Take rate, excluding vehicles, StubHub and the onetime item was flat versus last year. In Marketplaces, segment margin was 39.6% in the quarter, up 80 basis points primarily due to the benefit from indirect taxes partially offset by increased investments in technology and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. GSI had a good quarter. Revenue for Q2 was $221 million, up 9%, driven by a strong volume growth, partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Adjusting for the impact of the continued shift of clients to the service fee model, year-over-year growth would have been 12%. Global e-commerce merchandise sales or GMS grew 21% on a same-store sales basis. GSI marketing services, which is primarily demand generation activities, grew 27% and accounted for 26% of GSI's revenues in the quarter. And GSI's profitability is improving as we capitalize on the synergies we laid out at the time of the acquisition, resulting in a segment margin of 4.7% for the quarter. The margin is down versus the prior quarter due to seasonality and investments in the B11 platform. 
Q2 marks the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of GSI, and we have made great progress in realizing the operating synergies of the businesses. PayPal's share of checkout on GSI's volume in the quarter was 13%, up from 12% last quarter. And GSI's marketing products and solutions have been integrated into Magento, part of our X.commerce business. 
B11's platform is progressing, but not as fast as we would like. We expect merchant deployment to begin after the upcoming peak holiday season. Further testing is required to meet our highest expectations of the product for our clients. 
We are leveraging GSI's expertise in serving large merchants to deliver -- to help us deliver commerce solutions across all of our platforms. We're making great progress, and we have further opportunities ahead. 
Turning to operating expenses, in Q2, there were 45% of revenue, slightly lower on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by operating leverage. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated free cash flow of $411 million in the quarter. We've improved our financial flexibility by funding approximately 53% of the U.S. Bill Me Later loan receivables portfolio with offshore cash. We closed one acquisition and one disposition, and we repurchased 9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $350 million. And today, we also announced the $2 billion increase to our stock buyback program for the purposes of managing dilution from stock-based compensation. 
We end the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $7.6 billion, including approximately $700 million in the U.S. We have a strong balance sheet and free cash flow, which should allow us to finance our organic needs and stock buyback programs over the near to medium term, and we do not anticipate meaningful M&A activity in the near term. However, most of our cash is generated and resides offshore. We will remain opportunistic when assessing sources of additional liquidity, and to the extent we increase current levels, we expect it will negatively impact our net income and earnings per share. 
Now, let me turn to guidance. We feel great about the first half of the year. Despite significant macro headwinds in the second half of the year, we are maintaining the full year guidance we provided back in April. 
For the full year 2012, we continue to expect revenue of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion, representing growth of 18% to 21%. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $2.30 to $2.35, representing growth of 13% to 16%. 
Let me provide a little more clarity. First, our North America business is performing stronger than our expectations, and we continue to gain operating leverage on our cost base. Second, Europe and European currencies remain under pressure. This is impacting PayPal Europe organic growth, cross-border trade to Europe and translation of foreign revenue into U.S. dollars. And third, we continue to invest in marketing and technology and new growth opportunities such as the emerging markets, offline and mobile. 
Our expected full year non-GAAP tax rate remains in the range of 19% to 20%, and we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. We are increasingly confident in our outlook for 2012 and our plans for 2013. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, representing growth of 11% to 15% and we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 to $0.55, representing growth of 10% to 15%. 
In summary, we feel good about our performance and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. As PayPal continues its strong growth with increasing focus on simplifying and improving financial products and the consumer experience, the Marketplaces business is thriving, with strength across all geographies driven by improvements and buyer experience from our investments. And GSI is performing in line with our expectations as it continues to build its client portfolio and help eBay deliver commerce solutions for large merchants, leveraging our portfolio of assets. We're investing in our business for the long-term, and we are focused on delivering the next generation of global commerce and payments capabilities.

The second would be the recent marketing campaign, third would be mobile engagement and fourth would be potentially SKU growth from large merchants in the fashion inventory that you've added, which is improved selections.

As you said, there -- the way I look at it, there's really 2 things going on here. One, we've made an enormous amount of change to the site over the past several years, including trust and search, including bringing more selection. And that was clearly driving greater frequency of our existing users or more transactions per user. And that continues to be the case. Starting 9 months ago was really the first time we began marketing to new users, right? It started in the fourth quarter last year, By It New, Buy It Now. And we're seeing a nice response in new users coming. And when we poll them, they like what they're seeing and they're doing a second and third transaction. And then -- the thing that I think underlines both is Mobile because if you think about it, 4 years ago, the only time you could access eBay is when you were in front of a laptop or in front of a desktop, which is maybe a couple of hours a day. Now, you can access eBay 7 days a week, 24 hours a day with your mobile device. And that's helping with existing users and it's helping acquire new users as you saw. 600,000 new users in Q2 alone. So to be honest, even our internal metrics, we can't tease these out separately to force rank them, but I'll just say, the way I'm thinking about it is our existing users like it, MPS is going up and they're buying more. And the new news, really, in the last 9 months is an accelerating growth rate of new users who are trying us whether it's through mobile or through the web. They like what they see and they're coming back. And we want to keep pouring kerosene on that ladder fire to keep it going."

What's interesting is our analysis indicates that at least that much of volume that closes on the Web, their consumer access their mobile device at some point in the shopping experience. So as you said, mobile is impacting a significant portion of eBay's business, either at some point in the shopping experience and/or the transaction closes on it. The kinds of things we're seeing that's interesting on eBay Mobile is, let me just take the parts category, the motor parts category referenced earlier, as I said 340,000 parts a day are being closed. As we unpack that, we're finding more and more users, in this case, our target motorist buyer, which is a male, 30 to 50 years old, they're actually using their mobile device while they're under the hood. And they can scan the VIN code or take a picture of the back of the car. And when they see the parts they want, they do a search on their mobile device while they're under the car, our search results only show them parts that fit their car. And so that they're ordering right there on the spot. So similarly, as you described it, we're seeing consumers go into stores or walk down the street, use their mobile device out there to do their investigation or in some cases, to shop. So what we're certain about is mobile is having a profound impact in consumer behavior, and are -- we are aggressively driving innovation, both to close transactions on mobile but also to enhance the shopping experience, even if the transaction doesn't close on mobile. In many ways, PayPal is the same thing. If you look at PayPal Here, it's a great example of driving new use cases where PayPal can be used. So to your direct question, PayPal is used as the way to pay on a significant portion of the eBay transactions closed on mobile devices but not all. But what's really growing is PayPal off of eBay on the mobile arena, because retailers and merchants are finding when they put PayPal Mobile Express Checkout on their app or on their website, they're seeing significantly increased conversion. And what we know in both business units is mobile shoppers and mobile payers are 3 to 4x more valuable than Web-only, simply because they're more engaged with our products and they're buying more. So it's -- I can't underestimate the importance of mobile to what we see as the future of commerce and payments."

But new items is absolutely our sweet spot. And retailers and brands are finding new items that may be one season out of season, or 2 seasons out of season, all the way through liquidation stock. That's their sweet spot for eBay. So we estimate over 70% of the items are new on eBay. And buyers are responding to expanding selection because what you're having is more and more sellers, be they retailers or be they traditional eBay sellers, are bringing more of their new but somewhat out of season inventory on to eBay. There's one other category, it's interesting, that's kind of evolving, which is the scarce category. eBay has always been the place where something may be new and scarce, and so the auction format is really an interesting vehicle for that. And recently, we just announced a holiday collective of designers who are designing exclusive goods for the Holiday on eBay. The recent designers love it. It allows them to go directly to consumers and that will create scarcity value. So that's, I would say, a small but growing category of goods on eBay."

I think one of the decisions we made early on in mobile that has served us very well is from the beginning, we said, ""We're not going to worry if it's incremental or not."" And so it's a kind of thing we could've spent years having our financial analysts figuring out, is this incremental? Is mobile profitable, dot, dot, dot. We said, ""We believe mobile is a movement that consumers want."" And we've invested heavily in that. Now when we sit down with a retailer, what we can say is, ""When you put Mobile Express Checkout on your mobile websites or on a mobile app, cart conversion will go up because it's very proven that consumers don't want to enter in their credit card information into a mobile device, and PayPal is the safest way to pay."" And we think conversion can go up to 10%, 20%, 30%. I mean, we've not released exact statistics verified by retailer, but I think retailers find that their cart version goes up when they put Mobile Express Checkout on their mobile web or app. And by the way, Mobile Web -- Mobile Express Checkout is the same integration as Express Checkout. So and what it's doing is -- for the retailers is the same thing I described it was doing for eBay earlier. It allows the retailer to extend their reach outside the limitations of their store. And so now, if you're a retailer like Office Depot, who just signed with PayPal, no longer will the only way -- time you reach your consumers be when they're in the Office Depot store or when they're on the Office Depot website, but through mobile, Office Depot can be reaching their consumers 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. So retailers see the value of mobile and increasingly, they're embracing PayPal Mobile in aggressive ways."

And so while online sales tax will probably happen at some point in the future, our focus is to do nationally what we did last year in California where we worked with the California legislature and created a small business exclusion, where a small business that sold less than $1 million in California didn't have to collect cross state sales tax.

The truth is we've been adding sort of a million -- roughly a million new consumers a month for the last 3 years, and as the denominator gets bigger, our active user growth rate is coming down a little bit. And Dave has really brought an increased focus on the product experience for new users signing up to streamline registration flows, allow someone to sign up on a mobile device.

You can envision a world in the not-too-distant future where you can just frankly snap -- take a snapshot of your driver's license and credit cards to form of PayPal account.

And as you said, we're growing. We think we're going 2 to 3x faster than the market. So we're clearly gaining share in Web.

What's also happening is auction growth rates are coming back a little bit and simply, the mix of fixed-price and auction are such that our blended growth rate, GMV growth rate, this quarter is 15%. So we actually think the marketplace grew roughly at e-commerce growth rates in Q2. Where all the dialogue for us is going forward and the kind of focus Devin Wenig is bringing to the marketplace is, ""All right, how do we build on top of that?"" And he's got focus on how we leverage our data more effectively, a strong multiyear focus on leveraging our data and he brings some great experience from his experience on Reuters on leveraging data across the platform. How do we expand more aggressively to BRIC markets, initially with cross-border and then overtime with domestic. Again, a second big multiyear initiative. And then a third is, how do we bring more selection on to eBay, be it C2C selection, be it local selection from local retailers, be a Milo or be it from large retailers.

In the s",1255,"Thanks, Tracey, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q2 earnings call. We had another great quarter. Every part of our company showed strength and we feel good about our momentum as we reshape how people around the world shop and pay. In the second quarter, revenue is up 23% and non-GAAP EPS is up 16%, a strong finish to the first half of the year. 
As we consistently execute against our 3-year growth plans, there is no question that an inflection point is occurring in retail. Mobile is revolutionizing how people shop and pay, becoming the digital nexus of consumers' lives. They want what they want, when they want it, anywhere, any time. We now expect eBay and PayPal Mobile to each handle over $10 billion in volume transacted this year, a stunning surge in purchases and payments on devices that did not even exist just a few short years ago. Online and  offline commerce is becoming seamless and global, and retailers of all sizes need a partner who will help them navigate in this new world, compete effectively and deeply engage their consumers. And this is our focus: enabling commerce, helping consumers shop any time, anywhere and helping retailers of all sizes compete and win in this new commerce environment, and we will not compete with them. 
With our strong portfolio, each quarter, we're demonstrating our capabilities, our focus on innovation and our commitment to delivering against the bold goals we set for ourselves. I'm pleased with where we are and excited about what's to come. 
Now let's take a look at the quarter, starting with PayPal. This business continues to generate enormous opportunity and drive strong performance. PayPal is delivering real innovation, not just promises, to all segments of the market on a global scale, from small businesses to large retailers, to consumers everywhere. PayPal's global reach is a competitive advantage, and for the third consecutive quarter, more than half of PayPal's revenue came from outside the U.S. We're enabling safer, easier and more convenient ways to pay for consumers and merchants around the world. 
PayPal's TPV on eBay was up 18% for the quarter on an FX-neutral basis. This is driven by strong Marketplaces performance and increasing penetration on eBay, which was up 420 basis points year-over-year. In Merchant Services, TPV grew 26% on an FX-neutral basis. PayPal continued to add more than 1 million new active accounts per month in Q2, ending the quarter with over 113 million active accounts. 
PayPal continues to innovate. In Q2, we announced 15 retailers in addition to Home Depot, who will be implementing our point-of-sale product. Two of them are already live. Abercrombie & Fitch beta tested and began rolling out PayPal point-of-sale to over 900 stores across the U.S. in just 4 weeks, in time for the critical back-to-school shopping season. And in Q2, men's retailer Joseph A. Banks begun expanding its pilot to a full national rollout of over 550 stores. In addition, Office Depot recently, not only signed up for PayPal's point-of-sale, but also signed up for PayPal Online and PayPal Mobile. This is a great example of how we can provide comprehensive, innovative, multichannel support to retailers, and how we can drive growth in our core business while expanding PayPal's presence off-line. 
Our small business product, PayPal Here, the only global product of its kind, is also generating strong interest. PayPal Here has been introduced in 4 markets, and in Q2, we announced the joint venture with Softbank in Japan, which will bring PayPal Here to the world's third largest economy. And as of this week, we're pleased to announce general availability of PayPal Here on iPhone and Android to any merchant in the U.S. and Hong Kong who applies, including the over 300,000 customers who have signed up for our waiting list since announcement. 
As I mentioned in my opening, PayPal Mobile has strong momentum. Our new estimate of $10 billion in payment volume transacted for 2012 is up 150% over last year. Through PayPal Mobile, consumers increasingly have a more convenient way to pay in a growing number of everyday situations. For example, in Q2, 4 major High Street retailers in the U.K. began accepting payments using a new PayPal in-store app. And Starbucks added PayPal to the Android version of their app in the U.S. 
Now, let's turn to Marketplaces. Simply put, eBay had a great Q2, the best we've seen in years. In fact, on an FX-neutral basis, this was eBay's strongest quarter of year-over-year organic core GMV growth since 2006. Our multiyear focus to transform and reposition this business for the future is paying off. eBay is revitalized. We're more relevant today than ever to buyers and sellers globally. We've improved trust, enhanced value and selection, built better product experiences and become more customer-focused, and it's working. We believe the best is yet to come as we continue to drive innovation to serve our customers in a seamless multichannel retail environment and tap the full potential of eBay. 
In Q2, GMV, excluding vehicles, accelerated 2 points on an FX-neutral basis to 15%. Sold items also accelerated as did growth in active users, demonstrating that our improved eBay Marketplace is attracting more new users. And our fixed price format continues to be strong, growing 20% in the quarter on an FX-neutral basis. Fixed price is now consistently well over 60% of FX-neutral GMV, underscoring what a different and more relevant marketplace eBay is today for buyers and sellers. 
Top-rated sellers generated more than half of U.S. GMV and their same-store sales grew 18% in the quarter. And our sellers are offering more free shipping than ever. During Q2, 48% of transactions shipped free, up 11 points over the prior year. And Mobile continues to be a game changer, and eBay Mobile continues to be a leader with transacted mobile volume expected to double in 2012. 
Our mobile apps have been downloaded nearly 90 million times, and we're seeing incredible velocity stats. For example, sellers are listing almost 2 million items on mobile devices each week. A woman's handbag is purchased on eBay Mobile every 30 seconds. More than 8,000 cars and 340,000 car parts are sold each week before eBay -- through eBay mobile apps. And Mobile continues to attract new customers. In Q2, 600,000 new customers made their first purchase on eBay through our mobile apps. 
So again, a great quarter for eBay with strong momentum. We believe this business will continue to deliver strong, steady sustainable growth. 
Let me briefly share some Q2 highlights from GSI. GSI had another strong quarter, driving a 21% increase in same-store sales for its clients, once again outpacing e-commerce. A year after completing this acquisition, we feel very good about the synergies of GSI in our portfolio and the momentum and potential of this business. GSI is an essential part of enabling us to partner with large retailers and brands and drive multichannel commerce. 
In summary, our company had a strong second quarter and strong first half to 2012. We have a strong global portfolio, we are well positioned to enable the future of commerce and lead through the dynamic changes occurring in how people shop and pay. We're focused on innovation and on serving our customers, and we will continue to operate with discipline, clarity, and we're committed to achieving our long-term objectives. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob who'll provide more details on Q2 and on our outlook for Q3 and the full year."
27862,171897854,327038,"eBay Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2012",2012-07-18,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John.

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. 
Q2 was a great quarter for the company. Revenue increased 23%, margins expanded for each of our 3 businesses versus last year and non-GAAP EPS grew 16%. We feel excellent about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal continues its strong growth while innovating on the next-generation of payment capabilities. The Marketplaces business is healthy and getting stronger, and GSI continues to help large retailers succeed in a multichannel world. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we generated $411 million of free cash flow. We repurchased approximately 9 million shares of common stock and announced the $2 billion increase to our stock buyback program. We feel confident about our performance and are maintaining guidance for the full year. 
In Q2, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.4 billion, up 23%. Organic revenue growth was 18%, foreign currency movements decreased growth by roughly 3 points and the inclusion of recently closed acquisitions increased growth by roughly 8 points. 
Second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.56, a 16% increase year-over-year. Strong top line growth drove our outperformance relative to guidance. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.3%, down 30 basis points from the second quarter 2011. The decrease was mainly due to acquisitions and business mix. 
Let me provide a little more context on our Q2 results. Compared to the guidance we gave back in April, there are 3 things worth highlighting that impacted our actual performance: First, and most importantly, better performance from our businesses, primarily Marketplaces, generated an approximately $70 million and -- $70 million in revenue and contributing an additional $0.02 of earnings. Second, a favorable ruling related to an indirect tax position in Korea positively impacted international Marketplaces transaction revenue by approximately $29 million and non-GAAP EPS by $0.02. And third, a higher sequential non-GAAP tax rate due to onetime adjustment of reserves related to U.S. taxation of certain foreign earnings from prior periods negatively impacted non-GAAP EPS by $0.02. 
In summary, there are several moving parts in the quarter, but overall, very strong results and a very strong first half to the year. 
We generated free cash flow of $411 million in the quarter. CapEx was 10% of revenues due primarily to investments in technology and infrastructure. We expect full year CapEx in the range of 8% to 10% of revenue. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a strong quarter. Revenue reached $1.4 billion and total payment volume increased to $34.5 billion, up 27% and 23% respectively on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 24% and comprising 47% of overall TPV in the quarter. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. The net number of payments grew 31%, flat with the first quarter. On eBay TPV grew 18% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by strong eBay non-vehicles GMV growth and a 420 basis point increase in PayPal penetration. 
Merchant Services TPV grew 26% on an FX-neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion of PayPal on merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of checkout. The deceleration versus Q1 was due to macro pressure in the euro zone and softness in cross-border trade to Europe. Transaction margin was 66.3% in the quarter, up 270 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense. And PayPal's segment margin came in at 25.8%, up 390 basis points from last year. The improvement was mainly due to transaction margin expansion and operating leverage. 
Let me touch on a few key operating metrics for Bill Me Later. More consumers are turning to BML for both convenience and choice. BML's TPV was up 39% in the quarter, driven by continued strong penetration on and off eBay. And Bill Me Later penetration in the U.S. on eBay and in the PayPal wallet increased to approximately 1.8% in the quarter. While small compared to other funding choices, this penetration helps to reduce our funding cost. Risk-adjusted margin for the quarter was 15.5%, down 1 point over last year due primarily to a higher loss rate. 
Now let's move to our Marketplaces business. Marketplaces had a strong quarter, with net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 14% on an FX-neutral basis. This was driven by FX-neutral transaction revenue growth of 14%, and marketing services revenue growth of 11% from our adjacent formats. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces' operational metrics. Sold items grew 20%, a 3-point acceleration from Q1, driven by strong double-digit growth across all our major markets. U.S. non-vehicles GMV grew 14%, up from 13% last quarter, driven by accelerating growth in active users and strong performance in category sales in fashion, tickets and parts and accessories. 
The user experience on eBay continues to improve, driving a robust domestic business. This more than offset the impact from weaker cross-border trade activity, which negatively impacted the U.S. growth rate. International FX-neutral non-vehicles GMV grew 16%, a 3-point acceleration. Performance was driven by strong growth in both APAC and the EU. 
Take rate, excluding vehicles, StubHub and the onetime item was flat versus last year. In Marketplaces, segment margin was 39.6% in the quarter, up 80 basis points primarily due to the benefit from indirect taxes partially offset by increased investments in technology and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. GSI had a good quarter. Revenue for Q2 was $221 million, up 9%, driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Adjusting for the impact of the continued shift of clients to the service fee model, year-over-year growth would have been 12%. Global e-commerce merchandise sales, or GMS, grew 21% on a same-store sales basis. GSI marketing services, which is primarily demand generation activities, grew 27% and accounted for 26% of GSI's revenues in the quarter. And GSI's profitability is improving as we capitalize on the synergies we laid out at the time of the acquisition, resulting in a segment margin of 4.7% for the quarter. The margin is down versus the prior quarter due to seasonality and investments in the V11 platform. 
Q2 marks the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of GSI, and we have made great progress in realizing the operating synergies of the businesses. PayPal's share of checkout on GSI's volume in the quarter was 13%, up from 12% last quarter. And GSI's marketing products and solutions have been integrated into Magento, part of our X.commerce business. 
V11's platform is progressing, but not as fast as we would like. We expect merchant deployment to begin after the upcoming peak holiday season. Further testing is required to meet our highest expectations of the product for our clients. 
We are leveraging GSI's expertise in serving large merchants to deliver -- to help us deliver commerce solutions across all of our platforms. We're making great progress, and we have further opportunities ahead. 
Turning to operating expenses. In Q2, they were 45% of revenue, slightly lower on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by operating leverage. From a capital allocation perspective, we generated free cash flow of $411 million in the quarter. We've improved our financial flexibility by funding approximately 53% of the U.S. Bill Me Later loan receivables portfolio with offshore cash. We closed one acquisition and one disposition, and we repurchased 9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $350 million. And today, we also announced the $2 billion increase to our stock buyback program for the purposes of managing dilution from stock-based compensation. 
We end the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $7.6 billion, including approximately $700 million in the U.S. We have a strong balance sheet and free cash flow, which should allow us to finance our organic needs and stock buyback programs over the near to medium term, and we do not anticipate meaningful M&A activity in the near term. However, most of our cash is generated and resides offshore. We will remain opportunistic when assessing sources of additional liquidity, and to the extent we increase current levels, we expect it will negatively impact our net income and earnings per share. 
Now, let me turn to guidance. We feel great about the first half of the year. Despite significant macro headwinds in the second half of the year, we are maintaining the full year guidance we provided back in April. 
For the full year 2012, we continue to expect revenue of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion, representing growth of 18% to 21%. And we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $2.30 to $2.35, representing growth of 13% to 16%. 
Let me provide a little more clarity. First, our North America business is performing stronger than our expectations, and we continue to gain operating leverage on our cost base. Second, Europe and European currencies remain under pressure. This is impacting PayPal Europe organic growth, cross-border trade to Europe and translation of foreign revenue into U.S. dollars. And third, we continue to invest in marketing and technology and new growth opportunities such as emerging markets, offline and mobile. 
Our expected full year non-GAAP tax rate remains in the range of 19% to 20%, and we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. We are increasingly confident in our outlook for 2012 and our plans for 2013. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, representing growth of 11% to 15% and we anticipate non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 to $0.55, representing growth of 10% to 15%. 
In summary, we feel good about our performance and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. As PayPal continues its strong growth with increasing focus on simplifying and improving financial products and the consumer experience, the Marketplaces business is thriving, with strength across all geographies driven by improvements in buyer experience from our investments. And GSI is performing in line with our expectations as it continues to build its client portfolio and help eBay deliver commerce solutions for large merchants, leveraging our portfolio of assets. We're investing in our business for the long-term, and we are focused on delivering the next generation of global commerce and payments capabilities.

The second would be the recent marketing campaign, third would be mobile engagement and fourth would be potentially SKU growth from large merchants in the fashion inventory that you've added, which is improved selections.

As you said, there -- the way I look at it, there's really 2 things going on here. One, we've made an enormous amount of change to the site over the past several years, including trust in search, including bringing more selection. And that was clearly driving greater frequency of our existing users or more transactions per user. And that continues to be the case. Starting 9 months ago was really the first time we began marketing to new users, right? It started in the fourth quarter last year, Buy It New, Buy It Now. And we're seeing a nice response in new users coming. And when we poll them, they like what they're seeing and they're doing a second and third transaction. And then -- the thing that I think underlies both is Mobile, because if you think about it, 4 years ago, the only time you could access eBay is when you were in front of a laptop or in front of a desktop, which is maybe a couple of hours a day. Now, you can access eBay 7 days a week, 24 hours a day with your mobile device. And that's helping with existing users and it's helping acquire new users as you saw. 600,000 new users in Q2 alone. So to be honest, even our internal metrics, we can't tease these out separately to force rank them, but I'll just say, the way I'm thinking about it is our existing users like it, MPS is going up and they're buying more. And the new news, really, in the last 9 months is an accelerating growth rate of new users who are trying us whether it's through mobile or through the web. They like what they see and they're coming back. And we want to keep pouring kerosene on that latter fire to keep it going."

What's interesting is our analysis indicates that at least that much of volume that closes on the Web, their consumer access their mobile device at some point in the shopping experience. So as you said, mobile is impacting a significant portion of eBay's business, either at some point in the shopping experience and/or the transaction closes on it. The kinds of things we're seeing that's interesting on eBay Mobile is, let me just take the parts category, the motor parts category I referenced earlier, as I said 340,000 parts a day are being closed. As we unpack that, we're finding more and more users, in this case, our target motorist buyer, which is a male, 30 to 50 years old, they're actually using their mobile device while they're under the hood. And they can scan the VIN code or take a picture of the back of the car. And when they see the parts they want, if they do a search on their mobile device while they're under the car, our search results only show them parts that fit their car. And so that they're ordering right there on the spot. So similarly, as you described it, we're seeing consumers go into stores or walk down the street, use their mobile device either to do their investigation or in some cases, to shop. So what we're certain about is mobile is having a profound impact in consumer behavior, and are -- we are aggressively driving innovation, both to close transactions on mobile but also to enhance the shopping experience, even if the transaction doesn't close on mobile. In many ways, PayPal is the same thing. If you look at PayPal Here, it's a great example of driving new use cases where PayPal can be used. So to your direct question, PayPal is used as the way to pay on a significant portion of the eBay transactions closed on mobile devices but not all. But what's really growing is PayPal off of eBay in the mobile arena, because retailers and merchants are finding when they put PayPal Mobile Express Checkout on their app or on their website, they're seeing significantly increased conversion. And what we know in both business units is mobile shoppers and mobile payers are 3 to 4x more valuable than Web-only, simply because they're more engaged with our products and they're buying more. So it's -- I can't underestimate the importance of mobile to what we see as the future of commerce and payments."

But new items is absolutely our sweet spot. And retailers and brands are finding new items that may be one season out of season, or 2 seasons out of season, all the way through liquidation stock. That's their sweet spot for eBay. So we estimate over 70% of the items are new on eBay. And buyers are responding to expanding selection because what you're having is more and more sellers, be they retailers or be they traditional eBay sellers, are bringing more of their new but somewhat out of season inventory on to eBay. There's one other category, it's interesting, that's kind of evolving, which is the scarce category. eBay has always been the place where something may be new and scarce, and so the auction format is really an interesting vehicle for that. And recently, we just announced a holiday collective of designers who are designing exclusive goods for the Holiday on eBay. The reason designers love it. It allows them to go directly to consumers and that will create scarcity value. So that's, I would say, a small but growing category of goods on eBay."

I think one of the decisions we made early on in mobile that has served us very well is from the beginning, we said, ""We're not going to worry if it's incremental or not."" And so it's a kind of thing we could've spent years having our financial analysts figuring out, is this incremental? Is mobile profitable, dot, dot, dot. We said, ""We believe mobile is a movement that consumers want."" And we've invested heavily in that. Now when we sit down with a retailer, what we can say is, ""When you put Mobile Express Checkout on your mobile websites or on a mobile app, cart conversion will go up because it's very proven that consumers don't want to enter in their credit card information into a mobile device, and PayPal is the safest way to pay."" And we think conversion can go up to 10%, 20%, 30%. I mean, we've not released exact statistics because it varies by retailer, but I think retailers find that their cart version goes up when they put Mobile Express Checkout on their mobile web or app. And by the way, Mobile Web -- Mobile Express Checkout is the same integration as Express Checkout. So and what it's doing is -- for the retailers is the same thing I described it was doing for eBay earlier. It allows the retailer to extend their reach outside the limitations of their store. And so now, if you're a retailer like Office Depot, who just signed with PayPal, no longer will the only way -- time you reach your consumers be when they're in the Office Depot store or when they're on the Office Depot website, but through mobile, Office Depot can be reaching their consumers 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. So retailers see the value of mobile and increasingly, they're embracing PayPal Mobile in aggressive ways."

And so while online sales tax will probably happen at some point in the future, our focus is to do nationally what we did last year in California where we worked with the California legislature and created a small business exclusion, where a small business that sold less than $1 million in California didn't have to collect cross state sales tax.

Today, we're adding digital uses, we're adding BML uses, we're adding mobile uses.

The truth is we've been adding sort of 1 million -- roughly 1 million new consumers a month for the last 3 years, and as the denominator gets bigger, our active user growth rate is coming down a little bit. And Dave has really brought an increased focus on the product experience for new users signing up to streamline registration flows, allow someone to sign up on a mobile device. You may have seen we bought Card.io yesterday. You can envision a world in the not-too-distant future where you can just frankly snap -- take a snapshot of your driver's license and credit cards to form a PayPal account. So I think one of the pieces of the PayPal play book that I think you'll see increased focus on is just consumer acquisition, which then again leads to consumer engagement, which leads to -- which is supported by the merchant ubiquity. And as you said, we're growing. We think we're going 2 to 3x faster than the market. So we're clearly gaining share in Web.

What's also happening is auction growth rates are coming back a little bit and simply, the mix of fixed-price and auction are such that our blended growth rate, GMV growth rate, this quarter is 15%. So we actually think the marketplace grew roughly at e-commerce growth rates in Q2. Where all the dialogue for us is going forward and the kind of focus Devin Wenig is bringing to the marketplace is, ""All right, how do we build on top of that?"" And he's got focus on how we leverage our data more effectively, a strong multiyear focus on leveraging our data and he brings some great experience from his experience on Reuters on leveraging data across the platform. How do we expand more aggressively to BRIC markets, initially with cross-border and then overtime with domestic. Again, a second big multiyear initiative. And then a third is, how do we bring more selection on to eBay, be it C2C selection, be it local selection from local retailers, be a Milo or be it from large retailers.

Our third quarter revenue was up 15% and non-GAAP EPS was up 14%. With our focus on enabling commerce, we've set bold goals for ourselves in our 3-year growth plan, and we're delivering. 
I want to start out by briefly touching on 4 areas that are helping to generate momentum and create broader opportunities for our company. First, mobile continues to be a game changer and we continue to be a clear leader in mobile commerce and mobile payments. Our mobile experiences are changing the way people shop and pay. Mobile is more deeply engaging our existing customers and attracting new ones. And now, we're focused on using mobile technology to drive innovative multichannel commerce experiences for local and national retailers. 
Second, we are capitalizing on our global reach. Our platforms enable us to connect buyers and sellers anywhere in the world, and our core international businesses are strong. We have significant global presence, but we're only beginning to scratch the surface in emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia, which offer substantial long-term growth opportunities. 
Third, we're investing in our brands. Our new eBay logo and site enhancements as well as our recently updated PayPal look and feel create a fresh, contemporary user experience for these businesses. We're investing in marketing in both eBay and PayPal, which this week launched its first integrated consumer marketing campaign online. 
And last, we're leveraging our portfolio. In addition to growing our core businesses, we're also driving multichannel commerce innovation. We're focused on better integrating our technology capabilities to deliver innovative solutions for consumers and retailers. And we're creating new long-term growth opportunities by extending our capabilities offline. 
So in summary, we are enabling the future of commerce. We're making shopping simpler and easier for consumers anywhere, any time. And we're focused on being a partner, not a competitor, to retailers of all sizes. I am pleased with our strong consistent performance against our goals and vision. Technology is changing how people shop and pay and how retailers and brand compete. And each quarter demonstrates our commitment, our capabilities, our execution and the expanding opportunities we have to capitalize on these trends. 
Now let's take a look at the quarter starting with PayPal. PayPal had another strong quarter, continuing to increase merchant coverage and share of checkout. Merchant Services TPV grew 26% and TPV on eBay grew 18%, both on a FX-neutral basis. And PayPal now has more than 117 million active accounts globally with active account growth accelerating 1% in the quarter. PayPal's global reach is a competitive advantage. For the fourth consecutive quarter, more than half of PayPal's revenue came from outside the U.S.. 
And PayPal Mobile also continued its strong momentum in Q3, and we expect to do over $10 billion of Mobile payments volume in 2012. Consumers are choosing PayPal Mobile because it offers a unique, easy and safe way to pay on a mobile device. And merchants are finding that putting PayPal on their mobile experiences higher checkout conversion and higher sales. In fact, according to a commissioned study completed in July, 35% of all mobile sales completed with PayPal Mobile Express Checkout were incremental. 
So PayPal intends to be everywhere consumers need an easy, safe, secure way to pay, online from your phone, at your favorite neighborhood store and at major retailers. We've said that 2012 is a test-and-learn year for PayPal offline, and we feel good about what we accomplished thus far. 10 major U.S. retailers now have PayPal live in store at more than 7,000 locations. And we expect to have 20 major retailers signed up for PayPal's point-of-sale solutions by year end.  And in Q3, we announced our partnership with Discover, which will provide PayPal live access to more than 7 million merchant locations in the U.S. beginning next spring. 
Our small-business product, PayPal Here, is available in 5 markets. General availability in the U.S. now includes retail distribution at AT&T stores nationwide. 
Finally, PayPal is working to accelerate innovation by simplifying its product organization and creating more agile development teams. 9 different product teams are being combined into 1 global product organization. We believe the simpler, more streamlined approach will help PayPal consistently deliver greater products experiences for consumers at a faster pace. 
And now let's turn to Marketplaces. EBay had another great quarter. This is a revitalized business with strong momentum globally and a focus on the future. Excluding vehicles, U.S. GMV growth accelerated 2 points to 15%, and international GMV was up 15% on an FX-neutral basis. And the number of active users on eBay was up a strong 10% for the quarter, the fastest year-over-year growth since 2007. 
The new eBay is here. And as many of you saw, last week we introduced our fresh new logo and began to roll out a series of significant product enhancements. The new eBay delivers a cleaner, more contemporary and consistent shopping experience. And with innovative new features such as the eBay feed, we're beginning to use our data to provide a more personalized curated shopping experience. Better product experiences, a sharper customer focus, improved thrust and enhanced value and selection are paying off. New buyers are coming to eBay, and they like what they're finding. 
And we listen to our buyers and have recently raised the standards for our sellers to achieve the top-rated seller status. These sellers must now provide 1-day handling and 14-day returns. And sellers who met these stricter top seller standards accounted for 36% of U.S. volumes in Q3. And these sellers grew their same store sale 24% year-over-year. 
Mobile continues to show great traction at eBay. In Q3, more than 800,000 new users made their first eBay Mobile purchase at a mobile device. Downloads of eBay Mobile apps topped 100 million, and the number of items listed on eBay via Mobile also surpassed the 100 million milestone during the quarter. Sellers are now listing almost 2 million items per week from their smartphones. 
And Mobile is not only helping to drive momentum on eBay, but we also believe it's a powerful tool to enable multichannel commerce. For example, in September, we launched a new version of RedLaser. This new version includes local shopping features that offer unique in-store experiences as well as additional in, out, checkout and payment features. Best Buy is the first major retailer to partner with RedLaser to offer a geo-fenced in-store experience, providing shoppers customized content, local pricing and special discounts while they're in the store or outside. This is a great example of how mobile technology can be in used to enhance local local retail shopping experiences, not simply disrupt them. 
Another app is eBay Now, a pilot we launched in August in San Francisco. Using our eBay Now Mobile app, which is now available in the iTunes App Store, customers in San Francisco can purchase products on their phones from hundreds of local stores, including major retailers such as Target, Walgreens and Macy's, and then have these items delivered anywhere in the city, usually in less than an hour. We're continuing to learn from this pilot and may expand the test to other cities. 
So overall, Q3 was a great quarter for the eBay Marketplaces and it continues with strong momentum. We believe this business is well positioned to continue delivering strong steady growth. 
Now let me briefly share some Q3 highlights from GSI. GSI had another strong quarter, driving a 19% increase in same store sales for its clients, once again outpacing ecommerce. This business continues to execute well, and we continue to make good progress in capturing synergies across our portfolio to help large retailers. 
So in summary, our core -- our company had a strong third quarter. We're enabling commerce for retailers, brands and sellers of all sizes. And we're enabling consumers to shop anytime anywhere in a seamless multichannel commerce environment. This is a period of rapid change in technology-driven innovation and commerce. And with our mobile leadership, our global commerce platforms, our strong brands and enhanced portfolio capabilities, we will continue to lead and shape the future of commerce. We have strong momentum in our core businesses, and we're laying the foundation for a more expansive longer-term growth opportunities. I feel very good about our performance, our progress and our future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide more details on Q3 and our outlook for Q4 in the full year."
27862,215587375,365978,"eBay Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2012",2012-10-17,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Q3 was a great quarter for the company. Revenue increased 15%.

Q3 was a great quarter for the company. Revenue increased 15%. Non-GAAP EPS increased 14%, and user growth accelerated at both PayPal and Marketplaces. We feel very good about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal continues its strong growth while innovating on next-generation of payment capabilities. Marketplaces continues to get stronger, and GSI continues to help large retailers and brands succeed in a multichannel world. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we generated $792 million of free cash flow and we purchased approximately 1 million shares of common stock and issued $3 billion in long-term debt at very attractive rates. We feel confident about our performance and are raising guidance for the full year. 
In Q3, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.4 billion, up 15%. Organic revenue growth was 18% as foreign currency movements decreased growth by roughly 2.5 points. Third quarter non-GAAP EPS is $0.55, a 14% increase year-over-year. Strong top line growth and good operating leverage drove our outperformance relative to guidance.  Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3%, up 100 basis points from the third quarter of 2011 as segment margins increased across all 3 business units.  We generated free cash flow of $792 million in the quarter. CapEx was 11% of revenues due primarily to investments in search, data and site operations. We continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of 8% to 10% of revenue. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a strong quarter. Revenue reached $1.4 billion and total payment volume increased to $35.2 billion, up 24% and 23% respectively on FX-neutral basis. We continue to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 22% and comprising 47% of overall TPV in the quarter. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. Active accounts growth accelerated 1 point to 14%. On eBay, TPV grew 18% on FX-neutral basis, driven by strong eBay non-vehicles GMV growth and a 350 basis point increase in PayPal penetration. Merchant Services TPV grew 26% on an FX-neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion of PayPal on merchant sites around the world and an increase in share checkout. Transaction margin was 64.8% in Q3, up 330 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by higher take rate and lower transaction expense. PayPal's segment margins came in at 22.6% for the quarter, up 310 basis points from last year. The improvement was mainly due to transaction margin expansion. 
Let me touch on a few quick highlights for Bill Me Later. BML had a strong quarter and is becoming an increasingly important component of our portfolio. First, Bill Me Later has excellent stand-alone financials with TPV at $775 million, up 37%, and risk-adjusted margins of 16.5%. 
Second, Bill Me Later is increasing penetration as a funding source in the PayPal wallet at 1.3% share on Merchant Services and 3.7% on eBay. This penetration improves PayPal's funding mix and helps to reduce overall funding costs. 
And third, we continue to finance the Bill Me Later loan receivable portfolio using offshore cash. This enables us to increase the return on an underutilized asset.  Overall, Bill Me Later continues to perform extremely well. 
Now let's move to Marketplaces. Marketplaces had a strong quarter with net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 13% on an FX-neutral basis. This was driven by FX-neutral transaction revenue growth of 14% and marketing services revenue growth of 12% from our adjacent formats. 
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Active user growth accelerated 2 points to 10% driven by strong growth in the U.S., the U.K. and emerging markets. As John mentioned, this is the strongest growth rate since 2007. U.S. non-vehicles GMV accelerated 2 points to 16%, and international FX neutral non-vehicles GMV grew 15%. Volume growth was driven by improvements in the customer experience, increased mobile engagement and strong performance in the clothing and accessories and tickets categories. Take rate, excluding vehicles and stub hub, was essentially flat versus last year.  In Marketplaces, segment margin was 39% in the quarter, up 50 basis points, primarily due to operating leverage partially offset by investments in technology and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. GSI had a solid quarter and continues to execute in line with expectations, while generating higher cost synergies than we expected. Revenue for Q3 was $226 million, up 12% driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Global ecommerce merchandise sales or GMS grew 19% on a same store sales basis. GSI's profitability is improving as we capitalize on the cost synergies we laid out at the time of the acquisition, resulting in segment margins of 6.1% for the quarter, a 330 basis point improvement from last year. 
A few quick highlights on the progress related to the integration of GSI. Today, we had 15 clients leveraging ebay.com as a distribution channel to expand their businesses domestically, and a few clients now using eBay to expand their global footprint outside the U.S. PayPal is increasingly becoming the way to pay on GSI clients. PayPal coverage is now more than 90% of GSI client volume, and share of checkout is 13%. Additionally, 37 GSI clients offer Bill Me Later, and 3 clients are adopting PayPal's point-of-sale capabilities. Lastly, GSI is leveraging eBay Inc. technologies and innovation including RedLaser, eBay Now, the PayPal media network and Magento to build solutions for clients' needs. 
Turning to operating expenses. In Q3, operating expenses remained flat at 45% of revenue. Gains in operating leverage were reinvested back into investments in the brand experience and product and development innovation. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $10.8 billion, including approximately $3.6 billion in the U.S. 
We've improved our financial flexibility, funding 57% of the U.S. BML loan receivables portfolio with offshore cash in the quarter. We repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $47 million. And for the full year, we have substantially completed our plan to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee stock-based compensation. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We feel great about the first 3 quarters of the year, and we are raising the full year guidance on both the top and bottom line. For the full year of 2012, we are raising our revenue forecast to $13.95 billion to $14.1 billion, representing growth of 20% to 21% and increasing our non-GAAP EPS forecast to $2.32 to $2.35, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Let me provide a little more clarity on the guidance. First, we anticipate top line growth in the high teens and an okay holiday season and continue to expect mobile adoption to web-enabled commerce. Second, our North American business is performing stronger than our expectations, and we continue to gain operating leverage on our cost base. Third, we continue to expect macro pressures from Europe while cross-border trade have stabilized. And fourth, we continue to invest in marketing and technology in new growth opportunities such as emerging markets, offline and mobile. We are increasingly confident in our outlook for 2012 and our 2013 plans. 
In summary, we feel good about our performance, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. PayPal continues its strong growth with increasing focus on simplifying and improving the customer experience. Marketplaces is thriving with strength across all geographies driven by improvements in buyer experience from our investments. And GSI is performing in line with our expectations as it continues to add to its client portfolio and help eBay deliver commerce solutions for large merchants, leveraging our portfolio of assets. We are investing in our business for the long term, and we're focused on delivering the next generation of global commerce and payments capabilities. And now, we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator."

Streamlined registration is one that from the outset tested positive, and I think it's partly contributing to our increasing new user growth. And we'll continue to streamline registration to make it easier for new users sign up on eBay. On the other hand of the spectrum, you have just what we internally call turbo checkout, which is a much improved checkout experience where it's now in essence 2-click checkout. And we've always had that on Mobile and on the iPad, and now we've got it on the web. And again, it's something that's just taking friction out of the shopping experience that tested positively, and I think it's a positive enhancement. And in some of the in-line stuff, the improvement in search results, the simpler cleaner experience, each component of pieces tested positively. And I think they're partly explaining why we're continuing to make progress in that business. Interestingly, the 2 areas that I'm frankly most excited about in the medium to longer term, neither are things you can physically touch. One is the brand logo. The brand logo I think just communicates the new eBay is here, the eBay, there's a fresh, clean, same shopping experience. And we know that we're getting a lot of people that have tried eBay years ago that are coming back to eBay, and they like what they see. And I think this brand logo will be one of the things that attracts them in. And then the innovation I think is one of the most exciting ones is what we call the feed, which is the ability on your home page to customize what is a wonderful personalized browser experience. And any of you haven't tried it, I encourage you to go to the home page, sign up for the feed, put your interest, putting searches that you've done in the past. It will pick up historical searches, things that you bought, and you'll see eBay inventory coming in a very compelling user experience that I think is very entertaining and engaging. And certainly, our qualitative research say our customers love it. We haven't been able to test the incremental impact, but it's one we feel really good about. So overall, this business is continuing to get stronger. The product experience is continuing to get better."

And PayPal's employees know about that. We haven't finally landed on the impact of that. And once we do, we'll communicate that to the employees and elsewhere. But I think that 2 things I would say is one, this is clearly not a case where we're trying to pursue any cost reduction or efficiency goal. This is 100% focused on streamlining and simplifying how we create and consistently deliver great products. And that's something we are committed to do, and I think you're going to see real strong evidence of PayPal doing that in the coming weeks and months."

On PayPal offline, again, this represents an enormous opportunity for our companies for both PayPal and more broadly. We've gone from competing in a $500 billion ecommerce market to now a $10 -- or $10 trillion retail market where half of that today is being web-enabled. So there is strong interest and strong interest from retailers of bringing PayPal to point of sale. And our approach has been what we outlined at the beginning of the year, which is to use this year to focus on merchant coverage. And so we started off with the large retailer direct integrations, like PayPal point of sale that launch of Home Depot initially and now is live in 10 retailers in over 7,000 locations in the U.S. And we've proven that, that can work with adjusting hardware, existing software. But on the other end of the spectrum at the very small merchants, we launched PayPal here, and that will cover small merchants and individual business people. And then the Discover deals are an important piece in the middle because the Discover deal gives us coverage of over 7,000 -- or sorry, 7 million locations. And so you see what we're trying to do, which is build merchant coverage or merchant ubiquity and position ourselves where PayPal will be very widely accepted going forward. Having focused on the merchant side of the equation, we are now focusing on the consumer side and beginning to run some small tests with different retailers, with merchant-specific balances and other things to try to create little pockets of consumer engagement. And that will continue to be -- that will be -- 2013 will be the year of test and learn with consumer experiences. So we are using a -- we're trying to not to come to a press release a week or some fancy flash and sizzle, but trying to build a fundamental so we get a scalable business in PayPal offline. And as we said before, if we get 1% of offline, that's another PayPal. So we're trying in the way to achieve that. With respect of large retail large purchase on eBay, we're continuing to make progress. We're making good progress. Large retailers are looking for help to deal with this increasing multichannel environment. And they understand of that we're on their side. Our entire company is focused on helping those retailers grow their business. We're on their side. We don't compete with them. And so we're pleased with the progress. We're pleased with the progress that we've made in the relatively short period of time. we've got retailers like Toys""R""Us, Best Buy, GNT, Sony, there can eagle, Macy's, Target, Walgreens using different products capability we have. that being said, I said we're only beginning to scratch the surface here. There is just so much more opportunity were we can leverage the capability we have to help these retailers compete and win in this commerce environment. So I'd still say it's early days. But the more we see it, the more opportunity we see to really partner with them to really grow their business."

""Can you help us drive more traffic with your large user base and your technology? Second, can you educate me more about consumers when they enter my offline store, so that they -- we know that they're and we can reach out to them? Third, based on that, can we use your wallet, your functionality to help increase conversion when they're in the store? Fourth, can you do it for lower cost than I paid today?

Maybe if I can provide some context about trends we saw on the third quarter that influenced kind of how we're thinking about the fourth quarter. First, just macro, Mobile adoption is continue to drive more web-enabled commerce and ecommerce in particular. Therefore, what we're seeing throughout the course of this year is ecommerce growth, ecommerce growth rate accelerating. We only expect that to kind of continue into the fourth quarter. So in terms of secular trends, we're in a relatively good place. Secondly, things, Q2 to Q3 whether it was U.S. ecommerce growth rates, whether it's our global GMV, our TPV or our volume for GSI, we're essentially flat Q2 to Q3 at the macro level, a little bit underneath the covers as you saw a strong North America and a little bit weaker Europe. And lastly, currencies on a year-over-year basis are back to neutrality, if you will, so our cross-border volume have stabilized. The last point I'd make is July started strong, August was relatively weak and September ended reasonably strong. And I'd say those are all the dynamics that we've seen, we felt during the course of the third quarter and beginning here the fourth quarter that informs our guidance, which in essence is roughly a 17% organic growth rate, which is the middle of our range, in a holiday season with relatively tough comps with what I'd still characterize the some just macroeconomic unknowns particularly in Europe. So those were all the things that are influencing us. But in the aggregate, strong organic top line growth of the fourth quarter on some of the momentum in the first 3 quarters of the year."

And so we're -- and they're coming to the U.S. slide or to the U.K. sites or -- And so we're putting big focus on cross-border business and making cross-border even more seamless for buyers in these markets and for sellers around the world. so we think that offers us strong incremental growth opportunity. And that's our starting point. And then with respect to the domestic, we're starting with PayPal. For example, we now in Brazil, PayPal is now available in domestic Brazil payments. And with our partnership with down there and the actions we're taking to kind merchants, that PayPal Brazil business is growing very, very strongly. And we think that's a good starting point before we bring any domestic marketplace capabilities to grow PayPal's domestic capability in Brazil is a place where that's a real strong starting point. And we're in the process for filing for licenses in the other BRIC markets. So we can always use our balance sheet to accelerate progress and we'll be thoughtful about doing that. But for now, our plan is use cross-border and PayPal entry to penetrate some of the BRIC and emerging markets."

First, in terms of the context. I think as you know, active user growth for the last 24 months has been on a slow, steady consistent climb of higher and higher growth from low-single digits 2 years ago to 10% growth this quarter. So we feel great about this growth. couple dynamics. First, from a geographic standpoint, it's consistent across the globe. So in the Americas, in Europe and Asia, we're seeing kind of the same kind of trends as we rolled out the series of changes that we've done a couple years ago essentially across all markets. So it's geographic it's across the globe. And secondly, it's both buyers and listers. So the ecosystem, the growth in both buyers and listers or sellers is a good sign for the underlying ecosystem. So those are kind of the macro dynamics. In terms of maybe the 3 primary drivers, first, just a better experience. We have -- if I were to try to break down the components of an, roughly half of it just from a better experience, which includes both more engaged users but also disengaged that have reengaged over time. And that's somewhat of a function of the campaign that we began last year and this year to bring back old users to the site. The second maybe big bucket just emerging markets. As John highlighted, as these markets grow and middle classes get bigger and they look for great product around the globe, they're increasingly come to eBay. And we're benefiting from growth from users from emerging markets. And then the last thing is technology driven, and that's primary mobile. That 15 million users we've added over the last couple of years, John mentioned 800,000 of them alone were from new mobile users in the quarter. And that's been roughly 3 million over that same time period. So we have good fundamental trends, better experience, emerging markets and technology or mobile that's driving more usage. And I'd say characteristics were demographics, more women, more new now, and with mobile, slightly younger, slightly younger demographic."

And that's clearly what we're striving forward. We're focusing on it like we haven't focused on it in several years. I got and David nodding their across the table. So it's an area where I think there's a lot of runway left for us. On shipping, Mark, -- what our research says is consumers want choice. And actually, different consumer inside their wallet, sometimes they want same-day things, sometimes they're willing to wait some. So part of our approach has been to give them that choice. They want great deals. And on eBay sellers, what's happening is the categories where free shipping is necessary, they're providing free shipping. The categories where fast shipping is necessary, they're providing fast shipping. And the composition of the marketplace is forcing those sellers that are able to deliver that to do it. What's interesting on same-day delivery, which is getting a lot of attention now, our approaches rather than try to do this themselves. How do we partner with the retail industry to see when we can build that capability for consumers, whether they're buying on eBay they're buying directly from the retailers. And eBay Now is a nice example of how we're trying to leverage our global capabilities, our Milo capabilities, our PayPal Here capabilities to build the consumer experience that allows retailers to in essence, provide same-day delivery.

All the things that we've been focusing on, we're continuing to drive innovation and that's what's allowing us to grow at the growth rates we're growing at today. The dialogue we are now focusing on is how do we identify opportunity to grow over and above that? And Devin has really highlighted 3 major opportunities where he sees it. One, leveraging our data to provide a more personalized experience and to provide more merchandising on eBay, which we're just really getting started on. We didn't have a cart until this year, and the cart is a natural place of the merchandising. So leveraging our data. Two, what I described earlier, BRIC and emerging markets. A real there is starting with cross-border and over time, with domestic. And then three is the whole local opportunity, building that connection local inventory, whether it's large retailers listing on eBay, whether it's using Milo and RedLaser to provide a multichannel shopping experience, whether it's things like eBay Now. So those are the things that we think can help drive incremental growth on eBay. And we're bullish and optimistic as we've been certainly since any time I've been here on potential of the eBay business. And then in our Q4 marketing spend, we anticipate spending roughly the same amount we spent last year, the same magnitude. We're always optimizing within that. And we don't break out how much brand versus Google versus others. We basically are constantly optimizing. And I think integrated marketing campaign with the from the new to the hard to find, when it's on your mind, it's on eBay, is -- will serve us well in this fourth quarter.

And the other seasonal dynamic as we just -- we grow costs during the course of the year operationally kind of the fourth quarter holiday season. So those 2 seasonal dynamics result in a degradation of margins Q2 to Q3, and that's pretty -- been pretty consistent. I would say that on the year-over-year based though, Q1, Q2, Q3, we've seen the 300 basis point improvement year-on-year. And right now, through the first 9 months, segment margins are the low end of what we said we'd be able to do next year. So we feel very good about being margin expansion that we've experienced in the PayPal business."

With our focus on enabling commerce, we've s",1425,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 earnings call. We had a great quarter with strong momentum across the company. Our third quarter revenue was up 15%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 14%. With our focus on enabling commerce, we've set bold goals for ourselves in our 3-year growth plan, and we're delivering. 
I want to start out by briefly touching on 4 areas that are helping to generate momentum and create broader opportunities for our company. First, mobile continues to be a game changer, and we continue to be a clear leader in mobile commerce and mobile payments. Our mobile experiences are changing the way people shop and pay. Mobile is more deeply engaging our existing customers and attracting new ones. And now, we're focused on using mobile technology to drive innovative multichannel commerce experiences for local and national retailers. 
Second, we're capitalizing on our global reach. Our platforms enable us to connect buyers and sellers anywhere in the world, and our core international businesses are strong. We have significant global presence, but we're only beginning to scratch the surface in emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia, which offer substantial long-term growth opportunities. 
Third, we're investing in our brands. Our new eBay logo and site enhancements, as well as our recently updated PayPal look and feel, create a fresh, contemporary user experience for these businesses. We're investing in marketing in both eBay and PayPal, which this week launched its first integrated consumer marketing campaign online. 
And last, we're leveraging our portfolio. In addition to growing our core businesses, we're also driving multichannel commerce innovation. We're focused on better integrating our technology capabilities to deliver innovative solutions for consumers and retailers. And we're creating new long-term growth opportunities by extending our capabilities offline. 
So in summary, we are enabling the future of commerce. We're making shopping simpler and easier for consumers anywhere, any time. And we're focused on being a partner, not a competitor, to retailer of all sizes. I'm pleased with our strong consistent performance against our goals and vision. Technology is changing how people shop and pay and how retailers and brands compete. And each quarter demonstrates our commitment, our capabilities, our execution and the expanding opportunities we have to capitalize on these trends. 
Now let's take a look at the quarter, starting with PayPal. PayPal had another strong quarter, continuing to increase merchant coverage and share of checkout. Merchant Services TPV grew 26%, and TPV on eBay grew 18%, both on a FX-neutral basis. And PayPal now has more than 117 million active accounts globally, with active account growth accelerating 1% in the quarter. 
PayPal's global reach is a competitive advantage. For the fourth consecutive quarter, more than half of PayPal's revenue came from outside the U.S. And PayPal Mobile also continued its strong momentum in Q3, and we expect to do over $10 billion of mobile payments volume in 2012. Consumers are choosing PayPal Mobile because it offers a unique, easy and safe way to pay on a mobile device. And merchants are finding that putting PayPal on their mobile experiences drives higher checkout conversion and higher sales. In fact, according to a commissioned study completed in July, 35% of all mobile sales completed with PayPal Mobile Express Checkout were incremental. 
So PayPal intends to be everywhere consumers need an easy, safe, secure way to pay: online, from your phone, at your favorite neighborhood store and at major retailers. We've said that 2012 is a test-and-learn year for PayPal offline, and we feel good about what we accomplished thus far. 10 major U.S. retailers now have PayPal live in store at more than 7,000 locations. And we expect to have 20 major retailers signed up for PayPal's point-of-sale solution by year end. And in Q3, we announced our partnership with Discover, which will provide PayPal with access to more than 7 million merchant locations in the U.S. beginning next spring. 
Our small business product, PayPal Here, is available in 5 markets. General availability in the U.S. now includes retail distribution at AT&T stores nationwide. 
Finally, PayPal is working to accelerate innovation by simplifying its product organization and creating more agile development teams. 9 different product teams are being combined into one global product organization. We believe that simpler, more streamlined approach will help PayPal consistently deliver great product experiences for consumers at a faster pace. 
And now let's turn to Marketplaces. eBay had another great quarter. This is a revitalized business with strong momentum globally and a focus on the future. Excluding vehicles, U.S. GMV growth accelerated 2 points to 16%, and international GMV was up 15% on an FX-neutral basis. And the number of active users on eBay was up a strong 10% for the quarter, the fastest year-over-year growth since 2007. 
The new eBay is here. And as many of you saw, last week we introduced our fresh new logo and began to roll out a series of significant product enhancements. The new eBay delivers a cleaner, more contemporary and consistent shopping experience. And with innovative new features such as the eBay Feed, we're beginning to use our data to provide a more personalized, curated shopping experience. 
Better product experiences, a sharper customer focus, improved trust and enhanced value and selection are paying off. New buyers are coming to eBay, and they like what they're finding. And we've listen to our buyers and have recently raised the standards for our sellers to achieve the top-rated seller status. These sellers must now provide 1-day handling and 14-day returns. And sellers who met these stricter top seller standards accounted for 36% of U.S. volume in Q3. And these sellers grew their same-store sales 24% year-over-year. 
Mobile continues to show great traction at eBay. In Q3, more than 800,000 new users made their first eBay Mobile purchase on a mobile device. Downloads of eBay Mobile apps topped 100 million, and the number of items listed on eBay via Mobile also surpassed the 100 million milestone during the quarter. Sellers are now listing almost 2 million items per week from their smartphones. 
And Mobile's not only helping to drive momentum on eBay, but we also believe it's a powerful tool to enable multichannel commerce. For example, in September, we launched a new version of RedLaser. This new version includes local shopping features that offer unique in-store experiences as well as additional in/out, checkout and payment features. Best Buy is the first major retailer to partner with RedLaser to offer a geofenced in-store experience, providing shoppers customized content, local pricing and special discounts while they're in the store or outside. This is a great example of how mobile technology can be used to enhance local retail shopping experiences, not simply disrupt them. 
Another example is eBay Now, a pilot we launched in August in San Francisco. Using our eBay Now mobile app, which is now available in the iTunes App Store, customers in San Francisco can purchase products on their phones from hundreds of local stores, including major retailers such as Target, Walgreens and Macy's, and then have these items delivered anywhere in the city, usually in less than an hour. We're continuing to learn from this pilot and may expand the test to other cities. 
So overall, Q3 was a great quarter for the eBay Marketplaces, and it continues with strong momentum. We believe this business is well positioned to continue delivering strong, steady growth. 
Now let me briefly share some Q3 highlights from GSI. GSI had another strong quarter, driving a 19% increase in same-store sales for its clients, once again outpacing ecommerce. This business continues to execute well, and we continue to make good progress in capturing synergies across our portfolio to help large retailers. 
So in summary, our core -- our company had a strong third quarter. We're enabling commerce for retailers, brands and sellers of all sizes, and we're enabling consumers to shop anytime, anywhere in a seamless multichannel commerce environment. This is a period of rapid change in technology-driven innovation and commerce. And with our mobile leadership, our global commerce platforms, our strong brands and enhanced portfolio capabilities, we will continue to lead and shape the future of commerce. We have strong momentum in our core businesses, and we're laying the foundation for a more expansive longer-term growth opportunities. I feel very good about our performance, our progress and our future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide more details on Q3 and our outlook for Q4 in the full year."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Q3 was a great quarter for the company. Revenue increased 15%, non-GAAP EPS increased 14%, and user growth accelerated at both PayPal and Marketplaces. We feel very good about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal continues its strong growth while innovating on the next generation of payment capabilities. Marketplaces continues to get stronger, and GSI continues to help large retailers and brands succeed in a multichannel world. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we generated $792 million of free cash flow, where we purchased approximately 1 million shares of common stock and issued $3 billion in long-term debt at very attractive rates. We feel confident about our performance and are raising guidance for the full year. 
In Q3, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.4 billion, up 15%. Organic revenue growth was 18%, as foreign currency movements decreased growth by roughly 2.5 points. Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.55, a 14% increase year-over-year. Strong top line growth and good operating leverage drove our outperformance relative to guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3%, up 100 basis points from the third quarter of 2011 as segment margins increased across all 3 business units. 
We generated free cash flow of $792 million in the quarter. CapEx was 11% of revenues due primarily to investments in search, data and site operations. We continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of 8% to 10% of revenue. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a strong quarter. Revenue reached $1.4 billion, and total payment volume increased to $35.2 billion, up 24% and 23% respectively on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 22% and comprising 47% of overall TPV in the quarter. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. Active accounts growth accelerated 1 point to 14%. On eBay TPV grew 18% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by a strong eBay non-vehicles GMV growth and a 350-basis-point increase in PayPal penetration. Merchant Services TPV grew 26% on an FX-neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion of PayPal on merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of checkout. Transaction margin was 64.8% in Q3, up 330 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense. PayPal's segment margins came in at 22.6% for the quarter, up 310 basis points from last year. The improvement was mainly due to transaction margin expansion. 
Let me touch on a few quick highlights for Bill Me Later. BML had a strong quarter and is becoming an increasingly important component of our portfolio. First, Bill Me Later has excellent standalone financials with TPV at $775 million, up 37%, and risk-adjusted margin of 16.5%. Second, Bill Me Later is increasing penetration as a funding source in the PayPal wallet at 1.3% share on Merchant Services and 3.7% on eBay. This penetration improves PayPal's funding mix and helps to reduce overall funding costs. 
And third, we continue to finance the Bill Me Later loan receivable portfolio using offshore cash. This enables us to increase the return on an underutilized asset. Overall, Bill Me Later continues to perform extremely well. 
Now let's move to Marketplaces. Marketplaces had a strong quarter with net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 13% on an FX-neutral basis. This was driven by FX-neutral transaction revenue growth of 14% and marketing services revenue growth of 12% from our adjacent formats.
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Active user growth accelerated 2 points to 10%, driven by strong growth in the U.S., the U.K. and emerging markets. As John mentioned, this is the strongest growth rate since 2007. U.S. non-vehicles GMV accelerated 2 points to 16%, and international FX neutral non-vehicles GMV grew 15%. Volume growth was driven by improvements in the customer experience, increased mobile engagement and strong performance in the Clothing and Accessories and Tickets categories. Take rate, excluding vehicles and StubHub, was essentially flat versus last year. In Marketplaces, segment margin was 39% in the quarter, up 50 basis points, primarily due to operating leverage partially offset by investments in technology and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. GSI had a solid quarter and continues to execute in line with expectations while generating higher cost synergies than we expected. Revenue for Q3 was $226 million, up 12% driven by strong volume growth partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Global ecommerce merchandise sales, or GMS, grew 19% on a same-store sales basis. GSI's profitability is improving as we capitalize on the cost synergies we laid out at the time of the acquisition, resulting in segment margins of 6.1% for the quarter, a 330-basis-point improvement from last year. 
A few quick highlights on the progress related to the integration of GSI. Today, we have 15 clients leveraging ebay.com as a distribution channel to expand their businesses domestically, and a few clients now using eBay to expand their global footprint outside the U.S. PayPal is increasingly becoming the way to pay on GSI clients. PayPal coverage is now more than 90% of GSI client volume, and share of checkout is 13%. Additionally, 37 GSI clients offer Bill Me Later and 3 clients are adopting PayPal's point-of-sale capabilities. Lastly, GSI is leveraging eBay Inc. technologies and innovation including RedLaser, eBay Now, the PayPal Media Network and Magento to build solutions for clients' needs. 
Turning to operating expenses. In Q3, operating expenses remained flat at 45% of revenue. Gains in operating leverage were reinvested back into investments in the brand experience and product and development innovation. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $10.8 billion, including approximately $3.6 billion in the U.S. We've improved our financial flexibility, funding 57% of the U.S. BML loan receivables portfolio with offshore cash in the quarter. We repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $47 million, and for the full year, we have substantially completed our plan to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee stock-based compensation. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We feel great about the first 3 quarters of the year, and we are raising the full year guidance on both the top and bottom line. For the full year 2012, we are raising our revenue forecast to $13.95 billion to $14.1 billion, representing growth of 20% to 21% and increasing our non-GAAP EPS forecast to $2.32 to $2.35, representing growth of 14% to 16%. 
Let me provide a little more clarity on the guidance. First, we anticipate top line growth in the high teens in an ok holiday season and continue to expect mobile adoption to web-enabled commerce. Second, our North America business is performing stronger than our expectations, and we continue to gain operating leverage on our cost base. Third, we continue to expect macro pressures from Europe, while cross-border trade has stabilized. And fourth, we continue to invest in marketing and technology and new growth opportunities such as emerging markets, offline and mobile. We are increasingly confident in our outlook for 2012 and our 2013 plans. 
In summary, we feel good about our performance, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. PayPal continues its strong growth with increasing focus on simplifying and improving the customer experience. Marketplaces is thriving, with strength across all geographies driven by improvements in buyer experience from our investments. And GSI is performing in line with our expectations as it continues to add to its client portfolio and help eBay deliver commerce solutions for large merchants, leveraging our portfolio of assets. We are investing in our business for the long term, and we are focused on delivering the next generation of global commerce and payments capabilities.

Streamlined registration is one that, from the outset, tested positive, and I think it's partly contributing to our increasing new user growth. And we'll continue to streamline registration to make it easier for our new users to sign up on eBay. On the other end of the spectrum, you had just what we internally call turbo checkout, which is a much improved checkout experience where it's now in essence 2-click checkout. And we've always had that on mobile and on the iPad, and now we've got it on the web. And again, that's something that's just taking friction out of the shopping experience tested positively, and I think it's a positive enhancement. And then some of the in-line stuff, the improvement in search results, the simpler and cleaner experience, each of little component pieces have tested positively. And I think they're partly explaining why we're continuing to make progress in that business. Interestingly, the 2 areas that I'm frankly most excited about in the medium to longer term neither are things you can particularly test. One is just the brand logo. The brand logo, I think, just communicates that new eBay is here, the eBay, that's fresh, clean, safe shopping experience. And we know that we're getting a lot of people that have tried eBay 5, 10 years ago that are coming back to eBay, and they like what they see. And I think this brand logo will be one of the things that attracts them in. And then the innovation, I think, is one of the most exciting ones is what we call the Feed, which is the ability on your home page to customize what is a wonderful personalized browsing experience. And any of you that haven't tried it, I encourage you to go into the home page, sign up for the Feed, put in your interest, put in searches that you've done in the past. It'll pick up historical search of things you've bought, and you'll see eBay inventory coming in a very compelling user experience that I think is very entertaining and engaging. And certainly, our qualitative research say our customers love it. We haven't been able to test the incremental impact, but it's one we feel really good about. So overall, this business is continuing to get stronger. The product experience is continuing to get better."

But I think the 2 things I would say is, one, this is clearly not a case where we're trying to pursue any cost reduction or efficiency goals.

It's probably worth just highlighting that I think as you're aware historically, when we have situations like this that we would characterize as one-time in nature that have an impact on the financials, our historical practice has been if it's material, and I would use material as roughly $10 million as a threshold, if it's above that, we usually put it in GAAP-only numbers. And if it's below that, we just absorb that in our non-GAAP results. So I just -- I should just tell you that just so you understand how we think about items that are one-time in nature over time so you have context."

The -- on PayPal offline, again, this represents an enormous opportunity for our company, it's both PayPal. And more broadly, we've gone from competing in a $500 billion ecommerce market to now a $10 -- or $10 trillion retail market, where half of that today is being web-enabled. So there is strong interest from retailers of bringing PayPal to point of sale. And our approach has been what we outlined at the beginning of the year, which is to use this year to focus on merchant coverage. And so we started off with the large retailer direct integrations, like PayPal point of sale, that launch at Home Depot initially and now is live in 10 retailers in over 7,000 locations in the U.S. And we've proven that, that can work with existing hardware, existing software. Then on the other end of the spectrum, at the very small merchants, we have launched PayPal here, and that will cover small merchants and individual businesspeople. And then the Discover deals are an important piece in the middle, because the Discover deal gives us coverage that's over 7,000 -- or, sorry, 7 million locations. And so you see what we're trying to do, which is build merchant coverage or merchant ubiquity and position ourselves where PayPal will be very widely accepted going forward. Having focused on the merchant side of the equation, we're now focusing on the consumer side and beginning to run some small tests with different retailers, with merchant-specific balances and other things to try to create little pockets of consumer engagement. And that'll continue to be -- that'll be -- 2013 will be the year of test and learn with consumer experiences. So we're using a -- we're trying to not to come to a press release a week or some fancy flash-and-sizzle, but trying to build a fundamental so that we get a scalable business in PayPal offline. And as I've said before, if we get 1% of offline, that's another PayPal. So we're trying to build it in the way that achieves that. With respect to large retailers and large merchants on eBay, we're continuing to make progress. We're making good progress. Large retailers are looking for help to deal in this increasing multichannel environment, and they understand that we're on their side. Our entire company is focused on helping those retailers grow their business. We're on their side. We don't compete with them. And so we're pleased with some progress, we're pleased with the progress we've made in a relatively short period of time. We've got retailers like Toys""R""Us, Best Buy, GMC, Sony, American Eagle, Macy's, Target, Walgreens using different products and capabilities we have. And that being said, I'd say we're only beginning to scratch the surface here. There is just so much more opportunity where we can leverage the capabilities we have to help these retailers compete and win in this commerce environment. So I'd still say it's early days, but the more we see it, the more opportunity we see to really partner with them to help them grow their business."

And we were almost pulled in to it to a certain extent by large retailers. And, in essence, what they're looking for were, as you might imagine, the basics. ""Can you help us drive more traffic with your large user base and your technology? Second, ""Can you educate me more about consumers when they enter my offline store, so they -- we know that they're there and we can reach out to them?"" Third, based on that, ""Can we use your wallet and your functionality to help increase conversion when they're in the store?"" Fourth, ""Can you do it for a lower cost than I paid today?"" And fifth, ""Can you do it without cost -- where I don't have to invest a lot of capital?"" So those are the kind of the -- where the merchants started. It's kind of the 5 things that they were thinking about and asking us if we could help them in solving those 5 key fundamental challenges that they are wrestling with. So that's kind of how we started this game, I think.  And John walked you through how we've been going at it and the progress that we've made."

First, on the Q4, maybe even if I can provide some context about trends we saw in the third quarter that influenced kind of how we're thinking about the fourth quarter. First, just macro, mobile adoption is -- continues to drive more web-enabled commerce and ecommerce in particular. Therefore, what we're seeing throughout the course of this year is ecommerce growth rate accelerating. We only expect that to kind of continue into the fourth quarter. So in terms of secular trends, we're in a relatively good place. Secondly, things, Q2 to Q3 whether it was U.S. ecommerce growth rates, whether it's our global GMV, our TPV or our volume for GSI, we're essentially flat Q2 to Q3 at the macro level, a little bit underneath the covers as you saw a strong North America and a little bit weaker Europe. And lastly, currencies on a year-over-year basis are back to neutrality, if you will, so our cross-border volume has stabilized. The last point I'd make is July started strong, August was relatively weak and September ended reasonably strong. And I'd say those are all the dynamics that we've seen, we felt during the course of the third quarter and beginning here in the fourth quarter that informs our guidance, which, in essence, is roughly 17% organic growth rate, which is the middle of our range, in a holiday season with relatively tough comps with what I'd still characterize as some just macroeconomic unknowns, particularly in Europe. So those are all the things that are influencing us. But in the aggregate, strong organic top line growth in the fourth quarter, building on some of the momentum in the first 3 quarters of the year."

And so we think that offers a strong incremental growth opportunity, and that's our starting point. And then with respect to domestic, we're starting with PayPal. An example, we know in Brazil, PayPal is now available in domestic Brazil payments. And with our partnership with Vevo down there and the actions we're taking to penetrate merchants, the PayPal Brazilian business is growing very, very strongly. And we think that's a good starting point before we bring any domestic marketplace capabilities is to grow PayPal's domestic capability in Brazil as a place where that's a real strong starting point. And we're in the process of filing for licenses in the other BRIC markets. So we can always use our balance sheet to accelerate progress, and we'll be thoughtful about doing that. But for now, our plan is to use cross-border and PayPal entry to -- as we penetrate some of the BRIC and emerging markets."

First, just in terms of context. I think as you know, active user growth for the last 24 months has been on a slow, steady consistent climb of higher and higher growth from low single digits 2 years ago to 10% growth this quarter. So we feel great about its growth. Couple of dynamics. First, from a geographic standpoint, it's consistent across the globe. So in the Americas, in Europe and Asia, we're seeing kind of the same kind of trends as we've rolled out the series of changes that we did a couple of years ago essentially across all markets, so it's across the globe. And secondly, it's both buyers and listers. So the ecosystem, the growth in both buyers and listers or sellers is a good sign for the underlying ecosystem. So those are kind of macro dynamics. In terms of maybe the 3 primary drivers, first, just a better experience. We have -- if I were to try to break down the components of enhancement, roughly half of it is from just a better experience, which includes both more engaged users but also disengaged that have reengaged over time. And that's somewhat of a function of the campaign that we began last year and this year to bring back old users to the site. The second maybe big bucket is just emerging markets. As John highlighted, as these markets grow and middle classes get bigger and they look for great products around the globe, they're increasingly coming to eBay, and we're benefiting from growth of users from emerging markets. And then the last thing is technology [indiscernible], and that's primary mobile. That 15 million users we've added over the last couple of years, John mentioned 800,000 of them alone were from new mobile users in the quarter, and that's been roughly 3 million over that same time period. So we have good fundamental trends, better experience, emerging markets and technology or mobile that's driving more usage. And I'd say characteristics or demographics, more women, more new and now, and with mobile, a slightly younger demographic."

I mean I look at this and say the number of Internet users globally is going to double in the next 3 to 5 years and there's no reason why our active users shouldn't double during that period. And that's clearly what we're striving forward. We're focusing on it, like we haven't focused on it in a few -- in several years. I got Devin and David both nodding their heads across the table. So it's an area where I think there's a lot of runway left for us. On shipping, Mark, the -- what our research says is consumers want choice and actually different -- consumer, inside their wallet, sometimes they want same-day things, sometimes they want -- they're willing to wait some. And so part of our approach has been to give them that choice. They want great deals. And then eBay sellers, what's happening is the categories where free shipping is necessary, they're providing free shipping. The categories where fast shipping is necessary, they're providing fast shipping. And the competition of a marketplace is forcing those sellers that are able to deliver that to do it. What's interesting on same-day delivery, which is getting a lot of attention now, our approach is then rather than try to do this ourselves, how do we partner with the retail industry to see we can build that capability for consumers, whether they're buying on eBay or they're buying directly from the retailers. And that eBay Now is a nice example of how we're trying to leverage our mobile global capabilities, our Milo capabilities, our PayPal Here capabilities to build the consumer experience that allows retailers to, in essence, provide same-day delivery. So we'll continue to try to develop solutions that give consumers choice."

The marketplace, here's how I'm thinking about it, which is I think we have demonstrated that we can provide strong, sustainable growth roughly around ecommerce, and that we have a variety of things in our toolkit and our playbook to be able to continue to do that, whether it's improving search and the user experience, improving trust. All of the things that we've been focused on, we're continuing to drive innovation, and that's what's allowing us to grow at the growth rates we're growing at today. The dialogue we're now focusing on is how do we identify opportunities to grow over and above that. And Devin has really highlighted 3 major opportunities where he sees it. One, leveraging our data to provide a more personalized experience and to provide more merchandising on eBay, which we're just really getting started on. We didn't have a cart until this year, and the cart is a natural place to do merchandising. So leveraging our data. Two, what I described earlier, BRIC and emerging markets. A real focus there starting with cross-border and, over time, with domestic. And then three is the whole local opportunity, building that connection with local inventory, whether it's large retailer's listing on eBay, whether it's using Milo and RedLaser to provide a multichannel shopping experience, whether it's things like eBay Now. So those are the things that we think can help drive incremental growth on eBay, and we're bullish and optimistic as we've been certainly since any time I've been here on the potential of the eBay business. And then in our Q4 marketing spend, we anticipate spending roughly the same amount we spent last year, the same magnitude, and we're always optimizing within that. And we don't break out how much brand versus Google versus other. We basically are constantly optimizing. And I think the integrated marketing campaign with the tag line, ""From the new to the hard to find, when it's on your mind, it's on eBay,"" is -- will serve us well in this fourth quarter. And so we're excited about our holiday plans."

So those 2 seasonal dynamics result in a degradation of margins Q2 to Q3, and that's pretty -- been pretty consistent. I would say that on a year-over-year basis, though, Q1, Q2, Q3, we've seen the 300-basis-point improvement year-on-year.

We had a great quarter with strong momentum across the company. Our third quarter revenue was up 15%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 14%. With our focus on enabling commerce, we've s",1425,"Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 earnings call. We had a great quarter with strong momentum across the company. Our third quarter revenue was up 15%, and non-GAAP EPS was up 14%. With our focus on enabling commerce, we've set bold goals for ourselves in our 3-year growth plan, and we're delivering. 
I want to start out by briefly touching on 4 areas that are helping to generate momentum and create broader opportunities for our company. First, mobile continues to be a game changer, and we continue to be a clear leader in mobile commerce and mobile payments. Our mobile experiences are changing the way people shop and pay. Mobile is more deeply engaging our existing customers and attracting new ones. And now, we're focused on using mobile technology to drive innovative multichannel commerce experiences for local and national retailers. 
Second, we're capitalizing on our global reach. Our platforms enable us to connect buyers and sellers anywhere in the world, and our core international businesses are strong. We have significant global presence, but we're only beginning to scratch the surface in emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia, which offer substantial long-term growth opportunities. 
Third, we're investing in our brands. Our new eBay logo and site enhancements, as well as our recently updated PayPal look and feel, create a fresh, contemporary user experience for these businesses. We're investing in marketing in both eBay and PayPal, which this week launched its first integrated consumer marketing campaign online. 
And last, we're leveraging our portfolio. In addition to growing our core businesses, we're also driving multichannel commerce innovation. We're focused on better integrating our technology capabilities to deliver innovative solutions for our consumers and retailers. And we're creating new long-term growth opportunities by extending our capabilities offline. 
So in summary, we are enabling the future of commerce. We're making shopping simpler and easier for consumers anywhere, any time. And we're focused on being a partner, not a competitor, to retailers of all sizes. I'm pleased with our strong consistent performance against our goals and vision. Technology is changing how people shop and pay and how retailers and brands compete. And each quarter demonstrates our commitment, our capabilities, our execution and the expanding opportunities we have to capitalize on these trends. 
Now let's take a look at the quarter, starting with PayPal. PayPal had another strong quarter, continuing to increase merchant coverage and share of checkout. Merchant Services TPV grew 26%, and TPV on eBay grew 18%, both on a FX-neutral basis. And PayPal now has more than 117 million active accounts globally, with active account growth accelerating 1% in the quarter. 
PayPal's global reach is a competitive advantage. For the fourth consecutive quarter, more than half of PayPal's revenue came from outside the U.S. And PayPal Mobile also continued its strong momentum in Q3, and we expect to do over $10 billion of mobile payments volume in 2012. Consumers are choosing PayPal Mobile because it offers a unique, easy and safe way to pay on a mobile device. And merchants are finding that putting PayPal on their mobile experiences drives higher checkout conversion and higher sales. In fact, according to a commissioned study completed in July, 35% of all mobile sales completed with PayPal Mobile Express Checkout were incremental. 
So PayPal intends to be everywhere consumers need an easy, safe, secure way to pay: online, from your phone, at your favorite neighborhood store and at major retailers. We've said that 2012 is a test-and-learn year for PayPal offline, and we feel good about what we've accomplished thus far. 10 major U.S. retailers now have PayPal live in store at more than 7,000 locations. And we expect to have 20 major retailers signed up for PayPal's point-of-sale solution by year end. And in Q3, we announced our partnership with Discover, which will provide PayPal with access to more than 7 million merchant locations in the U.S. beginning next spring. 
Our small business product, PayPal Here, is available in 5 markets. General availability in the U.S. now includes retail distribution at AT&T stores nationwide. 
Finally, PayPal is working to accelerate innovation by simplifying its product organization and creating more agile development teams. 9 different product teams are being combined into one global product organization. We believe this simpler, more streamlined approach will help PayPal consistently deliver great product experiences for consumers at a faster pace. 
And now let's turn to Marketplaces. eBay had another great quarter. This is a revitalized business with strong momentum globally and a focus on the future. Excluding vehicles, U.S. GMV growth accelerated 2 points to 16%, and international GMV was up 15% on an FX-neutral basis. And the number of active users on eBay was up a strong 10% for the quarter, the fastest year-over-year growth since 2007. 
The new eBay is here. And as many of you saw, last week we introduced our fresh new logo and began to roll out a series of significant product enhancements. The new eBay delivers a cleaner, more contemporary and consistent shopping experience. And with innovative new features such as the eBay Feed, we're beginning to use our data to provide a more personalized, curated shopping experience. 
Better product experiences, a sharper customer focus, improved trust and enhanced value and selection are paying off. New buyers are coming to eBay, and they like what they're finding. And we've listen to our buyers and have recently raised the standards for our sellers to achieve the top-rated seller status. These sellers must now provide 1-day handling and 14-day returns. And sellers who met these stricter top seller standards accounted for 36% of U.S. volume in Q3. And these sellers grew their same-store sales 24% year-over-year. 
Mobile continues to show great traction at eBay. In Q3, more than 800,000 new users made their first eBay Mobile purchase on a mobile device. Downloads of eBay Mobile apps topped 100 million, and the number of items listed on eBay via Mobile also surpassed the 100 million milestone during the quarter. Sellers are now listing almost 2 million items per week from their smartphones. 
And Mobile's not only helping to drive momentum on eBay, but we also believe it's a powerful tool to enable multichannel commerce. For example, in September, we launched a new version of RedLaser. This new version includes local shopping features that offer unique in-store experiences as well as additional in/out, checkout and payment features. Best Buy is the first major retailer to partner with RedLaser to offer a geo-fenced in-store experience, providing shoppers customized content, local pricing and special discounts while they're in the store or outside. This is a great example of how mobile technology can be used to enhance local retail shopping experiences, not simply disrupt them. 
Another example is eBay Now, a pilot we launched in August in San Francisco. Using our eBay Now mobile app, which is now available in the iTunes App Store, customers in San Francisco can purchase products on their phones from hundreds of local stores, including major retailers such as Target, Walgreens and Macy's, and then have these items delivered anywhere in the city, usually in less than an hour. We're continuing to learn from this pilot and may expand the test to other cities. 
So overall, Q3 was a great quarter for the eBay Marketplaces, and it continues with strong momentum. We believe this business is well positioned to continue delivering strong, steady growth. 
Now let me briefly share some Q3 highlights from GSI. GSI had another strong quarter, driving a 19% increase in same-store sales for its clients, once again outpacing ecommerce. This business continues to execute well, and we continue to make good progress in capturing synergies across our portfolio to help large retailers. 
So in summary, our core -- our company had a strong third quarter. We're enabling commerce for retailers, brands and sellers of all sizes, and we're enabling consumers to shop anytime, anywhere in a seamless multichannel commerce environment. This is a period of rapid change and technology-driven innovation in commerce. And with our mobile leadership, our global commerce platforms, our strong brands and enhanced portfolio capabilities, we will continue to lead and shape the future of commerce. We have strong momentum in our core businesses, and we're laying the foundation for more expansive longer-term growth opportunities. I feel very good about our performance, our progress and our future. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll provide more details on Q3 and our outlook for Q4 in the full year."
27862,215587375,366053,"eBay Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Oct 17, 2012",2012-10-17,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Q3 was a great quarter for the company.

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings slide presentation that accompanies the webcast. Q3 was a great quarter for the company. Revenue increased 15%, non-GAAP EPS increased 14%, and user growth accelerated at both PayPal and Marketplaces. We feel very good about our portfolio and our capabilities. PayPal continues its strong growth while innovating on the next generation of payment capabilities. Marketplaces continues to get stronger, and GSI continues to help large retailers and brands succeed in a multichannel world. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we generated $792 million of free cash flow, where we purchased approximately 1 million shares of common stock and issued $3 billion in long-term debt at very attractive rates. We feel confident about our performance and are raising guidance for the full year. 
In Q3, our combined businesses generated net revenues of $3.4 billion, up 15%. Organic revenue growth was 18%, as foreign currency movements decreased growth by roughly 2.5 points. Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.55, a 14% increase year-over-year. Strong top line growth and good operating leverage drove our outperformance relative to guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3%, up 100 basis points from the third quarter of 2011 as segment margins increased across all 3 business units. 
We generated free cash flow of $792 million in the quarter. CapEx was 11% of revenues due primarily to investments in search, data and site operations. We continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of 8% to 10% of revenue. 
Now let's take a closer look at our segment results. PayPal had a strong quarter. Revenue reached $1.4 billion, and total payment volume increased to $35.2 billion, up 24% and 23% respectively on an FX-neutral basis. We continue to expand our global footprint with international TPV increasing 22% and comprising 47% of overall TPV in the quarter. 
A few quick highlights on PayPal operational metrics. Active accounts growth accelerated 1 point to 14%. On eBay TPV grew 18% on an FX-neutral basis, driven by strong eBay non-vehicles GMV growth and a 350-basis-point increase in PayPal penetration. Merchant Services TPV grew 26% on an FX-neutral basis. This growth was driven by continued expansion of PayPal on merchant sites around the world and an increase in share of checkout. Transaction margin was 64.8% in Q3, up 330 basis points. The increase was mainly driven by a higher take rate and lower transaction expense. PayPal's segment margins came in at 22.6% for the quarter, up 310 basis points from last year. The improvement was mainly due to transaction margin expansion. 
Let me touch on a few quick highlights for Bill Me Later. BML had a strong quarter and is becoming an increasingly important component of our portfolio. First, Bill Me Later has excellent standalone financials with TPV at $775 million, up 37%, and risk-adjusted margin of 16.5%. Second, Bill Me Later is increasing penetration as a funding source in the PayPal wallet at 1.3% share on Merchant Services and 3.7% on eBay. This penetration improves PayPal's funding mix and helps to reduce overall funding cost. 
And third, we continue to finance the Bill Me Later loan receivable portfolio using offshore cash. This enables us to increase the return on an underutilized asset. Overall, Bill Me Later continues to perform extremely well. 
Now let's move to Marketplaces. Marketplaces had a strong quarter with net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 13% on an FX-neutral basis. This was driven by FX-neutral transaction revenue growth of 14% and marketing services revenue growth of 12% from our adjacent formats.
A few quick highlights on Marketplaces operational metrics. Active user growth accelerated 2 points to 10%, driven by strong growth in the U.S., the U.K. and emerging markets. As John mentioned, this is the strongest growth rate since 2007. U.S. non-vehicles GMV accelerated 2 points to 16%, and international FX neutral non-vehicles GMV grew 15%. Volume growth was driven by improvements in the customer experience, increased mobile engagement and strong performance in the Clothing and Accessories and Tickets categories. Take rate, excluding vehicles and StubHub, was essentially flat versus last year. In Marketplaces, segment margin was 39% in the quarter, up 50 basis points, primarily due to operating leverage partially offset by investments in technology and marketing. 
Now let's turn to our newest business unit, GSI. GSI had a solid quarter and continues to execute in line with expectations while generating higher cost synergies than we expected. Revenue for Q3 was $226 million, up 12% driven by strong volume growth partially offset by the mix of merchant sales. Global ecommerce merchandise sales, or GMS, grew 19% on a same-store sales basis. GSI's profitability is improving as we capitalize on the cost synergies we laid out at the time of the acquisition, resulting in segment margins of 6.1% for the quarter, a 330-basis-point improvement from last year. 
A few quick highlights on the progress related to the integration of GSI. Today, we have 15 clients leveraging ebay.com as a distribution channel to expand their businesses domestically, and a few clients now using eBay to expand their global footprint outside the U.S. PayPal is increasingly becoming the way to pay on GSI clients. PayPal coverage is now more than 90% of GSI client volume, and share of checkout is 13%. Additionally, 37 GSI clients offer Bill Me Later and 3 clients are adopting PayPal's point-of-sale capabilities. Lastly, GSI is leveraging eBay Inc. technologies and innovation including RedLaser, eBay Now, the PayPal Media Network and Magento to build solutions for clients' needs. 
Turning to operating expenses. In Q3, operating expenses remained flat at 45% of revenue. Gains in operating leverage were reinvested back into investments in the brand experience and product and development innovation. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $10.8 billion, including approximately $3.6 billion in the U.S. We've improved our financial flexibility, funding 57% of the U.S. BML loan receivables portfolio with offshore cash in the quarter. We repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $47 million, and for the full year, we have substantially completed our plan to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee stock-based compensation. 
Now let me turn to guidance. We feel great about the first 3 quarters of the year, and we are raising the full year guidance on both the top and bottom line. For the full year 2012, we are raising our revenue forecast to $13.95 billion to $14.1 billion, representing growth of 20% to 21% and increasing our non-GAAP EPS forecast to $2.32 to $2.35, representing growth of 14% to 16%. 
Let me provide a little more clarity on the guidance. First, we anticipate top line growth in the high teens in an okay holiday season and continue to expect mobile adoption to Web-enabled commerce. Second, our North America business is performing stronger than our expectations, and we continue to gain operating leverage on our cost base. Third, we continue to expect macro pressures from Europe, while cross-border trade has stabilized. And fourth, we continue to invest in marketing and technology and new growth opportunities such as emerging markets, offline and mobile. We are increasingly confident in our outlook for 2012 and our 2013 plans. 
In summary, we feel good about our performance, and we're excited by the opportunities that lie ahead. PayPal continues its strong growth with increasing focus on simplifying and improving the customer experience. Marketplaces is thriving, with strength across all geographies driven by improvements in buyer experience from our investments. And GSI is performing in line with our expectations as it continues to add to its client portfolio and help eBay deliver commerce solutions for large merchants, leveraging our portfolio of assets. We are investing in our business for the long term, and we are focused on delivering the next generation of global commerce and payments capabilities.

Streamlined registration is one that, from the outset, tested positive, and I think is partly contributing to our increase in new user growth. And we'll continue to streamline registration to make it easier for a new user to sign up on eBay. On the other end of the spectrum, you had just what we internally call turbo checkout, which is a much improved checkout experience where it's now in essence 2-click checkout. And we've always had that on mobile and on the iPad, and now we've got it on the Web. And again, that's something that's just taking friction out of the shopping experience tested positively, and I think it's a positive enhancement. And then some of the in-line stuff, the improvement in search results, it's just a cleaner experience, each of the little component pieces have tested positively. And I think they're partly explaining why we're continuing to make progress in that business. Interestingly, the 2 areas that I'm frankly most excited about in the medium to longer term, neither are things you can particularly test. One is just the brand logo. The brand logo, I think, just communicates that new eBay is here, the eBay that's a fresh, clean, safe shopping experience. And we know that we're getting a lot of people that have tried eBay 5, 10 years ago that are coming back to eBay, and they like what they see. And I think this brand logo will be one of the things that attracts them in. And then the innovation, I think, is one of the most exciting ones is what we call the Feed, which is the ability on your home page to customize what is a wonderful personalized browse experience. And any of you that haven't tried it, I encourage you to go into the home page, sign up for the Feed, put in your interests, put in searches that you've done in the past. It'll pick up historical search of things you've bought, and you'll see eBay inventory coming in a very compelling user experience that I think is very entertaining and engaging. And certainly, our qualitative research say our customers love it. We haven't been able to test the incremental impact, but it's one we feel really good about. So overall, this business is continuing to get stronger. The product experience is continuing to get better."

And PayPal employees know about that. We haven't finally landed on the impact of that. And once we do, we'll communicate that to the employees and elsewhere. But I think the 2 things I would say is, one, this is clearly not a case where we're trying to pursue any cost reduction or efficiency goals. This is 100% focused on streamlining and simplifying how we create and consistently deliver great products. And that's something we're committed to do, and I think you're going to see real strong evidence of PayPal doing that in the coming weeks and months."

The -- on PayPal offline, again, this represents an enormous opportunity for our company, both PayPal and more broadly. We've gone from competing in a $500 billion ecommerce market to now a $10 -- or $10 trillion retail market, where half of that today is being Web-enabled. So there is strong interest from retailers of bringing PayPal to point of sale. And our approach has been what we outlined at the beginning of the year, which is to use this year to focus on merchant coverage. And so we started off with the large retailer direct integrations, like PayPal point of sale that launched at Home Depot initially and now is live in 10 retailers and over 7,000 locations in the U.S. And we've proven that, that can work with existing hardware, existing software. Then on the other end of the spectrum, with the very small merchants, we launched PayPal Here, and that will cover small merchants and individual businesspeople. And then the Discover deals are an important piece in the middle, because the Discover deal gives us coverage that's over 7,000 -- or sorry, 7 million locations. And so you see what we're trying to do, which is build merchant coverage or merchant ubiquity and position ourselves where PayPal will be very widely accepted going forward. Having focused on the merchant side of the equation, we're now focusing on the consumer side and beginning to run some small tests with different retailers, with merchant-specific balances and other things to try to create little pockets of consumer engagement. And that'll continue to be -- that'll be -- 2013 will be the year of test and learn with consumer experiences. So we're using a -- we're trying to not to come to a press release a week or some fancy flash-and-sizzle, but trying to build the fundamental so that we get a scalable business in PayPal offline. And as I've said before, if we get 1% of offline, that's another PayPal. So we're trying to build it in the way that achieves that. With respect to large retailers or large merchants on eBay, we're continuing to make progress. We're making good progress. Large retailers are looking for help to deal in this increasing multichannel environment, and they understand we're on their side. Our entire company is focused on helping those retailers grow their business. We're on their side. We don't compete with them. And so we're pleased with some progress, we're pleased with the progress we've made in a relatively short period of time. We've got retailers like Toys""R""Us, Best Buy, GMC, Sony, American Eagle, Macy's, Target, Walgreens using different products and capabilities we have. And that being said, I'd say we're only beginning to scratch the surface here. There is just so much more opportunity where we can leverage the capabilities we have to help these retailers compete and win in this commerce environment. So I'd still say it's early days, but the more we see it, the more opportunity we see to really partner with them to help them grow their business."

And we were almost pulled in to it to a certain extent by large retailers. And in essence, what they're looking for were, as you might imagine, the basics. ""Can you help us drive more traffic with your large user base and your technology?"" Second, ""Can you educate me more about consumers when they enter my offline store, so they -- we know that they're there and we can reach out to them?"" Third, based on that, ""Can we use your wallet and your functionality to help increase conversion when they're in the store?"" Fourth, ""Can you do it for a lower cost than I pay today?"" And fifth, ""Can you do it without cost -- where I don't have to invest a lot of capital?"" So those are the kind of the -- where the merchants started. It's kind of the 5 things that they were thinking about and asking us if we could help them in solving those 5 key fundamental challenges that they were wrestling with. So that's kind of how we started this game. I think then John walked you through how we've been going at it and the progress that we've made."

First, on the Q4, maybe even if I could provide some context about trends we saw in the third quarter that influenced kind of how we're thinking about the fourth quarter. First, just macro, mobile adoption is -- continues to drive more Web-enabled commerce and ecommerce in particular. Therefore, what we're seeing throughout the course of this year is ecommerce growth rates accelerating. We only expect that to kind of continue into the fourth quarter. So in terms of secular trends, we're in a relatively good place. Secondly, things, Q2 to Q3 whether it was U.S. ecommerce growth rates, whether it was our global GMV, our TPV or our volume for GSI, we're essentially flat Q2 to Q3 at the macro level, a little bit underneath the covers as you saw strong North America and a little bit weaker Europe. And lastly, currencies on a year-over-year basis are back to neutrality, if you will, so our cross-border volume has stabilized. The last point I would make is July started strong, August was relatively weak and September ended reasonably strong. And I'd say those are all the dynamics that we've seen, we felt during the course of the third quarter and beginning here in the fourth quarter that informs our guidance, which, in essence, is roughly 17% organic growth rate, which is the middle of our range, in a holiday season with relatively tough comps with what I'd still characterize as some just macroeconomic unknowns, particularly in Europe. So those are all the things that are influencing us. But in the aggregate, strong organic top line growth in the fourth quarter, building on some of the momentum in the first 3 quarters of the year."

The fact is that there are going to be 2 billion new people who come to the Internet in the next 3 to 5 years, largely in BRIC and emerging markets. And many of those, well, the first ecommerce transaction they have, we hope to have be on eBay using PayPal. eBay's got a global brand name. Our new user growth in these markets is already high. And so we're -- and they're coming to the U.S. site or to the U.K. site or -- and so we're -- Devin's putting a big focus on cross-border business and making cross-border even more seamless for buyers in these markets and for sellers around the world. And so we think that offers a strong incremental growth opportunity, and that's our starting point. And then with respect to domestic, we're starting with PayPal. An example, we know in Brazil, PayPal is now available in domestic Brazil payments. And with our partnership with Vevo down there and the actions we're taking to penetrate merchants, the PayPal Brazilian business is growing very, very strongly. And we think that's a good starting point before we bring any domestic marketplace capabilities is to grow PayPal's domestic capability, and Brazil is a place where that's a real strong starting point. And we're in the process of filing for licenses in the other BRIC markets. So we can always use our balance sheet to accelerate progress, and we'll be thoughtful about doing that. But for now, our plan is to use cross-border and PayPal entry to -- as we penetrate some of the BRIC and emerging markets."

First, just in terms of context. I think as you know, active user growth for the last 24 months has been on a slow, steady, consistent climb of higher and higher growth from low single digits 2 years ago to 10% growth this quarter. So we feel great about its growth. Couple of dynamics. First, from a geographic standpoint, it's consistent across the globe. So in the Americas, in Europe and Asia, we're seeing kind of the same kind of trends as we've rolled out the series of changes that we did a couple years ago essentially across all markets, so it's across the globe. And secondly, it's both buyers and listers. So the ecosystem, the growth in both buyers and listers or sellers is a good sign for the underlying ecosystem. So those are kind of macro dynamics. In terms of maybe the 3 primary drivers, first, just a better experience. We have -- if I were to try to break down the components of enhancement, roughly half of it is from just a better experience, which includes both more engaged users but also disengaged that have reengaged over time. And that's somewhat of a function of the campaigning we began last year and this year to bring back old users to the site. The second maybe big bucket is just emerging markets. As John highlighted, as these markets grow and middle classes get bigger and they look for great product around the globe, they're increasingly coming to eBay, and we're benefiting from growth of users from emerging markets. And then the last thing is technology driven, and that's primary mobile. That 15 million users we've added over the last couple years, John mentioned 800,000 of them alone were from new mobile users in the quarter, and that's been roughly 3 million over that same time period. So we have good fundamental trends, better experience, emerging markets and technology or mobile that's driving more usage. And I'd say characteristics or demographics, more women, more new and now, and with mobile, a slightly younger demographic."

I mean I look at this and say the number of Internet users globally is going to double in the next 3 to 5 years and there's no reason why our active users shouldn't double during that period. And that's clearly what we're striving toward. We're focusing on it, like we haven't focused on it in a few -- in several years. I got Devin and David both nodding their heads across the table. So it's an area where I think there's a lot of runway left for us. On shipping, Mark, the -- what our research says is consumers want choice and actually different -- a consumer, inside their wallet, sometimes they want same-day things, sometimes they want -- they're willing to wait some time. And so part of our approach has been to give them that choice. They want great deals. And then eBay sellers, what's happening is the categories where free shipping is necessary, they're providing free shipping. The categories where fast shipping is necessary, they're providing fast shipping. And the competition of a marketplace is forcing those sellers that are able to deliver that to do it. What's interesting on same-day delivery, which is getting a lot of attention now, our approach has been rather than try to do this ourselves, how do we partner with the retail industry to if see we can build that capability for consumers, whether they're buying on eBay or they're buying directly from the retailers. And that eBay Now is a nice example of how we're trying to leverage our mobile capabilities, our Milo capabilities, our PayPal Here capabilities to build a consumer experience that allows retailers to, in essence, provide same-day delivery. So we'll continue to try to develop solutions that give consumers choice."

The marketplace, here's how I'm thinking about it, which is I think we have demonstrated that we can provide strong, sustainable growth roughly around ecommerce, and that we have a variety of things in our toolkit and our playbook to be able to continue to do that, whether it's improving search and the user experience, improving trust. All of the things that we've been focused on, we're continuing to drive innovation, and that's what's allowing us to grow at the growth rates we're growing at today. The dialogue we're now focusing on is how do we identify opportunities to grow over and above that. And Devin has really highlighted 3 major opportunities where he sees it. One, leveraging our data to provide a more personalized experience and to provide more merchandising on eBay, which we're just really getting started on. We didn't have a cart until this year, and the cart is a natural place to do merchandising. So leveraging our data. Two, what I described earlier, BRIC and emerging markets. A real focus there starting with cross-border and, over time, with domestic. And then three is the whole local opportunity, building that connection with local inventory, whether it's large retailers listing on eBay, whether it's using Milo and RedLaser to provide a multichannel shopping experience, whether it's things like eBay Now. So those are things that we think can help drive incremental growth on eBay, and we're as bullish and optimistic as we've been certainly since any time I've been here on the potential of the eBay business. And then in our Q4 marketing spend, we anticipate spending roughly the same amount we spent last year, the same magnitude, and we're always optimizing within that. And we don't break out how much brand versus Google versus other. We basically are constantly optimizing. And I think the integrated marketing campaign with the tag line, ""From the new to the hard to find, when it's on your mind, it's on eBay,"" is -- will serve us well in this fourth quarter. And so we're excited about our holiday plans."

But I envision this new entry of new buyers to, yes, help sold item growth. But over time, I think sold item and GMV growth will be fairly consistent.

It relies on a series of external data feeds where we can make decisions in split seconds about the credit worthiness of an individual.

And then secondly, now that the front-end upgrade is deployed, can you review again some of the specifics on the back-end technology upgrade such as Cassini, when we should expect the bulk of those to roll out?"

And some of the promotions that are gaining a little bit of -- little pockets of traction, we're still testing in micro-pockets with the retailers is we would call merchant-specific balances, which is the merchants offering a balance if they pay with PayPal. And if it gets them engaged and gets the consumer to come in and say, ""How can I pay with PayPal?"" and mobile number and PIN is often how they're paying. And no, I don't think there's anything material in the funding mix, yes."

And we'll just continue to roll it out wherever it tests positive, and we'll aggregate it over the week. The first customers -- this week is the first time we're putting any reasonable portion of customer-facing volume against it, and it's doing well. So I put that into the bucket of a series of technology and product continuous improvement that we'll be making over the next year or 2 years."

Just hoping you could help us understand some of the dynamics here, I guess in particular the Q-to-Q. How much is tied to seasonality and then perhaps hedging as well? And then just quickly on the Marketplaces side. You're obviously pretty excited about the site redesign. Is there any risk of unintended consequences here as you're making these changes fairly close to the holiday season?"

So yes, the short answer is seasonal, and the underlying dynamics are really twofold. One is, seasonally, our Q2 take rate, primarily because the adoption of the PayPal private label card is in essence monetized in Q2. So we always have a higher take rate in Q2 than we do rest of year. And the other seasonal dynamic is we just -- we broke off during the course of the year in preparation for the fourth quarter holiday season. So those 2 seasonal dynamics result in a degradation of margins Q2 to Q3, and that's pretty -- been pretty consistent. I would say that on a year-over-year basis, though, Q1, Q2, Q3, we've seen the 300-basis-point improvement year-on-year. And right now, through the first 9 months, segment margins are roughly 25%, which is at the low end of what we said we'd be able to do next year. So we feel very good about the margin expansion that we've experienced in the PayPal business."

In fact, if anything, I think we're feeling better going into this holiday than we have in a while. I mean I feel like the user experience, the growing new users, as well as existing users, the marketing campaign. So we can't predict what the macroeconomic set of circumstances is going to be this holiday in the U.S. and particularly in Europe. But we feel very good about the business momentum we're carrying into the fourth quarter. So we will look forward to reporting on that and seeing all of you in 90 days. Thank you."
