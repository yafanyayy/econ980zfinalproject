249205,145658092,214462,"Allergan Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2012",2012-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During the fourth quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 7.2% and due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most world currencies by a higher 8.2% in local currencies. We",2632,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During the fourth quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 7.2% and due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most world currencies by a higher 8.2% in local currencies. We enjoyed double-digit growth in many operating regions. That is, in the U.S., pharmaceutical business, thanks to the acceleration of the Botox therapeutic franchise, in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, while business and economic conditions in Europe were more challenging than earlier in the year. 
For the full year of 2011, Allergan grew year-over-year by 10.9% in dollars and 9.2% in local currencies with double digit growth in all of our overseas operating regions: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. 
Regarding operating performance, we continued on a strong trajectory, with fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $1 even, marking an increase of 13.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and above the range provided on the last earnings call. 
Gross margin in the quarter was a direct tie of 86.8% of sales, which Jeff Edwards will comment shortly. For the full year of 2011, Allergan generated on the same basis, earnings per share of $3.65, an increase of 15.5% over 2010. The reconciliations to GAAP numbers kindly consult our press release. 
With these strong results, we are pleased that we delivered on our midterm aspiration of mid-teens earnings per share growth. The strong earnings we achieved after we observed estimated total cost of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts of just over $130 million on a pre-tax equivalent basis. The split is just over $90 million the U.S. healthcare reform and approximately $40 million for overseas price reductions. 
At the start of the year, we have estimated the cost of $100 million for the year. This cost increased as the year progressed, as we were hit the midst of mandated price reductions in Europe as well as in South Korea, and in Q4, by an increase in our accrual for the so-called doughnut toll for Medicare Part D by an additional amount in excess with $10 million. 
Of the $130 million plus, approximately $100 million was reflected as a reduction in net sales. We continue to invest vigorously into our future, increasing our investment into R&D by 12.6% to $858 million on a non-GAAP basis. 
For 2012, we plan to execute off the large number of revelatory approvals that we secured from agencies around the world in 2010 and 2011. And just be noted within the guidance given for 2012, that R&D is substantially higher than the models of many sellside analysts. 
During 2011, we maintain high level of investment in SG&A of just over 40.3% of sales in line with 2010. Regarding investment in DTC, we spent $177 million in 2011, just over the $171 million expense in 2010. As we added a new branded, unbranded campaign for chronic migraine, it is evident that spend in other brands was leveraged, as we transition from the creation of brand awareness to maintaining consumer awareness. 
Now turning to the performance for the individual businesses. Regarding ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. After an outlier cultural weak growth in Q3, both culture growth returned to double-digit in local currencies of 10.7% and 9.2% in dollars. This is very much in line with full-year 2011 growth over 2010 at 9.9% in local currencies and 11.4% in dollars, and matching up with the year-to-date September growth numbers of 10% reported by IMS Global. 
Of course, you'll note there is one quarter arrears given market research. In the U.S., we're picking up the growth, as we have worked our way past that genericization of ACULAR and radius that, and a stable base to base up to get product, after licensing run rate in 0.15% to outcome. 
Even after the generalization of Zylotan, LUMIGAN continues to grow strongly at is poised to overtake Zylotan in terms of prescription in the coming weeks. Given the lower rates of hyperemia for LUMIGAN 0.01%, the rescission perception of the efficacy of LUMIGAN, the percentage of new prescriptions written them for LUMIGAN 0.0%, As a proportion of all LUMIGAN prescriptions has passed the 50% mark. 
In 2012, LUMIGAN enjoys the best formulary position ever. COMBIGAN and RESTASIS also continued to grow strongly in the United States. All of our overseas regions enjoy double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. In Europe, strong performance is being driven by LUMIGAN, GANFORT, OPTIVE and OZURDEX. Latin America, we are the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company, with the wide range of countries enjoying strong advances, driven by LUMIGAN 0.01%, GANFORT, our tears products, as well as release that and Zypred. 
In Asia, we are growing very strongly across Southeast Asia, as well as any China, although off a mall base. In addition, we are growing share in our large businesses in India and Korea. LUMIGAN 0.01% was recently launched in India. 
For 2012, we are pleased that we have just launched in the U.S. a new OPTIVE product, OPTIVE advance, triple action the formula that works in all layers of the tear film. In Europe, the same product is just been launched as OPTIVE Plus. 
Regarding of the them, our partner Japan, Senju, just secured approval and will mark the product, will market the product as ALPHAGAN. In Russia, we commence selling ALPHAGAN P and GANFORT in January and launch other products shortly. OZURDEX, since last earnings call, has been a provider for retinal the inclusion or retinal vein occlusion and uveitis in several countries, namely Canada, Israel, Switzerland, Singapore, Mexico, Chile and Sri Lanka. 
Regarding BOTOX, sales increased versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 8.3% in local currencies and by 7.5% in dollars. The full-year 2011, sales grew by 10.4% in local currencies and 12.4% in dollars. 
Concerning the full year of 2011, we estimate the sales of BOTOX for therapeutic indications, and separately, cosmetic use, both grew 12% versus prior year. 
Commenting for fourth quarter performance. Sales in U.S. therapeutic business continue to grow on the mid-teens rate. This is driven, not only by chronic migraine, which is increasing steadily well in excess of this rate, but also by our movement disorders franchise boosted by the upper limb spasticity indication. With the U.S. year genic bladder launch in November, sales in Q4 from this indication were only limited. 
The U.S. chronic migraine launch is progressing very well and better than planned. We have now trained about 4,600 individual physicians, either via the web or live injector training sessions, with most of the trainees in the last quarter being in the more productive life format. In total, almost 5,600 trainings have been conducted since approval. 
Reimbursement access continues to improve, with 88% of all commercial lines at a policy coverage at year-end. The volume of insurance verifications continues to increase and the number of denials to prior authorizations falls. Our physicians become convinced that there is reimbursement available. The average number of units injected moves closer to the FDA indicated dose of 155 units. 
Monitoring the effectiveness of our unbranded DTC campaign, which commence at the end of September, we have clear number of metrics of number of website hits and visits to find a doctor page. From this month onwards, we are placing branded advertisements in women's magazines. Our surveys indicate high levels of patient satisfaction. 
Regarding competition, therapeutic market share for movement disorders for Dysport and Xeomin combined is detonating about 5%. BOTOX therapy sales in Europe suffered from government austerity measures, as well as the impact of mandated price reductions. Sales in our Asia-Pacific markets and largest countries in Latin America continue to grow double-digit. Sales from our partner, GlaxoSmithKline in Japan, were also under strong growth trends. 
Please note that we booked royalty income for Japan, not sales. Since the last earnings call, we received additional country approvals for chronic migraine in a host of countries: Canada, Sweden, Spain, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Peru. For new better euro over activity approvals in Canada, Spain, Austria, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Estonia and Peru. We've also reduced a positive period from transfer that cell-based BOTOX release assay and an approval in the Czech Republic. 
In Japan, our partner, GlaxoSmithKline, followed BOTOX with the treatment of auxiliary hyperhidrosis. I'll now move on to give further color regarding aesthetic category sales. First of all, U.S. market conditions remain good and appeared to have strengthened since the summer. We estimate that in the fourth quarter, the markets grew year-over-year as follows. Consumer demand for aesthetic your modulators in the low double-digits, fillers in the upper teens and breast procedures in the high single-digit. Given the impact of our consumer promotions, there may be short timing differences between consumer demand and ex-factory shipments. 
Regarding market share in the U.S., aesthetic neuro modulator category, it seems that this port share is stagnating in the high teens. The most recent survey for December shows Dysport 17% and CMN with 8%, the latter driven by very heavy sampling with roughly a quarter of CMN's gain stemming from Dysport. 
Sales in Europe were challenging, given economic conditions and some market share loss, as both kosher and as earlier enter new markets. Sales in the quarter continues to grow in the double digits in Asia-Pacific and our main markets in Latin America. 
We are pleased that we commenced our direct sales operations for Allergan Medical in Russia this week. Regarding worldwide market share for all users of neuromodulators in Q3 2011, the last periods for which we have data available, we estimate that BOTOX enjoyed about 78.5% market share, actually gaining about 180 basis points from the year earlier, as we regain some share in the ascetic space, despite the entry of new competition. 
From the sales expectations contained in our press release, you will note that we had foresee double-digit BOTOX sales growth in 2011, led by the newly approved therapeutic indications. Commencing facial aesthetics meaning thermal failures. Sales in the fourth quarter increased by 13.5% in local currencies and 12.4% in dollars. The full-year sales grew by 24.9% in local currencies and by 27.8% in dollars. 
Regarding the fourth quarter, sales growth was more moderate relative to earlier quarters in the year, principally due to the timing of our promotion in the U.S. called duet dividends that provided incentives to physicians to place combination orders for BOTOX and JUVÉDERM. 
The selling of this promotion, which was highly successful, ended in the 3rd week of September. Analyzing the data, this clearly boosted sales in Q3, as was commented on the last call, and then tampered ex-factory sales in Q4, especially in October. 
As stated earlier, we estimate that consumer demand in the U.S. filler markets is growing in the upper teens, and JUVÉDERM actually gains some share year-over-year in Q4. In all the other operating regions, including Europe and Canada, we continue to enjoy volume growth. 
In Brazil, we have successfully supported JUVÉDERM with DTC advertising. Coming back to the U.S. This week, we started taking orders for our JUVÉDERM presentation, which contains 25% more clinically relevant highlighted acid and a new 1 ML syringe. Total the same price as the 0.8% ML syringe, this is yet another way to the Allergan is providing value for our customers. 
Breast aesthetics. Breast aesthetic sales increased in the fourth quarter by 2.5% in local currencies and 2.0% in dollars. For the full year, sales grew 7.2% in local currencies and 9.5% in dollars. As commented earlier, we estimate the U.S. market in the fourth quarter grew in procedures in the high single-digit, better than we have expected at the time of the last earnings call. 
Given steady long-term share gains, as Allergan can offer a full line of market leading products, Mentor has responded with breast reductions in certain selective accounts. We maintained price disciplined, and we're willing to walk away from certain low price accounts. As a result, we may have lost some marginal share at year-end. 
Throughout the year, U.S. sales have benefited from market preference for higher-priced Philip implants and new tissue expanded products. In the fourth quarter, perhaps some initial sales of our Recta XT imaging system. 
In Europe sales continue to grow modestly, even in most Southern European markets. Given the scandal around the French PIP company, implant company, since mid-December, and media attention, we're monitoring the situation carefully, especially in France, the U.K., Germany and Italy, where most of the PIP implants result. So far, we have not suffered any noticeable impact in our sales, although it is quite possible that surgeons may be moving away from lower priced competitors to our higher-priced quality products. 
Sales growth in Latin America and Asia were lower than in prior quarters due to differences in timing of shipments to distributors in Q4 of 2011 versus Q4 of 2010. Our skin care franchise grew in the fourth quarter year-over-year by a strong 19.8% in dollars and virtually the same at 19.9% to local currencies, given that this is mostly U.S. business. 
Full-year sales growth was just over 13% in dollars and local currencies. The fourth quarter result was driven by a jump of 41% in LATISSE sales, as resulted a special offer to physicians in dispensing states in Q4 2011, coupled with an aggressive sampling campaign in Q4 2010 i.e. the prior year, which dampened the prior year sales. 
Since the repositioning of the product as part of the woman's 8 antiaging portfolio of products, we have seen an improvement in product perception in our consumer and Azzalure surveys. In addition to the U.S., contributions to sales growth came from Canada, Mexico, where we can support the product with DCC advertising, Brazil, Hong Kong and other markets in Southeast and East Asia. 
ACZONE sales benefiting from a dedicated medical dermatology sales force and increased deployment, jumped more than 50%, with TAZORAC ex- factory sales declining modestly, although we see end market acquisition dollars growing 8% year-over-year in Q4. More detailed attention is being devoted to TAZORAC since Q3.
Regarding the obesity intervention line, sales in the fourth quarter continued on a disappointing trend, declining 23.0% in dollars and 22.7% in local currencies. Year-to-date sales declined 16.5% in dollars and 18.1% local currencies. 
On a positive note, we're able to increase our sales of our balloon, driven by strong performance in Latin America. Outbound sales in the U.S. are being impacted, both by higher employment rates, as well as reimbursement barriers and increasing co-pays, as employer ships cost to their employees. Sales in Australia also declined for similar reasons. In the overall, U.S. bariatric market, which we estimate declined 6% year-to-date in November has declined in procedure share to 40% in November from 52% a year earlier, while bypass held steady at 34% and sleeve gastrectomy doubled from 11% to 22%. 
Based on overseas experience, we believe the sleeve will reach a plateau. The only bright share data point is that LAP-BAND increased its share of the band market to 83%. In light of these market dynamics, we have made a major change in our resource allocation to access to reimbursement, expanding both the teams dedicated to Lat Am, as well as harnessing the full strength of our full managed markets steam. This is the same team that has produced great results for BOTOX and our ophthalmic products. 
We do have convincing health economics data to influence policy changes, both the managed care organizations, as well as large corporate and government employers. Regarding Lat Am, for a use in adolescents, we are conducting a study at the suggestion of the FDA which to receive clinical data. We will, however, not be pursuing a label extension to adolescents. And I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financials."

During the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan generated high-quality operating results despite increasing headwinds relating to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing pressures. Allergan continu",1152,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan generated high-quality operating results despite increasing headwinds relating to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing pressures. Allergan continues to successfully manage and perform through this type of pressure due to our diversified base of business, strong product platform and softly directed approach to investing into the businesses. This portfolio based approach is once again enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share results above the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1, marking a 13.6% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Excluding the effects of the fourth quarter 2010 R&D tax catch-up, non-GAAP diluted EPS growth for the fourth quarter was approximately 19%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter earnings per share for 2010 was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit cost by the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2010. A constellation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. 
For the full year of 2011, Allergan delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.65, despite increasing cost related to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing and economic pressure mentioned by David. The strong full-year EPS result was above the high end of our range of expectations provided in February 2011 of $3.54, to $3.60. 
Our commitment to the long-term future of our company and to our shareholders is evident in this result as we're able to both investors strongly to our growth drivers of the business and pass stronger earnings performance on to our shareholders in the form of greater EPS performance. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's Q4 2011 gross margin of 86.8% increased 100 basis points when compared to Q4 2010. And Allergan once again saw a sequential quarterly improvement in both its pharmaceutical and medical device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, positive manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions, lower royalty expenses and in the fourth quarter, favorable geographic and product mix. Favorable margins were partially offset by the continual pricing pressure we are experiencing around the world unreimbursed products. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product in the sales ratio for the fourth quarter was 39%, totaling 550 -- I'm sorry, $540 million. 
Comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 40% and $517 million, respectively. We continue to recognize the benefits of leveraging many of our busied while continuing to have the flexibility to make meaningful focused investments on projects that we believe will yield the greatest financial returns. 
Allergan will continue to seek out these value driving investments during 2010. However, expectations are is that there will be that we will be in the position to produce some SG&A spending leverage versus 2011 non-GAAP full-year results. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.4% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $226 million, an increase in spend of approximately $26 million over the fourth quarter of 2010, when the ratio of R&D spend product net sales was 15.5%. 
It is worth noting that the R&D spend during the fourth quarter was sequentially above the level of spread to the third quarter of 2011, and represented the third consecutive quarter of sequential quarterly R&D spend increase, excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, as we continue to fund new projects and increase funding of projects, which we're advancing through the pipeline. We will adjust the R&D pipeline in more detail on our upcoming R&D day, in late March of this year. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjusted, Allergan's fourth quarter operating income ratio increased by 110 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Solid top line growth, as well as continuing strengthening of the gross margins and enhanced leverage within the SG&A category of the primary drivers of this improvements. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan day sales outstanding was 48 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 125 days. Allergan generated operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $339 million in the quarter and $965 million for the full year of 2010. This compares to $955 million generated for the full year of 2010 after excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2010 payments to the Department of Justice of approximately $594 million. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions total approximately $2.6 billion and $987 million respectively. For the first quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1.340 billion to $1.390 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.86. Regarding full-year expectations for 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,650 billion to $5,850 billion. Our 2012 expectations, since incremental pricing pressures outside of the U.S. of approximately $40 million and a negative currency impact of between 2% and 3% on sales growth. 
Allergan estimates full-year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $4.13 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 13% and 15%. This expectation assumes that the R&D, the U.S. R&D, tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012 with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. This would generate a higher effective tax rate in the first 3 quarters of 2012, Thus, a lower EPS result, while benefiting both the Q4 effective tax rate reported Q4 EPS. 
For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. 
With respect to 2012 capital expenditures, we project a CapEx of approximately $200 million for the full year. Regarding 2012 cash flow, we expect to generate operating cash flow, after CapEx, in excess of $1 billion. We have assumed moderate level of share repurchase activity of approximately 6 million shares in 2012 with our repurchase objectives limited to only match expected employee stock option-based compensation programs. 
Quite some the judges I have made reference to earlier in my text, 2011 was a very successful year and a good year. We are a company with very sound balanced and positioning and more importantly, are in a good place with respect to our future. We will make every effort to further build on our momentum and strengths while effectively executing against our strategies. Further strengthening Allergan's position as a leader within each of our selected specialty market is an important success factor that we continuously aim to build upon. We look forward to the opportunities emerging for Allergan in 2012. So with that, operator, I'd now like to open the call up to questions."

One other thing I should just quickly correct from my opening remarks, when I talked about outlook for BOTOX growth in 2012, I talked about double-digit and I misread it as 2011.

And I believe that we're both about 50% of the BOTOX franchise sales. I guess my question is, beyond European price cuts, why isn't the therapeutic side growing faster? And how should we think about migraine? Obviously, your comments have been optimistic, but at least relative to our model, BOTOX sales were a little bit below what we were looking for, and it seems to be on the therapeutic side. So just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on whether we should be expecting therapeutic to accelerate as advertising drives more U.S. sales and/or as ex-U.S. sales grow as the rollout continues?"

It's another racket sport, so to speak. Because we know that all the therapeutic launched are very long run. I often use the analogy, this is the fighter jet taking off this versus the 747 as is for the other side of the world. Long, long climb.

Some of that or a lot of that is attributable to geographic mix. So a stronger U.S. component. And then if you look at the product mix, stronger both ophthalmology and BOTOX components within that. So that always drives some very nice performance for us. And some of that is attributable to the timing of the year and reimbursement. So if you look at sustainability, we -- we've seen growth expense declined. And our expectations are as a percent, that should continue being the case. So that is sustainable. If you look at plant performance, our standard cost continues to improve. We had some very favorable appearances of this year. You could see that if we continue to perform above our expectation, you'll see positive variances as well. So the offset, of course, got to mention it is it this ongoing pricing pressure in certain parts of the world. So we've got to keep that in mind and look at it in the basket. So I would say, generally strong manufacture performance, strong standard cost performance, strong plant efficiencies and lower royalty expense, all very, very sustainable."

It just didn't, naturally, it's logical since the recession has got much worse because it's very easy for politicians to go and basically extract money out of the pharmaceutical industry, it's tougher  extract it out of hospitals or physicians salaries then of course, in Europe most doctors our employees of the government versus being independent on their operators. so to speak, as in the United States. So we're just being thankful about it, but we don't know where these price cuts will be, but they will probably come. And it's always safer to be -- it's better to be safe than sorry. I think given that background, I can certainly assure you that the profitability of our European, meaning, greater European operations continues to increase well. So we're not just sitting there saying we have a like your region. The reason that our, my European colleagues can do this is they, too, have had a huge number of new approvals. And of course, approvals, innovation drive growth. And in between that, of course, just like we've done in North America, there is some leveraging of our SG&A structures. So despite these headwinds, Europe actually had, for the full-year last year, across-the-board, double-digit local currency growth. And also, managed very nice, even an excessive, the sales number bottom line growth, as measured on a management basis. So good job done. And I think it goes to big to the quality of everybody of this company and all the way from the cost of goods that are, that the products that are manufactured, where we brought down the cost of goods all the way through good performance in the field."

And clearly, with reimbursement available and then awareness through DTCs that I've commented, we've seen growth there. And the next sector of growth is the next cohorts arriving brand-new. Let's call then the newly trained injectors. And as I've open pointed out. There's probably somewhere between 6 and 12 months lag between people saying, okay, I've trained and now starting, and then really injecting patients in volumes. So we have all these different curves of growth. And then, the final one you addressed was repeat. And what I both heard for determine when I interviewed doctors as well as the surveys I've read, I think the vast majority of neurologists will inject patients for as long as 3 injection cycles, even if they may be skeptical about the efficacy of the drug in that individual patient. Also, from everything I can see, it would suggest very high levels of both physicians, as well as patient satisfaction. And I think it's in excess of 80%, where people believe that BOTOX is providing incremental benefit to that individual patient and relative to other drugs, that is a very, very high rate of satisfaction. And of course, we monitor it really carefully so that we understand how the product is really coming through all these phases of adoption. And everything is very positive."

During the fourth quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 7.2% and due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most world currencies by a higher 8.2% in local currencies. We",2617,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During the fourth quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 7.2% and due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most world currencies by a higher 8.2% in local currencies. We enjoyed double-digit growth in many operating regions. That is, in the U.S., pharmaceutical business, thanks to the acceleration of the Botox therapeutic franchise, in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, while business and economic conditions in Europe were more challenging than earlier in the year. 
For the full year of 2011, Allergan grew year-over-year by 10.9% in dollars and 9.2% in local currencies with double digit growth in all of our overseas operating regions: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. 
Regarding operating performance, we continued on a strong trajectory, with fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $1 even, marking an increase of 13.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and above the range provided on the last earnings call. 
Gross margin in the quarter was a direct core tie of 86.8% of sales, which Jeff Edwards will comment shortly. For the full year of 2011, Allergan generated on the same basis, earnings per share of $3.65, an increase of 15.5% over 2010. For reconciliations to GAAP numbers kindly consult our press release. 
With this strong result, we are pleased that we delivered on our midterm aspiration of mid-teens earnings per share growth. The strong earnings we achieved after we absorbed estimated total cost of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts of just over $130 million on a pre-tax equivalent basis. The split is just over $90 million for U.S. healthcare reform and approximately $40 million for overseas price reductions. 
At the start of the year, we have estimated the cost of $100 million for the year. This cost increased as the year progressed. As we were hit with waves of mandated price reductions in Europe as well as in South Korea, and in Q4, by an increase in our accrual for the so-called doughnut toll for Medicare Part D by an additional amount in excess of $10 million. 
 
Of the $130 million plus, approximately $100 million was reflected as a reduction to net sales. We continue to invest vigorously into our future, increasing our investment into R&D by 12.6% to $858 million on a non-GAAP basis. 
For 2012, we plan to execute off the large number of regulatory approvals that we secured from agencies around the world in 2010 and 2011. If this [ph] be noted within the guidance given for 2012, that R&D is substantially higher than the models of many sellside analysts. 
During 2011, we maintained high level of investment in SG&A of just over 40.3% of sales in line with 2010. Regarding investment in DTC, we spent $177 million in 2011, just over the $171 million expense in 2010. As we added a new branded, unbranded campaign for chronic migraine, it is evident that spend in other brands was leveraged, as we transition from the creation of brand awareness to maintaining consumer awareness. 
Now turning to the performance for the individual businesses. Regarding ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. After an outlier quarter of weak growth in Q3, fourth quarter growth returned to double-digit in local currencies of 10.7% and 9.2% in dollars. This is very much in line with full-year 2011 growth over 2010 at 9.9% in local currencies and 11.4% in dollars, and matching up with the year-to-date September growth numbers of 10% reported by IMS Global. 
Of course, you'll note,  we're always one quarter in arrears given market research. In the U.S., we're picking up in growth, as we have worked our way past that genericization of ACULAR and ELESTAT, and stabilized the base ALPHAGAN product, after licensing remonidine 0.15% to Alcon. 
Even after the genericization of Zylotan, LUMIGAN continues to grow strongly and is poised to overtake Travatan in terms of prescriptions in the coming weeks. Given the lower rates of hyperemia for LUMIGAN 0.01%, the physician perception of the efficacy of LUMIGAN, the percentage of new prescriptions written for LUMIGAN 0.01%, as a proportion of all LUMIGAN prescriptions has passed the 50% mark. 
In 2012, LUMIGAN enjoys the best formulary position ever. COMBIGAN and RESTASIS also continued to grow strongly in the United States. All of our overseas regions enjoy double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. In Europe, strong performance is being driven by LUMIGAN, GANFORT, OPTIVE and OZURDEX. Latin America, we are the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company, with a wide range of countries enjoying strong advances, driven by LUMIGAN 0.01%, GANFORT, our tears products, as well as RELESTAT and Zypred. 
In Asia, we are growing very strongly across Southeast Asia, as well as in China, although off a small base. In addition, we are growing share in our large businesses in India and Korea. LUMIGAN 0.01% was recently launched in India. 
For 2012, we are pleased that we have just launched in the U.S. a new OPTIVE product, OPTIVE Advanced, a triple action formula that works in all layers of the tear film. In Europe, the same product is just been launched as OPTIVE Plus. 
Regarding of ALPHAGAN, our partner Japan, Senju, just secured approval and will mark the product, will market the product as AIPHAGAN. In Russia, we commenced selling ALPHAGAN P and GANFORT in January and launch other products shortly. OZURDEX, since last earnings call, has been approved either for retinal vein occlusion or retinal vein occlusion and uveitis in several countries, namely Canada, Israel, Switzerland, Singapore, Mexico, Chile and Sri Lanka. 
Regarding BOTOX, sales increased versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 8.3% in local currencies and by 7.5% in dollars. The full-year 2011, sales grew by 10.4% in local currencies and 12.4% in dollars. 
Concerning the full year of 2011, we estimate the sales of BOTOX for therapeutic indications, and separately, cosmetic use, both grew 12% versus prior year. 
Commenting for fourth quarter performance. Sales in the U.S. therapeutic business continue to grow at a mid-teens rate. This is driven, not only by chronic migraine, which is increasing steadily well in excess of this rate, but also by our movement disorders franchise, boosted by the upper limb spasticity indication. With the U.S. neurogenic bladder launch in November, sales in Q4 from this indication were only limited. 
The U.S. chronic migraine launch is progressing very well and better than planned. We have now trained about 4,600 individual physicians, either via the web or live injector training sessions, with most of the trainings in the last quarter being in the more productive live format. In total, almost 5,600 trainings have been conducted since approval. 
Reimbursement access continues to improve, with 88% of all commercial lives paying policy coverage at year-end. The volume of insurance verifications continues to increase and the number of denials to prior authorizations falls. As physicians become convinced that there is reimbursement available, the average number of units injected moves closer to the FDA indicated dose of 155 units. 
Monitoring the effectiveness of our unbranded DTC campaign, which commenced at the end of September, we have clear number -- metrics of number of website hits and visits to the find-a-doctor page. From this month onwards, we are placing branded advertisements in women's magazines. Our surveys indicate high levels of patient satisfaction. 
Regarding competition, therapeutic market share for movement disorders for Dysport and Xeomin combined is stagnating about 5%. BOTOX therapeutic sales in Europe suffered from government austerity measures, as well as the impact of mandated price reductions. Sales in our Asia-Pacific markets and largest countries in Latin America continue to grow double-digit. Sales from our partner, GlaxoSmithKline in Japan, were also on a strong growth trends. 
Please note that we book royalty income for Japan, not sales. Since the last earnings call, we received additional country approvals for chronic migraine in a host of countries: Canada, Sweden, Spain, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Peru. For neurogenic [indiscernible] overactivity approvals in Canada, Spain, Austria, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Estonia and Peru. We've also received a positive opinion from France  for the cell-based BOTOX release assay and an approval in the Czech Republic. In Japan, our partner, GlaxoSmithKline, filed BOTOX for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis. 
I'll now move on to give further color regarding aesthetics category sales. First of all, U.S. market conditions remain good and appeared to have strengthened since the summer. We estimate that in the fourth quarter, the markets grew year-over-year as follows. Consumer demand for aesthetic neuromodulators in the low double-digits, fillers in the upper teens and breast procedures in the high single-digit. Given the impact of our consumer promotions, there may be short timing differences between consumer demand and x factory shipments. 
Regarding market share in the U.S., aesthetic neuromodulator category, it seems that Dysport share is stagnating in the high teens. The most recent survey for December shows Dysport at 17% and Xeomin with 8%, the latter driven by very heavy sampling with roughly a quarter of Xeomin's gain stemming from Dysport. 
Sales in Europe were challenging, given economic conditions and some market share loss, as both [ph] and Azzalure enter new markets. Sales in the quarter continued to grow in the double digits in Asia-Pacific and our main markets in Latin America.  We are pleased that we commenced our direct sales operations for Allergan Medical in Russia this week. 
Regarding worldwide market share for all users of neuromodulators in Q3 2011, the last periods for which we have data available, we estimate that BOTOX enjoyed about 78.5% market share, actually gaining about 180 basis points from the year earlier, as we regain some share in the aesthetic space, despite the entry of new competition. 
From the sales expectations contained in our press release, you will note that we had foresee double-digit BOTOX sales growth in 2011, led by the newly approved therapeutic indications. Commencing facial aesthetics, meaning thermal fillers, sales in the fourth quarter increased by 13.5% in local currencies and 12.4% in dollars. The full-year sales grew by 24.9% in local currencies and by 27.8% in dollars. 
Regarding the fourth quarter, sales growth was more moderate relative to earlier quarters in the year, principally due to the timing of our promotion in the U.S. called Duet Dividends, that provided incentives to physicians to place combination orders for BOTOX and JUVÉDERM. 
The sell-in of this promotion, which was highly successful, ended in the 3rd week of September. Analyzing the data, this clearly boosted sales in Q3, as was commented on the last call, and then tempered x factory sales in Q4, especially in October. 
As stated earlier, we estimate that consumer demand in the U.S. filler market is growing in the upper teens, and JUVÉDERM actually gained some share year-over-year in Q4. In all the other operating regions, including Europe and Canada, we continue to enjoy volume growth. 
In Brazil, we have successfully supported JUVÉDERM with DTC advertising. Coming back to the U.S. This week, we started taking orders for JUVÉDERM presentation, which contains 25% more clinically relevant hyaluronic acid in a new 1 mL syringe. Sold at the same price as the 0.8% mL syringe, this is yet another way that Allergan is providing value for our customers. 
Breast aesthetics. Breast aesthetic sales increased in the fourth quarter by 2.5% in local currencies and 2.0% in dollars. For the full year, sales grew 7.2% in local currencies and 9.5% in dollars. As commented earlier, we estimate the U.S. market in the fourth quarter grew in procedures in the high single-digit, better than we'd at the time of the last earnings call. 
Given steady long-term share gains, as Allergan can offer a full line of market leading products, Mentor has responded with price reductions in certain selective accounts. We maintained price discipline and we're willing to walk away from certain low-priced accounts. As a result, we may have lost some marginal share at year-end. 
Throughout the year, U.S. sales have benefited from market preference for higher-priced silicone implants and new tissue expander products. In the fourth quarter, from some initial sales of our Vectra XT imaging system. 
In Europe, sales continued to grow modestly, even in most southern European markets. Given the scandal around the French PIP company, implant company, since mid-December, and media attention, we're monitoring the situation carefully, especially in France, the U.K., Germany and Italy, where most of the PIP implants result. So far, we have not suffered any noticeable impact on our sales, although it is quite possible that surgeons may be moving away from lower-priced competitors to our higher-priced quality products. 
Sales growth in Latin America and Asia was lower than in prior quarters due to differences in timing of shipments to distributors in Q4 of 2011 versus Q4 of 2010. Our skin care franchise grew in the fourth quarter year-over-year by a strong 19.8% in dollars and virtually the same at 19.9% to local currencies, given that this is mostly U.S. business. 
Full-year sales growth was just over 13% in dollars and local currencies. The fourth quarter result was driven by a jump of 41% in LATISSE sales, as we sold in a special offer to physicians in dispensing states in Q4 2011, coupled with an aggressive sampling campaign in Q4 2010 i.e. the prior year, which dampened the prior year sales. 
Since the repositioning of the product as part of the woman's 8 anti-aging portfolio of products, we have seen an improvement in product perception in our consumer and attitude surveys. In addition to the U.S., contributions to sales growth came from Canada, Mexico, where we can support the product with DTC advertising, Brazil, Hong Kong and other markets in Southeast and East Asia. 
ACZONE sales benefiting from a dedicated medical dermatology sales force and increased deployment, jumped more than 50%, with TAZORAC x factory sales declining modestly, although we see in-market acquisition dollars growing 8% year-over-year in Q4. More detailed attention is being devoted to TAZORAC since Q3.
Regarding the obesity intervention line, sales in the fourth quarter continued on a disappointing trend, declining 23.0% in dollars and 22.7% in local currencies. Year-to-date sales declined 16.5% in dollars and 18.1% local currencies. 
On a positive note, we're able to increase our sales of ORBERA Balloon, driven by strong performance in Latin America. Outbound sales in the U.S. are being impacted, both by higher employment rates, as well as reimbursement barriers and increasing co-pays, as employers shift cost to their employees. Sales in Australia also declined for similar reasons. In the overall, U.S. bariatric market, which we estimate declined 6% year-to-date in November, it declined in procedure share to 40% in November from 52% a year earlier, whilst bypass held steady at 34% and sleeve gastrectomy doubled from 11% to 22%. 
Based on overseas experience, we believe that sleeve will reach a plateau. The only bright share data point is that LAP-BAND increased its share of the band market to 83%. In light of these market dynamics, we have made a major change in our resource allocation, to access to reimbursement, expanding both the teams dedicated to LAP-BAND, as well as harnessing the full strength of our full managed markets team. This is the same team that has produced great results for BOTOX and our ophthalmic products. 
We do have convincing health economics data to influence policy changes, both with managed care organizations, as well as large corporate and government employers. Regarding LAP-BAND, for use in adolescents, we are conducting a study, at the suggestion of the FDA who wish to receive clinical data. We will, however, not be pursuing a label extension to adolescents. And I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financials."

During the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan generated high-quality operating results despite increasing headwinds relating to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing pressures. Allergan continu",1154,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan generated high-quality operating results despite increasing headwinds relating to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing pressures. Allergan continues to successfully manage and perform through this type of pressure due to our diversified base of business, strong product platform and thoughtfully directed approach to investing into the businesses. This portfolio-based approach once again enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share results above the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1, marking a 13.6% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Excluding the effects of the fourth quarter 2010 R&D tax catch-up, non-GAAP diluted EPS growth for the fourth quarter was approximately 19%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter earnings per share for 2010 was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit caused by the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2010. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. 
For the full year of 2011, Allergan delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.65, despite the increasing cost related to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing and economic pressures mentioned by David. The strong full-year EPS result was above the high end of our range of expectations provided in February 2011 of $3.54 to $3.60. 
Our commitment to the long-term future of our company and to our shareholders is evident in this result as we were able to both invest strongly into our growth drivers of the business and pass stronger earnings performance onto our shareholders in the form of greater EPS performance. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's Q4 2011 gross margin of 86.8% increased 100 basis points when compared to Q4 2010. And Allergan once again saw sequential quarterly improvement in both its pharmaceutical and medical device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, positive manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions, lower royalty expenses and in the fourth quarter, favorable geographic and product mix. Favorable margins were partially offset by the continuing pricing pressure we are experiencing around the world on reimbursed products. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the fourth quarter was 39%, totaling 550 -- I'm sorry, $540 million. 
The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 40% and $517 million, respectively. We continue to recognize the benefits of leveraging many of our busied while continuing to have the flexibility to make meaningful, focused investments on projects that we believe will yield the greatest financial returns. 
Allergan will continue to seek out these thoughtful value-driving investments during 2010. However, expectations are, is that there will be -- that we will be in the position to produce some SG&A spending leverage versus 2011 non-GAAP full-year results. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.4% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $226 million, an increase in spend of approximately $26 million over the fourth quarter of 2010, when the ratio of R&D spend to product net sales was 15.5%. 
It is worth noting that the R&D spend during the fourth quarter was sequentially above the level of spend for the third quarter of 2011, and represented the third consecutive quarter of sequential quarterly R&D spend increase, excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, as we continue to fund new projects and increase funding of projects, which we're advancing through the pipeline. We will address the R&D pipeline in more detail at our upcoming R&D day, in late March of this year. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's fourth quarter operating income ratio increased by 110 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Solid top line growth, as well as continuing strengthening of the gross margins and enhanced leverage within the SG&A category are the primary drivers of this improvement. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan day sales outstanding was 48 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 125 days. Allergan generated operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $339 million in the quarter and $965 million for the full year of 2010. This compares to $955 million generated for the full year of 2010 after excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2010 payments to the Department of Justice of approximately $594 million. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.6 billion and $987 million respectively. For the first quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1.340 billion to $1.390 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.86. Regarding full-year expectations for 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5.650 billion to $5.850 billion. Our 2012 expectations, assumes incremental pricing pressures outside of the U.S. of approximately $40 million and a negative currency impact of between 2% and 3% on sales growth. 
Allergan estimates full-year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $4.13 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 13% and 15%. This expectation assumes that the R&D, the U.S. R&D, tax credit, will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012 with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. This would generate a higher effective tax rate in the first 3 quarters of 2012, thus, a lower EPS result, while benefiting both the Q4 effective tax rate reported Q4 EPS. 
For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. 
With respect to 2012 capital expenditures, we project a CapEx of approximately $200 million for the full year. Regarding 2012 cash flow, we expect to generate operating cash flow, after CapEx, in excess of $1 billion. We have assumed moderate level of share repurchase activity of approximately 6 million shares in 2012, with our repurchase objectives limited to only match expected employee stock option-based compensation programs. 
Quite some the judges I have made reference to earlier in my text, 2011 was a very successful year and a good year. We are a company with very sound, balanced and positioning and more importantly, are in a good place with respect to our future. We will make every effort to further build on our momentum and strengths while effectively executing against their strategies. Further strengthening Allergan's position as a leader within each of our selected specialty markets is an important success factor that we continuously aim to build upon. We look forward to the new opportunities emerging for Allergan in 2012. So with that, operator, I'd now like to open the call up to questions."

Because clearly, we live in an industry that is more under price pressure than it's ever been before. And if you just reflected on all the numbers I read for last year, it's pretty clear we did pretty well even after we've absorbed $130 million of costs in terms of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts. So that's the way I think about it. One other thing I should just quickly correct from my opening remarks, when I talked about outlook for BOTOX growth in 2012, I talked about double-digit and I misread it as 2011. I think it was clearly, a non sequitur, but I just wanted to straighten that fact out. Maybe the next question then."

Clearly, lots of opportunity. I think having lived, particularly in Spain, and knowing those cultures a little bit, of course, it's also a market or markets where there are people with money and then, unfortunately, people with not much money. And we probably are more skewed to the people who have economic purchasing power. And that in turn to me explains why our performances held up. That being said, I think, when I push all the papers away and say, what do I have to pay attention to in 2012? Clearly, it's monitoring Europe carefully."

It's another racket sport, so to speak. Because we know that all the therapeutic launches are very long ramp. I often use the analogy, this isn't a fighter jet taking off, this is a 747 headed for the other side of the world. A long, long climb. And you'll start really seeing this climb setting in 2012 and indeed beyond that. So -- and then I spoke the other side, on the cosmetic, I have to say, well, caution with economy.

So that always drives some very nice performance for us. And some of that is attributable to the timing of the year and reimbursement. So if you look at sustainability, we've seen royalty expense decline. And our expectations are, as a percent, that should continue being the case. So that is sustainable. If you look at plant performance, our standard cost continued to improve. We had some very favorable variances this year. You could see that if we continue to perform above our expectation, you'll see positive variances as well. So the offset, of course, got to mention it, is there's this ongoing pricing pressure in certain parts of the world. So we got to keep that in mind and look at it in the basket. So I would say, generally strong manufacturing performance, strong standard cost performance, strong plant efficiencies, lower royalty expense, all very, very sustainable."

Once you're in the 90s, in terms of commercial lives, where product has policy availability, we're in good shape. So then it comes down to vials out of the door, and that's one of the beauties of our model that we ship virtually everything direct. And of course, we then know, with great specificity, what is deep in use by individual doctors. When it gets to hospitals, fractionally more complicated because there we're shipping to hospital pharmacy, and then, of course, we have to try and allocate. Is that going into movement disorders because we have a long-term historical base there, or is it the new injectors for, say, migraine or now it's just starting out for a neurogenic overactive bladder. So you can go to the pharmacy and ask. And people understand why we're doing that. Of course, the other thing I look at is, not only surveys but anecdotes of patient satisfaction and we do consumer use and attitude surveys and to us, it's very apparent that the level of satisfaction with this product is very high and relative to other pharmaceutical products that have been launched for, I'll use the term, headaches, in the last decade."

One of the things that sometimes, I don't wish to be subtle, I'm trying to be very forthright. When I sat back and look to our numbers, clearly, that was the comment about our promotions. If you look at U.S. dividends, we sold that in, and physicians, clearly, were motivated to buy, and we can check that because we ship everything direct. So what I was saying is, that probably Q3, in terms of what was consumed, i.e. what was injected into patients, was slightly overstated and Q4, understated. Because, clearly, the physicians stocks up, buying on the offer, if you like, and then for not a very long period, but a couple of weeks, that inventory has to be rundown before they reorder. And so that's where I was really trying to put a spotlight on that. And when I look at all our numbers, I can see that in the U.S. medical business, at the margin for BOTOX and even more dramatically for fillers, which explains a lot of why the filler growth, Q3 year-over-year, is much higher than Q4 year-over-year. And otherwise, going back to Europe, fillers doing great. BOTOX, a little bit less, but there's also new competition. And if there's one thing I keep on reiterating, that we're watching very carefully is what's going on with the European economy. I'm not afraid of it.

It just since, naturally, it's logical since the recession has got much worse because it's very easy for politicians to go on and basically extract money out of the pharmaceutical industry, it's tougher  to extract it out of hospitals or physician salaries. Then of course, in Europe most doctors are employees of the government versus being independent owner-operators, so to speak, as in the United States. So we're just being sanguine about it, but we don't know where these price cuts will be, but they will probably come. And it's always safer to be -- it's better to be safe than sorry. I think given that background, I can certainly assure you that the profitability of our European, meaning, greater European operations continues to increase well. So we're not just sitting there saying we have a laggard region. The reason that our -- my European colleagues can do this is they, too, have had a huge number of new approvals. And of course, approvals, innovation drive growth. And in between that, of course, just like we've done in North America, there is some leveraging of our SG&A structures. So despite these headwinds, Europe actually had, for the full-year last year, across-the-board, double-digit local currency growth. And also, managed very nice, even an excessive, the sales number bottom line growth, as measured on a management basis. So good job done. And I think it goes to big to the quality of everybody of this company and all the way from the cost of goods that are -- that the products that are manufactured, where we brought down the cost of goods all the way through to good performance in the field."

So we have all these different curves of growth. And then, the final one you addressed was repeat. And what I both heard verbatim when I've interviewed doctors, as well as the surveys I've read, I think the vast majority of neurologists will inject patients for as long as 3 injection cycles, even if they may be skeptical about the efficacy of the drug in that individual patient. Also, from everything I can see, it would suggest very high levels of both physician, as well as patient satisfaction. And I think it's in excess of 80%, where people believe that BOTOX is providing incremental benefit to that individual patient and relative to other drugs, that is a very, very high rate of satisfaction.

During the fourth quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 7.2% and due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most world currencies by a higher 8.2% in local currencies. We",2638,"Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. During the fourth quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 7.2% and due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most world currencies by a higher 8.2% in local currencies. We enjoyed double-digit growth in many operating regions. That is, in the U.S., pharmaceutical business, thanks to the acceleration of the Botox therapeutic franchise, in Latin America and in Asia Pacific, while business and economic conditions in Europe were more challenging than earlier in the year. 
For the full year of 2011, Allergan grew year-over-year by 10.9% in dollars and 9.2% in local currencies with double digit growth in all of our overseas operating regions: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
Regarding operating performance, we continued on a strong trajectory, with fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $1 even, marking an increase of 13.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and above the range provided on the last earnings call. 
Gross margin in the quarter was a direct core tie of 86.8% of sales, which Jeff Edwards will comment shortly. For the full year of 2011, Allergan generated on the same basis, earnings per share of $3.65, an increase of 15.5% over 2010. For reconciliation to GAAP numbers kindly consult our press release. 
With this strong result, we are pleased that we delivered on our midterm aspiration of mid-teens earnings per share growth. The strong earnings were achieved after we absorbed estimated total cost of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts of just over $130 million on a pre-tax equivalent basis. The split is just over $90 million for U.S. healthcare reform and approximately $40 million for overseas price reductions. 
At the start of the year, we have estimated the cost of $100 million for the year. These costs increased as the year progressed as we were hit with waves of mandated price reductions in Europe as well as in South Korea, and in Q4, by an increase in our accrual for the so-called doughnut toll for Medicare Part D by an additional amount in excess of $10 million. 
 
Of the $130 million-plus, approximately $100 million was reflected as a reduction to net sales. We continue to invest vigorously into our future, increasing our investment into R&D by 12.6% to $858 million on a non-GAAP basis. 
For 2012, we plan to execute off the large number of regulatory approvals that we secured from agencies around the world in 2010 and 2011. It is to be noted that in the guidance given for 2012, that R&D is substantially higher than the models of many sell-side analysts. 
During 2011, we maintained a high level of investment in SG&A at just over 40.3% of sales in line with 2010. Regarding the investment in DTC, we spent $177 million in 2011, just over the $171 million expensed in 2010. As we added a new branded, unbranded campaign for chronic migraine, it is evident that spend in other brands was leveraged, as we transition from the creation of brand awareness to maintaining consumer awareness. 
Now turning to the performance of the individual businesses. Regarding ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. After an outlier quarter of weak growth in Q3, fourth quarter growth returned to double-digit in local currencies of 10.7% and 9.2% in dollars. This is very much in line with full year 2011 growth over 2010 at 9.9% in local currencies and 11.4% in dollars and matching up with the year-to-date September growth numbers of 10% reported by IMS Global. 
Of course, you'll note, we're always one quarter in arrears given market research. In the U.S., we're picking up in growth, as we have worked our way past the genericization of ACULAR and ELESTAT and have stabilized the base ALPHAGAN product, after licensing remonidine 0.15% to Alcon. 
Even after the genericization of Zylotan, LUMIGAN continues to grow strongly and is poised to overtake Travatan in terms of prescriptions in the coming weeks. Given the lower rates of hyperemia for LUMIGAN 0.01% and physician perception of the efficacy of LUMIGAN, the percentage of new prescriptions written for LUMIGAN 0.01%, as a proportion of all LUMIGAN prescriptions, has passed the 50% mark. 
In 2012, LUMIGAN enjoys the best formulary position ever. COMBIGAN and RESTASIS also continued to grow strongly in the United States. All of our overseas regions enjoy double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. In Europe, strong performance is being driven by LUMIGAN, GANFORT, OPTIVE and OZURDEX. In Latin America, we are the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company, with a wide range of countries enjoying strong advances, driven by LUMIGAN 0.01%, GANFORT, our tears products, as well as RELESTAT and Zypred. 
In Asia, we are growing very strongly across Southeast Asia, as well as in China, although off a small base. In addition, we are growing share in our large businesses in India and Korea. LUMIGAN 0.01% was recently launched in India. 
For 2012, we are pleased that we have just launched in the U.S. a new OPTIVE product, OPTIVE Advanced, a triple-action formula that works on all layers of the tear film. In Europe, the same product has just been launched as OPTIVE Plus. 
Regarding of ALPHAGAN, our partner in Japan, Senju, just secured approval and will mark the product -- will market the product as AIPHAGAN. In Russia, we commenced selling ALPHAGAN P and GANFORT in January and will launch other products shortly. OZURDEX, since the last earnings call, has been approved either for retinal vein occlusion or retinal vein occlusion and uveitis in several countries, namely Canada, Israel, Switzerland, Singapore, Mexico, Chile and Sri Lanka. 
Regarding BOTOX, sales increased versus the fourth quarter of 2010 by 8.3% in local currencies and by 7.5% in dollars. The full year 2011, sales grew by 10.4% in local currencies and 12.4% in dollars. 
Concerning the full year of 2011, we estimate that sales of BOTOX for therapeutic indications, and separately, cosmetic use, both grew 12% versus prior year. 
Commenting for fourth quarter performance. Sales in the U.S. therapeutic business continued to grow at a mid-teens rate. This is driven, not only by chronic migraine, which is increasing steadily well in excess of this rate, but also by our movement disorders franchise, boosted by the upper limb spasticity indication. With the U.S. neurogenic bladder launch in November, sales in Q4 from this indication were only limited. 
The U.S. chronic migraine launch is progressing very well and better than planned. We have now trained about 4,600 individual physicians, either via the Web or live injector training sessions, with most of the trainings in the last quarter being in the more productive live format. In total, almost 5,600 trainings have been conducted since approval. 
Reimbursement access continues to improve, with 88% of all commercial lives having policy coverage at year end. The volume of insurance verifications continues to increase and the number of denials to prior authorizations falls. As physicians become convinced that there is reimbursement available, the average number of units injected moves closer to the FDA indicated dose of 155 units. 
Monitoring the effectiveness of our unbranded DTC campaign, which commenced at the end of September, we have clear number -- metrics of number of website hits and visits to the find-a-doctor page. From this month onwards, we are placing branded advertisements in women's magazines. Our surveys indicate high levels of patient satisfaction. 
Regarding competition, therapeutic market share for movement disorders for Dysport and Xeomin combined is stagnating around 5%. BOTOX therapeutic sales in Europe suffered from government austerity measures, as well as the impact of mandated price reductions. Sales in our Asia Pacific markets and largest countries in Latin America continue to grow double-digit. Sales from our partner, GlaxoSmithKline in Japan, were also on a strong growth trend. 
Please note that we book royalty income for Japan, not sales. Since the last earnings call, we received additional country approvals for chronic migraine in a host of countries: Canada, Sweden, Spain, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Peru; for neurogenic detrusor overactivity approvals in Canada, Spain, Austria, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Estonia and Peru. We've also received a positive opinion from France for the cell-based BOTOX release assay and an approval in the Czech Republic. In Japan, our partner, GlaxoSmithKline, filed BOTOX for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis. 
I'll now move on to give further color regarding aesthetics category sales. First of all, U.S. market conditions remain good and appeared to have strengthened since the summer. We estimate that in the fourth quarter, the markets grew year-over-year as follows. Consumer demand for aesthetic neuromodulators in the low-double digits, fillers in the upper teens and breast procedures in the high-single digit. Given the impact of our consumer promotions, there may be short timing differences between consumer demand and x factory shipments. 
Regarding market share in the U.S., aesthetic neuromodulator category, it seems that Dysport share is stagnating in the high teens. The most recent survey for December shows Dysport at 17% and Xeomin with 8%, the latter driven by very heavy sampling with roughly a quarter of Xeomin's gain stemming from Dysport. 
Sales in Europe were challenging, given economic conditions and some market share loss, as Bocouture and Azzalure enter new markets. Sales in the quarter continued to grow in the double digits in Asia Pacific and our main markets in Latin America. We are pleased that we commenced our direct sales operations for Allergan Medical in Russia this week. 
Regarding worldwide market share for all users of neuromodulators in Q3 2011, the last periods for which we have data available, we estimate that BOTOX enjoyed about 78.5% market share, actually gaining about 180 basis points from the year earlier, as we regained some share in the aesthetic space, despite the entry of new competition. 
From the sales expectations contained in our press release, you will note that we had foresee double-digit BOTOX sales growth in 2011 (sic) [2012], led by the newly approved therapeutic indications. Commencing facial aesthetics, meaning thermal fillers, sales in the fourth quarter increased by 13.5% in local currencies and 12.4% in dollars. The full year sales grew by 24.9% in local currencies and by 27.8% in dollars. 
Regarding the fourth quarter, sales growth was more moderate relative to earlier quarters in the year, principally due to the timing of our promotion in the U.S. called Duet Dividends, that provided incentives to physicians to place combination orders for BOTOX and JUVÉDERM. 
The sell-in of this promotion, which was highly successful, ended in the 3rd week of September. Analyzing the data, this clearly boosted sales in Q3, as was commented on the last call, and then tempered x factory sales in Q4, especially in October. 
As stated earlier, we estimate that consumer demand in the U.S. filler market is growing in the upper teens, and JUVÉDERM actually gained some share year-over-year in Q4. In all the other operating regions, including Europe and Canada, we continue to enjoy volume growth. 
In Brazil, we have successfully supported JUVÉDERM with DTC advertising. 
Coming back to the U.S. This week, we started taking orders for JUVÉDERM presentation, which contains 25% more clinically relevant hyaluronic acid in a new 1 mL syringe. Sold at the same price as the 0.8 mL syringe, this is yet another way that Allergan is providing value for our customers. 
Breast aesthetics. Breast aesthetic sales increased in the fourth quarter by 2.5% in local currencies and 2.0% in dollars. For the full year, sales grew 7.2% in local currencies and 9.5% in dollars. As commented earlier, we estimate the U.S. market in the fourth quarter grew in procedures in the high-single digit, better than we'd expected at the time of the last earnings call. 
Given steady long-term share gains, as Allergan can offer a full line of market leading products, Mentor has responded with price reductions in certain selected accounts. We maintained price discipline and we're willing to walk away from certain low-priced accounts. As a result, we may have lost some marginal share at year end. 
Throughout the year, U.S. sales have benefited from market preference for higher-priced silicone implants and new tissue expander products. In the fourth quarter, from some initial sales of our Vectra XT imaging system. 
In Europe, sales continued to grow modestly, even in most southern European markets. Given the scandal around the French PIP company, implant company, since mid-December, and media attention, we're monitoring the situation carefully, especially in France, the U.K., Germany and Italy, where most of the PIP implants result. So far, we have not suffered any noticeable impact on our sales, although it is quite possible that surgeons may be moving away from lower-priced competitors to our higher-priced quality products. 
Sales growth in Latin America and Asia was lower than in prior quarters due to differences in timing of shipments to distributors in Q4 of 2011 versus Q4 of 2010. Our skin care franchise grew in the fourth quarter year-over-year by a strong 19.8% in dollars and virtually the same at 19.9% to local currencies, given that this is mostly U.S. business. 
Full year sales growth was just over 13% in dollars and local currencies. The fourth quarter result was driven by a jump of 41% in LATISSE sales, as we sold in a special offer to physicians in dispensing states in Q4 2011, coupled with an aggressive sampling campaign in Q4 2010, i.e. the prior year, which dampened the prior year sales. 
Since the repositioning of the product as part of a woman's 8 anti-aging portfolio of products, we have seen an improvement in product perception in our consumer and attitude surveys. In addition to the U.S., contributions to sales growth came from Canada, Mexico, where we can support the product with DTC advertising, Brazil, Hong Kong and other markets in Southeast and East Asia. 
ACZONE sales benefiting from a dedicated medical dermatology sales force and increased deployment, jumped more than 50%, with TAZORAC x factory sales declining modestly, although we see in-market acquisition dollars growing 8% year-over-year in Q4. More detailed attention is being devoted to TAZORAC since Q3.
Regarding the obesity intervention line, sales in the fourth quarter continued on a disappointing trend, declining 23.0% in dollars and 22.7% in local currencies. Year-to-date sales declined 16.5% in dollars and 18.1% local currencies. 
On a positive note, we're able to increase our sales of ORBERA Balloon, driven by a strong performance in Latin America. LAP-BAND sales in the U.S. are being impacted both by high unemployment rates, as well as reimbursement barriers and increasing co-pays, as employers shift cost to their employees. Sales in Australia also declined for similar reasons. In the overall, U.S. bariatric market, which we estimate declined 6% year-to-date in November, bands declined in procedure share to 40% in November from 52% a year earlier, whilst bypass held steady at 34% and sleeve gastrectomy doubled from 11% to 22%. 
Based on overseas experience, we believe that sleeve will reach a plateau. The only bright share data point is that LAP-BAND increased its share of the band market to 83%. In light of these market dynamics, we have made a major change in our resource allocation, to access to reimbursement, expanding both the teams dedicated to LAP-BAND, as well as harnessing the full strength of our full managed markets team. This is the same team that has produced great results for BOTOX and our ophthalmic products. 
We do have convincing health economics data to influence policy changes, both with managed care organizations, as well as large corporate and government employers. Regarding LAP-BAND for use in adolescents, we are conducting a study at the suggestion of the FDA who wish to receive clinical data. We will, however, not be pursuing a label extension to adolescents. And I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financials."

During the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan generated high-quality operating results despite increasing headwinds relating to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing pressures. Allergan continu",1156,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Allergan generated high-quality operating results despite increasing headwinds relating to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing pressures. Allergan continues to successfully manage and perform through this type of pressure due to our diversified base of business, strong product platform and thoughtfully directed approach to investing into the businesses. This portfolio-based approach has once again enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share results above the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1, marking a 13.6% increase over 2010 results for the same quarter. Excluding the effects of the fourth quarter 2010 R&D tax catch-up, non-GAAP diluted EPS growth for the fourth quarter was approximately 19%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter earnings per share for 2010 was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit caused by the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2010. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. 
For the full year of 2011, Allergan delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.65, despite the increasing cost related to U.S. Health Care Reform and Europe pricing and economic pressures mentioned by David. The strong full year EPS result was above the high end of our range of expectations provided in February 2011 of $3.54 to $3.60. 
Our commitment to the long-term future of our company and to our shareholders is evident in this result as we were able to both invest strongly into our growth drivers of the business and pass stronger earnings performance onto our shareholders in the form of greater EPS performance. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's Q4 2011 gross margin of 86.8% increased 100 basis points when compared to Q4 2010. And Allergan once again saw sequential quarterly improvement in both its pharmaceutical and medical device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, positive manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions, lower royalty expenses and in the fourth quarter, favorable geographic and product mix. Favorable margins were partially offset by the continuing pricing pressures we are experiencing around the world on reimbursed products. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the fourth quarter was 39%, totaling 550 -- I'm sorry, $540 million. 
The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2010 were 40% and $517 million, respectively. We continue to recognize the benefits of leveraging many of our businesses while continuing to have the flexibility to make meaningful, focused investments on projects that we believe will yield the greatest financial returns. 
Allergan will continue to seek out these thoughtful value-driving investments during 2012. However, expectations are that there will be -- that we will be in the position to produce some SG&A spending leverage versus 2011 non-GAAP full year results. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.4% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $226 million, an increase in spend of approximately $26 million over the fourth quarter of 2010, when the ratio of R&D spend to product net sales was 15.5%. 
It is worth noting that the R&D spend during the fourth quarter was sequentially above the level of spend for the third quarter of 2011, and represented the third consecutive quarter of sequential quarterly R&D spend increase, excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, as we continue to fund new projects and increase funding of projects, which we're advancing through the pipeline. We will address the R&D pipeline in more detail at our upcoming R&D day, in late March of this year. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's fourth quarter operating income ratio increased by 110 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Solid top line growth, as well as continuing strengthening of the gross margins and enhanced leverage within the SG&A category are the primary drivers of this improvement. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 48 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 125 days. Allergan generated operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $339 million in the quarter and $965 million for the full year of 2010. This compares to $955 million generated for the full year of 2010 after excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2010 payments to the Department of Justice of approximately $594 million. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments -- and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.6 billion and $987 million respectively. For the first quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,340,000,000 to $1,390,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.86. Regarding full year expectations for 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,650,000,000 to $5,850,000,000. Our 2012 expectations, assumes incremental pricing pressures outside of the U.S. of approximately $40 million and a negative currency impact of between 2% and 3% on sales growth. 
Allergan estimates full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $4.13 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 13% and 15%. This expectation assumes that the R&D -- the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012 with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. This would generate a higher effective tax rate in the first 3 quarters of 2012, thus, a lower EPS result, while benefiting both the Q4 effective tax rate reported Q4 EPS. 
For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. 
With respect to 2012 capital expenditures, we project a CapEx of approximately $200 million for the full year. Regarding 2012 cash flow, we expect to generate operating cash flow, after CapEx, in excess of $1 billion. We have assumed moderate levels of share repurchase activity of approximately 6 million shares in 2012, with our repurchase objectives limited to only match expected employee stock option-based compensation programs. 
Despite some of the challenges I’ve made reference to earlier in my text, 2011 was a very successful year and a good year. We are a company with very sound, balanced and positioning and more importantly, are in a good place with respect to our future. We will make every effort to further build on our momentum and strengths while effectively executing against our strategies. Further strengthening Allergan's position as a leader within each of our selected specialty markets is an important success factor that we continuously aim to build upon. We look forward to the new opportunities emerging for Allergan in 2012. So with that, operator, I'd now like to open the call up to questions."

Because clearly, we live in an industry that is more under price pressure than it's ever been before. And if you just reflect on all the numbers I read for last year, it's pretty clear we did pretty well even after we've absorbed $130 million of costs in terms of U.S. healthcare reform and overseas price cuts. So that's the way I think about it. One other thing I should just quickly correct from my opening remarks, when I talked about outlook for BOTOX growth in 2012, I talked about double-digit and I misread it as 2011. I think it was clearly, a non sequitur, but I just wanted to straighten that out. Maybe the next question then."

Clearly, lots of opportunity. I think having lived, particularly in Spain, and knowing those cultures a little bit, of course, it's also a market or markets where there are people with money and then, unfortunately, people with not much money. And we probably are more skewed to the people who have economic purchasing power. And that in turn to me explains why our performance has held up. That being said, I think, when I push all the papers away and say, what do I have to pay attention to in 2012? Clearly, it's monitoring Europe carefully."

It's another racket sport, so to speak. Because we know that all the therapeutic launches are very long ramp. I’ve often used the analogy, this isn't a fighter jet taking off, this is a 747 headed for the other side of the world. A long, long climb.

Some of that or a lot of that is attributable to geographic mix. So a stronger U.S. component. And then if you look at the product mix, stronger both ophthalmology and BOTOX components within that. So that always drives some very nice performance for us. And some of that is attributable to the timing of the year and reimbursement. So if you look at sustainability, we've seen royalty expense decline. And our expectations are, as a percent, that should continue being the case. So that is sustainable. If you look at plant performance, our standard costs continued to improve. We had some very favorable variances this year. You could see that if we continue to perform above our expectations, you'll see positive variances as well. So the offset, of course, got to mention it, is there's ongoing pricing pressure in certain parts of the world. So we got to keep that in mind and we look at it in a basket. So I would say, generally strong manufacturing performance, strong standard cost performance, strong plant efficiencies, lower royalty expense, all very, very sustainable."

And of course, we then know, with great specificity, what is deep in use by individual doctors. When it gets to hospitals, fractionally more complicated because there we're shipping to hospital pharmacy, and then, of course, we have to try and allocate. Is that going into movement disorders because we have a long-term historical base there, or is it the new injectors for, say, migraine or now it's just starting up for neurogenic overactive bladder. So you can go to the pharmacy and ask. And people understand why we're doing that. Of course, the other thing I look at is, not only surveys but anecdotes of patient satisfaction and we do consumer use and attitude surveys and to us, it's very apparent that the level of satisfaction with this product is very high relative to other pharmaceutical products that have been launched for, I'll use the broader term, headaches, in the last decade."

If you look at U.S. dividends, we sold that in, and physicians, clearly, were motivated to buy, and we can check that because we ship everything direct. So what I was saying is, that probably Q3, in terms of what was consumed, i.e. what was injected into patients, was slightly overstated and Q4, understated. Because, clearly, the physicians’ stock’s up, buying on the offer, if you like, and then for not a very long period, but a couple of weeks, that inventory has to be run down before they reorder. And so that's where I was really trying to put a spotlight on that. And when I look at all our numbers, I can see that in the U.S. medical business, at the margin for BOTOX and even more dramatically for fillers, which explains a lot of why the filler growth, Q3 year-over-year, is much higher than Q4 year-over-year. And otherwise, going back to Europe, fillers doing great. BOTOX, a little bit less, but there's also new competition.

And if I were a physician, a, I would have intellectual curiosity. I’d want to try it. And then secondly, if it's all free, I'm even more motivated to try it because, of course, I'm sure I'd be charging my patients, i.e., I've done something great for my personal bank account, right? So I think the next phase where Merz has stated that they will have national availability in March, which to me says they'll actually start selling versus giving away, that will become much more interesting. And we have a very robust series of measures to welcome them to our nice friendly market."

First of all, as I've stated, it follows the normal launch pattern, where the first goal is getting injectors trained. The second one is getting reimbursements in place. And right now, there's only temporary injection codes being utilized so that's always more challenging. We won't get a permanent code until 2013 because it takes a year until the system catches up. So everything is going well. There's a lot of enthusiasm. But of course, I have to kind of temper everybody's enthusiasm by saying, the numbers are interesting, but in 2012, still modest. You'll see a much bigger pickup in 2013, once reimbursement is permanent. And secondly, once we get into the bigger category of idiopathic, and I think where you are going is to say, if you’ve started as a neurologist with neurogenic, it will not be a massive learning process to then go to the next indication once it's on label because it's the same principle."

It’s just since, naturally, it's logical since the recession has got much worse because it's very easy for politicians to go and basically extract money out of the pharmaceutical industry, it's tougher to extract it out of hospitals or physician salaries. And then of course, in Europe most doctors are employees of the government versus being independent owner-operators, so to speak, as in the United States. So we're just being sanguine about it, but we don't know where these price cuts will be, but they will probably come. And it's always safer to be -- it's better to be safe than sorry. I think given that background, I can certainly assure you that the profitability of our European, meaning, greater European operations continues to increase well. So we're not just sitting there saying we have a laggard region. The reason that my European colleagues can do this is they, too, have had a huge number of new approvals. And of course, approvals, innovation drive growth. And in between that, of course, just like we've done in North America, there is some leveraging of our SG&A structures. So despite these headwinds, Europe actually had, for the full year last year, across-the-board, double-digit local currency growth. And also, managed a very nice, even in excess of the sales number bottom line growth, as measured on a management basis. So good job done. And I think it goes to a bit to the quality of everybody of this company and all the way from the cost of goods that are -- that the products that are manufactured, where we brought down the cost of goods all the way through to good performance in the field."

And clearly, with reimbursement available and then awareness through the DTCs that I commented, we've seen growth there. Then the next vector of growth is the next cohorts arriving brand-new. Let's call them the newly trained injectors. And as I've often pointed out, there is probably somewhere between 6 and 12 months’ lag between people saying, okay, I've trained and now I’m starting and then really injecting patients in volume. So we have all these different curves of growth. And then, the final one you addressed was repeat. And what I both heard verbatim when I've interviewed doctors, as well as the surveys I've read, I think the vast majority of neurologists will inject patients for as long as 3 injection cycles, even if they may be skeptical about the efficacy of the drug in that individual patient. Also, from everything I can see, it would suggest very high levels of both physician, as well as patient satisfaction. And I think it's in excess of 80%, where people believe that BOTOX is providing incremental benefit to that individual patient and relative to other drugs, that is a very, very high rate of satisfaction. And of course, we monitor it really carefully so that we understand how the product is really coming through all these phases of adoption. And everything is very positive."

In the first quarter of this year, Allergan sales grew versus the first quarter of 2011 by 9.0%.

In the first quarter of this year, Allergan sales grew versus the first quarter of 2011 by 9.0%. Due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to many world currencies, especially the euro, by a higher 10.4% in local currencies. 
We enjoyed strong double-digit growth in many operating regions, namely the U.S. and Canadian pharmaceuticals businesses, across the total business in Europe, Africa, Middle East, and also in Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
The U.S. medical device business have declining sales due to the filler business, which is explained by the timing of consumer promotions in 2012 and 2011, and due to market conditions for LAP-BAND. 
Regarding operating performance, we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86, marking an increase of 11.7% and at the top end of the range of expectations provided at our last earnings call. 
For reconciliation to GAAP numbers, kindly consult our press release. You'll note that we have not changed our outlook for sales and earnings for the full year of 2012. A few major swing items for the full year are, however, worthy of comment. 
On March 9, a U.S. District Court judge in California issued a permanent injunction in joining Merz from selling or providing German or soliciting purchases of Xeomin in official facial aesthetics market until January 9, 2013. The judge also imposed the same restrictions on Xeomin in the therapeutic market, unless customers are not identified on court mandate to the exclusion list, or customers voluntarily or without solicitation request to purchase the product for therapeutic use, and sworn declarations are submitted so stating. 
Finally, the judge joined Merz from providing or selling dermal filler products or soliciting purchases of dermal filler products until Jan 9, 2013, except to customers who voluntarily and without solicitation request to purchase the product and sworn declarations are submitted so stating, or unless customers have already purchased product between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010. 
Further exact details of this injunction are to be found in the court order. Given Xeomin inventory in channel, which still have to be used, this did not positively affect BOTOX sales in the quarter, but is expected to provide a benefit during the remainder of the year, and additionally, a small benefit to JUVÉDERM sales. 
As an offsite item, the cost of U.S. healthcare reform is now expected to cost us an incremental $20 million, increasing from $90 million in 2011 to an estimated pre-tax equivalent of $110 million in 2012. 
This is due to increased cost of the so-called doughnut toll relating to primarily our glaucoma product line and an increase in Allergan's share of the pharmaceutical tax due to our sales growth relative to the rest of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. 
Overseas, government-mandated price cuts remain in the range of our planning assumptions. Regarding Centura XR, a district court found all claims in patent invalid for obviousness. Whilst we were disappointed about the court's ruling, we believe that we have strong arguments on appeal. 
Based on the foregoing under our analysis of generic filers, our assumption is that no generic of century Exar will be commercialized during 2012. Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. Given the odd looking decline in facial aesthetics, which declined 5.0% year-over-year and 3.5% in local currencies, I will start with the consumer facing, cash pay businesses. 
From the facts which I will present, it is clear that we remain very positive about consumer spending in our markets. Derma fillers declined considerably in the United States, offset by strong double-digit growth internationally. Also recollect was sales in Q1 2011 grew a spectacular 48% versus the first quarter of 2010 and represented the first time that facial aesthetic sales were sequentially higher than the high point of the fourth quarter. 
In the U.S., this swing is explained by the timing of our so-called duet dividends promotion, whereby, we provide incentives to physicians and rebate coupons to their patients to combine orders and treatments of JUVÉDERM with BOTOX. 
In 2011, all orders for this highly successful promotion were in the first quarter. This year, the promotion commenced in the middle of April and last throughout the second quarter. 
In Q2, we've already seen a strong response to this promotion. The 2012 campaign was timed to commence just after the presumed launch of Xeomin cosmetic of the American Academy of Dermatology, which took place in the middle of March. 
Furthermore, physician office inventory of JUVÉDERM was drawn down as we launch the new syringe size of 1 ML at the same price as the former 0.8 ML syringe, which will no longer be commercialized in the U.S. market. 
In our commercial policy, we were clear to customers that we would not be taking back 0.8 ML inventory, thereby, encouraging physicians to exhaust old inventory before placing the orders. 
Earning out the channel inventories swings created ourselves, we estimate that the U.S. market in Q1 grew in the low double-digit. Sequentially, market share was flat in Q1 at about 39%, but up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2011. 
Overseas, we also continued to be encouraged by strong market growth, as well as share gains for JUVÉDERM. In Europe, syndicated market data shows fourth quarter year-over-year growth at about 16% across the European Union. 
JUVÉDERM sales in Europe, Australia and Korea, were boosted by physician enthusiasm for VOLUMA with lighter can in a 1 MLC range, which was launched during the quarter. JUVÉDERM was also launched in Thailand, and JUVÉDERM with LEVAQUIN in Mexico 
In Italy and Spain, extremely strong sales growth in both facial and but breast aesthetics pointed the results of consumer demand for our products. In Canada, we have commenced TV advertising for JUVÉDERM in March. 
Now moving onto breast aesthetics. Sales increased a very strong 17.0% in dollars and 18.4% in local currencies, with particularly strong performance stemming from Europe and Latin America. 
Based on extensive feedback from the marketplace, it seems that we have benefited as the clear market leader in Europe from a move to high-quality manufacturers for first-time augmentation surgery. 
In addition, Allergan implants have been chosen for revision surgery in the wake of the PIP scandal, which had its greatest impacts in France and the U.K. Lesser effects were seen in most of the European markets, as well as Latin America and Australia. 
In the U.S., we enjoyed good growth, not only from healthy growth in market procedures, but also due to the continuing improvement of mix to higher price silicon gel products and tissue expanders. 
With the breadth of our product line, both in implants and tissue expanders, but also across our plastic surgery product line, we feel well prepared to face new competition from center in the U.S. 
In Europe, at the Aesthetic Medicine World Congress in Monaco at the end of March, we unveiled a quarterly first communications campaign covering not only our breast implants, but also a full range of aesthetics products, building our heritage as clear category leader in each of our market segments. 
This campaign encompasses not only media relations, but also advertisements in women's magazines. 
Regarding BOTOX, the franchise grew 9.4% in dollars and 10.5% to local currencies, with greater double-digit growth from the therapeutic side of the business, thanks to the recently approved indications of chronic migraine, neurogenic overactive bladder and in the U.S., upper limb spasticity. 
A more margin rate grow on the cosmetic side due to competitive entries. Regarding worldwide market share for all users of neuromodulators in Q4 2011, the last period for which we have data available, we estimate the BOTOX enjoy just over 76% share, down about 300 basis points from Q4 of 2010, given the entry of competitors into new geographic markets. 
This, however, very positive that both the therapeutic and the aesthetic neuro modular market in Europe Q4 year-over-year continue to grow in the double digits. 
Now back to Q1 sales. On the cosmetic side of the business, we're impacted in the U.S. by Xeomin 7% to 8% share in the first quarter, this is for our consumer survey, after their prelaunch in October 2011. 
We were, however, pleased that BOTOX Cosmetic volume share in March moved up to 78% from 75% in February, gaining both against the sport and Xeomin. The driver was the media and promotional launch of our BOTOX 10-year anniversary campaign, which enabled patients to capture a discount across 3 treatments. 
We estimate that the U.S. aesthetic neuromodulator market was growing double-digit in Q1. In Europe, we lost limited market share in Southern European countries, where call derma with as alert and by Saad Bargach are still in the launch phase, but market growth remains encouraging. 
Sales across Asia were particularly strong. Turning to the therapeutic side of the business, growth was particularly strong in the United States, Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. 
In Europe, we're impacted by government-mandated price cuts, which have the effect of converting gratifying unit growth into low market growth in value. 
Regarding the trajectory of all BOTOX therapeutic launches, I wish to remind investors that our 20-year experience is that this is always long cycle, even if all the metrics are very positive. As injectors learn the procedure and incorporate BOTOX into regular clinics, clearly, that takes time. 
Since the last earnings call, we are pleased that we have received additional BOTOX therapeutic approvals. BOTOX for chronic migraine was additionally approved in Hungary, Luxembourg, Israel, Singapore, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Venezuela, and now enjoys licenses in a total of 42 countries. 
Regarding BOTOX for neurogenic bladder, approvals came through in Australia, Baojun, Norway, Luxembourg and Spain, with now approvals totaling all together, 31 countries. 
In the U.S., BOTOX therapeutic market share remains very high at 93%, with the remaining 7% being shared fairly equally by Dysport, Myobloc and Xeomin. The U.S. chronic migraine launch continues to progress very well, with particularly encouraging feedback from injecting physicians attending the recent American Academy of Neurology regarding their assessment to patient response to treatment and overall satisfaction. About 5,000 individual physicians of the approximately 10,000 neurologists in the United States have now been trained, and we're beginning to ramp up receptor ships for those customers requesting advanced training. 
50% of practicing neurologist inject at least one patient for chronic migraine in the past month. The last reimbursement gaps are being gradually close. 
Regarding access in commercial managed care plans, 91% of all lives now have policy coverage. Accordingly, the volume of insurance verifications continues to rise and a number denials to prior authorizations are in a steady decline. 
We launched nonbranded DTC campaign for patient awareness of the condition in September of last year and in addition of place BOTOX branded print advertisements in women's magazines since February. 
We're also building a public relations campaign called Rewrite Your Day. We're pleased with a number of hits to our websites and the number of patients visiting the Find Your Doctor webpage. 
In Canada, were also ignored recording good initial sales for chronic migraine, where patients have insurance coverage from private rather than governmental plans. Potentially, 80% of the total opportunity in Canada is from the privates arena. As we only received Health Canada approval in Q4, we do not yet have coverage from provincial plans. 
In the U.S., in the core movement disorders area, which include the upper limb spasticity indication, we also continue to enjoy double-digit growth. 
Regarding the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, were also off to a good start. Just over 1,000 individual physicians have been trained and we're now launching a proctorship program. 
Regarding insurance access, 60% of commercial lines enjoy policy coverage, 82% of Medicare lives and 96% of Medicaid lives. Clearly, age and insurance profiles for spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients were quite different from each other. 
Outcomes of the insurance verification process are very similar to what we experienced in initial months, postlaunch we chronic migraine. Obviously, the next event in our neurology franchise is the expected approval for idiopathic overactive bladder by both FDA and the European authorities in 2013. 
Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales increased 10.2% year-over-year in dollars and 12.0% in local currencies. We did double-digit growth in North America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia. This is commendable performance, considering sales growth is impacted by government-mandated price cuts across a broad range of European countries, extended out to Turkey and Korea. Gulf was driven by a wide range of products: RESTASIS, COMBIGAN, LUMIGAN, OZURDEX and the artificial tears line led by OPTIVE. We've also reached the juncture where the sales reduction from the genericization of ACULAR in the United States and the impact on the combined ACULAR, Abbeville franchise is minor. 
The IMS Global report for the fourth quarter of 2011 shows the global market growing by only 4% and excluding retina, the market declining by 1% due to the genericization of Xalatan and COSOPT around the world. 
In the same period, IMS shows Allergan growing by 8% in line with Alcon. Clearly, Allergan has strongly growing market share in glaucoma and a small base share in retina with OZURDEX. Share in the artificial tears market was stable. 
In the first quarter, we continue to make excellent progress, with both LUMIGAN globally and GANFORT overseas. In the U.S., the percentage of new prescriptions written for LUMIGAN 0.01% as a proportion of all LUMIGAN prescriptions passed the 60% mark. And as the franchise continues to grow despite the genericization of Xalatan. Given the success of LUMIGAN 0.01%, U.S. wholesalers and retailers are reducing their stock of LUMIGAN 0.03%. Of a done also continues to grow in the U.S., despite the availability of generics. RESTASIS remains on a strong growth trajectory in the U.S. and has made a strong impact in its initial launch in Canada. 
OPTIV advanced a triple-action formula that works in all areas of the tear film with launch in the U.S. in the quarter and is enjoying strong pickup. The same product was launched under the brand, OPTIVE Plus in Germany, Italy and Belgium. In France, OPTIVE has been approved and launched as a reverse product. We are pleased with our strong and growing presence overall in emerging markets. 
In Latin America, we're the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company and the largest ophthalmic company Brazil. 
Since the beginning of the year, we've had a lot of activity. LUMIGAN 0.01% was launched in Mexico, Ostertag in Mexico and Argentina and Abbeville under local brands in Brazil. In Russia, of the be and GANFORT was successfully introduced in January. 
In China, we are growing very strongly on a small base, driven by our glaucoma and tears products. In India, our market growing by about 415%. We're growing even faster as a strong number one market leader. 
Our skin care franchise grew by a very strong 28.8%, both in dollars and in local currencies. ACZONE is on a strong upswing with ex-factory sales increasing 66% and is about to become the number one product in the anti-inflammatory acne category, surpassing to act. 
TAZORAC, also had a strong quarter on an ex-factory basis and grew in market of 6.7% on acquisition dollar basis, as reported by IMS BOM8. But sales declined 8.9% in dollars by 8.8% in local currencies. This follows the very strong Q4 sales due to the sell in of a special offer to physicians. 
In market, we are pleased that we reached a new record level of prescriptions and the consumers have responded well to the repositioning of the product as part of the women's antiaging portfolio of products. 
In Canada, a national TV campaign has driven a record number of consumers to our physician locator. In Latin America, we had good growth in Brazil and Mexico and launch LATISSE in Chile. Data center out neurology franchise declined 6%, 6.0%, as we move to our promotional emphasis to the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic overactive bladder. 
The obesity intervention line declined 15.5% in dollars and 15.0% in local currencies. In the U.S., we're somewhat encouraged with the rate of decline of the bariatric market is attenuating. In fact, we believe at the beginning of this year even grew slightly. 
The overall market declined 6% in 2011 and only grew, as I stated, 3% to 4% year-to-date, February. With the share of banding ranging around 41% since August 21, with gains in fleet tractomy coming at the expense of bypass procedures. 
Within the band category, LAP-BAND enjoyed 90% share in February. Now a substantial part of our efforts are directed to improving access to reimbursement that we had expected in 2013. 
I will now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance."
249205,183847568,294981,"Allergan Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, May 02, 2012",2012-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. This quarter of 2012 represented a good start for the year for Allergan, despite gives me discuss pressures relating to U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing. Allergan diversified base busin",847,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. This quarter of 2012 represented a good start for the year for Allergan, despite gives me discuss pressures relating to U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing. Allergan diversified base business, as well as its consistent and thoughtful approach of reinvesting in our business, enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS results at the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were already $0.86, marking an 11.7% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. 
As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share in Q1 2011 includes the beneficial impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit of approximately $0.01 per share, which should not recur in Q1 2012. 
Excluding this benefit from the prior-year results in adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in Q1 2012 of 13.2%. Reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q1 2012 gross margin of 85.7% increased 30 basis points when compared to Q1 2011. 
This year-over-year improvement in gross margin is driven by a number of variables, but primarily attributable to favorable product mix. With respect to the favorability in product mix, the drivers were primarily related to a slightly higher proportion of Pharma products versus medical device products that slightly higher proportion of higher Arjun pharmaceutical products. As sales volume increase over the remainder of the year, you should expect the cost per files for our manufacturing process to continue to improve and some improvement in gross profit margin. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the first quarter was 42.1% to totaling $575 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 42.6% and $534 million, respectively. 
We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010 and '11. As is historically the case, Allergan's SG&A expense to product mix sales ratio test to be higher in the first half of the year and moderates during the back half of the year. 
Our expectation for 2012 is consistent with this historic thing. Non-GAAP research and development  expenses were 16.5%, a product net sales for the quarter. Totaling to the $225 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the $198 million or 15.8% of product net sales expense in the first quarter of 2011. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan sales, day sales outstanding, was at 57 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 122 days. 
In the first quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $186 million. At the end of the first quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.6 billion and $1 billion. respectively. Our current net cash position, along with our strong access to external capital provides Allergan with the continuing capability to make intelligent productive investments within the selling and marketing and research and development areas of our business. 
Moreover, this liquidity provides the company with superb latitude and flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities. 
With respect to stock repurchase and as previously disclosed, the company is presently executing against the 10b5-1 plan involving some 6 million shares covering the first half of 2012 with a focus of offsetting the dilutive effect of share-based employee compensation plans. 
As we move toward the second half of the year, we are likely to either extend this program or continue with periodic open market purchases. 
For the second quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,450,000,000 to $1,500,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 extends to $1.06. All full year expectations for 2012 remain consistent with previous guidance. 
Allergan estimates full year product net sales between $5,650,000,000 and $5,850,000,000 and full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share remains between $4.13 and $4.19, which represents growth between 13% and 15%. 
To repeat the comment already made by David Pyott, this expectation now includes a full year pretax equivalent impact of approximately $110 million related to U.S. Health Care Reform, which is an increase of approximately $20 million from our previous assumption. 
This increase reflects the inclusion of our payment expectations relating to the doughnut hole and an increase of our prorata share of the pharma tax, as several major pharmaceuticals industry products moves to a generic impairment. As we have previously indicated, our 2012 expectation assumes that U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, with full year retroactive benefit impact the Q4 results. 
For information, expectations for all other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in the current and prior earnings releases and also remain unchanged. So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

And this year, as I pointed out in my remarks, we compounded that with the switch of the size from 0.8 to 1 ml at the same price and we made it very clear. We weren't taking back the smaller size. So the motivation to stock up was less than 0. And clearly, the selling of this promotion, which started in the middle of April has been very strong. So based in everything we can see, you'll see the flip around in Q2 with some very major pillar growth across the world. So we did this all for promotional reasons, As I stated, it was all due to the times to just after what we have assumed would be the launch of Xeomin cosmetic at the ADD."

For the first time for a while, we've actually seen total bariatric procedures moving up just fractionally. We only have data year-to-date, February. The other thing we watch, of course, is what is the overall share of bands as part of all bariatric procedures. And that's been pretty flat for about all the time since from recollection, August of last year. So they're bouncing right around 40% mark. So what I'd call the value segment shares are beginning to flatten, which is a good thing. Secondly, my remarks about 2013 was, clearly, when we get policy changes by insurance plans, even if they were to decide hypothetically today, in practice, they don't actually roll out the new plan coverage until January 1, 2013. And we know this is employees in our own companies as well. Plans tend to change with the calendar year. So all the efforts are going towards improvement of access and also, reducing cost of copays. And they we're using the health economics states that we have published. So we're not asking for a favor from employers or their insurance plans, we're asking them to do a favor to themselves. Looking at SG&A, Jeff made the comment that clearly, always, we start high in the year because we tend to move up our investments into salesforce or new initiatives. If we look at this year, clearly, a big investment was made in the launch of chronic migraine and neurogenic bladder, particularly in the U.S., but you could hear from my remarks in Canada and certain countries in Europe as well. And then, DTC, we continue to invest strongly. Clearly, migraine is an up item, given that there was no history to that particular spending item. And at the very margin, we have some increased legal expenses and the biggest single item was the March litigation. And looking back, of course, not for once was a good investment in lawyers. We got the result we wanted. And this is me speaking as a former lawyer. Forgive my sense of humor."

Well, you can kind of do your own back of the envelope, Mark, because if I'm saying if event that the market grew double-digit and in our survey, we believe that Merz captured through heavy sampling, which, of course, sampling comes out of us in terms of sales being the market leader. We think that they gained 7% to 8% share. Also, I pointed out, given the injunction only occurred on March 9, clearly, the market was full of product. And so we can see this in our numbers. Gradually, Xeomin is disappearing. So what does that all mean? It means we got no benefit in Q1 from the injunction, but we will start seeing the benefit in Q2 and then even greater in Q3 and Q4 and so on. I think when we get down to the question of outlook, our view was you can get into what I'll call microscopic guidance where I can tell the whole analyst community, move up that product by $5 million, move that one done by $3 million, move that one up by $10 million. These numbers are small this early in the year. It's much simpler just to leave everything the way it is. And we'll give you a much better view on this call, which 3 months from now."

So I think great satisfaction on the physician side. As I pointed out, and we've known this for 20 years now, the whole cycle of training people and then gradually getting them not only to inject, and I did make the remark that half of all part seeing neurologists in the past month had inject at least one patient. So very positive again. But how do you turn that the bottom end of the quintiles occasional users into highly frequent users? And we know that it takes time to get physicians to create a clinic where they spend, it's all very individual home morning or a whole afternoon doing nothing but BOTOX injections. On the consumer side, extremely positive. When we look at brand awareness, where away about golden arms of Madison Avenue because clearly, we see metric that as well. Also in other surveys, we've seen in terms of physician awareness within the whole broader market of migraine. We now have the highest awareness of any single product. So also, good leading indicator. And clearly, I made remarks about the number of patients that have gone on our websites and have even have just looked for Find a Doctor in the last couple of months, that's close to 0.25 million patients.

One is, given that we are by far the market leader in breast implants in Europe, we benefited sadly for patients where revision surgery had to be conducted. So i,e, a PIP implants was explanted and a new one was put in. And I think that own explains part of it. I think the second part is that plastic surgeons making their choice had a real move to the quality makers. And of course, one of the biggest stamps of quality in the European market is who is approved in the United States. And clearly, at that moment, it was 2 companies: Mentor and ourselves.

But this was prior to the launch of OPTIVE Advance. So one would assume we will get a benefit looking at history in artificial tears from the value of innovation.

Because, as we all know, I'm stating the obvious, even once you get an approval of chronic migraine, say, in Spain or the U.K., that doesn't mean that the product instantly is available. If we look at the U.K. where there's no delay in actual pricing. But if one looks set all drug launches between NICE and the Scottish meds and consortium, they take many quarters to actually convene and review the data and then say, we're actually paying for this product through the primary health care trusts. So I think the way to think about this, summing that up, is that the U.S. will be the lion share. But clearly, there are some very interesting markets in Europe, Australia and Canada.

In the first quarter of this year, Allergan sales grew versus the first quarter of 2011 by 9.0%, due to the strength of U.S. dollar relative to many world currencies, especially the euro, by a higher",2775,"Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In the first quarter of this year, Allergan sales grew versus the first quarter of 2011 by 9.0%, due to the strength of U.S. dollar relative to many world currencies, especially the euro, by a higher 10.4% in local currencies. 
We enjoyed strong double-digit growth in many operating regions, namely the U.S. and Canadian pharmaceuticals businesses, across the total business in Europe, Africa, Middle East, and also in Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
The U.S. medical device business have declining sales due to the filler business, which is explained by the timing of consumer promotions in 2012 and 2011 and due to market conditions for LAP-BAND.  Regarding operating performance, we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86, marking an increase of 11.7% and at the top end of the range of expectations provided at our last earnings call. 
For reconciliation to GAAP numbers, kindly consult our press release. You will note that we have not changed our outlook for sales or earnings for the full year 2012. A few major swing items for the full year are, however, worthy of comment. 
On March 9, a U.S. District Court judge in California issued a permanent injunction enjoining Merz from selling or providing Xeomin or soliciting purchases of Xeomin in official -- facial aesthetics market until January 9, 2013. The judge also imposed the same restrictions on Xeomin in the therapeutic market, unless customers are not identified on court mandate to the exclusion lists, or customers voluntarily and without solicitation request to purchase the product for therapeutic use, and sworn declarations are submitted so stating. 
Finally, the judge enjoined Merz from providing or selling dermal filler products or soliciting purchases of dermal filler products until Jan. 9, 2013, except to customers who voluntarily and without solicitation request to purchase the product and sworn declarations are submitted so stating, or unless customers had already purchased product between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010. Further exact details of this injunction are to be found in the court order. 
Given Xeomin inventory in channel , which still have to be used, this did not positively affect BOTOX sales in the quarter, but is expected to provide a benefit during the remainder of the year, and additionally, a small benefit to JUVÉDERM sales. 
As an offsetting item, the cost of U.S. healthcare reform is now expected to cost us an incremental $20 million, increasing from $90 million in 2011 to an estimated pre-tax equivalent of $110 million in 2012. This is due to increased cost of the so-called doughnut hole relating to primarily our glaucoma product line and an increase in Allergan's share of the pharmaceutical tax due to our sales growth relative to the rest of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. 
Overseas, government-mandated price cuts remain in the range of our planning assumptions. Regarding SANCTURA XR, a district court found all claims in patents invalid for obviousness. Whilst we were disappointed about the court's ruling, we believe that we have strong arguments on appeal. Based on the foregoing, under our analysis of generic filers, our assumption is that no generic of SANCTURA XR will be commercialized during 2012. 
Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. Given the odd-looking decline in facial aesthetics, which declined 5.0% year-over-year and 3.5% in local currencies, I will start with the consumer-facing cash pay businesses. 
From the facts which I will present, it is clear that we remain very positive about consumer spending in our markets. Dermal fillers declined considerably in the United States, offset by strong double-digit growth internationally. Also recollect, the sales in Q1 2011 grew a spectacular 48% versus the first quarter of 2010 and represented the first time that facial aesthetic sales were sequentially higher than the high point of the fourth quarter. 
In the U.S., the swing is explained by the timing of our so-called Duet Dividends promotion, whereby, we provide incentives to physicians and rebate coupons to their patients to combine orders and treatments of JUVÉDERM with BOTOX. 
In 2011, all orders for this highly successful promotion were in the first quarter. This year, the promotion commenced in the middle of April and last throughout the second quarter. 
In Q2, we've already seen a strong response to this promotion. The 2012 campaign was timed to commence just after the presumed launch of Xeomin cosmetic of the American Academy of Dermatology, which took place in the middle of March. Furthermore, physician office inventory of JUVÉDERM was drawn down as we launch the new syringe size of 1 mL at the same price as the former 0.8 mL syringe, which will no longer be commercialized in the U.S. market. In our commercial policy, we were clear to customers that we would not be taking back 0.8 mL inventory, thereby, encouraging physicians to exhaust old inventory before placing the orders. 
Earning out the channel inventory swings created by ourselves, we estimate that the U.S. market in Q1 grew in the low double digits. Sequentially, market share was flat in Q1 at about 39%, but up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2011. 
Overseas, we also continued to be encouraged by strong market growth, as well as share gains for JUVÉDERM. In Europe, syndicated market data shows fourth quarter year-over-year growth at about 16% across the European Union. 
JUVÉDERM sales in Europe, Australia and Korea, were boosted by physician enthusiasm for VOLUMA with Lidocaine in a 1 mL syringe, which was launched during the quarter. JUVÉDERM was also launched in Thailand, and JUVÉDERM with Lidacaine in Mexico 
In Italy and Spain, extremely strong sales growth in both facial and breast aesthetics point to the resilience of consumer demand for our products. In Canada, we have commenced TV advertising for JUVÉDERM in March. 
Now moving onto breast aesthetics. Sales increased a very strong 17.0% in dollars and 18.4% in local currencies, with particularly strong performance stemming from Europe and Latin America. Based on extensive feedback from the marketplace, it seems that we've benefited as the clear market leader in Europe from a move to high-quality manufacturers for first-time augmentation surgery. 
In addition, Allergan implants have been chosen for revision surgery in the wake of the PIP scandal, which had its greatest impacts in France and the U.K. Lesser effects were seen in most of the European markets, as well as Latin America and Australia. In the U.S., we enjoyed good growth, not only from healthy growth in market procedures, but also due to the continuing improvement of mix to higher price silicon gel products and tissue expanders. 
With the breadth of our product line, both in implants and tissue expanders, but also across our plastic surgery product line, we feel well prepared to face new competition from Sientra in the U.S. 
In Europe, at the Aesthetic Medicine World Congress in Monaco at the end of March, we unveiled a quality first communications campaign covering not only our breast implants, but also a full range of aesthetics products, building on our heritage as clear category leader in each of our market segments. This campaign encompasses not only media relations, but also advertisements in women's magazines. 
Regarding BOTOX, the franchise grew 9.4% in dollars and 10.5% in local currencies, with greater double-digit growth from the therapeutic side of the business, thanks to the recently approved indications of chronic migraine, neurogenic overactive bladder and in the U.S., upper limb spasticity. And more moderate growth on the cosmetic side due to competitive entries. 
Regarding worldwide market share for all users of neuromodulators in Q4 2011, the last period for which we have data available, we estimate the BOTOX enjoy just over 76% share, down about 300 basis points from Q4 of 2010, given the entry of competitors into new geographic markets. This, however, very positive that both the therapeutic and aesthetic neuromodulator markets in Q4 year-over-year continue to grow in the double digits. 
Now back to Q1 sales. On the cosmetic side of the business, we're impacted in the U.S. by Xeomin's 7% to 8% share in the first quarter, this per our consumer survey, after their prelaunch in October 2011. We were, however, pleased that BOTOX Cosmetic volume share in March moved up to 78% from 75% in February, gaining both against Dysport and Xeomin. The driver was the media and promotional launch of our BOTOX 10-year anniversary campaign, which enabled patients to capture a discount across 3 treatments. 
We estimate that the U.S. aesthetic neuromodulator market was growing double-digit in Q1. In Europe, we lost limited market share in Southern European countries, where Galderma with Azzalure and Merz with Bocouture are still in the launch phase, but market growth remains encouraging. Sales across Asia were particularly strong. 
Turning to the therapeutic side of the business, growth was particularly strong in the United States, Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. In Europe, we are impacted by government-mandated price cuts, which have the effect of converting gratifying unit growth into low market growth in value. 
Regarding the trajectory of all BOTOX therapeutic launches, I wish to remind investors that our 20-year experience is that this is always long cycle, even if all the metrics are very positive. As injectors learn the procedure and incorporate BOTOX into regular clinics, clearly, that takes time. 
Since the last earnings call, we are pleased that we have received additional BOTOX therapeutic approvals. BOTOX for chronic migraine was additionally approved in Hungary, Luxembourg, Israel, Singapore, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Venezuela, and now enjoys licenses in a total of 42 countries. 
Regarding BOTOX for neurogenic bladder, approvals came through in Australia, Belgium, Norway, Luxembourg and Spain, with now approvals totaling, altogether, 31 countries. In the U.S., BOTOX therapeutic market share remains very high at 93%, with the remaining 7% being shared fairly equally by Dysport, Myobloc and Xeomin. 
The U.S. chronic migraine launch continues to progress very well, with particularly encouraging feedback from injecting physicians attending the recent American Academy of Neurology regarding their assessment of patient response to treatment and overall satisfaction. About 5,000 individual physicians of the approximately 10,000 neurologists in the United States have now been trained and were beginning to ramp up preceptorships for those customers requesting advanced training. 
50% of practicing neurologists inject at least one patient for chronic migraine in the past month. The last reimbursement gaps are being gradually closed.  Regarding access in commercial-managed care plans, 91% of all lives now have policy coverage. Accordingly, the volume of insurance verifications continues to rise, and the number denials to prior authorizations are in a steady decline. 
We launched non-branded DTC campaign for patient awareness of their condition in September of last year and in addition, have placed BOTOX-branded print advertisements in women's magazines since February. 
We're also fielding a public relations campaign called Rewrite Your Day. We're pleased with the number of hits to our websites and the number of patients visiting the Find a Doctor webpage. 
In Canada, we're also recording good initial sales for chronic migraine, where patients have insurance coverage from private rather than government plans. Potentially, 80% of the total opportunity in Canada is from the private arena. As we only received Health Canada approval in Q4, we do not yet have coverage from provincial plans. 
In the U.S., in the core movement disorders area, which include the upper limb spasticity indication, we also continue to enjoy double-digit growth. Regarding the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we're also off to a good start. Just over 1,000 individual physicians have been trained, and we're now launching a proctorship program. Regarding insurance access, 60% of commercial lives enjoy policy coverage, 82% of Medicare lives and 96% of Medicaid lives. Clearly, age and insurance profiles for spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients are quite different from each other. 
Outcomes of the insurance verification process are very similar to what we experienced in initial months post-launch with chronic migraine. Obviously, the next key event in our urology franchise is the expected approvals for idiopathic overactive bladder by both FDA and the European authorities in 2013. 
Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales increased 10.2% year-over-year in dollars and 12.0% in local currencies. We did double-digit growth in North America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia. This is commendable performance considering sales growth is impacted by government-mandated price cuts across a broad range of European countries, extended out to Turkey and Korea. 
Growth was driven by a wide range of products: RESTASIS, COMBIGAN, LUMIGAN, OZURDEX and the artificial tears line led by OPTIVE. We have also reached the juncture where the sales reduction from the genericization of ACULAR in the United States and the impact on the combined ACULAR, ACUVAIL franchise is minor. 
The IMS Global report for the fourth quarter of 2011 shows the global market growing by only 4%. And excluding retina, the market declining by 1% due to the genericization of Xalatan and Cosopt around the world. 
In the same period, IMS shows Allergan growing by 8% in line with Alcon. Clearly, Allergan is strongly growing market share in glaucoma and in a small base, share in retina with OZURDEX. Share in the artificial tears market was stable. 
In the first quarter, we continue to make excellent progress, with both LUMIGAN globally and GANFORT overseas. In the U.S., the percentage of new prescriptions written for LUMIGAN 0.01% as a proportion of all LUMIGAN prescriptions passed the 60% mark and as their franchise continues to grow despite the genericization of Xalatan. Given the success of LUMIGAN 0.01%, U.S. wholesalers and retailers are reducing their stock of LUMIGAN 0.03%. 
ALPHAGAN also continues to grow in the U.S. despite the availability of generics. RESTASIS remains on a strong growth trajectory in the U.S. and has made a strong impact in its initial launch in Canada. 
OPTIVE advanced a triple-action formula that works on all layers of the tear film, was launched in the U.S. in the quarter and is enjoying strong pick up. The same product was launched under the brand, OPTIVE Plus in Germany, Italy and Belgium. In France, OPTIVE has been approved and launched as a reimbursed product. We are pleased with our strong and growing presence overall in emerging markets. In Latin America, we're the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company, one of the largest ophthalmic company Brazil. 
Since the beginning of the year, we've had a lot of activity. LUMIGAN 0.01% was launched in Mexico, OZURDEX in Mexico and Argentina and ZYMAXID and ACUVAIL under local brands in Brazil. In Russia, ALPHAGAN P and GANFORT were successfully introduced in January. 
In China, we're growing very strongly on a small base, driven by our glaucoma and tears products. In India, our market growing by about 15%, we're growing even faster as a strong #1 market leader. 
Our skin care franchise grew by a very strong 28.8%, both in dollars and in local currencies. ACZONE is on a strong upswing with ex-factory sales increasing 66% and is about to become the #1 product in the anti-inflammatory acne category, surpassing Duac. 
TAZORAC, also had a strong quarter on an ex-factory basis and grew in market of 6.7% on an acquisition dollar basis, as reported by IMS VONA. LATISSE sales declined 8.9% in dollars, by 8.8% in local currencies. This follows the very strong Q4 sales due to the sell-in of a special offer to physicians. 
In market, we're pleased that we reached a new record level of prescriptions and the consumers have responded well to the repositioning of the product as part of the women's antiaging portfolio of products. 
In Canada, a national TV campaign has driven a record number of consumers to our physician locator. In Latin America, we had good growth in Brazil and Mexico and launched LATISSE in Chile. The SANCTURA urology franchise declined 6%, 6.0%, as we move to our promotional emphasis to the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic overactive bladder. 
The obesity intervention line declined 15.5% in dollars and 15.0% in local currencies. In the U.S., we're somewhat encouraged with the rate of decline of the bariatric market is attenuating. In fact, we believe, at the beginning of this year, even grew slightly. 
The overall market declined 6% in 2011 and only grew, as I stated, 3% to 4% year-to-date, February. With the share of banding ranging around 41% since August 21, 2011 with gains in sleeve gastrectomy coming at the expense of bypass procedures.  Within the band category, LAP-BAND enjoyed 90% share in February. Now a substantial part of our efforts are directed to improving access to reimbursement with results expected in 2013. 
I will now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance."

This quarter of 2012 represented a good start for the year for Allergan, despite previously-discussed pressures relating to U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing. Allergan's diversified base",841,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. This quarter of 2012 represented a good start for the year for Allergan, despite previously-discussed pressures relating to U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing. Allergan's diversified base business, as well as its consistent and thoughtful approach of reinvesting in our business, enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS results at the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.86, marking an 11.7% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share in Q1 2011 includes the beneficial impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit of approximately $0.01 per share, which should not recur in Q1 2012. Excluding this benefit from the prior-year results in adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in Q1 2012 of 13.2%. Reconciliation of all of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q1 2012 gross margin of 85.7% increased 30 basis points when compared to Q1 2011. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin is driven by a number of variables, but primarily attributable to favorable product mix. With respect to the favorability in product mix, the drivers were primarily related to a slightly higher proportion of pharma products versus medical device products and a slightly higher proportion of higher-margin pharmaceutical products.  As sales volumes increased over the remainder of the year, you should expect the cost profiles of our manufacturing process to continue to improve and some improvement in gross profit margin. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the first quarter was 42.1% totaling $575 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 42.6% and $534 million, respectively. We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010 and '11. As is historically the case, Allergan's SG&A expense to product mix sales ratio tends to be higher in the first half of the year and moderates during the back half of the year. Our expectation for 2012 is consistent with this historic thing. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.5% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $225 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the $198 million or 15.8% of product net sales expense in the first quarter of 2011. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan sales, day sales outstanding, was at 57 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 122 days. 
In the first quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $186 million. At the end of the first quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.6 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Our current net cash position, along with our strong access to external capital, provides Allergan with the continuing capability to make intelligent productive investments within the selling and marketing and research and development areas of our business. Moreover, this liquidity provides the company with superb latitude and flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities. 
With respect to stock repurchase, and as previously disclosed, the company is presently executing against the 10b5-1 plan involving some 6 million shares covering the first half of 2012 with a focus of offsetting the dilutive effect of share-based employee compensation plans. As we move towards the second half of the year, we are likely to either extend this program or continue with periodic open market purchases. 
For the second quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,450,000,000 to $1,500,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.06. All full year expectations for 2012 remain consistent with previous guidance. 
Allergan estimates full year product net sales between $5,650,000,000 and $5,850,000,000 and full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share remains between $4.13 and $4.19, which represents growth between 13% and 15%. 
To repeat a comment already made by David Pyott, this expectation now includes a full year pretax equivalent impact of approximately $110 million related to U.S. health care reform, which is an increase of approximately $20 million from our previous assumption. This increase reflects the inclusion of our payment expectations relating to the doughnut hole and an increase of our pro rata share of the pharma tax, as several major pharmaceutical industry products move to a generic impairment. 
As we have previously communicated, our 2012 expectations assume that U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. 
For information, expectations for all other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in the current and prior earnings releases and also remain unchanged. 
So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

And this year, as I pointed out in my remarks, we compounded that with the switch of the size from 0.8 to 1 mL at the same price. And we made it very clear, we weren't taking back the smaller size. So the motivation to stock up was less than 0. And clearly, the sell-in of this promotion, which started in the middle of April has been very strong. So based on everything we can see, you'll see the flip around in Q2 with some very major filler growth across the world. So we did this all for promotional reasons, as I stated, it was all due to be timed to just after what we have assumed would be the launch of Xeomin cosmetic at the ADD."

For the first time for a while, we've actually seen total bariatric procedures moving up just fractionally. We only have data year-to-date, February. The other thing we watch, of course, is what is the overall share of bands as part of all bariatric procedures. And that's been pretty flat for about all the time since -- from recollection, August of last year. So they're bouncing right around that 40% mark. So what I'd call the various segment shares are beginning to flatten, which is a good thing. Secondly, my remarks about 2013 was, clearly, when we get policy changes by insurance plans, even if they were to decide hypothetically today, in practice, they don't actually roll out the new plan coverage until January 1, 2013. And we know this as employees in our own companies as well. Plans tend to change with the calendar year. So all the efforts are going towards improvement of access and also reducing cost of co-pays. And there, we're using the health economics data that we have published. So we're not asking for a favor from employers or their insurance plans, we're asking them to do a favor to themselves. Looking at SG&A, Jeff made the comment that, clearly, always, we start high in the year because we tend to move up our investments into sales force or new initiatives. If we look at this year, clearly, a big investment was made in the launch of chronic migraine and neurogenic bladder, particularly in the U.S., but you could hear from my remarks, in Canada and certain countries in Europe as well. And then, DTC, we continue to invest strongly. Clearly, migraine is an up item, given that there was no history to that particular spending item. And the very margin, we have some increased legal expenses, and the biggest single item was the Merz litigation. And looking back, of course, that for once was a good investment in lawyers. We got the result we wanted. And this is me speaking as a former lawyer. Forgive my sense of humor."

They -- many doctors, not all of them, of course, have the perception that LUMIGAN is the most potent of the prostaglandin or prostaglandin analogs. And fortunately, with the new product, without the undesirable hyperemia that was associated with probably roughly 10% of the patients with the original 0.03%.

Also, I pointed out, given the injunction only occurred on March 9, clearly, the market was full of product. And so we can see this in our numbers. Gradually, Xeomin is disappearing. So what does that all mean? It means we got no benefit in Q1 from the injunction, but we will start seeing the benefit in Q2 and then even greater in Q3 and Q4 and so on. I think when we get down to the question of outlook, our view was you can get into what I'd call microscopic guidance where I can tell the whole analyst community, move up that product by 5 million, move that one down by 3 million, move that one up by 10 million.

But when you paste together all my remarks, all of this is being created by ourselves. And it shows the power of the brand and the power of the promotions."

When we look around the world, the share gains by Xeomin, really Germany is the only place where they were somewhat successful, and that's their home territory. And as many people know, if one goes back in the eons of time, Merz was the distributor of BOTOX in its day, well over 10 years ago. So they have prior knowledge and customer contact. So obviously, we modeled those things out. And as I've also pointed out, we're not the only competitor. There's Dysport as well. And usually, what happens is that we tend to ride above the fray, and Dysport and Xeomin tend to compete with one another on price. And that's the way most markets operate. You have the category creator, the later that tends to be at some premium, and then the other is fight for share to prove their place in the world."

When you ask physicians what they think the success ratios are for treatment, it's across-the-board. But it's sort of 65% to 80%, very, very high for any drug therapy that any of us have ever heard. So I think great satisfaction on the physician side. As I pointed out, and we've known this for 20 years now, the whole cycle of training people and then gradually getting them not only to inject, and I did make the remark that half of all practicing neurologists in the past month had inject at least one patient. So very positive again. But how do you turn at the bottom end of the quintiles occasional users into highly frequent users? And we know that it takes time to get physicians to create a clinic where they spend, it's all very individual -- a whole morning or a whole afternoon doing nothing but BOTOX injections. On the consumer side, extremely positive. When we look at brand awareness, we're way above all the norms of Madison Avenue because clearly, we metric that as well. Also in other surveys we've seen in terms of physician awareness within the whole broader market of migraine, we now have the highest awareness of any single product. So also, a good leading indicator. And clearly, I made remarks about the number of patients that have gone on our websites and have even just looked for Find a Doctor, in the last couple of months, that's close to 0.25 million patients. So what is going into the funnel is very, very positive, and we're beginning to understand better and better over time what does  it take in terms of being on the website then looking for Find a Doctor, all the way through to being injected, and that's called experience, right, where we metric it over time. And then you get better and better at your predicted model."

When one comes literally this almost 10. Clearly, I know from last year, from our research, meaning, the full year 2011, that in procedures that the European market did grow, modestly, but it did grow. So going to Q1, we had very strong sales. I think there for 2 reasons. One is, given that we are by far the market leader in breast implants in Europe, we benefited sadly for patients where revision surgery had to be conducted. So i.e., a PIP implants was explanted and a new one was put in. But I think that only explains part of it. I think the second part is that plastic surgeons making their choice had a real move to the quality makers. And, of course, one of the biggest stamps of quality in the European market is who is approved in the United States. And clearly, at that moment, it was 2 companies: Mentor and ourselves.

But if one looks at all drug launches between NICE and the Scottish Medicines Consortium, they take many quarters to actually convene and review the data and then say, ""Are we actually paying for this product through the primary health care trusts?""

Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In the first quarter of this year, Allergan sales grew versus the first quarter of 2011 by 9.0%, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to many world currencies, especially the euro, by a higher 10.4% in local currencies. 
We enjoyed strong double-digit growth in many operating regions, namely the U.S. and Canadian pharmaceuticals businesses, across the total business in Europe, Africa, Middle East, and also in Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
The U.S. medical device business have declining sales due to the filler business, which is explained by the timing of consumer promotions in 2012 and 2011 and due to market conditions for LAP-BAND.  Regarding operating performance, we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86, marking an increase of 11.7% and at the top end of the range of expectations provided at our last earnings call. 
For reconciliation to GAAP numbers, kindly consult our press release. You will note that we have not changed our outlook for sales or earnings for the full year 2012. A few major swing items for the full year are, however, worthy of comment. 
On March 9, a U.S. District Court judge in California issued a permanent injunction enjoining Merz from selling or providing Xeomin or soliciting purchases of Xeomin in official -- facial aesthetics market until January 9, 2013. The judge also imposed the same restrictions on Xeomin in the therapeutic market, unless customers are not identified on court mandate to the exclusion lists, or customers voluntarily and without solicitation request to purchase the product for therapeutic use, and sworn declarations are submitted so stating. 
Finally, the judge enjoined Merz from providing or selling dermal filler products or soliciting purchases of dermal filler products until Jan. 9, 2013, except to customers who voluntarily and without solicitation request to purchase the product and sworn declarations are submitted so stating, or unless customers had already purchased product between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010. Further exact details of this injunction are to be found in the court order. 
Given Xeomin inventory in channel , which still have to be used, this did not positively affect BOTOX sales in the quarter, but is expected to provide a benefit during the remainder of the year, and additionally, a small benefit to JUVÉDERM sales. 
As an offsetting item, the cost of U.S. healthcare reform is now expected to cost us an incremental $20 million, increasing from $90 million in 2011 to an estimated pre-tax equivalent of $110 million in 2012. This is due to increased cost of the so-called doughnut hole relating to primarily our glaucoma product line and an increase in Allergan's share of the pharmaceutical tax due to our sales growth relative to the rest of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. 
Overseas, government-mandated price cuts remain in the range of our planning assumptions. Regarding SANCTURA XR, a district court found all claims and patents invalid for obviousness. Whilst we were disappointed about the court's ruling, we believe that we have strong arguments on appeal. Based on the foregoing, under our analysis of generic filers, our assumption is that no generic of SANCTURA XR will be commercialized during 2012. 
Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. Given the odd-looking decline in facial aesthetics, which declined 5.0% year-over-year and 3.5% in local currencies, I will start with the consumer-facing cash pay businesses. 
From the facts which I will present, it is clear that we remain very positive about consumer spending in our markets. Dermal fillers declined considerably in the United States, offset by strong double-digit growth internationally. Also recollect, the sales in Q1 2011 grew a spectacular 48% versus the first quarter of 2010 and represented the first time that facial aesthetic sales were sequentially higher than the high point of a fourth quarter. 
In the U.S., the swing is explained by the timing of our so-called Duet Dividends promotion, whereby we provide incentives to physicians and rebate coupons to their patients to combine orders and treatments of JUVÉDERM with BOTOX. 
In 2011, all orders for this highly successful promotion were in the first quarter. This year, the promotion commenced in the middle of April and lasts throughout the second quarter. 
In Q2, we've already seen a strong response to this promotion. The 2012 campaign was timed to commence just after the presumed launch of Xeomin cosmetic of the American Academy of Dermatology, which took place in the middle of March. Furthermore, physician office inventory of JUVÉDERM was drawn down as we launched the new syringe size of 1 mL at the same price as the former 0.8 mL syringe, which will no longer be commercialized in the U.S. market. In our commercial policy, we were clear to customers that we would not be taking back 0.8 mL inventory, thereby, encouraging physicians to exhaust old inventory before placing the orders. 
Earning out the channel inventory swings created by ourselves, we estimate that the U.S. market in Q1 grew in the low double digits. Sequentially, market share was flat in Q1 at about 39%, but up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2011. 
Overseas, we also continued to be encouraged by strong market growth, as well as share gains for JUVÉDERM. In Europe, syndicated market data shows fourth quarter year-over-year growth at about 16% across the European Union. 
JUVÉDERM sales in Europe, Australia and Korea, were boosted by physician enthusiasm for VOLUMA with Lidocaine in a 1 mL syringe, which was launched during the quarter. JUVÉDERM was also launched in Thailand, and JUVÉDERM with Lidacaine in Mexico 
In Italy and Spain, extremely strong sales growth in both facial and breast aesthetics point to the resilience of consumer demand for our products. In Canada, we have commenced TV advertising for JUVÉDERM in March. 
Now moving onto breast aesthetics. Sales increased a very strong 17.0% in dollars and 18.4% in local currencies, with particularly-strong performance stemming from Europe and Latin America. Based on extensive feedback from the marketplace, it seems that we've benefited as the clear market leader in Europe from a move to high-quality manufacturers for first-time augmentation surgery. 
In addition, Allergan implants have been chosen for revision surgery in the wake of the PIP scandal, which had its greatest impact in France and the U.K. Lesser effects were seen in most of the European markets, as well as Latin America and Australia. In the U.S., we enjoyed good growth, not only from healthy growth in market procedures, but also due to the continuing improvement of mix to higher price silicon gel products and tissue expanders. 
With the breadth of our product line, both in implants and tissue expanders, but also across our plastic surgery product line, we feel well prepared to face new competition from Sientra in the U.S. 
In Europe, at the Aesthetic Medicine World Congress in Monaco at the end of March, we unveiled a quality first communications campaign covering not only our breast implants, but also a full range of aesthetics products, building on our heritage as clear category leader in each of our market segments. This campaign encompasses not only media relations, but also advertisements in women's magazines. 
Regarding BOTOX, the franchise grew 9.4% in dollars and 10.5% to local currencies, with greater double-digit growth from the therapeutic side of the business, thanks to the recently-approved indications of chronic migraine, neurogenic overactive bladder and in the U.S., upper limb spasticity. And more moderate growth on the cosmetic side due to competitive entries. 
Regarding worldwide market share for all uses of neuromodulators in Q4 2011, the last period for which we have data available, we estimate that BOTOX enjoyed just over 76% share, down about 300 basis points from Q4 of 2010, given the entry of competitors into new geographic markets. This, however, very positive that both the therapeutic and aesthetic neuromodulator markets in Q4 year-over-year continue to grow in the double digits. 
Now back to Q1 sales. On the cosmetic side of the business, we're impacted in the U.S. by Xeomin's 7% to 8% share in the first quarter -- this is per our consumer survey -- after their prelaunch in October 2011. We were, however, pleased that BOTOX Cosmetic volume share in March moved up to 78% from 75% in February, gaining both against Dysport and Xeomin. The driver was the media and promotional launch of our BOTOX 10-year anniversary campaign, which enabled patients to capture a discount across 3 treatments. 
We estimate that the U.S. aesthetic neuromodulator market was growing double-digit in Q1. In Europe, we lost limited market share in Southern European countries, where Galderma with Azzalure and Merz with Bocouture are still in their launch phase, but market growth remains encouraging. Sales across Asia were particularly strong. 
Turning to the therapeutic side of the business, growth was particularly strong in the United States, Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. In Europe, we are impacted by government-mandated price cuts, which have the effect of converting gratifying unit growth into low market growth in value. 
Regarding the trajectory of all BOTOX therapeutic launches, I wish to remind investors that our 20-year experience is that this is always long cycle, even if all the metrics are very positive. As injectors learn the procedure and incorporate BOTOX into regular clinics, clearly that takes time. 
Since the last earnings call, we are pleased that we have received additional BOTOX therapeutic approvals. BOTOX for chronic migraine was additionally approved in Hungary, Luxembourg, Israel, Singapore, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Venezuela, and now enjoys licenses in a total of 42 countries. 
Regarding BOTOX for neurogenic bladder, approvals came through in Australia, Belgium, Norway, Luxembourg and Spain, with now approvals totaling, altogether, 31 countries. In the U.S., BOTOX therapeutic market share remains very high at 93%, with the remaining 7% being shared fairly equally by Dysport, Myobloc and Xeomin. 
The U.S. chronic migraine launch continues to progress very well, with particularly-encouraging feedback from injecting physicians attending the recent American Academy of Neurology regarding their assessment of patient response to treatment and overall satisfaction. About 5,000 individual physicians of the approximately 10,000 neurologists in the United States have now been trained and we're beginning to ramp up preceptorships for those customers requesting advanced training. 
50% of practicing neurologists injected at least one patient for chronic migraine in the past month. The last reimbursement gaps are being gradually closed.  Regarding access in commercial-managed care plans, 91% of all lives now have policy coverage. Accordingly, the volume of insurance verifications continues to rise, and the number of denials to prior authorizations are in a steady decline. 
We launched non-branded DTC campaign for patient awareness of their condition in September of last year and in addition, have placed BOTOX-branded print advertisements in women's magazines since February. 
We're also fielding a public relations campaign called Rewrite Your Day. We're pleased with the number of hits to our websites and the number of patients visiting the Find a Doctor webpage. 
In Canada, we're also recording good initial sales for chronic migraine, where patients have insurance coverage from private rather than government plans. Potentially, 80% of the total opportunity in Canada is from the private arena. As we only received Health Canada approval in Q4, we do not yet have coverage from provincial plans. 
In the U.S., in the core movement disorders area, which include the upper limb spasticity indication, we also continue to enjoy double-digit growth. Regarding the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we're also off to a good start. Just over 1,000 individual physicians have been trained, and we're now launching a proctorship program. Regarding insurance access, 60% of commercial lives enjoy policy coverage, 82% of Medicare lives and 96% of Medicaid lives. Clearly, age and insurance profiles for spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients are quite different from each other. 
Outcomes of the insurance verification process are very similar to what we experienced in the initial months post-launch with chronic migraine. Obviously, the next key event in our urology franchise is the expected approvals for idiopathic overactive bladder by both FDA and the European authorities in 2013. 
Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales increased 10.2% year-over-year in dollars and 12.0% in local currencies. We did double-digit growth in North America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia. This is commendable performance considering sales growth is impacted by government-mandated price cuts across a broad range of European countries, extended out to Turkey and Korea. 
Growth was driven by a wide range of products: RESTASIS, COMBIGAN, LUMIGAN, OZURDEX and the artificial tears line led by OPTIVE. We have also reached the juncture where the sales reduction from the genericization of ACULAR in the United States and the impact on the combined ACULAR, ACUVAIL franchise is minor. 
The IMS Global report for the fourth quarter of 2011 shows the global market growing by only 4%. And excluding retina, the market declining by 1% due to the genericization of Xalatan and Cosopt around the world. 
In the same period, IMS shows Allergan growing by 8% in line with Alcon. Clearly, Allergan is strongly growing market share in glaucoma and in a small base, share in retina with OZURDEX. Share in the artificial tears market was stable. 
In the first quarter, we continued to make excellent progress, with both LUMIGAN globally and GANFORT overseas. In the U.S., the percentage of new prescriptions written for LUMIGAN 0.01% as a proportion of all LUMIGAN prescriptions passed the 60% mark and as their franchise continues to grow despite the genericization of Xalatan. Given the success of LUMIGAN 0.01%, U.S. wholesalers and retailers are reducing their stock of LUMIGAN 0.03%. 
ALPHAGAN also continues to grow in the U.S. despite the availability of generics. RESTASIS remains on a strong growth trajectory in the U.S. and has made a strong impact in its initial launch in Canada. 
OPTIVE advanced a triple-action formula that works on all layers of the tear film, was launched in the U.S. in the quarter and is enjoying strong pick up. The same product was launched under the brand, OPTIVE Plus in Germany, Italy and Belgium. In France, OPTIVE has been approved and launched as a reimbursed product. We are pleased with our strong and growing presence overall in emerging markets. In Latin America, we're the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company, and are the largest ophthalmic company in Brazil. 
Since the beginning of the year, we've had a lot of activity. LUMIGAN 0.01% was launched in Mexico, OZURDEX in Mexico and Argentina, and ZYMAXID and ACUVAIL under local brands in Brazil. In Russia, ALPHAGAN P and GANFORT were successfully introduced in January. 
In China, we're growing very strongly on a small base, driven by our glaucoma and tears products. In India, our market growing by about 15%, we're growing even faster as a strong #1 market leader. 
Our skin care franchise grew by a very strong 28.8%, both in dollars and in local currencies. ACZONE is on a strong upswing with ex-factory sales increasing 66% and is about to become the #1 product in the anti-inflammatory acne category, surpassing Duac. 
TAZORAC also had a strong quarter on an ex-factory basis and grew in market of 6.7% on an acquisition dollar basis, as reported by IMS VONA. LATISSE sales declined 8.9% in dollars, by 8.8% to local currencies. This follows the very strong Q4 sales due to the sell-in of a special offer to physicians. 
In market, we're pleased that we reached a new record level of prescriptions and that consumers have responded well to the repositioning of the product as part of the women's antiaging portfolio of products. 
In Canada, a national TV campaign has driven a record number of consumers to our physician locator. In Latin America, we had good growth in Brazil and Mexico and launched LATISSE in Chile. The SANCTURA urology franchise declined 6%, 6.0%, as we moved to our promotional emphasis to the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic overactive bladder. 
The obesity intervention line declined 15.5% in dollars and 15.0% to local currencies. In the U.S., we're somewhat encouraged that the rate of decline of the bariatric market is attenuating. In fact, we believe, at the beginning of this year,it even grew slightly. 
The overall market declined 6% in 2011 and only grew, as I stated, 3% to 4% year-to-date, February. With the share of banding ranging around 41% since August 21, 2011 with gains in sleeve gastrectomy coming at the expense of bypass procedures.  Within the band category, LAP-BAND enjoyed 90% share in February. Now a substantial part of our efforts are directed to improving access to reimbursement with results expected in 2013. 
I will now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance."

Allergan's diversified",841,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. The first quarter of 2012 represented a good start to the year for Allergan, despite previously-discussed pressures relating to U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing. Allergan's diversified base of business, as well as its consistent and thoughtful approach of reinvesting in our business, enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS results at the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.86, marking an 11.7% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share in Q1 2011 includes the beneficial impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit of approximately $0.01 per share, which should not recur in Q1 2012. Excluding this benefit from the prior-year results in adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in Q1 2012 of 13.2%. Reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q1 2012 gross margin of 85.7% increased 30 basis points when compared to Q1 2011. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin is driven by a number of variables, but primarily attributable to favorable product mix. With respect to the favorability in product mix, the drivers were primarily related to a slightly higher proportion of pharma products versus medical device products and a slightly higher proportion of higher-margin pharmaceutical products.  As sales volumes increase over the remainder of the year, you should expect the cost profiles of our manufacturing process to continue to improve and some improvement in gross profit margin. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the first quarter was 42.1% totaling $575 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 42.6% and $534 million, respectively. We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010 and '11. As is historically the case, Allergan's SG&A expense to product mix sales ratio tends to be higher in the first half of the year and moderates during the back half of the year. Our expectation for 2012 is consistent with this historic theme. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.5% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $225 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the $198 million or 15.8% of product net sales spent in the first quarter of 2011. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan sales, day sales outstanding, was at 57 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 122 days. 
In the first quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $186 million. At the end of the first quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.6 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Our current net cash position, along with our strong access to external capital, provides Allergan with the continuing capability to make intelligent productive investments within the selling and marketing and research and development areas of our business. Moreover, this liquidity provides the company with superb latitude and flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities. 
With respect to stock repurchase, and as previously disclosed, the company is presently executing against the 10b5-1 plan involving some 6 million shares covering the first half of 2012 with a focus of offsetting the dilutive effect of share-based employee compensation plans. As we move towards the second half of the year, we are likely to either extend this program or continue with periodic open market purchases. 
For the second quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,450,000,000 to $1,500,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.06. All full year expectations for 2012 remain consistent with previous guidance. 
Allergan estimates full year product net sales between $5,650,000,000 and $5,850,000,000 and full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share remains between $4.13 and $4.19, which represents growth between 13% and 15%. 
To repeat a comment already made by David Pyott, this expectation now includes a full year pretax equivalent impact of approximately $110 million related to U.S. health care reform, which is an increase of approximately $20 million from our previous assumption. This increase reflects the inclusion of our payment expectations relating to the doughnut hole and an increase of our pro rata share of the pharma tax, as several major pharmaceutical industry products move to a generic environment. 
As we have previously communicated, our 2012 expectations assume that U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. 
For information, expectations for all other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in the current and prior earnings releases and also remain unchanged. 
So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

So the motivation to stock up was less than 0. And clearly, the sell-in of this promotion, which started in the middle of April has been very strong. So based on everything we can see, you'll see the flip around in Q2 with some very major filler growth across the world.

The other thing we watch, of course, is what is the overall share of bands as part of all bariatric procedures. And that's been pretty flat for about all the time since -- from recollection, August of last year. So they're bouncing right around that 40% mark. So what I'd call the various segment shares are beginning to flatten, which is a good thing. Secondly, my remarks about 2013 was, clearly, when we get policy changes by insurance plans, even if they were to decide hypothetically today, in practice, they don't actually roll out the new plan coverage until January 1, 2013. And we know this as employees in our own companies as well. Plans tend to change with the calendar year. So all the efforts are going towards improvement of access and also reducing cost of co-pays. And there, we're using the health economics data that we have published. So we're not asking for a favor from employers or their insurance plans, we're asking them to do a favor to themselves. Looking at SG&A, Jeff made the comment that, clearly, always, we start high in the year because we tend to move up our investments into sales force or new initiatives. If we look at this year, clearly, a big investment was made in the launch of chronic migraine and neurogenic bladder, particularly in the U.S., but you could hear from my remarks, in Canada and certain countries in Europe as well. And then, DTC, we continue to invest strongly. Clearly, migraine is an up item, given that there was no history to that particular spending item. And at the very margin, we had some increased legal expenses, and the biggest single item was the Merz litigation. And looking back, of course, that for once was a good investment in lawyers. We got the result we wanted. And this is me speaking as a former lawyer. Forgive my sense of humor."

The -- many doctors, not all of them, of course, have the perception that LUMIGAN is the most potent of the prostaglandin or prostaglandin analogs.

I was just wondering, David, if you could help us contextualize a little bit when you describe the launch runway and maybe talk about the confluence of physicians trained and when they get comfortable versus that kind of patient awareness in your DTC.

When you ask physicians what they think the success ratios are for treatment, it's across-the-board. But it's sort of 65% to 80%, very, very high for any drug therapy that any of us have ever heard. So I think great satisfaction on the physician side. As I pointed out, and we've known this for 20 years now, the whole cycle of training people and then gradually getting them not only to inject, and I did make the remark that half of all practicing neurologists in the past month had injected at least one patient. So very positive again. But how do you turn at the bottom end of the quintiles occasional users into highly-frequent users? And we know that it takes time to get physicians to create a clinic where they spend, it's all very individual -- a whole morning or a whole afternoon doing nothing but BOTOX injections. On the consumer side, extremely positive. When we look at brand awareness, we're a way above all the norms of Madison Avenue because clearly, we metric that as well. Also in other surveys we've seen in terms of physician awareness within the whole broader market of migraine, we now have the highest awareness of any single product. So also, a good leading indicator. And clearly, I made remarks about the number of patients that have gone on our websites and have even just looked for Find a Doctor, in the last couple of months, that's close to 0.25 million patients. So what is going into the funnel is very, very positive, and we're beginning to understand better and better over time what does  it take in terms of being on the website then looking for Find a Doctor, all the way through to being injected, and that's called experience, right, where we metric it over time. And then you get better and better at your predictive model."

When one counts, literally there's almost 10. Clearly, I know from last year, from our research, meaning, the full year 2011, that in procedures that the European market did grow, modestly, but it did grow. So going to Q1, we had very strong sales. I think there for 2 reasons. One is, given that we are by far the market leader in breast implants in Europe, we benefited sadly for patients where revision surgery had to be conducted. So i.e., a PIP implant was explanted and a new one was put in. But I think that only explains part of it. I think the second part is that plastic surgeons making their choice had a real move to the quality makers. And, of course, one of the biggest stamps of quality in the European market is who is approved in the United States. And clearly, at that moment, it was 2 companies: Mentor and ourselves. And there, as I've stated, being the market leader, you tend to have a very strong halo effect to leadership. So really, double benefit in terms of first-time primary augmentations as well."

But this was prior to the launch of OPTIVE Advanced. So one would assume we will get a benefit looking at history in artificial tears from the value of innovation.

If we look at the U.K. where there's no delay in actual pricing. But if one looks at all drug launches between NICE and the Scottish Medicines Consortium, they take many quarters to actually convene and review the data and then say, ""Are we actually paying for this product through the primary health care trusts?""

Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In the first quarter of this year, Allergan sales grew versus the first quarter of 2011 by 9.0%, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to many world currencies, especially the euro, by a higher 10.4% in local currencies. 
We enjoyed strong double-digit growth in many operating regions, namely the U.S. and Canadian pharmaceuticals businesses, across the total business in Europe, Africa, Middle East, and also in Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
The U.S. medical device business have declining sales due to the filler business, which is explained by the timing of consumer promotions in 2012 and 2011 and due to market conditions for LAP-BAND. Regarding operating performance, we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86, marking an increase of 11.7% and at the top end of the range of expectations provided at our last earnings call. 
For reconciliation to GAAP numbers, kindly consult our press release. You will note that we have not changed our outlook for sales or earnings for the full year 2012. A few major swing items for the full year are, however, worthy of comment. 
On March 9, a U.S. District Court judge in California issued a permanent injunction enjoining Merz from selling or providing Xeomin or soliciting purchases of Xeomin in official -- facial aesthetics market until January 9, 2013. The judge also imposed the same restrictions on Xeomin in the therapeutic market, unless customers are not identified on court mandate to the exclusion lists, or customers voluntarily and without solicitation request to purchase the product for therapeutic use, and sworn declarations are submitted so stating. 
Finally, the judge enjoined Merz from providing or selling dermal filler products or soliciting purchases of dermal filler products until Jan. 9, 2013, except to customers who voluntarily and without solicitation request to purchase the product and sworn declarations are submitted so stating, or unless customers had already purchased product between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010. Further exact details of this injunction are to be found in the court order. 
Given Xeomin inventory in channel, which still have to be used, this did not positively affect BOTOX sales in the quarter, but is expected to provide a benefit during the remainder of the year, and additionally, a small benefit to JUVÉDERM sales. 
As an offsetting item, the cost of U.S. healthcare reform is now expected to cost us an incremental $20 million, increasing from $90 million in 2011 to an estimated pre-tax equivalent of $110 million in 2012. This is due to increased cost of the so-called doughnut hole relating to primarily our glaucoma product line and an increase in Allergan's share of the pharmaceutical tax due to our sales growth relative to the rest of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. 
Overseas, government-mandated price cuts remain in the range of our planning assumptions. Regarding SANCTURA XR, a district court found all claims and patents invalid for obviousness. Whilst we were disappointed about the court's ruling, we believe that we have strong arguments on appeal. Based on the foregoing, under our analysis of generic filers, our assumption is that no generic of SANCTURA XR will be commercialized during 2012. 
Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. Given the odd-looking decline in facial aesthetics, which declined 5.0% year-over-year and 3.5% in local currencies, I will start with the consumer-facing cash pay businesses. 
From the facts which I will present, it is clear that we remain very positive about consumer spending in our markets. Dermal fillers declined considerably in the United States, offset by strong double-digit growth internationally. Also recollect, the sales in Q1 2011 grew a spectacular 48% versus the first quarter of 2010 and represented the first time that facial aesthetic sales were sequentially higher than the high point of a fourth quarter. 
In the U.S., the swing is explained by the timing of our so-called Duet Dividends promotion, whereby we provide incentives to physicians and rebate coupons to their patients to combine orders and treatments of JUVÉDERM with BOTOX. 
In 2011, all orders for this highly successful promotion were in the first quarter. This year, the promotion commenced in the middle of April and lasts throughout the second quarter. 
In Q2, we've already seen a strong response to this promotion. The 2012 campaign was timed to commence just after the presumed launch of Xeomin cosmetic of the American Academy of Dermatology, which took place in the middle of March. Furthermore, physician office inventory of JUVÉDERM was drawn down as we launched the new syringe size of 1 mL at the same price as the former 0.8 mL syringe, which will no longer be commercialized in the U.S. market. In our commercial policy, we were clear to customers that we would not be taking back 0.8 mL inventory, thereby, encouraging physicians to exhaust old inventory before placing the orders. 
Earning out the channel inventory swings created by ourselves, we estimate that the U.S. market in Q1 grew in the low double digits. Sequentially, market share was flat in Q1 at about 39%, but up 200 basis points from Q1 of 2011. 
Overseas, we also continued to be encouraged by strong market growth, as well as share gains for JUVÉDERM. In Europe, syndicated market data shows fourth quarter year-over-year growth at about 16% across the European Union. 
JUVÉDERM sales in Europe, Australia and Korea, were boosted by physician enthusiasm for VOLUMA with Lidocaine in a 1 mL syringe, which was launched during the quarter. JUVÉDERM was also launched in Thailand, and JUVÉDERM with Lidocaine in Mexico 
In Italy and Spain, extremely strong sales growth in both facial and breast aesthetics point to the resilience of consumer demand for our products. In Canada, we have commenced TV advertising for JUVÉDERM in March. 
Now moving onto breast aesthetics. Sales increased a very strong 17.0% in dollars and 18.4% in local currencies, with particularly-strong performance stemming from Europe and Latin America. Based on extensive feedback from the marketplace, it seems that we've benefited as the clear market leader in Europe from a move to high-quality manufacturers for first-time augmentation surgery. 
In addition, Allergan implants have been chosen for revision surgery in the wake of the PIP scandal, which had its greatest impact in France and the U.K. Lesser effects were seen in most of the European markets, as well as Latin America and Australia. In the U.S., we enjoyed good growth, not only from healthy growth in market procedures, but also due to the continuing improvement of mix to higher price silicone gel products and tissue expanders. 
With the breadth of our product line, both in implants and tissue expanders, but also across our plastic surgery product line, we feel well prepared to face new competition from Sientra in the U.S. 
In Europe, at the Aesthetic Medicine World Congress in Monaco at the end of March, we unveiled a quality first communications campaign covering not only our breast implants, but also a full range of aesthetics products, building on our heritage as clear category leader in each of our market segments. This campaign encompasses not only media relations, but also advertisements in women's magazines. 
Regarding BOTOX, the franchise grew 9.4% in dollars and 10.5% to local currencies, with greater double-digit growth from the therapeutic side of the business, thanks to the recently-approved indications of chronic migraine, neurogenic overactive bladder and in the U.S., upper limb spasticity. And more moderate growth on the cosmetic side due to competitive entries. 
Regarding worldwide market share for all uses of neuromodulators in Q4 2011, the last period for which we have data available, we estimate that BOTOX enjoyed just over 76% share, down about 300 basis points from Q4 of 2010, given the entry of competitors into new geographic markets. This, however, very positive that both the therapeutic and aesthetic neuromodulator markets in Q4 year-over-year continue to grow in the double digits. 
Now back to Q1 sales. On the cosmetic side of the business, we're impacted in the U.S. by Xeomin's 7% to 8% share in the first quarter -- this is per our consumer survey -- after their prelaunch in October 2011. We were, however, pleased that BOTOX Cosmetic volume share in March moved up to 78% from 75% in February, gaining both against Dysport and Xeomin. The driver was the media and promotional launch of our BOTOX 10-year anniversary campaign, which enabled patients to capture a discount across 3 treatments. 
We estimate that the U.S. aesthetic neuromodulator market was growing double-digit in Q1. In Europe, we lost limited market share in Southern European countries, where Galderma with Azzalure and Merz with Bocouture are still in their launch phase, but market growth remains encouraging. Sales across Asia were particularly strong. 
Turning to the therapeutic side of the business, growth was particularly strong in the United States, Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. In Europe, we are impacted by government-mandated price cuts, which have the effect of converting gratifying unit growth into low market growth in value. 
Regarding the trajectory of all BOTOX therapeutic launches, I wish to remind investors that our 20-year experience is that this is always long cycle, even if all the metrics are very positive. As injectors learn the procedure and incorporate BOTOX into regular clinics, clearly that takes time. 
Since the last earnings call, we are pleased that we have received additional BOTOX therapeutic approvals. BOTOX for chronic migraine was additionally approved in Hungary, Luxembourg, Israel, Singapore, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Venezuela, and now enjoys licenses in a total of 42 countries. 
Regarding BOTOX for neurogenic bladder, approvals came through in Australia, Belgium, Norway, Luxembourg and Spain, with now approvals totaling, altogether, 31 countries. In the U.S., BOTOX therapeutic market share remains very high at 93%, with the remaining 7% being shared fairly equally by Dysport, Myobloc and Xeomin. 
The U.S. chronic migraine launch continues to progress very well, with particularly-encouraging feedback from injecting physicians attending the recent American Academy of Neurology regarding their assessment of patient response to treatment and overall satisfaction. About 5,000 individual physicians of the approximately 10,000 neurologists in the United States have now been trained and we're beginning to ramp up preceptorships for those customers requesting advanced training. 
50% of practicing neurologists injected at least one patient for chronic migraine in the past month. The last reimbursement gaps are being gradually closed. Regarding access in commercial-managed care plans, 91% of all lives now have policy coverage. Accordingly, the volume of insurance verifications continues to rise, and the number of denials to prior authorizations are in a steady decline. 
We launched non-branded DTC campaign for patient awareness of their condition in September of last year and in addition, have placed BOTOX-branded print advertisements in women's magazines since February. 
We're also fielding a public relations campaign called Rewrite Your Day. We're pleased with the number of hits to our websites and the number of patients visiting the Find a Doctor webpage. 
In Canada, we're also recording good initial sales for chronic migraine, where patients have insurance coverage from private rather than government plans. Potentially, 80% of the total opportunity in Canada is from the private arena. As we only received Health Canada approval in Q4, we do not yet have coverage from provincial plans. 
In the U.S., in the core movement disorders area, which include the upper limb spasticity indication, we also continue to enjoy double-digit growth. Regarding the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we're also off to a good start. Just over 1,000 individual physicians have been trained, and we're now launching a proctorship program. Regarding insurance access, 60% of commercial lives enjoy policy coverage, 82% of Medicare lives and 96% of Medicaid lives. Clearly, age and insurance profiles for spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients are quite different from each other. 
Outcomes of the insurance verification process are very similar to what we experienced in the initial months post-launch with chronic migraine. Obviously, the next key event in our urology franchise is the expected approvals for idiopathic overactive bladder by both FDA and the European authorities in 2013. 
Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales increased 10.2% year-over-year in dollars and 12.0% in local currencies. We did double-digit growth in North America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia. This is commendable performance considering sales growth is impacted by government-mandated price cuts across a broad range of European countries, extended out to Turkey and Korea. 
Growth was driven by a wide range of products: RESTASIS, COMBIGAN, LUMIGAN, OZURDEX and the artificial tears line led by OPTIVE. We have also reached the juncture where the sales reduction from the genericization of ACULAR in the United States and the impact on the combined ACULAR, ACUVAIL franchise is minor. 
The IMS Global report for the fourth quarter of 2011 shows the global market growing by only 4%. And excluding retina, the market declining by 1% due to the genericization of Xalatan and Cosopt around the world. 
In the same period, IMS shows Allergan growing by 8% in line with Alcon. Clearly, Allergan is strongly growing market share in glaucoma and in a small base, share in retina with OZURDEX. Share in the artificial tears market was stable. 
In the first quarter, we continued to make excellent progress, with both LUMIGAN globally and GANFORT overseas. In the U.S., the percentage of new prescriptions written for LUMIGAN 0.01% as a proportion of all LUMIGAN prescriptions passed the 60% mark and as their franchise continues to grow despite the genericization of Xalatan. Given the success of LUMIGAN 0.01%, U.S. wholesalers and retailers are reducing their stock of LUMIGAN 0.03%. 
ALPHAGAN also continues to grow in the U.S. despite the availability of generics. RESTASIS remains on a strong growth trajectory in the U.S. and has made a strong impact in its initial launch in Canada. 
OPTIVE advanced a triple-action formula that works on all layers of the tear film, was launched in the U.S. in the quarter and is enjoying strong pick up. The same product was launched under the brand, OPTIVE Plus in Germany, Italy and Belgium. In France, OPTIVE has been approved and launched as a reimbursed product. We are pleased with our strong and growing presence overall in emerging markets. In Latin America, we're the fastest-growing multinational ophthalmic company, and are the largest ophthalmic company in Brazil. 
Since the beginning of the year, we've had a lot of activity. LUMIGAN 0.01% was launched in Mexico, OZURDEX in Mexico and Argentina, and ZYMAXID and ACUVAIL under local brands in Brazil. In Russia, ALPHAGAN P and GANFORT were successfully introduced in January. 
In China, we're growing very strongly on a small base, driven by our glaucoma and tears products. In India, our market growing by about 15%, we're growing even faster as a strong #1 market leader. 
Our skin care franchise grew by a very strong 28.8%, both in dollars and in local currencies. ACZONE is on a strong upswing with ex-factory sales increasing 66% and is about to become the #1 product in the anti-inflammatory acne category, surpassing Duac. 
TAZORAC also had a strong quarter on an ex-factory basis and grew in market of 6.7% on an acquisition dollar basis, as reported by IMS VONA. LATISSE sales declined 8.9% in dollars, by 8.8% to local currencies. This follows the very strong Q4 sales due to the sell-in of a special offer to physicians. 
In market, we're pleased that we reached a new record level of prescriptions and that consumers have responded well to the repositioning of the product as part of the women's antiaging portfolio of products. 
In Canada, a national TV campaign has driven a record number of consumers to our physician locator. In Latin America, we had good growth in Brazil and Mexico and launched LATISSE in Chile. The SANCTURA urology franchise declined 6%, 6.0%, as we moved to our promotional emphasis to the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic overactive bladder. 
The obesity intervention line declined 15.5% in dollars and 15.0% to local currencies. In the U.S., we're somewhat encouraged that the rate of decline of the bariatric market is attenuating. In fact, we believe, at the beginning of this year, it even grew slightly. 
The overall market declined 6% in 2011 and only grew, as I stated, 3% to 4% year-to-date, February. With the share of banding ranging around 41% since August 21, 2011 with gains in sleeve gastrectomy coming at the expense of bypass procedures. Within the band category, LAP-BAND enjoyed 90% share in February. Now a substantial part of our efforts are directed to improving access to reimbursement with results expected in 2013. 
I will now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance."

The first quarter of 2012 represented a good start to the year for Allergan, despite previously-discussed pressures relating to U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing. Allergan's diversified",841,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. The first quarter of 2012 represented a good start to the year for Allergan, despite previously-discussed pressures relating to U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing. Allergan's diversified base of business, as well as its consistent and thoughtful approach of reinvesting in our business, enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS results at the top end of our earnings per share guidance for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.86, marking an 11.7% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. As a reminder, our diluted earnings per share in Q1 2011 includes the beneficial impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit of approximately $0.01 per share, which should not recur in Q1 2012. Excluding this benefit from the prior-year results in adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in Q1 2012 of 13.2%. Reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q1 2012 gross margin of 85.7% increased 30 basis points when compared to Q1 2011. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin is driven by a number of variables, but primarily attributable to favorable product mix. With respect to the favorability in product mix, the drivers were primarily related to a slightly higher proportion of pharma products versus medical device products and a slightly higher proportion of higher-margin pharmaceutical products. As sales volumes increase over the remainder of the year, you should expect the cost profiles of our manufacturing process to continue to improve and some improvement in gross profit margin. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the first quarter was 42.1% totaling $575 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 42.6% and $534 million, respectively. We continue to implement targeted investments to further support our future growth and support the launch of the many products approved in 2010 and '11. As is historically the case, Allergan's SG&A expense to product mix sales ratio tends to be higher in the first half of the year and moderates during the back half of the year. Our expectation for 2012 is consistent with this historic theme. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.5% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $225 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the $198 million or 15.8% of product net sales spent in the first quarter of 2011. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan sales, day sales outstanding, was at 57 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 122 days. 
In the first quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $186 million. At the end of the first quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.6 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Our current net cash position, along with our strong access to external capital, provides Allergan with the continuing capability to make intelligent productive investments within the selling and marketing and research and development areas of our business. Moreover, this liquidity provides the company with superb latitude and flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities. 
With respect to stock repurchase, and as previously disclosed, the company is presently executing against the 10b5-1 plan involving some 6 million shares covering the first half of 2012 with a focus of offsetting the dilutive effect of share-based employee compensation plans. As we move towards the second half of the year, we are likely to either extend this program or continue with periodic open market purchases. 
For the second quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,450,000,000 to $1,500,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.06. All full year expectations for 2012 remain consistent with previous guidance. 
Allergan estimates full year product net sales between $5,650,000,000 and $5,850,000,000 and full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share remains between $4.13 and $4.19, which represents growth between 13% and 15%. 
To repeat a comment already made by David Pyott, this expectation now includes a full year pretax equivalent impact of approximately $110 million related to U.S. health care reform, which is an increase of approximately $20 million from our previous assumption. This increase reflects the inclusion of our payment expectations relating to the doughnut hole and an increase of our pro rata share of the pharma tax, as several major pharmaceutical industry products move to a generic environment. 
As we have previously communicated, our 2012 expectations assume that U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. 
For information, expectations for all other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in the current and prior earnings releases and also remain unchanged. 
So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

And this year, as I pointed out in my remarks, we compounded that with the switch of the size from 0.8 to 1 mL at the same price. And we made it very clear, we weren't taking back the smaller size. So the motivation to stock up was less than 0. And clearly, the sell-in of this promotion, which started in the middle of April has been very strong. So based on everything we can see, you'll see the flip around in Q2 with some very major filler growth across the world. So we did this all for promotional reasons, as I stated, it was all due to be timed to just after what we had assumed would be the launch of Xeomin cosmetic at the ADD."

And therefore, our job, as the category leader, is to ensure that the market is growing.

For the first time for a while, we've actually seen total bariatric procedures moving up just fractionally. We only have data year-to-date, February. The other thing we watch, of course, is what is the overall share of bands as part of all bariatric procedures. And that's been pretty flat for about all the time since -- from recollection, August of last year. So they're bouncing right around that 40% mark. So what I'd call the various segment shares are beginning to flatten, which is a good thing. Secondly, my remarks about 2013 was, clearly, when we get policy changes by insurance plans, even if they were to decide hypothetically today, in practice, they don't actually roll out the new plan coverage until January 1, 2013. And we know this as employees in our own companies as well. Plans tend to change with the calendar year. So all the efforts are going towards improvement of access and also reducing cost of co-pays. And there, we're using the health economics data that we have published. So we're not asking for a favor from employers or their insurance plans, we're asking them to do a favor to themselves. Looking at SG&A, Jeff made the comment that, clearly, always, we start high in the year because we tend to move up our investments into sales force or new initiatives. If we look at this year, clearly, a big investment was made in the launch of chronic migraine and neurogenic bladder, particularly in the U.S., but you could hear from my remarks, in Canada and certain countries in Europe as well. And then, DTC, we continue to invest strongly. Clearly, migraine is an up item, given that there was no history to that particular spending item. And at the very margin, we had some increased legal expenses, and the biggest single item was the Merz litigation. And looking back, of course, that for once was a good investment in lawyers. We got the result we wanted. And this is me speaking as a former lawyer. Forgive my sense of humor."

The -- many doctors, not all of them, of course, have the perception that LUMIGAN is the most potent of the prostaglandin or prostaglandin analogs.

So obviously, we model those things out. And as I've also pointed out, we're not the only competitor. There's Dysport as well.

When you ask physicians what they think the success ratios are for treatment, it's across-the-board. But it's sort of 65% to 80%, very, very high for any drug therapy that any of us have ever heard. So I think great satisfaction on the physician side. As I pointed out, and we've known this for 20 years now, the whole cycle of training people and then gradually getting them not only to inject, and I did make the remark that half of all practicing neurologists in the past month had injected at least one patient. So very positive again. But how do you turn at the bottom end of the quintiles occasional users into highly-frequent users? And we know that it takes time to get physicians to create a clinic where they spend, it's all very individual -- a whole morning or a whole afternoon doing nothing but BOTOX injections. On the consumer side, extremely positive. When we look at brand awareness, we're a way above all the norms of Madison Avenue because clearly, we metric that as well. Also in other surveys we've seen in terms of physician awareness within the whole broader market of migraine, we now have the highest awareness of any single product. So also, a good leading indicator. And clearly, I made remarks about the number of patients that have gone on our websites and have even just looked for Find a Doctor, in the last couple of months, that's close to 0.25 million patients. So what is going into the funnel is very, very positive, and we're beginning to understand better and better over time what does it take in terms of being on the website then looking for Find a Doctor, all the way through to being injected, and that's called experience, right, where we metric it over time.

So going to Q1, we had very strong sales. I think there for 2 reasons. One is, given that we are by far the market leader in breast implants in Europe, we benefited sadly for patients where revision surgery had to be conducted. So i.e., a PIP implant was explanted and a new one was put in. But I think that only explains part of it. I think the second part is that plastic surgeons making their choice had a real move to the quality makers. And, of course, one of the biggest stamps of quality in the European market is who is approved in the United States. And clearly, at that moment, it was 2 companies: Mentor and ourselves.

I think, if one looks at the willingness of payers, access will be easier in this country than many others. And of course, there will also be an advantage of time because, as we all know, I'm stating the obvious, even once you get an approval of chronic migraine, say, in Spain or the U.K., that doesn't mean that the product instantly is available. If we look at the U.K. where there's no delay in actual pricing. But if one looks at all drug launches between NICE and the Scottish Medicines Consortium, they take many quarters to actually convene and review the data and then say, ""Are we actually paying for this product through the primary health care trusts?"" So I think the way to think about this, summing that up, is that the U.S. will be the lion's share. But clearly, there are some very interesting markets in Europe, Australia and Canada. And I did make very positive comments about the Canadian private market already as an example."

In the second quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the second quarter 2011 by 8.7% to local currencies. And due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to virtually all of the world's all currencies by 4.8% in dollars.
Year-to-date, we've been able to grow Allergan's total sales by 9.5% year-over-year in local currencies, despite challenges in the global economy. Benefiting from our global footprint, our international sales in the first half grew double digits in many businesses namely: Ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, BOTOX, thermal fillers and breast aesthetics. In fact, all of our consumer-facing businesses performed relative well so far this year. 
Regarding operating performance, we generated in Q2, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07, marking an increase of 11.5% over the prior year and a penny over the top end of the range of expectations provided at our last earnings call. 
Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has increased 11.6% versus 2011. In the first half of the year, we have also continued to invest in the long-term success of Allergan, investing $457 million or 11.4% more on R&D on a non-GAAP basis. For a reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please consult our press release.
Now commenting on the performance of the individual businesses. Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales increased in Q2 versus the prior year at a slightly lower rate than normal, 6.5% in local currencies and 1.9% in dollars, and with year-to-date growth at 9.1% to local currencies and 5.9% in dollars. 
The year-to-date growth in local currencies is more in line with the historical performance for this business. The Q2 growth rate was dampened rate by the U.S., which I'll comment further, while international sales grew in local currencies year-over-year, 11.0% and year-to-date, 12.2%, with double-digit growth in all the 3, in all the ex- U.S. operating regions: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Canada. 
The IMS Global report for the first quarter of 2012, the last period for which states is available of shows Allergan growing in market at 8% and outperforming Alcon, Novartis one excludes the retina segment. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, the IMS reports shows Allergan gaining share strongly in glaucoma and in retina and small base, as well as an uptick in share in artificial tears. driven by the recent launches of OPTIVE Advanced marketed as OPTIVE Plus outside the U.S. 
In the U.S. Q2 ex-factory sales growth was limited at 3.3% with year-to-date growth versus prior year at 6.9%. Per IMS, U.S. acquisition dollar sales growth year-to-date June was 11.8%. The states this growth versus prior year per IMS continued on the strong trend, with quarter-to-date June growth of 16.1% and year-to-date growth at 14.1%, as more and more physicians recognize the value of treating dry eye symptoms early in the progression of this disease. 
LUMIGAN franchise performance merits closer commentary with the decline of 3.2% in Q2 in local currencies and year-to-date growth in local currencies at 1.8%. 
At U.S., Q2 performance were strong, with LUMIGAN and Danforth continuing to gain market share in all key markets and the decline in the U.S. due to increased commercial and Part D rebates, as well as a reduction in trade inventory.
Per IMS year-to-date, June, U.S. LUMIGAN sales increased year-over-year 16.2% in acquisition dollars and 3.5% in trailing prescriptions for retail in mail order. Analysis of the updated outlook for the LUMIGAN franchise for the second half of the year will demonstrate that we foresee renewed growth in the LUMIGAN franchise due primarily to the benefits of price greases in the U.S. 
Regarding the status of our 2013 contracts with CVS Caremark, I wish provide a fact-based analysis. We lost our preferred status only on the commercial formerly, which is less important than the Part D formerly. The branded competitor offered a rebate structure, which did not make any financial sense for us. Plus, we do not like losing any account. This only amounts so less than a handful of share all overall LUMIGAN prescriptions in the United States and has been partially offset by another formerly win, 
In summary, we believe that our overall formally physicians in 2013 will be broadly similar to those in 2012. Due to the excellent acceptance of LUMIGAN 0.01%, which accounts now for 61% to trailing prescriptions and is based on a superior profile relative to the original LUMIGAN, we announced this week that we plan to no longer manufacture LUMIGAN 0.03% by the end of 2012 for the United States market. 
In our outlook, we have factored in for the U.S. LUMIGAN 0.03% inventory reduction between now and year-end. Given the availability of generics for brimonidine, we are go out that the ALPHAGAN and COMBIGAN franchise continues to enjoy growth, both in the U.S. and worldwide. 
Rounding up my commentary on ophthalmics, our Canadian business is growing strongly, driven by a strong uptick of RESTASIS, paid for by private insurance, as well as completion of the successful conversion of the LUMIGAN franchise to 0.01%, marketed as LUMIGAN RC in Canada. 
Successful launches in Mexico of LUMIGAN RC and Zypred have driven very strong growth this year. OZURDEX is performing particularly strongly in Europe. In June, the Scottish Medicines Consortium issued a positive coverage review. During the quarter, OZURDEX was launched in Mexico, Argentina, Singapore and Turkey. 
LATISSE is off to the strong start in Brazil. OPTIVE was launched in Venezuela and OPTIVE Plus in the U.K. Switzerland, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. The Spanish government has to reimbursed gears from August 1, which on the one hand will introduce turbulence into the marketplace. From the other hand, based on other similar experiences in other markets, will give us opportunities as the clear market leader in Spain to position and price products on a premium.
Regarding BOTOX. We enjoyed a continuing ramp-up in sales. In Q2, the franchise grew 13.6% in local currencies and 10.2% in dollars, with double-digit local currency performance of both the cosmetic and therapeutic franchises.
The therapeutic franchise is clearly benefiting from the recently approved indications of chronic migraine, eurogenic overactive bladder and in the U.S., Opera then as it is it. Since the last earnings call, we have received additional country approvals. 
For chronic migraine in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Costa Rica, Bahrain, Kuwait and Jordan. NICE in the U.K. issued its final guidance recommending use in the National Health Service for patients of not responded to 3 prior preventative treatments and whose conditions is appropriately manage for medication overuse. This means that the primary care trust in England and Wales have until the end of September to make funding and resources available for this patient group.
Regarding neurogenic bladder, we received additional approval from Switzerland, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia, Panama, Egypt, Jordan and the Philippines. In Canada, we received a positive recommendation in the common drug review with action not to be taken by the individual provinces. Additionally, we filed an application to help Canada for approval of the ediopathic overactive bladder indication. 
BOTOX therapeutic growth was particularly strong in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. In Europe, we are impacted by government-mandated price cuts and low tender prices offered by some competitors, which have the effect of converting reasonable unit growth into low market growth in value. 
In the U.S., BOTOX therapeutic market share remains very high, with over 93% with the remaining 7% being shared by Dysport, Myobloc and Xeomin in descending order. The ramp in U.S. chronic migraine treatments continues on a strong trajectory. We have now trained approximately 5,800 individual physicians and have started to train pain specialists in a very targeted number of general practitioners with high indices, both migraine patients. 
Regarding access, 92% of all lives and commercial managed care plans now have some level of policy coverage. The volume of insurance verifications continues to rise and the number of denials to prior authorizations is on a declining trend. 
In the recent patient survey, over 60% of all patients reported being satisfied with their overall treatment regimen and over 90% stated that they would continue with BOTOX. 
In the core movement disorders area in the U.S., which includes the upper limb spasticity indication we're growing the low double-digits. Regarding the progress of the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we have trained approximately 1,800 individual physicians since launch. In the American urology Association, there are many elections in BOTOX, and we received a considerable degree of interest. 
Regarding insurance access, 88% of commercial lives have some level of policy access, 93% of Medicare lives and over 90% of Medicaid lives. The agent profile of spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients are quite different from one another. 
Trends in insurance verifications it in denial rates are following the same pattern as in the commensurate timeframe of the chronic migraine launch. 
Now moving over to the cosmetic side of the business. The U.S. return to growth in Q2 subsequent to Merz product. Additionally, sales were boosted by both the BOTOX 10-year anniversary campaign, as well as the Duet Dividends promotion, incentivizing consumers to use both JUVÉDERM and BOTOX Cosmetic. 
Based in our survey, we estimate that BOTOX had over 80% share in the quarter, moving up from a low point of 75% in the January to February timeframe. In June, Xeomin still have the reported residual share of 2% as inventory has drained. 
In Q2, we estimate that the U.S. market grew double-digit in volume. Outside the U.S., we benefited in Q2 from strong growth across the wide range of countries in Latin America, Asia and emerging markets in Europe, Africa, Middle East. 
Even some European countries performed well, offset by some market share loss in Southern Europe, where competition is still in their launch phases. Facial aesthetics. Sales rebounded by the weak ex-factory shipments in Q1, with Q2 sales increasing year-over-year by 23.5% in local currencies and 18.0% in dollars. Further to our commentary on the last earnings call, this was due to the timing of our Duet Dividends promotion in the U.S., which took place in Q2 in 2012 versus Q1 in 2011. Year-to-date sales increased 10.5% in local currencies and 6.9% in dollars.
In the U.S., we estimate that we had over 37% share, gaining over 100 basis points relative to Q2 of 2011. Year-to-date, overseas, we have enjoyed strong growth in many markets across Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe, Africa, Middle East. 
Even in Western Europe, we have recorded gratifying sales increases. This is explicable by the strong position acceptance of our new VOLUMA Plus lidocaine a 1 mL syringe, which in turn, has driven by the share increases in Europe and also other markets where it is available. This category-leading product was also launched in Q2 in Australia and Korea. 
Breast aesthetics had another strong quarter, with Q2 sales increasing over Q2 of 2011 by 10.2% in local currencies, by 6.0% in dollars. Year-to-date growth was 14.0% in local currencies and 11.1% in dollars. All of our overseas regions namely Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America recorded very strong growth.
In the wake of the PIP scandal in Europe, it is evident that many surgeons and their patients shows Allergan's implants for revision surgery, given that we are the clear market leader in Europe. While the rate of our sales increases have somewhat attenuated, we still have some great growth rates in many of the European countries and to surprisingly robust sales in Southern Europe. 
In the U.S., we've seen good growth, not only in volume, but also we benefited from improvement in product mix with higher price silicone gel products and tissue expanders. So far, the new competitor, CEM Chair, has only picked up limited share. In Curiel, we received approval for the fourth and shaped silicon implant range and we'll be commercializing this shortly. 
Our skin care franchise grew in Q2 9.8% year-over-year in local currencies and 9.3% in dollars. Year-to-date, 18.8% in local currencies and 18.5% in dollars over the prior year. ACZONE sales continues to increase rapidly with acquisition dozers per RIMS viewing 8 increasing year-to-date 49%. ACZONE, even prior to the generous a station of the duet have become the clear market leader in the anti-inflammatory acne category. 
TAZORAC acquisition dollar sales increased year-to-date by 3%, with market share starting to pick up a little, given greater sales force attention. LATISSE Q2 sales increase year-over-year by 19.9% in local currencies and by 18.7% in dollars, benefiting particularly from a promotion in Q2 in the U.S. 
In the U.S., we received a summary judgment from the U.S. District Court in Orange County pursuant to an action for unfair competition that the commission revitalize advanced eyelash conditioner is a drug and not a cosmetic. We are currently awaiting for this federal judge's ruling regarding terms of an injunction. 
In response to the court's action, Athena has suspended domestic sales of this product. From a market analysis, we estimate that Athena have the higher share of the LATISSE in our cost. Continuing our process of innovation, we, today, introduced a 5 mL pack of LATISSE to the U.S. market, we should offer consumers greater convenience relative to the 3 mL pack for achieving their goal of longer, darker and thicker lashes. We also launched LATISSE in Q2 in Taiwan and Russia. 
Sales of LATISSE continue to progress well in Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The SANCTURA urology franchise declined 31.4% in Q2 year-over-year and 19.0% year-to-date. In terms of in-market acquisition dollars, SANCTURA has declined 5.3% year-to-date. Since the district court finds our SANCTURA XR patents to be invalid, we have moved all commercial efforts in our urology team to the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic bladder. 
The obesity intervention line declined in Q2 year-over-year at 21.5% in local currencies, 24.1% in dollars, broadly in line with the past trend in constant currency. year-to-date, the line declined 18.3% in local currencies and 19.9% in dollars. It is encouraging that the decline in the overall U.S. bariatric market is flattening the rate of decline in the last 3 months to May estimated at 2% compared to a 6% decline throughout the year 2011.
On the negative side, the share of banding has dropped from the low 40% in 2011 to 33% in May, with band losing to gain to sleeve gastrectomy, which have guarded the 31% share in May. 
Within Vance, LAP-BAND enjoys a roughly 90% share. As commented for the last 6 months or so, we have directed considerable effort improving reimbursement with results expected in the new insurance policy year of 2013. 
So far, we succeeded in improving bariatric policy in 41 million commercial lines. Clearly, in a time of higher employment, high patient co-pays are of our your Steven those patients have insurance coverage. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment our financial performance and outlook."

During the second quarter of 2012, Allergan generated good operating results despite costs related to U.S. Health Care Reform, ongoing overseas pricing pressure, somewhat choppy European economic environment other charges to the company a stronger U.S. dollar environments. 
Despite each of these challenges, the debt and breadth of our business and continued focus on rational expense management and thoughtfully directing investments allowed the company to achieve non-GAAP diluted earnings per share above the top end of our EPS guidance for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.07, marking an 11.5% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q2 2012 gross margin of 86.3% increased 20 basis points when compared to Q2 2011. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin is a continuation of favorable product mix on both a year-over-year basis and a sequential quarter basis. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio to the second quarter was 39%, totaling $572 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 40.2% and $563 million, respectively. This decrease in percentage of SG&A reflects our commitment to continuing to develop our leverage goal and scalable business model as we undertake thoughtful evaluations to our structure and investments to ensure that they continue to generate positive financial returns while simultaneously maintaining a certain level of financial flexibility, which can be adjusted, if necessary, in response to changing circumstances. 
We continue to believe the Allergan's non-GAAP SG&A expense to product net sales ratio will be further leveraged in the second half of this year. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.8% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $232 million, an increase in spend of approximately $7 million over the first quarter of 2012 and nearly $20 million over the second quarter of 2011. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan day sales outstanding was 54 days, a 3-day reduction from the first quarter result, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 117 days, a 5-day reduction from the first quarter result. 
In the second quarter, Allergan's operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $395 million. At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents and short-term investments and cash and equivalents and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.7 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively. 
With respect to stock repurchased, the company executed against the 10b5-1 plan involving approximately 6 million shares in the first half of 2012. This program has been extended into the second half of 2012, and we expect to repurchase an additional 4 million shares with a continued focus of offsetting the dilutive effect of share-based employee compensation plans.
With respect to our expectations, what we've provided today with our earnings release accounts for Allergan's current perspective on the state of the global economic environment in foreign currency markets for the remainder of 2012. 
While Allergan has produced good results during the first half of 2012, there are still number of variables that may influence performance during the second half of the year, including potential movements within the macroeconomic environment and continued volatility of foreign exchange rates. Let me multinational company's, Allergan regularly monitors and measures the impact of foreign currency movements on our financial results. Although we have seen a meaningful strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most major foreign currencies in the recent past, we have a clear understanding of the value of this currency movement, and today, are comfortable with our ability to continue managing its impact. 
As a reminder, Allergan does maintain a hedging program to combine the natural hedges and offsets we have in place as a consequence of the structure, as well as the use of vanilla options to further limit our exposure to further currency movements. 
For the third quarter of 2011, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,370,000,000  to $1,445,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.04. Regarding full year expectations for 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,650,000,000 and $5,800,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $4.15 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%. 
Our product net sales expectations reflect a reduction of $50 million from the top end of the range provided within our previous expectations. This decision is attributable to a significant negative currency movement, both incurred and projected. We currently estimate a negative currency impact of approximately 3% to 4% on sales growth across the year. Also, we are reducing the top end of LUMIGAN franchise product net sales expectations by $30 million. 
This action is due primarily to currency headwinds, the previously discussed plan to discontinue LUMIGAN 0.03 in the U.S. and the related channel inventory -- and that will result from it's an increased commercial and Part D rebates. 
Lastly, we are reducing the top end of the facial filler net sales expectation by $30 million due to both currency headwinds and more modest market growth that was originally expected. Note, we estimate the U.S. filler market growth to be in the high single-digit range in 2012. 
Consistent with our May 2012 expectations, we continue to expect full year pretax equivalent impact of approximately $110 million related to U.S. health care reform and $40 million in incremental overseas pricing pressure. 
In addition, as previously to make it, our 2012 expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012 with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results.

If you think of, say, the U.S. market first, I gave data saying we believe that the neuromodulator market for aesthetic use is going double-digit currently. Jeff, in his remarks, stated that we believe, for the full year 2012, the market will be going high single-digits. And when you think about the remarks I made about Europe in clearly, that's the place that we do look very carefully, we have some fabulous growth rates, even in the so-called, old Europe, let alone, the new Europe or Russia or the Middle East and so on. And I think, really, what it's driven by its multiple factors. One is, if you look at that breast aesthetics market, which we've often felt was a leading indicator for consumer behavior, given hopefully, it's a one-time decision or a decision for a long time. Market very, very robust. And I think this is as market leader benefiting from the problems of lack of quality of PIP. And clearly, we are by far the market leader. We believe we have just over 50% market share in Western Europe in breast implants. Then when I look through BOTOX Cosmetic or those markets look healthy. And fillers, clearly, the market is good. And we're picking up share due to innovation, which is really driven by VOLUMA and most recently, the introduction of the new smaller sized product, which is really appreciated, not only by the doctors for ease of injection, but also speed and comfort by the patients. So when I look across the world, obviously, I'm looking very careful for tracks in the wall. But things are pretty darn good and it's difficult to forecast years and years into the future. Otherwise, I should be working for the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England or somebody. But assuming things continue in this kind of mold, we would certainly like to reiterate our aspiration of mid-teens earnings per share growth."

And we continue to think about what could be the next markets we might add. Really, probably, when you look at sort of the East of Europe and then headed out to Asia. Going back to the bigger question of M&A, clearly, we want to put our free cash flow to work. I think in our largest businesses, ophthalmology and medical settings, a lot of opportunities come to us because clearly, anybody who wants an asset that might want to sell it or share it or partner it would think of us. And it's not altruism because in theory, we should be able to pay more for that asset than somebody else, given our strengths and our regional -- and our worldwide distribution. What we are putting more effort the other way is really looking at neurosciences and urology. And one of the great things with our mix is that we can be fairly agnostic. It could be a drug. It could be a drug delivered in a device. Or it might be even be a device.

Well, I'd say the very high level units and price very similar. Maybe a little bit of price pressure in Europe. We always have to pay attention where governments have mandated on the therapeutic side price declines. We have to keep an eye what is the differentiation between that and visible i.e. the aesthetic side. Because I think you're all very aware that, and the same happens in the United States with diversion. But in Europe, there's lots of parallel trading from lower-priced markets to higher-priced. So net-net, you can tell very healthy unit volume growth, which is reflected in my remarks. Because I did say in local currencies in Q2, both therapeutic, as well as aesthetic, both grew double-digits. Then in terms of new markets, the only one that sort of been that's a good filler this year has been Russia, given that we have the lower base in the prior year through a distributor. And clearly, prior to taking over the business, we wanted to make sure we control deliveries because otherwise, we all know when you take over businesses, often, people will have filled up the channel nicely for you, and we are able to top-down supply so that we at least didn't end up working into an overstock position when we start at the beginning of the year. So net-net, a very healthy unit growth. One last thought, many of you on the sales side conduct surveys and of course, I read them carefully. And I think in terms of same-store sales, maybe your surveys are accurate. But of course, what it can't assure is all then you people wanting to come into the marketplace because of course, many physicians are trying to escape the pressures of managed care and they have much rather be in a nice pieces where the patients basically pays cash or credit card."

We're on the side, we've done very well. And that's why I wanted to put that whole care mac commentary into context. It really was in the context of the ball moving up and down the 5 yards line. This was not a big deal. This is the way we move. You lose some, you win some. And it really didn't change where we'll end up in 2013 in any meaningful way."

But of course, as we have always pointed out with most insurance plans following calendar years, it's much more about waiting for the next calendar year to see a real change in policy. Regarding obesity drugs, my view is that sort of Venn diagram, that sort of scarcely touches this one. It's a different type of patient in terms of the amount of the number of pounds or kilos they want to lose. And I think that will touch as much more diet change and exercise. And I know a little bit about that because in my prior life a long time ago, before I joined Allergan, actually, I was the biggest marketer of what would be called in this country, as diet aids and slimming products in Europe, in both pharmacy and grocery. So I have some memories in my head that I'll never forget, and it's quite a difficult market."

And the wish list has to have metrics on it i.e. if I'm nice enough to give them a $1 million, what will that do to drive both sales and bottom line? So it's almost like lining up David distinct to stick to those jokes. So I do prefer my job. So -- and obviously, in times of dollar strength, that the margin flips the other way. And frankly, we just start maybe tightening the belt a notch or maybe 2 in terms of things like travel and how many people go to medical conventions because, of course, at the very margin, those things may be over a 3-year, 4-year, you could argue have some difference. But in the short term, none at all. So now going sort of the higher level, where you are saying when we look over the balance of this year and to next and where we'll potentially there could be increased expenditure. Well, on a very high level, not really. Because if you think about idiopathic overactive bladder, we've already created the BOTOX sales force for urology in the United States. And sadly, one says we won't make any money on SANCTURA. But now we have soon -- we have more detail capacity, given that we're not spending any more time on SANCTURA. So that opens up space for idiopathic, which hopefully, will be approved earlier next year, 2013. In Europe, the margin, of course, as we're getting those approvals and get reimbursement, we're adding people. But it's kind of dozens and certainly, not hundreds. And if I go to your comment about fillers. Basically, we have the sales force in place. And now can just keep on adding products to the back and move around what is our detail focus, if you like. And whether the sales force have been spending time on JUVÉDERM alter or hopefully, next year, VOLUMA doesn't make a lot of difference. You could just move around the capacity. And there's a real source of leverage, not because of need to rain in spend, but it just makes strategic sense. And then as you alluded here and there, there will be emerging market additions. But of course, as I often point out, another 100 salespeople in India don't cost anything like another 100 salespeople in the U.S. or Germany or somewhere like that."

And I've often stated that we believe that the introduction of VOLUMA to Canada probably increased the overall Canadian market. I just don't mean us, although we are by far, the market leader as company by 40%. Of course, that's absolutely huge. And now that we have the 1 mL format in Europe, when I look through all the markets, you can say this is the part of innovation, despite economic malaise in certain places. I think one when looks at BOTOX Cosmetic, it's interesting that it's going even faster than filler. In many markets, my theory is that there's equilibrium where one day, the neuromodulators and fillers will be somewhere around 50-50 mark. And then it's based on history, based on approval timings, relative strength of companies and so on. But certainly, very, very encouraging that the U.S. market continues to grow double-digit. And that, I'd like to think is due to the investments we put into training physicians, how to conduct these procedures to enable great results for their patients."

On the aesthetic side, as David committed, VOLUMA is just intrinsically innovative product wherever we juiced it into a 1 mL with lidocaine packaging. It's done well. That's sitting at the FDA. It's filed. I think it's a unique product, which is why FDA will look over it carefully, but the data are strong. And so that could be a very important launch in the United States for '13. As I commented earlier, we've got 2 products, unit dose LUMIGAN and unit dose can fourth helps our glaucoma franchise in Europe. So that's another important launch as well. And in terms of earlier stage data, again, you commented on the bimatoprost for scalp hairloss. We haven't made, until we have the data or we won't decide which meeting to submit that to. So we let you know once the abstracts are submitted. And then Q1, as we look at LATISSE globally, is Europe. So that was already filed.

And then, given my ophthalmology background, a lot of focus as well on our anti-VEGF DARPin program. And so there should be some data from our Phase II program next year as well. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the pipeline. And my guess is that, that will help and then my colleagues remind we as well that we have another file in on the aesthetic side, which is BOTOX for close feet.

In the second quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the second quarter 2011 by 8.7% to local currencies. And due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to virtually all of the world's currencie",2482,"Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In the second quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the second quarter 2011 by 8.7% to local currencies. And due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to virtually all of the world's currencies by 4.8% in dollars.
Year-to-date, we've been able to grow Allergan's total sales by 9.5% year-over-year in local currencies, despite challenges in the global economy. Benefiting from our global footprint, our international sales in the first half grew double digits in many businesses namely: Ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, BOTOX, dermal fillers and breast aesthetics. In fact, all of our consumer-facing businesses performed rather well so far this year. 
Regarding operating performance we generated in Q2, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07, marking an increase of 11.5% over the prior year and $0.01 over the top end of the range of expectations provided at our last earnings call. 
Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has increased 11.6% versus 2011. In the first half of the year, we have also continued to invest in the long-term success of Allergan, investing $457 million or 11.4% more on R&D on a non-GAAP basis. For a reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please consult our press release.
Now commenting on the performance of the individual businesses. Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales increased in Q2 versus the prior year at a slightly lower rate than normal, at 6.5% in local currencies and 1.9% in dollars, and with year-to-date growth at 9.1% to local currencies and 5.9% in dollars. 
The year-to-date growth in local currencies is more in line with the historical performance for this business. The Q2 growth rate was dampened by the U.S., which I'll comment further, while international sales grew in local currencies year-over-year, 11.0%, and year-to-date, 12.2%, with double-digit growth in all the 3 -- in all the x U.S. operating regions: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Canada. 
The IMS Global report for the first quarter of 2012, the last period for which data is available, shows Allergan growing in-market at 8% and outperforming Alcon, Novartis when one excludes the retina segment. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, the IMS reports shows Allergan gaining share strongly in glaucoma and in retina on a small base, as well as an uptick in share in artificial tears, driven by the recent launches of OPTIVE Advanced marketed as OPTIVE Plus outside the U.S. 
In the U.S., Q2 ex-factory sales growth was limited at 3.3% with year-to-date growth versus prior year at 6.9%. Per IMS, U.S. acquisition dollar sales growth year-to-date June was 11.8%. RESTASIS growth versus prior year per IMS continued on the strong trend, with quarter-to-date June growth of 16.1% and year-to-date growth at 14.1%, as more and more physicians recognize the value of treating dry eye symptoms early in the progression of this disease. 
LUMIGAN franchise performance merits closer commentary with a decline of 3.2% in Q2 in local currencies and year-to-date growth in local currencies at 1.8%. 
Ex-U.S., Q2 performance was strong, with LUMIGAN and GANFORT continuing to gain market share in all key markets and a decline in the U.S. due to increased commercial and Part D rebates, as well as a reduction in trade inventory.
Per IMS year-to-date, June, U.S. LUMIGAN sales increased year-over-year 16.2% in acquisition dollars and 3.5% in trailing prescriptions for retail and mail order. An analysis of the updated outlook for the LUMIGAN franchise for the second half of the year will demonstrate that we foresee renewed growth in the LUMIGAN franchise due primarily to the benefits of price increases in the U.S. 
Regarding the status of our 2013 contracts with CVS Caremark, I wish to provide a fact-based analysis. We lost our preferred status only on the commercial formulary, which is less important than the Part D formulary. A branded competitor offered a rebate structure, which did not make any financial sense for us. Plus, we do not like losing any account. This only amounts to less than a handful of share of overall LUMIGAN prescriptions in the United States and has been partially offset by another formulary win.
In summary, we believe that our overall formulary positions in 2013 will be broadly similar to those in 2012. Due to the excellent acceptance of LUMIGAN 0.01%, which accounts now for 61% to trailing prescriptions and is based on a superior profile relative to the original LUMIGAN, we announced this week that we plan to no longer manufacture LUMIGAN 0.03% by the end of 2012 for the United States market. 
In our outlook, we have factored in further U.S. LUMIGAN 0.03% inventory reduction between now and year end. Given the availability of generics of brimonidine, we're glad that the ALPHAGAN and COMBIGAN franchise continues to enjoy growth, both in the U.S. and worldwide. 
Rounding out my commentary on Ophthalmics, our Canadian business is growing strongly, driven by a strong uptick of RESTASIS, paid for by private insurance, as well as completion of the successful conversion of the LUMIGAN franchise to 0.01%, marketed as LUMIGAN RC in Canada. 
Successful launches in Mexico of LUMIGAN RC and Zypred have driven very strong growth this year. OZURDEX is performing particularly strongly in Europe. In June, the Scottish Medicines Consortium issued a positive coverage review. During the quarter, OZURDEX was launched in Mexico, Argentina, Singapore and Turkey. 
LASTACAFT is off to a strong start in Brazil. OPTIVE was launched in Venezuela and OPTIVE Plus in the U.K., Switzerland, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. The Spanish government has dereimbursed TEARS from August 1, which on the one hand, will introduce turbulence into the marketplace. On the other hand, based on other similar experiences in other markets, will give us opportunities as the clear market leader in Spain to position and price products on a premium.
Regarding BOTOX, we enjoyed a continuing ramp-up in sales. In Q2, the franchise grew 13.6% in local currencies and 10.2% in dollars, with double-digit local currency performance of both the cosmetic and therapeutic franchises.
The therapeutic franchise is clearly benefiting from the recently approved indications of Chronic Migraine, neurogenic overactive bladder, and in the U.S., upper limb spasticity. Since the last earnings call, we have received additional country approvals  for Chronic Migraine in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Costa Rica, Bahrain, Kuwait and Jordan. NICE in the U.K. issued its final guidance recommending use in the National Health Service for patients who have not responded to 3 prior preventative treatments and whose condition is appropriately managed for medication overuse. This means that the Primary Care Trusts in England and Wales have until the end of September to make funding and resources available for this patient group.
Regarding neurogenic bladder, we received additional approvals in Switzerland, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia, Panama, Egypt, Jordan and The Philippines. In Canada, we received a positive recommendation in the common drug review with action not to be taken by the individual provinces. Additionally, we filed an application to help Canada for approval of the idiopathic overactive bladder indication. 
BOTOX therapeutic growth was particularly strong in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. In Europe, we are impacted by government-mandated price cuts and low tender prices offered by some competitors, which have the effect of converting reasonable unit growth into low market growth and value. 
In the U.S., BOTOX therapeutic market share remains very high at over 93%, with the remaining 7% being shared by Dysport, Myobloc and Xeomin in descending order. The ramp in U.S. Chronic Migraine treatments continues on a strong trajectory. We have now trained approximately 5,800 individual physicians and have started to train pain specialists and a very targeted number of general practitioners with high indices, both migraine patients. 
Regarding access, 92% of all lives and commercial managed care plans now have some level of policy coverage. The volume of insurance verifications continues to rise and the number of denials to prior authorizations is on a declining trend. 
In a recent patient survey, over 60% of all patients reported being satisfied with their overall treatment regimen and over 90% stated that they would continue with BOTOX. 
In the core movement disorders area in the U.S., which includes the upper limb spasticity indication, we're growing in the low-double digits. Regarding the progress of the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we have trained approximately 1,800 individual physicians since launch. At the American Urology Association, there were many lectures in BOTOX and we received a considerable degree of interest. 
Regarding insurance access, 88% of commercial lives have some level of policy access: 93% of Medicare lives; and over 90% of Medicaid lives. Age and profile of spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients are quite different from one another. 
Trends in insurance verifications and denial rates are following the same pattern as in the commensurate time frame of the Chronic Migraine launch. 
Now moving over to the cosmetic side of the business. The U.S. return to growth in Q2 subsequent to Merz ceasing to ship product. Additionally, sales were boosted by both the BOTOX 10-year anniversary campaign as well as the Duet Dividends promotion, incentivizing consumers to use both JUVÉDERM and BOTOX Cosmetic. 
Based on our survey, we estimate that BOTOX had over 80% share in the quarter, moving up from a low point of 75% in the January to February time frame. In June, Xeomin still had a reported residual share of 2% as inventory has drained. 
In Q2, we estimate that the U.S. market grew double digit in volume. Outside the U.S., we benefited in Q2 from strong growth across a wide range of countries: in Latin America; Asia; and emerging markets in Europe, Africa, Middle East. 
Even some European countries performed well, offset by some market share loss in Southern Europe, where competition is still in their launch phases. 
Facial aesthetics. Sales rebounded from the weak ex-factory shipments in Q1, with Q2 sales increasing year-over-year by 23.5% in local currencies and 18.0% in dollars. Further to our commentary on the last earnings call, this was due to the timing of our Duet Dividends promotion in the U.S., which took place in Q2 in 2012 versus Q1 in 2011. Year-to-date sales increased 10.5% in local currencies and 6.9% in dollars.
In the U.S., we estimate that we had over 37% share, gaining over 100 basis points relative to Q2 of 2011. Year-to-date, overseas, we have enjoyed strong growth in many markets across Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe, Africa, Middle East. 
Even in Western Europe, we have recorded gratifying sales increases. This is explicable by the strong position acceptance of our new VOLUMA Plus lidocaine in a 1 mL syringe, which, in turn, has driven market share increases in Europe and also other markets where it is available. This category-leading product was also launched in Q2 in Australia and Korea. 
Breast aesthetics had another strong quarter, with Q2 sales increasing over Q2 of 2011 by 10.2% in local currencies, by 6.0% in dollars. Year-to-date growth was 14.0% in local currencies and 11.1% in dollars. All of our overseas regions, namely Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America recorded very strong growth.
In the wake of the PIP scandal in Europe, it is evident that many surgeons and their patients chose Allergan's implants for revision surgery, given that we are the clear market leader in Europe. While the rate of our sales increases have somewhat attenuated, we still have some great growth rates in many of the European countries, and surprisingly, robust sales in Southern Europe. 
In the U.S., we've seen good growth, not only in volume, but also we benefited from improvement in product mix, with higher price silicone gel products and tissue expanders. So far, the new competitor, Sientra, has only picked up limited share. In Korea, we received approval for the 410 shaped silicone gel implant range and we'll be commercializing this shortly. 
Our skin care franchise grew in Q2 9.8% year-over-year in local currencies and 9.3% in dollars. Year-to-date, 18.8% in local currencies and 18.5% in dollars over the prior year. ACZONE sales continued to increase rapidly, with acquisition dollar sales per IMS VONA increasing year-to-date 49%. ACZONE, even prior to the genericization of Duac, have become the clear market leader in the anti-inflammatory acne category. 
TAZORAC acquisition dollar sales increased year-to-date by 3%, with market share starting to pick up a little, given greater sales force attention. LATISSE Q2 sales increased year-over-year by 19.9% in local currencies and by 18.7% in dollars, benefiting particularly from a promotion in Q2 in the U.S. 
In the U.S., we received a summary judgment from the U.S. District Court in Orange County pursuant to an action for unfair competition that Athena's RevitaLash advanced eyelash conditioner is a drug and not a cosmetic. We're currently waiting for this federal judge's ruling regarding terms of an injunction. 
In response to the court's action, Athena has suspended domestic sales of this product. From a market analysis, we estimate that Athena had the highest share of the LATISSE in our comps [ph]. Continuing our process of innovation, we, today, introduced a 5 mL pack of LATISSE to the U.S. market, which should offer consumers greater convenience relative to the current 3 mL pack for achieving their goal of longer, darker and thicker lashes. We also launched LATISSE in Q2 in Taiwan and Russia. 
Sales of LATISSE continue to progress well in Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The SANCTURA urology franchise declined 31.4% in Q2 year-over-year and 19.0% year-to-date. In terms of in-market acquisition dollars, SANCTURA has declined 5.3% year-to-date. Since the district court finds our SANCTURA XR patents to be invalid, we have moved all commercial efforts in our urology team to the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic bladder. 
The obesity intervention line declined in Q2 year-over-year at 21.5% in local currencies, 24.1% in dollars, broadly in line with the past trend in constant currency. Year-to-date, the line declined 18.3% in local currencies and 19.9% in dollars. It is encouraging that the decline in the overall U.S. bariatric market is flattening, with the rate of decline in the last 3 months to May estimated at 2% compared to a 6% decline throughout the year 2011.
On the negative side, the share of banding has dropped from the low 40% in 2011 to 33% in May, with band losing to gains in sleeve gastrectomy, which had garnered a 31% share in May. 
Within bands, LAP-BAND enjoys a roughly 90% share. As commented for the last 6 months or so, we have directed considerable effort to improving reimbursement, with results expected in the new insurance policy year of 2013. 
So far, we've succeeded in improving bariatric policy in 41 million commercial lives. Clearly, in a time of high unemployment, high-patient co-pays are a barrier to even those patients who have insurance coverage. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment our financial performance and outlook."

During the second quarter of 2012, Allergan generated good operating results despite costs related to U.S. health care reform, ongoing overseas pricing pressures, somewhat choppy European economic",1009,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the second quarter of 2012, Allergan generated good operating results despite costs related to U.S. health care reform, ongoing overseas pricing pressures, somewhat choppy European economic environment and the challenges that accompany a stronger U.S. dollar environment.
Despite each of these challenges, the debt and breadth of our business and continued focus on rational expense management and thoughtfully directing investments allowed the company to achieve non-GAAP diluted earnings per share above the top end of our EPS guidance for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.07, marking an 11.5% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q2 2012 gross margin of 86.3% increased 20 basis points when compared to Q2 2011. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin is a continuation of favorable product mix on both a year-over-year basis and a sequential quarter basis. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio to the second quarter was 39%, totaling $572 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 40.2% and $563 million, respectively. This decrease in percentage of SG&A reflects our commitment to continuing to develop our leverageable and scalable business model as we undertake thoughtful evaluation to our structure and investments to ensure that they continue to generate positive financial returns while simultaneously maintaining a certain level of financial flexibility, which can be adjusted, if necessary, in response to changing circumstances. 
We continue to believe the Allergan's non-GAAP SG&A expense to product net sales ratio will be further leveraged in the second half of this year. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.8% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $232 million, an increase in spend of approximately $7 million over the first quarter of 2012 and nearly $20 million over the second quarter of 2011. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 54 days, a 3-day reduction from the first quarter result, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 117 days, a 5-day reduction from the first quarter result. 
In the second quarter, Allergan's operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $395 million. At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents in short-term investments and cash and equivalents in short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. 
With respect to stock repurchased, the company executed against the 10b5-1 plan involving approximately 6 million shares in the first half of 2012. This program has been extended into the second half of 2012 and we expect to repurchase an additional 4 million shares with a continued focus of offsetting the dilutive effect of share-based employee compensation plans.
With respect to our expectations, what we've provided today with our earnings release accounts for Allergan's current perspective on the state of the global economic environment and foreign currency markets for the remainder of 2012. 
While Allergan has produced good results during the first half of 2012, there are still a number of variables that may influence performance during the second half of the year, including potential movements within the macroeconomic environment and continued volatility of foreign exchange rates. Like many multinational companies, Allergan regularly monitors and measures the impact of foreign currency movements on our financial results. Although we have seen a meaningful strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most major foreign currencies in the recent past, we have a clear understanding of the value of this currency movement, and today, are comfortable with our ability to continue managing its impact. 
As a reminder, Allergan does maintain a hedging program that combines the natural hedges and offsets we have in place as a consequence of our structure, as well as the use of vanilla options to further limit our exposure to foreign currency movements. 
For the third quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,370,000,000  to $1,445,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.04. Regarding full year expectations for 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,650,000,000 and $5,800,000,000, and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $4.15 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%. 
Our product net sales expectations reflect a reduction of $50 million from the top end of the range provided within our previous expectations. This decision is attributable to a significant negative currency movement, both incurred and projected. We currently estimate a negative currency impact of approximately 3% to 4% on sales growth across the year. Also, we are reducing the top end of LUMIGAN franchise product net sales expectations by $30 million. 
This action is due primarily to currency headwinds, the previously discussed plan to discontinue LUMIGAN 0.03% in the U.S. and the related channel inventory reduction that will result from it and increased commercial and Part D rebates. 
Lastly, we are reducing the top end of the facial filler product net sales expectation by $30 million due to both currency headwinds and more modest market growth than was originally expected. Note, we estimate the U.S. filler market growth to be in the high-single-digit range in 2012. 
Consistent with our May 2012 expectations, we continue to expect full year pretax equivalent impact of approximately $110 million related to U.S. health care reform and $40 million in incremental overseas pricing pressure. 
In addition, as previously communicated, our 2012 expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. 
For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. So with that, operator, I would like now to open the call to questions."

I think if you listen to all of the facts I gave you regarding all those franchises, I think we can say the consumer is alive and well. If you think of, say, the U.S. market first, I gave data saying we believe that the neuromodulator market for aesthetic use is going double digit currently. Jeff, in his remarks, stated that we believe, for the full year 2012, the market will be going high-single digits. And when you think about the remarks I made about Europe, and clearly, that's the place that we do look very carefully, we have there some fabulous growth rates, even in the so-called old Europe, let alone, the new Europe or Russia or the Middle East and so on. And I think, really, what it's driven by is multiple factors. One is, if you look at the breast aesthetics market, which, we've often felt was a leading indicator for consumer behavior, given hopefully, it's a onetime decision or a decision for a long time, market very, very robust. And I think this is us as market leader benefiting from the problems of lack of quality of PIP, and clearly, we are, by far, the market leader. We believe we have just over 50% market share in Western Europe in breast implants. Then when I look through BOTOX Cosmetic or VISTABEL, those markets look healthy. And fillers, clearly, the market's good and we're picking up share due to innovation, which is really driven by VOLUMA, and most recently, the introduction of the new smaller-sized product, which is really appreciated not only by the doctors for ease of injection, but also speed and comfort by the patients. So when I look across the world, obviously, I'm looking very carefully for cracks in the wall, but things are pretty darn good and it's difficult to forecast years and years into the future. Otherwise, I should be working for the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England or somebody. But assuming things continue in this kind of mode, we would certainly like to reiterate our aspiration of mid-teens earnings per share growth."

Clearly, we have a commitment to pushing out the edges of the world to the few white spaces or the weaker spaces that we have. We're really pleased that Russia is off to a great start, our most recent venture. Also, we're very pleased that China really is beginning to hit its stride, both in medical aesthetics, but also ophthalmology. So all that's going pretty well and we continue to think about what could be the next markets we might add, really, probably, when you look at sort of the east of Europe and then headed out into Asia. Going back to the bigger question of M&A, clearly, we want to put our free cash flow to work. I think in our largest businesses, ophthalmology and medical aesthetics, a lot of opportunities come to us because clearly, anybody who wants an asset that might want to sell it or share it or partner it would think of us, and it's not altruism because in theory, we should be able to pay more for that asset than somebody else, given our strengths and our regional -- and our worldwide distribution. Where we're putting more effort the other way is really looking at neurosciences and urology, and one of the great things with our mix is that we can be fairly agnostic. It could be a drug, it could be a drug delivered in a device, or it might even be a device. So very clearly, we're pleased with our internal growth motors, but we'd like to supplement them using, frankly, our balance sheet and to intelligently acquire new sources of growth, where, we believe, we can add value in a meaningful way to the businesses we would license or acquire."

Well, I'd say the very high level units and price are very similar. Maybe a little bit of price pressure in Europe. We always have to pay attention where governments have mandated on the therapeutic side price declines. We have to keep an eye what is the differential between that and VISTABEL i.e. the aesthetic side because I think you're all very aware that -- I mean the same happens in United States with diversion. But in Europe, there's lots of parallel trading from lower-priced markets to higher-priced. So net-net, you can tell very healthy unit volume growth, which is reflected in my remarks because I did say in local currencies in Q2, both therapeutic as well as aesthetic, both grew double digits. Then in terms of new markets, the only one that's sort of been, I would say, a good filler this year has been Russia, given that we had a lower base in the prior year through a distributor. And clearly, prior to taking over the business, we wanted to make sure we controlled deliveries because otherwise, we all know when you take over businesses, often, people will have filled up the channel nicely for you, and we were able to tap down supply so that we, at least, didn't end up walking into an overstocked position when we start at the beginning of the year. So net-net, a very healthy unit growth. One last thought, many of you on the sales side, conduct surveys, and of course, I read them carefully. And I think in terms of same-store sales, maybe your surveys are accurate. But of course, what you can't measure is all the new people wanting to come into the marketplace because of course, many physicians are trying to escape the pressures of managed care and they'd much rather be in a nice business where the patients basically pay cash or credit card."

As I've often stated, from a very high level, in periods of dollar weakness, I encourage my colleagues to bring me a wish list. And the wish list has to have metrics on it, i.e. if I'm nice enough to give them $1 million, what will that do to drive both sales and bottom line? So it's almost like lining up with David's headwind, though, to stick to those jokes. So I do prefer my job. So -- and obviously, in times of dollar strength, the margin flips the other way. And frankly, we just start maybe tightening the belt a notch or maybe 2 in terms of things like travel and how many people go to medical conventions because, of course, at the very margin, those things may be over a 3- or 4-year, you could argue, have some difference. But in the short term, none at all. So now going to sort of the higher level, where you are saying when we look over the balance of this year and to next and where we'll potentially there could be increased expenditure. Well, on a very high level, not really because if you think about idiopathic overactive bladder, we've already created the BOTOX sales force for urology in the United States. And sadly, one says that we won't make any money on SANCTURA. But now we have soon -- we have more detail capacity, given that we're not spending any more time on SANCTURA. So that opens up space for idiopathic, which, hopefully, will be approved early-ish next year, 2013. In Europe, the margin, of course, as we're getting those approvals and get reimbursement, we're adding people. But it's kind of dozens and certainly, not hundreds. And if I go to your comment about fillers, basically, we have the sales force in place. And now we can just keep on adding products to the bag and move around what is our detail focus, if you like. And whether the sales force have been spending time on JUVÉDERM Ultra or hopefully, next year, VOLUMA doesn't make a lot of difference. You can just move around the capacity. And there is a real source of leverage, not because of need to rein in spend, but it just makes strategic sense. And then as you alluded here and there, there will be emerging market additions. But of course, as I often point out, another 100 salespeople in India don't cost anything like another 100 salespeople in the U.S. or Germany or somewhere like that."

Well, if one looks back over a year ago, I recollect what I was saying is that dermal fillers probably were going high teens then. I think that was still where we were benefiting from the innovation of lidocaine. And like everything, trees just don't keep growing to the sky, but I still think it's very healthy that the fillers market in the U.S. is growing healthily. And I think when we have the opportunity of introducing VOLUMA, that will create another huge wave of growth. And my closest market to draw the analogy from is Canada, and I've often stated that we believe that the introduction of VOLUMA to Canada probably increased the overall Canadian market. I don't just mean us, although we're, by far, the market leader as company by 40%. Of course, that's absolutely huge. And now that we have the 1 mL format in Europe, when I look through all the markets, you can say this is the power of innovation, despite economic malaise in certain places. I think when one looks at BOTOX Cosmetic, it's interesting that it's growing even faster than filler. In many markets, my theory is that there's an equilibrium where, one day, the neuromodulators and fillers will be somewhere around the 50-50 mark. And then it's based on history, based on approval timings, relative strength of companies and so on. But certainly, very, very encouraging that the U.S. market continues to grow double digit. And that, I'd like to think, is due to the investments we put into training physicians, how to conduct these procedures to enable great results for their patients."

We've presented some of the data, but more to come. But overall, the findings were very strong, and so, we will continue to roll out data. On the aesthetic side, as David commented, VOLUMA's just a terrifically innovative product wherever. We've introduced it in the 1 mL with lidocaine packaging. It's done well. That's sitting at the FDA. It's filed. I think it's a unique product, which is why FDA will look over it carefully, but the data are strong, and so, that could be a very important launch in the United States for '13. As I commented earlier, we've got 2 products: unit dose LUMIGAN; and unit dose GANFORT to help our glaucoma franchise in Europe. So that's another important launch as well. And in terms of earlier-stage data, again, you commented on the bimatoprost for scalp hairloss. We haven't made -- until we have the data, we won't decide which meeting to submit that to. So we'll let you know once the abstracts are submitted. And then Q1, as we look at LATISSE globally, is Europe. So that was already filed, and we're hoping to have approval late this year, early next year. So lots of approvals and launches. And then given my ophthalmology background, a lot of focus as well on our anti-VEGF DARPin program, and so, there should be some data from our Phase II program next year as well. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the pipeline, and my guess is that, that will help. And then my colleagues remind we as well that we have another file in on the aesthetic side, which is BOTOX for crow's feet. So again, what that allows us to do is expand physician training on label, which we focus on and also will give us publications and should help the BOTOX Cosmetic franchise, both in the U.S. and globally."

Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has increased 11.6% versus 2011. In the first half of the year, we have also continued to invest in the long-term success of Allergan, investing $457 million or 11.4% more on R&D on a non-GAAP basis. For a reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please consult our press release.
Now commenting on the performance of the individual businesses. Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales increased in Q2 versus the prior year at a slightly lower rate than normal, at 6.5% in local currencies and 1.9% in dollars, and with year-to-date growth at 9.1% to local currencies and 5.9% in dollars. 
The year-to-date growth in local currencies is more in line with the historical performance for this business. The Q2 growth rate was dampened by the U.S., which I'll comment further, while international sales grew in local currencies year-over-year, 11.0%, and year-to-date, 12.2%, with double-digit growth in all the 3 -- in all the x U.S. operating regions: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Canada. 
The IMS Global report for the first quarter of 2012, the last period for which data is available, shows Allergan growing in-market at 8% and outperforming Alcon, Novartis when one excludes the retina segment. Compared to the first quarter of 2011, the IMS reports shows Allergan gaining share strongly in glaucoma and in retina on a small base, as well as an uptick in share in artificial tears, driven by the recent launches of OPTIVE Advanced marketed as OPTIVE Plus outside the U.S. 
In the U.S., Q2 ex-factory sales growth was limited at 3.3% with year-to-date growth versus prior year at 6.9%. Per IMS, U.S. acquisition dollar sales growth year-to-date June was 11.8%. RESTASIS growth versus prior year per IMS continued on the strong trend, with quarter-to-date June growth of 16.1% and year-to-date growth at 14.1%, as more and more physicians recognize the value of treating dry eye symptoms early in the progression of this disease. 
LUMIGAN franchise performance merits closer commentary with a decline of 3.2% in Q2 in local currencies and year-to-date growth in local currencies at 1.8%. 
Ex-U.S., Q2 performance was strong, with LUMIGAN and GANFORT continuing to gain market share in all key markets and a decline in the U.S. due to increased commercial and Part D rebates, as well as a reduction in trade inventory.
Per IMS year-to-date, June, U.S. LUMIGAN sales increased year-over-year 16.2% in acquisition dollars and 3.5% in trailing prescriptions for retail and mail order. An analysis of the updated outlook for the LUMIGAN franchise for the second half of the year will demonstrate that we foresee renewed growth in the LUMIGAN franchise due primarily to the benefits of price increases in the U.S. 
Regarding the status of our 2013 contracts with CVS Caremark, I wish to provide a fact-based analysis. We lost our preferred status only on the commercial formulary, which is less important than the Part D formulary. A branded competitor offered a rebate structure, which did not make any financial sense for us. Plus, we do not like losing any account. This only amounts to less than a handful of share of overall LUMIGAN prescriptions in the United States and has been partially offset by another formulary win.
In summary, we believe that our overall formulary positions in 2013 will be broadly similar to those in 2012. Due to the excellent acceptance of LUMIGAN 0.01%, which accounts now for 61% to trailing prescriptions and is based on a superior profile relative to the original LUMIGAN, we announced this week that we plan to no longer manufacture LUMIGAN 0.03% by the end of 2012 for the United States market. 
In our outlook, we have factored in further U.S. LUMIGAN 0.03% inventory reduction between now and year end. Given the availability of generics of brimonidine, we're glad that the ALPHAGAN and COMBIGAN franchise continues to enjoy growth, both in the U.S. and worldwide. 
Rounding out my commentary on Ophthalmics, our Canadian business is growing strongly, driven by a strong uptick of RESTASIS, paid for by private insurance, as well as completion of the successful conversion of the LUMIGAN franchise to 0.01%, marketed as LUMIGAN RC in Canada. 
Successful launches in Mexico of LUMIGAN RC and Zypred have driven very strong growth this year. OZURDEX is performing particularly strongly in Europe. In June, the Scottish Medicines Consortium issued a positive coverage review. During the quarter, OZURDEX was launched in Mexico, Argentina, Singapore and Turkey. 
LASTACAFT is off to a strong start in Brazil. OPTIVE was launched in Venezuela and OPTIVE Plus in the U.K., Switzerland, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. The Spanish government has dereimbursed TEARS from August 1, which on the one hand, will introduce turbulence into the marketplace. On the other hand, based on other similar experiences in other markets, will give us opportunities as the clear market leader in Spain to position and price products on a premium.
Regarding BOTOX, we enjoyed a continuing ramp-up in sales. In Q2, the franchise grew 13.6% in local currencies and 10.2% in dollars, with double-digit local currency performance of both the cosmetic and therapeutic franchises.
The therapeutic franchise is clearly benefiting from the recently approved indications of Chronic Migraine, neurogenic overactive bladder, and in the U.S., upper limb spasticity. Since the last earnings call, we have received additional country approvals  for Chronic Migraine in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Costa Rica, Bahrain, Kuwait and Jordan. NICE in the U.K. issued its final guidance recommending use in the National Health Service for patients who have not responded to 3 prior preventative treatments and whose condition is appropriately managed for medication overuse. This means that the Primary Care Trusts in England and Wales have until the end of September to make funding and resources available for this patient group.
Regarding neurogenic bladder, we received additional approvals in Switzerland, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia, Panama, Egypt, Jordan and The Philippines. In Canada, we received a positive recommendation in the common drug review with action now to be taken by the individual provinces. Additionally, we filed an application to help Canada for approval of the idiopathic overactive bladder indication. 
BOTOX therapeutic growth was particularly strong in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. In Europe, we are impacted by government-mandated price cuts and low tender prices offered by some competitors, which have the effect of converting reasonable unit growth into low market growth and value. 
In the U.S., BOTOX therapeutic market share remains very high at over 93%, with the remaining 7% being shared by Dysport, Myobloc and Xeomin in descending order. The ramp in U.S. Chronic Migraine treatments continues on a strong trajectory. We have now trained approximately 5,800 individual physicians and have started to train pain specialists and a very targeted number of general practitioners with high indices, both migraine patients. 
Regarding access, 92% of all lives and commercial managed care plans now have some level of policy coverage. The volume of insurance verifications continues to rise and the number of denials to prior authorizations is on a declining trend. 
In a recent patient survey, over 60% of all patients reported being satisfied with their overall treatment regimen and over 90% stated that they would continue with BOTOX. 
In the core movement disorders area in the U.S., which includes the upper limb spasticity indication, we're growing in the low-double digits. Regarding the progress of the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we have trained approximately 1,800 individual physicians since launch. At the American Urology Association, there were many lectures in BOTOX and we received a considerable degree of interest. 
Regarding insurance access, 88% of commercial lives have some level of policy access: 93% of Medicare lives; and over 90% of Medicaid lives. Age and profile of spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients are quite different from one another. 
Trends in insurance verifications and denial rates are following the same pattern as in the commensurate time frame of the Chronic Migraine launch. 
Now moving over to the cosmetic side of the business. The U.S. return to growth in Q2 subsequent to Merz ceasing to ship product. Additionally, sales were boosted by both the BOTOX 10-year anniversary campaign as well as the Duet Dividends promotion, incentivizing consumers to use both JUVÉDERM and BOTOX Cosmetic. 
Based on our survey, we estimate that BOTOX had over 80% share in the quarter, moving up from a low point of 75% in the January to February time frame. In June, Xeomin still had a reported residual share of 2% as inventory has drained. 
In Q2, we estimate that the U.S. market grew double digit in volume. Outside the U.S., we benefited in Q2 from strong growth across a wide range of countries: in Latin America; Asia; and emerging markets in Europe, Africa, Middle East. 
Even some European countries performed well, offset by some market share loss in Southern Europe, where competition is still in their launch phases. 
Facial aesthetics. Sales rebounded from the weak ex-factory shipments in Q1, with Q2 sales increasing year-over-year by 23.5% in local currencies and 18.0% in dollars. Further to our commentary on the last earnings call, this was due to the timing of our Duet Dividends promotion in the U.S., which took place in Q2 in 2012 versus Q1 in 2011. Year-to-date sales increased 10.5% in local currencies and 6.9% in dollars.
In the U.S., we estimate that we had over 37% share, gaining over 100 basis points relative to Q2 of 2011. Year-to-date, overseas, we have enjoyed strong growth in many markets across Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe, Africa, Middle East. 
Even in Western Europe, we have recorded gratifying sales increases. This is explicable by the strong position acceptance of our new VOLUMA Plus lidocaine in a 1 mL syringe, which, in turn, has driven market share increases in Europe and also other markets where it is available. This category-leading product was also launched in Q2 in Australia and Korea. 
Breast aesthetics had another strong quarter, with Q2 sales increasing over Q2 of 2011 by 10.2% in local currencies, by 6.0% in dollars. Year-to-date growth was 14.0% in local currencies and 11.1% in dollars. All of our overseas regions, namely Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America recorded very strong growth.
In the wake of the PIP scandal in Europe, it is evident that many surgeons and their patients chose Allergan's implants for revision surgery, given that we are the clear market leader in Europe. While the rate of our sales increases have somewhat attenuated, we still have some great growth rates in many of the European countries, and surprisingly, robust sales in Southern Europe. 
In the U.S., we've seen good growth, not only in volume, but also we benefited from improvement in product mix, with higher price silicone gel products and tissue expanders. So far, the new competitor, Sientra, has only picked up limited share. In Korea, we received approval for the 410 shaped silicone gel implant range and we'll be commercializing this shortly. 
Our skin care franchise grew in Q2 9.8% year-over-year in local currencies and 9.3% in dollars. Year-to-date, 18.8% in local currencies and 18.5% in dollars over the prior year. ACZONE sales continued to increase rapidly, with acquisition dollar sales per IMS VONA increasing year-to-date 49%. ACZONE, even prior to the genericization of Duac, have become the clear market leader in the anti-inflammatory acne category. 
TAZORAC acquisition dollar sales increased year-to-date by 3%, with market share starting to pick up a little, given greater sales force attention. LATISSE Q2 sales increased year-over-year by 19.9% in local currencies and by 18.7% in dollars, benefiting particularly from a promotion in Q2 in the U.S. 
In the U.S., we received a summary judgment from the U.S. District Court in Orange County pursuant to an action for unfair competition that Athena's RevitaLash advanced eyelash conditioner is a drug and not a cosmetic. We're currently waiting for this federal judge's ruling regarding terms of an injunction. 
In response to the court's action, Athena has suspended domestic sales of this product. From a market analysis, we estimate that Athena had the highest share of the LATISSE knockoffs. Continuing our process of innovation, we, today, introduced a 5 mL pack of LATISSE to the U.S. market, which should offer consumers greater convenience relative to the current 3 mL pack for achieving their goal of longer, darker and thicker lashes. We also launched LATISSE in Q2 in Taiwan and Russia. 
Sales of LATISSE continue to progress well in Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The SANCTURA urology franchise declined 31.4% in Q2 year-over-year and 19.0% year-to-date. In terms of in-market acquisition dollars, SANCTURA has declined 5.3% year-to-date. Since the district court finds our SANCTURA XR patents to be invalid, we have moved all commercial efforts in our urology team to the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic bladder. 
The obesity intervention line declined in Q2 year-over-year at 21.5% in local currencies, 24.1% in dollars, broadly in line with the past trend in constant currency. Year-to-date, the line declined 18.3% in local currencies and 19.9% in dollars. It is encouraging that the decline in the overall U.S. bariatric market is flattening, with the rate of decline in the last 3 months to May estimated at 2% compared to a 6% decline throughout the year 2011.
On the negative side, the share of banding has dropped from the low 40% in 2011 to 33% in May, with bands losing to gains in sleeve gastrectomy, which had garnered a 31% share in May. 
Within bands, LAP-BAND enjoys a roughly 90% share. As commented for the last 6 months or so, we have directed considerable effort to improving reimbursement, with results expected in the new insurance policy year of 2013. 
So far, we've succeeded in improving bariatric policy in 41 million commercial lives. Clearly, in a time of high unemployment, high-patient co-pays are a barrier to even those patients who have insurance coverage. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment our financial performance and outlook."
249205,213653789,337122,"Allergan Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Allergan, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the second quarter of 2012, Allergan generated good operating results despite costs related to U.S. health care reform, ongoing overseas pricing pressures, somewhat choppy European economic",1009,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the second quarter of 2012, Allergan generated good operating results despite costs related to U.S. health care reform, ongoing overseas pricing pressures, somewhat choppy European economic environment and the challenges that accompany a stronger U.S. dollar environment.
Despite each of these challenges, the debt and breadth of our business and continued focus on rational expense management and thoughtfully directing investments allowed the company to achieve non-GAAP diluted earnings per share above the top end of our EPS guidance for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.07, marking an 11.5% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q2 2012 gross margin of 86.3% increased 20 basis points when compared to Q2 2011. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin is a continuation of favorable product mix on both a year-over-year basis and a sequential quarter basis. 
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio to the second quarter was 39%, totaling $572 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 40.2% and $563 million, respectively. This decrease in percentage of SG&A reflects our commitment to continuing to develop our leverageable and scalable business model as we undertake thoughtful evaluation to our structure and investments to ensure that they continue to generate positive financial returns while simultaneously maintaining a certain level of financial flexibility, which can be adjusted, if necessary, in response to changing circumstances. 
We continue to believe the Allergan's non-GAAP SG&A expense to product net sales ratio will be further leveraged in the second half of this year. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.8% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $232 million, an increase in spend of approximately $7 million over the first quarter of 2012 and nearly $20 million over the second quarter of 2011. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 54 days, a 3-day reduction from the first quarter result, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 117 days, a 5-day reduction from the first quarter result. 
In the second quarter, Allergan's operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $395 million. At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents in short-term investments and cash and equivalents in short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $2.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. 
With respect to stock repurchased, the company executed against the 10b5-1 plan involving approximately 6 million shares in the first half of 2012. This program has been extended into the second half of 2012 and we expect to repurchase an additional 4 million shares with a continued focus of offsetting the dilutive effect of share-based employee compensation plans.
With respect to our expectations, what we've provided today with our earnings release accounts for Allergan's current perspective on the state of the global economic environment and foreign currency markets for the remainder of 2012. 
While Allergan has produced good results during the first half of 2012, there are still a number of variables that may influence performance during the second half of the year, including potential movements within the macroeconomic environment and continued volatility of foreign exchange rates. Like many multinational companies, Allergan regularly monitors and measures the impact of foreign currency movements on our financial results. Although we have seen a meaningful strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most major foreign currencies in the recent past, we have a clear understanding of the value of this currency movement, and today, are comfortable with our ability to continue managing its impact. 
As a reminder, Allergan does maintain a hedging program that combines the natural hedges and offsets we have in place as a consequence of our structure, as well as the use of vanilla options to further limit our exposure to foreign currency movements. 
For the third quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,370,000,000  to $1,445,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.04. Regarding full year expectations for 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $5,650,000,000 and $5,800,000,000, and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $4.15 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%. 
Our product net sales expectations reflect a reduction of $50 million from the top end of the range provided within our previous expectations. This decision is attributable to a significant negative currency movement, both incurred and projected. We currently estimate a negative currency impact of approximately 3% to 4% on sales growth across the year. Also, we are reducing the top end of LUMIGAN franchise product net sales expectations by $30 million. 
This action is due primarily to currency headwinds, the previously discussed plan to discontinue LUMIGAN 0.03% in the U.S. and the related channel inventory reduction that will result from it and increased commercial and Part D rebates. 
Lastly, we are reducing the top end of the facial filler product net sales expectation by $30 million due to both currency headwinds and more modest market growth than was originally expected. Note, we estimate the U.S. filler market growth to be in the high-single-digit range in 2012. 
Consistent with our May 2012 expectations, we continue to expect full year pretax equivalent impact of approximately $110 million related to U.S. health care reform and $40 million in incremental overseas pricing pressure. 
In addition, as previously communicated, our 2012 expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. 
For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. So with that, operator, I would like now to open the call to questions."

We believe we have just over 50% market share in Western Europe in breast implants. Then when I look through BOTOX Cosmetic or VISTABEL, those markets look healthy. And fillers, clearly, the market's good and we're picking up share due to innovation, which is really driven by VOLUMA, and most recently, the introduction of the new smaller-sized product, which is really appreciated not only by the doctors for ease of injection, but also speed and comfort by the patients. So when I look across the world, obviously, I'm looking very carefully for cracks in the wall, but things are pretty darn good and it's difficult to forecast years and years into the future. Otherwise, I should be working for the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England or somebody. But assuming things continue in this kind of mode, we would certainly like to reiterate our aspiration of mid-teens earnings per share growth."

Well, first of all, clearly, we're benefiting from the wave of approvals we had in 2009 and '10, and now our job is to internationalize those approvals, which, when you just think about the long list of countries I give you, clearly, is occurring. Clearly, we have a commitment to pushing out the edges of the world to the few white spaces or the weaker spaces that we have. We're really pleased that Russia is off to a great start, our most recent venture. Also, we're very pleased that China really is beginning to hit its stride, both in medical aesthetics, but also ophthalmology. So all that's going pretty well and we continue to think about what could be the next markets we might add, really, probably, when you look at sort of the east of Europe and then headed out into Asia. Going back to the bigger question of M&A, clearly, we want to put our free cash flow to work. I think in our largest businesses, ophthalmology and medical aesthetics, a lot of opportunities come to us because clearly, anybody who wants an asset that might want to sell it or share it or partner it would think of us, and it's not altruism because in theory, we should be able to pay more for that asset than somebody else, given our strengths and our regional -- and our worldwide distribution. Where we're putting more effort the other way is really looking at neurosciences and urology, and one of the great things with our mix is that we can be fairly agnostic. It could be a drug, it could be a drug delivered in a device, or it might even be a device. So very clearly, we're pleased with our internal growth motors, but we'd like to supplement them using, frankly, our balance sheet and to intelligently acquire new sources of growth, where, we believe, we can add value in a meaningful way to the businesses we would license or acquire."

Well, I'd say the very high level units and price are very similar. Maybe a little bit of price pressure in Europe. We always have to pay attention where governments have mandated on the therapeutic side price declines. We have to keep an eye what is the differential between that and VISTABEL i.e. the aesthetic side because I think you're all very aware that -- I mean the same happens in United States with diversion. But in Europe, there's lots of parallel trading from lower-priced markets to higher-priced. So net-net, you can tell very healthy unit volume growth, which is reflected in my remarks because I did say in local currencies in Q2, both therapeutic as well as aesthetic, both grew double digits. Then in terms of new markets, the only one that's sort of been, I would say, a good filler this year has been Russia, given that we had a lower base in the prior year through a distributor. And clearly, prior to taking over the business, we wanted to make sure we controlled deliveries because otherwise, we all know when you take over businesses, often, people will have filled up the channel nicely for you, and we were able to tap down supply so that we, at least, didn't end up walking into an overstocked position when we start at the beginning of the year. So net-net, a very healthy unit growth. One last thought, many of you on the sales side, conduct surveys, and of course, I read them carefully. And I think in terms of same-store sales, maybe your surveys are accurate. But of course, what you can't measure is all the new people wanting to come into the marketplace because of course, many physicians are trying to escape the pressures of managed care and they'd much rather be in a nice business where the patients basically pay cash or credit card."

I'd say when you really sort of think about all the comments I made, probably the biggest single item to think about is: a, foreign exchange impact, which, you could say to some degree, isn't real, it's just translating foreign currencies into dollars; secondly is inventory reduction, particularly in Q2.

It's a different type of patient in terms of the amount of -- the number of pounds or kilos they want to lose, and I think that well touches much more diet change and exercise.

And frankly, we just start maybe tightening the belt a notch or maybe 2 in terms of things like travel and how many people go to medical conventions because, of course, at the very margin, those things may be over a 3- or 4-year, you could argue, have some difference. But in the short term, none at all. So now going to sort of the higher level, where you are saying when we look over the balance of this year and to next and where we'll potentially there could be increased expenditure. Well, on a very high level, not really because if you think about idiopathic overactive bladder, we've already created the BOTOX sales force for urology in the United States. And sadly, one says that we won't make any money on SANCTURA. But now we have soon -- we have more detail capacity, given that we're not spending any more time on SANCTURA. So that opens up space for idiopathic, which, hopefully, will be approved early-ish next year, 2013. In Europe, the margin, of course, as we're getting those approvals and get reimbursement, we're adding people. But it's kind of dozens and certainly, not hundreds. And if I go to your comment about fillers, basically, we have the sales force in place. And now we can just keep on adding products to the bag and move around what is our detail focus, if you like. And whether the sales force have been spending time on JUVÉDERM Ultra or hopefully, next year, VOLUMA doesn't make a lot of difference. You can just move around the capacity. And there is a real source of leverage, not because of need to rein in spend, but it just makes strategic sense. And then as you alluded here and there, there will be emerging market additions.

Well, if one looks back over a year ago, I recollect what I was saying is that dermal fillers probably were going high teens then. I think that was still where we were benefiting from the innovation of lidocaine. And like everything, trees just don't keep growing to the sky, but I still think it's very healthy that the fillers market in the U.S. is growing healthily. And I think when we have the opportunity of introducing VOLUMA, that will create another huge wave of growth. And my closest market to draw the analogy from is Canada, and I've often stated that we believe that the introduction of VOLUMA to Canada probably increased the overall Canadian market. I don't just mean us, although we're, by far, the market leader as company by 40%. Of course, that's absolutely huge. And now that we have the 1 mL format in Europe, when I look through all the markets, you can say this is the power of innovation, despite economic malaise in certain places. I think when one looks at BOTOX Cosmetic, it's interesting that it's growing even faster than filler. In many markets, my theory is that there's an equilibrium where, one day, the neuromodulators and fillers will be somewhere around the 50-50 mark. And then it's based on history, based on approval timings, relative strength of companies and so on. But certainly, very, very encouraging that the U.S. market continues to grow double digit. And that, I'd like to think, is due to the investments we put into training physicians, how to conduct these procedures to enable great results for their patients."

We've presented some of the data, but more to come. But overall, the findings were very strong, and so, we will continue to roll out data. On the aesthetic side, as David commented, VOLUMA's just a terrifically innovative product wherever we've introduced it in the 1 mL with lidocaine packaging, it's done well. That's sitting at the FDA. It's filed. I think it's a unique product, which is why FDA will look over it carefully, but the data are strong, and so, that could be a very important launch in the United States for '13. As I commented earlier, we've got 2 products: unit dose LUMIGAN; and unit dose GANFORT to help our glaucoma franchise in Europe. So that's another important launch as well. And in terms of earlier-stage data, again, you commented on the bimatoprost for scalp hairloss. We haven't made -- until we have the data, we won't decide which meeting to submit that to. So we'll let you know once the abstracts are submitted. And then Q1, as we look at LATISSE globally, is Europe. So that was already filed, and we're hoping to have approval late this year, early next year. So lots of approvals and launches. And then given my ophthalmology background, a lot of focus as well on our anti-VEGF DARPin program, and so, there should be some data from our Phase II program next year as well. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the pipeline, and my guess is that, that will help. And then my colleagues remind we as well that we have another file in on the aesthetic side, which is BOTOX for crow's feet. So again, what that allows us to do is expand physician training on label, which we focus on and also will give us publications and should help the BOTOX Cosmetic franchise, both in the U.S. and globally."

Before we start, we wish to express our concerns and also our regrets for all of you in the eastern states who have been suffering through the Superstardom Sandy. We're so sorry that millions of people's have lost their power, and we sincerely hope that conditions will normalize as soon as possible. 
After careful deliberation, we decided to go ahead with this call as scheduled to avoid the pile up of earnings that will almost certainly occur later this week after the market reopens. So getting down to the business.
In the third quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the third quarter 2011 by 9.4% to local currencies. And due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, relative to most of the world's currencies by 6.1% in dollars.
With current foreign exchange rates, the difference between local currency and dollar sales growth rates should be less in Q4. Year-to-date, Allergan's total sales have grown by 9.5% in local currencies and by 6.6% in dollars, in spite of the challenges in the global economy. 
In the European region, we're very pleased with our consumer-facing businesses performed strongly in the quarter. In our press release, we commented that we're exploring strategic options for the obesity intervention business, as the sales dynamics did not fit the profile of a high-growth company like Allergan. Vigorous management of our portfolio of businesses has always been integral to our strategy.
Regarding operating performance. We generated in Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.06, marking an increase of 15.2%, even with strong currency pressure and 2 pennies over the top end of the range of expectations provided at the time of our last earnings call.
Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has increased 13.3%. During the year, we pursued our long-term strategy of strengthening our R&D pipeline, an example of which is the broadening of our licensing agreement with Molecular Partners in Zürich for potential jewel anti-VEGF PDGF-B DARPin. 
Year-to-date, we'd invested $688 million in R&D on a non-GAAP basis, marking an increase of 8.9%. For reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please consult our press release. 
We plan to invest over $1 billion in R&D in 2013, and we opened a new R&D center for clinical development and biostatistics in Bridgewater, New Jersey. 
Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX sales in Q3 increased 11.5% in local currencies and 8.8% in dollars, with year-to-date growth of 11.9% in local currencies and 9.5% in dollars. Both the aesthetic and therapeutic businesses grew double-digit in Q3 in local currencies. 
In Q2, the last quarter for which we have global market data available, we estimate that the world market for neuromodulators grew 12% year-over-year and the global BOTOX share was stable, with share gains in the therapeutic segment being offset by share losses in aesthetics.
The U.S. therapeutic business continued than a strong growth trajectory, driven by chronic migraine, neurogenic bladder and Opryland specificity. BOTOX sales in Europe have been affected by a broad array of government measures to reduce healthcare expenses, such as mandated price reductions, tenders to squeeze prices, as well as measures to restrict patient access.
In fact, the therapeutic side has been a greater challenge in Europe than the issues we have with consumer spending on medical aesthetics procedures. 
Since the last earnings call, we had additional country approvals. For chronic migraine in Serbia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Egypt and Oman and for neurogenic overactive bladder in the U.K., the Netherlands, Malta, Turkey, Poland, Korea, Vietnam, Qatar and New Zealand. BOTOX therapeutic growth was particularly strong in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. In the U.S., the REMS for chronic migraine upper limb spasticity and neurogenic bladder continue on strong trajectories. All the metrics for long-term establishment to the chronic migraine franchise are positive. Access is virtually complete, with 93% of all commercial lines enjoying policy coverage. 
Patients with about access are at a very low level and are on a declining trend. Since the last earnings report, we have trained 200 more individual physicians. Focus is now on deepening the level of training in local live sessions and preceptorships rather than just training the noble injectors, as well as the goal of increasing injector productivity. 
Our investments in both branded and nonbranded DTC campaigns for BOTOX for chronic migraine are driving patients to our websites for information about the condition and also, where to find the headache specialist. 
In terms of patient satisfaction, only 19% of treated patients feel that their headaches are very severe or extremely severe after BOTOX treatment. We are pleased that in the recent physician survey, Allergan is now perceived as the number one company in migraine management by physicians.
Overall BOTOX U.S. therapeutic market share continues to rise, given the strong growth in the new indications, where BOTOX is the sole approved product. In July, U.S. share was close to 95%, with the remaining 5% being shared by Dysport, Xeomin and Myobloc, in descending order. On the cervical dystonia submarket, where we have 2 licensed competitors, BOTOX has also been gaining share in the course of the last 12 months and we estimate that BOTOX in July held 86% of this market.
Regarding the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we're also making excellent progress. Regarding access, we've acknowledged a very favorable level. Some level of policy coverage exists in 88% of commercial lines and for 100% of all Medicare carriers and almost 100% of Medicaid lives.
Agent profile of spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients were quite different. The number of patients without access is on a declining trend. Since launch, we have trained over 2,000 individual physicians. At the October meeting of the American Euro Gynecological Society, there was positive data presented on a study conducted by NIH on the use of BOTOX and anti-pelagics neurogenic bladder. Results of this study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Both for chronic migraine and the injection into the bladder, we're awaiting actions by CMS for their 2013 payment schedules for specific treatment holds. 
On the aesthetic side of the business, we enjoyed strong growth in all operating regions of the world. In the U.S., we estimate that the market in Q3 grew double-digits in volume. Based on our survey data, we estimate that BOTOX in Q3 increased its share to 82% at the expense of both Dysport and Xeomin. The latter, which still have the residual 2% share.
In fact, BOTOX have the same share as in Q3 2011 before Xeomin came onto the market. As commented in our press release, the injunction prohibiting Merz for commercializing Xeomin remains in place for aesthetics until January 9, 2013. 
In Europe, we estimate that the aesthetic neuromodulator market was flat in Western Europe and that we have halted our market share losses as a result of launches of Bocouture and Azzalure in new markets.
Overall, double-digit growth in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region was driven by Eastern Europe and emerging markets. 
From the fourth quarter, we're monitoring the effect of new taxes. In France, the government has imposed a 20% VAT of medical aesthetics procedures. And in Spain, the rate was increased from 8% to 21%. In Asia Pacific, we're recording strong growth across virtually all markets, with exceptional performance in China and Japan. In Australia, we're dealing with the launch of Azzalure by Galderma, which is heavily discounting their product. And in Korea, with several local competitive nueromodulators.
Facial aesthetic sales grew 5.0% in local currencies versus Q3 of 2011 and 0.8% in dollars. This was caused by a double-digit decline in U.S. ex-factory sales, offset by massive growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada. The U.S. decline is due to the timing of a Duet Dividend promotion in Q3 2011, as well as the benefits of the ongoing transition at that time to JUVÉDERM with Lidocaine. 
In fact, the U.S. in Q3 2011 had over 40% growth versus Q3 of 2010. Hence, the comps that I mentioned. Ex-U.S., we're benefiting from the launch of the Wilma, which stimulated growth in the overall market and additionally, from good growth from basic JUVÉDERM. In the U.S., we estimate that the market in Q3 grew low-single digits in volume. 
In terms of market share, we estimate that JUVÉDERM is market leader, enjoyed 36% share in Q3, down one share point from Q3 2011, due to the launch of Le-Tourneau by Merz, which had garnered 8% share in Q3. Most of Belateroz gain came at the expense of the RESTALIN franchise, which we gauge to be at 31%. 
From October, the Wilma and a new 1 mL package is now available in Brazil and Colombia. Year-to-date, facial aesthetic sales have increased 8.7% in local currencies. We estimate that the world market in Q2, the last period for which we have data available, increased about 6% year-over-year. The market in the European Union also grew about 6%, which is positive, given the economic situation.
Almost all of this growth in EU was driven by Juviderm and Wilma, even with a very large number of competitive products being available. Breast aesthetics sales increased 7.1% in local currencies and 3.4% in dollars. Gulf was strong in the U.S. and Latin America. The Q3 growth rate was slightly lower than in the first 2 quarters, due to the attenuation of growth in Europe, as the market share benefits of the aftermath of the PIP scandal wear off. 
Q3 ex- factory growth was dampened by the timing of sales to certain distributors in Latin America and Asia. In Europe, based on industry data, Q2 growth in implant procedures in the top 5 markets was over 7% with, a substantial share gains for Allergan. 
For Q2, the last state of for which -- the last period for which data is available, we estimate worldwide market growth in value at about 4%, which points to our share gains. The shift anatomical 4 10 line was approved in Korea and was recently launched with good acceptance by surgeons.
Our natural round silicon gel implants and tissue expanders were approved in Japan and will be launched in early 2013. We are the sole manufacturer with the Japanese Ministry approval. 
In the U.S., we've been able to hold unit market share, in spite of the unit -- the entry of Sientra into the markets and price discounting by Mentor and have been able to migrate products to higher value silicone gel and tissue expanders.
Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales in Q3 were strong, increasing 12.5% in local currencies versus Q3 of 2011 and 8.4% in dollars. Year-to-date, sales ex- factory increased year-over-year, 10.2% in local currencies, with both U.S. and international growth at just over 10%. This growth rate correlates with the end market growth reported by IMS Global for the 6 months up to June also at 10%. 
The IMS Q2 report, the last period for which data is available, list out the world market growing by 7%, boosted by retinal therapeutics and dampened by latanoprost generics.
In this data Q2, Allergan growth by 10%. Allergan is gaining share with RESTASIS in glaucoma, retina and artificial tears. RESTASIS is now the number 2 ophthalmic product worldwide by value after LATISSE. In the U.S., we are pleased to report RESTASIS growing in Q3. Year-over-year, 19.7% in local currencies. 
Since the end of Q2, there's been an acceleration in the growth trend line, with volume growth being reported by IMS at over 10%. We ascribe this to the effectiveness of our TV campaign, growing medical awareness that drive ice disease, deepening patient education, the chronic dry eye as a disease and enthusiasm for the product by optometrist. 
RESTASIS is also the fastest-growing ophthalmic product in Canada. The LUMIGAN franchise rebounded with 8.2% growth in Q3 in local currency after the weak ex-factory sales in Q2. In the U.S., acquisition dollar growth for LUMIGAN in Q3 year-over-year, as reported by IMS, was 18%, with most of this attributable to price with only a small gain in volume.
LUMIGAN is holding up better than competitive products from the impact of latanoprost generics, due to its differentiated profile and perception is the most potent of the broad class. However, the impact of latanoprost generics is greater than we had originally anticipated.
After our August announcement that we will discontinue the manufacture of LUMIGAN 0.03% for the U.S. market by the end of 2012, we are pleased that already over 70% of new prescriptions are being written for the improved 0.01% product. Obviously, this decision reduce sales ex-factory in 2013, as we are now reducing overall trade inventory of LUMIGAN before year-end.
Regarding 2013 former coverage, were almost all contract negotiations have been concluded, LUMIGAN will enjoy similar status to the 2012 contracts with losses being broadly offset by gains. 
In Europe, LUMIGAN is widening its share leadership versus the Travatan franchise. In the U.K., Allergan is, for the first time, the number one company in glaucoma. In Spain, we have launched Optava as a reimbursed pharmaceutical third quarter, which will mitigate the impact that all other reimbursed tears have been dereimbursed by the Spanish government. 
In France, OZURDEX received a positive reimbursement assessment for uveitis. In Asia, we're enjoying strong growth into India and China both due to overall market growth, as well as the introduction of both international, as well as local Allergan products. 
Our skin care franchise grew 11.7% in local currencies and 11.4% in dollars versus Q3 of 2011. ACZONE sales continue to grow rapidly, with acquisition dollar sales per IMS VONA increasing year-over-year in the quarter 57% and year-to-date at 52%.
In September, ACZONE enjoy 21.7% share in the dermatology channel and the widening absolute leadership position in the anti-inflammatory acne category. TAZORAC sales per IMS VONA declined by 4% year-over-year in the quarter and were flat year-to-date.
LATISSE sales in the quarter grew 7.9% in local currencies and 7.2% in dollars, with good performance in the U.S. Thanks to favorable physician and patient response to our new 5 mL packaging presentation and pricing. 
Our press release comments the status of unfair competition action against Athena and its product, RevitaLash advanced eyelash conditioner. We have information that Athena may be resuming shipments of RevitaLash to all states with the exception of California and Tennessee. We're evaluating our options for further legal action against Athena and a few other companies, who are marketing unapproved eyelash growth products.
In Europe, we with drew our LATISSE Marketing Authorization Application from a decentralized procedure. We plan to submit the application in individual EU countries to optimize the product label. 
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment our financial performance and outlook."

We appreciate that you guys have made the effort to join us and hope all is well.

We appreciate that you guys have made the effort to join us and hope all is well. 
During the third quarter of 2012, Allergan generated solid operating results, despite the increasing cost related to U.S. Health Care Reform, ongoing overseas pricing pressure and uncertain European economic environment in the challenges that accompany a stronger you saw environment. As in the past, we benefited from our natural hedges with overseas manufacturing and also foreign exchange option contracts. Despite these challenges, the company achieve non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.02 above the top end of our EPS guidance for the quarter.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.06, marking a 15.2% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2012 gross margin of 86.4% increased 70 basis points when compared to Q3 2011. This increase in gross margin was driven primarily by favorable product and geographic mix, despite continuing pricing pressures we're experiencing around the world.
The non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses to product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 38.6% and totaling $537 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 39.4% and $517 million, respectively. 
As we continue to diligently work to offset the increasing cost in the U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing pressures, consistent with our planning comments of investment committee, we are recognizing that an effective average of our Stallman of our markets. Our ongoing focus to try to investments title the projects we have been publicly risk adjustment for economic risks and traditional market and execution risks. Consistent with our historic trends, you should anticipate that for the reduction in non-GAAP SG&A expense to net sales ratio in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.6% of product net sales for the quarter totaling $231 million and increasing spend of approximately $10 million over the third quarter of 2011. 
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 57 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 128 days. In the quarter decile levels were slightly higher than our Q2 2012 levels, due primarily to the timing of the quarter end and our efforts to accommodate specific distributor requests. 
End of quarter DOH levels reflects the higher than prior quarter, primarily due to preparation for various product launches around the world, so it's a shift -- shipping methods from air to ocean and for certain emerging markets. 
In the third quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $421 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $1 billion. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents and short-term investments in cash and equivalents in short term investments net of debt positions totaled $2.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. 
We currently project capital expenditures of between $150 million and $200 million for the full year of 2012.
For the fourth quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,470,000,000 to $1,545,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.20. 
Regarding full year expectations for 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales ranges of $5,695,000,000 and $5,770,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $4.17 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%. 
Our product net sales expectations reflect the reduction of $13 million from the top end of this range provided with our previous expectations. This is primarily attributable to the external events, such as increasing U.S. Health Care Reform; overseas pricing pressure; and the fourth quarter generic impact of SANCTURA XR. We currently estimate an increase in U.S. healthcare reform of approximately $10 million, primarily due to an increase in our coverage GAAP or donut hole exposure. Increasing European austerity measures are expected to lead to an addition of approximately $5 million overseas pricing pressure and the generatization of SANCTURA XR in the fourth quarter is expected to have an approximate $10 million impact. As a reminder, SANCTURA XR profitability is negligible.
As previously communicated, our 2012 expectations assume that U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012 with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. 
Our current estimate of the full year earnings per share impact is between $0.05 and $0.06. One of our key drivers budget success has been the continues evaluation of the performance of business to ensure that they're delivering high growth. 
During the past few years, the entire obesity intervention market has faced challenges as a result of economic conditions and reimbursement limitations. Earlier in the year, we committed to improving the reimbursement conditions for LAP-BAND. We've been able to reduce the wait time for surgery by reducing time patients must undergo medically manage weight-loss. Now 63% of commercial lives or 120 million patients have this benefit in their policies, an increase of 22 million lives just this year. 
While we are confident in the long-term prospects of the business, we also must consider the best potential fee future development and clinical advancement makes this outside of the company. Moreover, Allergan's business model strategy emphasizes the importance of leverage and scalability. It is clear to us today that Allergan will have have the same ability to achieve the strategic business it is not there today. That Allergan will have the same ability to achieve the strategic business. Therefore, we're exploring strategic options, including among other things, a potential sale of the business unit. 
For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. So that, operator, I'd now like to open the call to questions."

And I think where we really felt that difference was the pullback and spend an effort on Dysport. And I think that was a realization that the share was beginning to cost. We always felt that they wouldn't really get much beyond 20%. And based on all the numbers I gave you today, it seems to be settling down in the kind of the mid-teens kind of range.

You're quite right to put your finger on the fact that it's Europe, and it's more on the therapeutic side than the aesthetic slide, which seems initially surprising, If you you'd asked me that question 2 years ago, I would have got it the wrong way around. You think the consumer would be the problem, I don't think that's the case. I was just looking at my numbers for the consumer-facing businesses again. And while, Southern Europe is fantastic. If we can only get rid of this recession one day, we're going to be having a wonderful time in Southern Europe, when they really have money to spend. So really, it's the pressures on the therapeutic side. I think you can see that in other companies across the medical device industry, anything that's hospital-based, it's really tough in Europe. Governments are literally turning off the lights in the operating rooms earlier in the day when the money is running tight. Luckily, of course, we're not we expose that much to the hospital.

And so that's their flywheel we're working on.  And in the second part, though, is partially that's new for us is to be here from some portion of neurologists, where their greatest results and satisfaction they have from using BOTOX is they say, ""I don't want to be doing or exaggerate to make my point. BOTOX 5 days a week. "" I do other things as on urologists. And that's where we want to improve the procedures in the office so that they can just move the patients through, in a good way, with quality, but faster. And of course, that then applies the learnings we've made in the aesthetics business over the years, where you can still have a quality outcome and feeling about the procedure, but you can really move up the number of patients per day. Also, what we see is some urologists when the reaching the limit that they decide that as a number they want to do, some of them are referred to other colleagues in the community that are frequently pain specialists that are very procedure-oriented and are willing to take up the slack. So where that kind of partnership opportunity sits, we're very happy to put these 2 physicians because it's always 2 individuals or 2 group practices together."

And at the time, if I restrict my comment to the U.S. first of all, we didn't realize that a lot of that was not only cash pay, but actually, it was credit cards pay. And so of course, with hindsight, that market, which at the peak was about 1/3 of our U.S. sales, has really shriveled down to a very negligible part. So I think the next part of the thinking then came in, and that was me commitment over 1 year ago to you on the sell side, as well as the investment community on the buy side. But our job is to improve reimbursement conditions. And as you heard from Jeff's remarks, we have made progress. But then, comes to they will kind of what I would call it a tough call. Clearly, you know as a company, we're very committed to high growth. And we've been able to do that. So a business like this, which is going the wrong direction, is a drag on that overall growth rate. Now I come to the point about leverageability and scalability. If you think of all of the business areas we're in, ophthalmology and medical aesthetics being very clear, we have a very broad range of products. So we often have multiple sales forces presenting multiple products. And of course, that gives you the benefits of scale. If you look at the general surgery market, where we're present with LAP-BAND, it's basically a one product entry. And as we've looked at alternatives, that would take us deeper into general surgery, which would be fine, but usually, those products are associated with lower gross margin than the ones we have. So really ending the whole stream of thought, it may make better sense, either for another company that one would call a strategic to LAP-BAND and order overseas, which is the intragastric balloon, to their portfolio, or it could make sense for a private equity firm to acquire this business because, of course, it's profitable, it's cash generative, it has a great brand name, has very good intellectual property. And finally, of course, just to make it clear, we are assessing the sale because everything comes down to numbers at the end of the day. And so, as you know, we could always, if you don't get the numbers we like, choose just to keep this business and run it in a different way."

Well, you're quite right because you're point to some of the elements in terms of things that will be boosters of growth. I think you can very clearly feel that the migraine launch in the neurogenic bladder launch and upper limb spasticity in U.S. are doing very well. We want to really repeat that experience particularly in Europe. One quick remark about Europe, although I'm very dutiful reporting when we get product approvals, the delay between approval dates and reimbursement date in many countries can be well over one year. And then due to further access impediments, governments throughout, it can even spread out maybe another 0.5 year. So Europe, we're looking for some good growth in this new indications in 2013 and '14. Scott Whitcup, clearly talks about the bigger opportunity in neurology which is idiopathic bladder. He talks about VOLUMA. He -- those are probably the big ones in terms of what I'll call short-term horizon approvals. Then on the negative side, clearly, we factored in when Xeomin comes back on the aesthetic side, we have to lose some share. And that's clear. We're Sanguin. Obviously, we don't want to loose much. And then, I would say, when you look at Centura, it's a pretty small product. And more importantly, as Jeff remarked, really due to royalty obligations, really didn't produce any bottom line growth talking about. One other item, which is, although your questions were really more directed to sales, just as a reminder, we have to pick up the device tax in 2013 for us as a company, it's not that big. Obviously, we're not just a med device company. But that's something we will just suck up. And hopefully, you won't really feel that at all when we come up with our guidance or our outlook, which will be in early February shortly -- at the time of our next earnings call.

In terms of bimatoprost for scalp hair growth, we'll finish all the analysis, hopefully, early next year. We've said consistently that we, to be commercially successful with an Rx product, need to be better than minoxidil, which is now generic. So we'll look at those data. For substantially better, we would consider going to Phase III. If we are not, what I've said is that we can potentially go higher on the dose and we would then consider doing a Phase IIb with a higher dose. Because I think to be commercially successful, we need to be differentiated from minoxidil. Again, I don't think we would communicate those other than you'll see the data at a medical meeting.

Before we start, we wish to express our concerns and also our regrets for all of you in the eastern states who have been suffering through the superstorm Sandy. We're so sorry that millions of people have lost their power, and we sincerely hope that conditions will normalize as soon as possible.
After careful deliberation, we decided to go ahead with this call as scheduled to avoid the pile-up of earnings that will almost certainly occur later this week after the market reopens.
So getting down to the business. In the third quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the third quarter of 2011 by 9.4% to local currencies and, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most of the world's currencies, by 6.1% in dollars. With current foreign exchange rates, the difference between local currency and dollar sales growth rates should be less in Q4. Year-to-date, Allergan's total sales have grown by 9.5% in local currencies and by 6.6% in dollars in spite of the challenges in the global economy. In the European region, we're very pleased that our consumer-facing businesses performed strongly in the quarter.
In our press release, we commented that we are exploring strategic options for the obesity intervention business as the sales dynamics did not fit the profile of a high-growth company like Allergan. Rigorous management of our portfolio of businesses has always been integral to our strategy.
Regarding operating performance. We generated in Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.06, marking an increase of 15.2%, even with strong currency pressure, and $0.02 over the top end of the range of expectations provided at the time of our last earnings call. Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has increased 13.3%.
During the year, we pursued our long-term strategy of strengthening our R&D pipeline, an example of which is the broadening of our licensing agreement with Molecular Partners in Zürich for a potential dual anti-VEGF/PDGF-B DARPin. Year-to-date, we have invested $688 million in R&D on a non-GAAP basis, marking an increase of 8.9%.
For a reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please consult our press release.
We plan to invest over $1 billion in R&D in 2013. And we opened a new R&D center for clinical development and biostatistics in Bridgewater, New Jersey.
Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX sales in Q3 increased 11.5% in local currencies and 8.8% in dollars, with year-to-date growth of 11.9% in local currencies and 9.5% in dollars. Both the aesthetic and therapeutic businesses grew double digit in Q3 in local currencies.
In Q2, the last quarter for which we have global market data available, we estimate that the world market for neuromodulators grew 12% year-over-year and the global BOTOX share was stable, with share gains in the therapeutic segment being offset by share losses in aesthetics.
The U.S. therapeutic business continued on a strong growth trajectory driven by chronic migraine, neurogenic bladder and upper limb spasticity. BOTOX sales in Europe have been affected by a broad array of government measures to reduce health care expenses, such as mandated price reductions, tenders to squeeze prices as well as measures to restrict patient access. In fact, the therapeutic side has been a greater challenge in Europe than the issues we have with consumer spending on medical aesthetics procedures.
Since the last earnings call, we have additional country approvals for chronic migraine in Serbia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Egypt and Oman; and for neurogenic overactive bladder in the U.K., the Netherlands, Malta, Turkey, Poland, Korea, Vietnam, Qatar and New Zealand. BOTOX therapeutic growth was particularly strong in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. In the U.S., the REMS for chronic migraine, upper limb spasticity and neurogenic bladder continue on strong trajectories. All the metrics for long-term establishment to the chronic migraine franchise are positive. Access is virtually complete, with 93% of all commercial lines enjoying policy coverage.
Patients without access are at a very low level and on the -- on a declining trend. Since the last earnings report, we have trained 200 more individual physicians. Focus is now on deepening the level of training in local live sessions and preceptorships rather than just training the noble injectors, as well as the goal of increasing injector productivity. Our investments in both branded and non-branded DTC campaigns for BOTOX for chronic migraine are driving patients to our websites for information about the condition and also where to find a headache specialist. In terms of patient satisfaction, only 19% of treated patients feel that their headaches are very severe or extremely severe after BOTOX treatment. We are pleased that, in the recent physician survey, Allergan is now perceived as the #1 company in migraine management by physicians.
Overall BOTOX U.S. therapeutic market share continues to rise given the strong growth in the new indications where BOTOX is the sole approved product. In July, U.S. share was close to 95%, with the remaining 5% being shared by Dysport, Xeomin and Myobloc, in descending order. In the cervical dystonia submarket where we have 2 licensed competitors, BOTOX has also been gaining share in the course of the last 12 months, and we estimate that BOTOX in July held 86% of this market.
Regarding the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we're also making excellent progress. Regarding access, we're at -- now at a very favorable level. Some level of policy coverage exists in 88% of commercial lives and for 100% of all Medicare carriers and almost 100% of Medicaid lives.
Agent profile of spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients are quite different. The number of patients without access is on a declining trend. Since launch, we have trained over 2,000 individual physicians. At the October meeting of the American Urogynecological Society, there was positive data presented on a study conducted by NIH on the use of BOTOX and anticholinergics and neurogenic bladder. Results of this study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Both for chronic migraine and injection into the bladder, we're awaiting action by CMS for their 2013 payment schedules for specific treatment codes.
On the aesthetics side of the business, we enjoyed strong growth in all operating regions of the world. In the U.S., we estimate that the market in Q3 grew double digits in volume. Based on our survey data, we estimate that BOTOX in Q3 increased its share to 82% at the expense of both Dysport and Xeomin, the latter of which still have the residual 2% share. In fact, BOTOX have the same share as in Q3 2011 before Xeomin came onto the market.
As commented in our press release, the injunction prohibiting Merz from commercializing Xeomin remains in place for aesthetics until Jan 9, 2013.
In Europe, we estimate that the aesthetic neuromodulator market was flat in Western Europe and that we have halted our market share losses as a result of launches of Bocouture and Azzalure in new markets. Overall, double-digit growth in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region was driven by Eastern Europe and emerging markets.
From the fourth quarter, we are monitoring the effect of new taxes. In France, the government has imposed a 20% VAT on medical aesthetics procedures, and in Spain, the rate was increased from 8% to 21%. In Asia Pacific, we're recording strong growth across virtually all markets, with exceptional performance in China and Japan. In Australia, we're dealing with the launch of Azzalure by Galderma, which is heavily discounting their product, and in Korea with several local competitive neuromodulators.
Facial aesthetics sales grew 5.0% in local currencies versus Q3 of 2011 and 0.8% in dollars. This was caused by a double-digit decline in U.S, x factory sales, offset by massive growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada. The U.S. decline is due to the timing of a Duet Dividend promotion in Q3 2011 as well as the benefits of the ongoing transition at that time to JUVÉDERM with lidocaine. In fact, the U.S. in Q3 2011 had over a 40% growth versus Q3 of 2010, hence the comps that I mentioned. x U.S., we're benefiting from the launch of the VOLUMA, which has stimulated growth in the overall market, and, additionally from good growth from base JUVÉDERM. In the U.S., we estimate that the market in Q3 grew low single digits in volume.
In terms of market share, we estimate that JUVÉDERM, as market leader, enjoyed 36% share in Q3, down one share point from Q3 2011, due to the launch of Belotero by Merz, which has garnered 8% share in Q3. Most of Belotero's gain came at the expense of the Restylane franchise which we gauge to be at 31%. From October, VOLUMA in a new 1-mL package is now available in Brazil and Colombia.
Year-to-date, facial aesthetics sales have increased 8.7% in local currencies. We estimate that the world market in Q2, the last period for which we have data available, increased about 6% year-over-year. The market in the European Union also grew about 6%, which is positive given the economic situation. Almost all of this growth in the EU was driven by JUVÉDERM and VOLUMA, even with a very large number of competitive products being available.
Breast aesthetics sales increased 7.1% in local currencies and 3.4% in dollars. Growth was strong in the U.S. and Latin America. The Q3 growth rate was slightly lower than in the first 2 quarters due to the attenuation of growth in Europe as the market share benefits off the aftermath of the PIP scandal wear-off.
Q3 x factory growth was dampened by the timing of sales to certain distributors in Latin America and Asia. In Europe, based on industry data, Q2 growth in implant procedures in the top 5 markets was over 7%, with substantial share gains for Allergan. For Q2, the last data for which -- the last period for which data is available, we estimate worldwide market growth in value at about 4%, which points to our share gains. The shift to anatomical 410 line was approved in Korea and was recently launched with good acceptance by surgeons.
Our Natrelle round silicone gel implants and tissue expanders were approved in Japan and will be launched in early 2013. We are the sole manufacturer with the Japan Ministry approval. In the U.S., we've been able to hold unit market share, in spite of unit -- the entry of Sientra into the markets and price discounting by Mentor and have been able to migrate products to higher-value silicone gel and tissue expanders.
Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales in Q3 were strong, increasing 12.5% in local currencies versus Q3 of 2011 and 8.4% in dollars. Year-to-date, sales, x factory, increased year-over-year 10.2% in local currencies, with both U.S. and international growth at just over 10%. This growth rate correlates with the end market growth reported by IMS Global for the 6 months up to June, also at 10%. The IMS Q2 report, the last period for which data was -- is available, lays out the world market growing by 7%, boosted by retinal therapeutics and dampened by latanoprost generics. In this data of Q2, Allergan grows by 10%.
Allergan is gaining share with RESTASIS in glaucoma, retina and artificial tears. RESTASIS is now the #2 ophthalmic product worldwide by value, after LUCENTIS. In the U.S., we are pleased to report RESTASIS growing in Q3 year-over-year 19.7% in local currencies.
Since the end of Q2, there's been an acceleration in the growth trend line, with volume growth being reported by IMS at over 10%. We ascribe this to the effectiveness of our TV campaign, growing medical awareness that dry eyes is a progressive disease, deepening patient education that chronic dry eye is a disease and enthusiasm for the product by optometrists.
RESTASIS is also the fastest-growing ophthalmic product in Canada. The LUMIGAN franchise rebounded with 8.2% growth in Q3 in local currency after the weak x factory sales in Q2. In the U.S., acquisition dollar growth for LUMIGAN in Q3 year-over-year, as reported by IMS, was 18%, with most of this attributable to price with only a small gain in volume. LUMIGAN is holding up better than competitive products from the impact of latanoprost generics due to its differentiated profile and perception as the most potent of the broad class. However, the impact of latanoprost generics is greater than we had originally anticipated.
After our August announcement that we will discontinue the manufacture of LUMIGAN 0.03% for the U.S. market by the end of 2012, we are pleased that already over 70% of new prescriptions are being written for the improved 0.01% product. Obviously, this decision reduced sales, x factory, in 2013 (sic) [2012] as we are now reducing overall trade inventory of LUMIGAN before year end.
Regarding 2013 formulary coverage where almost all contract negotiations have been concluded, LUMIGAN will enjoy similar status to the 2012 contracts, with losses being broadly offset by gains.
In Europe, LUMIGAN is widening its share leadership versus the Travatan franchise. In the U.K., Allergan is, for the first time, the #1 company in glaucoma. In Spain, we have launched Optava as a reimbursed pharmaceutical tear, which will mitigate the impact that all other reimbursed tears have been de-reimbursed by the Spanish government.
In France, OZURDEX received a positive reimbursement assessment for uveitis. In Asia, we're enjoying strong growth in India and China both due to overall market growth as well as the introduction of both international as well as local Allergan products.
Our skin care franchise grew 11.7% in local currencies and 11.4% in dollars versus Q3 of 2011. ACZONE sales continue to grow rapidly, with acquisition dollar sales per IMS VONA increasing year-over-year in the quarter at 57% and year-to-date at 52%. In September, ACZONE enjoy 31.7% share in the dermatology channel and a widening absolute leadership position in the anti-inflammatory acne category. TAZORAC sales per IMS VONA declined by 4% year-over-year in the quarter and were flat year-to-date.
LATISSE sales in the quarter grew 7.9% in local currencies and 7.2% in dollars, with good performance in the U.S., thanks to favorable physician and patient response to our new 5 mL packaging presentation and pricing.
Our press release comments the status of unfair competition action against Athena and its product, RevitaLash Advanced Eyelash Conditioner. We have information that Athena may be resuming shipments of RevitaLash to all states, with the exception of California and Tennessee. We're evaluating our options for further legal action against Athena and a few other companies who are marketing unapproved eyelash growth products.
In Europe, we withdrew our LATISSE Marketing Authorization Application from a decentralized procedure. We plan to submit the application in individual EU countries to optimize the product label.
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance and outlook."

We appreciate that you guys have made the effort to join us and hope all is well.During the third quarter of 2012, Allergan generated solid operating results despite the increasing costs related",999,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. We appreciate that you guys have made the effort to join us and hope all is well.
During the third quarter of 2012, Allergan generated solid operating results despite the increasing costs related to U.S. healthcare reform, ongoing overseas pricing pressure and uncertain European economic environment and the challenges that accompany a stronger U.S. dollar environment. As in the past, we benefited from our natural hedges with overseas manufacturing and also foreign exchange option contracts. Despite these challenges, the company achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.02 above the top end of our EPS guidance for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.06, marking a 15.2% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2012 gross margin of 86.4% increased 70 basis points when compared to Q3 2011. This increase in gross margin was driven primarily by favorable product and geographic mix despite continuing pricing pressures we're experiencing around the world.
The non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses-to-product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 38.6%, totaling $537 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 39.4% and $517 million, respectively.
As we continue to diligently work to offset the increasing costs of the U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing pressures, consistent with our planning comments to the investment community, we are recognizing the benefit of leveraging scale in many of our markets. Our ongoing focus to grant our investments to high-yielding projects, which have been appropriately risk adjusted for economic risks, and traditional market and execution risks. Consistent with our historic trends, you should anticipate a further reduction in non-GAAP SG&A expense-to-net sales ratio in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.6% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $231 million, an increasing spend of approximately $10 million over the third quarter of 2011.
With respect to our balance sheet. Consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 57 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 128 days. End-of-quarter DSO levels were slightly higher than our Q2 2012 levels due primarily to the timing of the quarter end and our efforts to accommodate specific distributor requests.
End-of-quarter DOH levels were slightly higher than prior quarter primarily due to preparation for various product launches around the world as well as a shift in shipping methods from air to ocean in -- for certain emerging markets.
In the third quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $421 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $1 billion. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents and short-term investments and cash and equivalents in short term investments net of debt positions totaled $2.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
We currently project capital expenditures of between $150 million and $200 million for the full year of 2012.
For the fourth quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,470,000,000 to $1,545,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.20.
Regarding full year expectations for 2012. Allergan estimates product net sales ranges of $5,695,000,000 and $5,770,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $4.17 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%.
Our product net sales expectations reflects a reduction of $30 million from the top end of this range provided with our previous expectations. This is primarily attributable to the external events such as increasing U.S. healthcare reform, overseas pricing pressure and fourth quarter generic impact of SANCTURA XR. We currently estimate an increase in U.S. healthcare reform of approximately $10 million primarily due to an increase in our coverage gap or donut hole exposure. Increasing European austerity measures are expected to lead to an addition of approximately $5 million in overseas pricing pressure. And the genericization of SANCTURA XR in the fourth quarter is expected to have an approximate $10 million impact. As a reminder, SANCTURA XR profitability is negligible.
As previously communicated, our 2012 expectations assume that U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. Our current estimate of the full year earnings per share impact is between $0.05 and $0.06.
One of our key drivers of Allergan's long-term success has been the continues evaluation of our portfolio of businesses to ensure that they are delivering high growth. During the past few years, the entire obesity intervention market has faced challenges as the result of economic conditions and reimbursement limitations. Earlier in the year, we committed to improving the reimbursement conditions for LAP-BAND. We've been able to reduce the wait time for surgery by reducing time patients must undergo medically managed weight loss. Now 63% of commercial lives or 120 million patients have this benefit in their policies, an increase of 22 million lives just this year.
While we are confident in the long-term prospects of the business, we also must consider the best potential for future development and clinical advancement may exist outside of the company. Moreover, Allergan's business model strategy emphasizes the importance of leverage and scalability. It is clear to us today that Allergan will have the same ability to achieve this strategic business -- it is not clear today that Allergan will have the same ability to achieve this strategic objective with this business. Therefore, we're exploring strategic options, including among other things, a potential sale of the business unit.
For your information, expectation for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. So with that, operator, I'd now like now to open the call to questions."

So it may not be first half of the year, it might be late first half of the year, early second half of the year, depends on which conference that's presented at."

We expect that, that will go to panel, although that decision is clearly up to FDA. So that would be a catalyst. Once -- if there's a panel, then clearly, there'll be data presented there. And then a number of people have followed the DARPin. So that's in Phase IIb. Those data, we expect some time next year. And again, similar to bimatoprost, once we get those data, we would get that submitted to a major meeting, which I would expect would be not first half of the year but probably second half, just based on the timing to submit.

If you you'd asked me that question 2 years ago, I'd have got it the wrong way around. You think the consumer would be the problem, I don't think that's the case. I was just looking at my numbers for the consumer-facing businesses again, and wow, Southern Europe, fantastic. If we can only get rid of this recession one day, we're going to be having a wonderful time in Southern Europe when they really have money to spend. So really, it's the pressures on the therapeutic side. And I think you can see that in other companies across the medical device industry, anything that's hospital based, it's really tough in Europe. Governments are literally turning off the lights in the operating rooms earlier in the day when the money is running tight. Luckily, of course, we're not really exposed that much to the hospital. But we are exposed to both national and regional tenders issued in several different countries. So I hope that gives you more color. And I do attempt to try and address it through my remarks."

And so that's the flywheel we're working on. I think the second part, though, that partially is new for us is we hear from some portion of neurologists, this greatest results and satisfaction they have from using BOTOX is, they say, ""I don't want to be doing,"" I'll exaggerate to make my point, ""BOTOX 5 days a week. And I do other things as a neurologist."" And that's where we want to improve the procedures in the office so that they can just move the patients through, in a good way, with quality but faster. And of course, that then applies the learnings we've made in the aesthetics business over the years where you can still have a quality outcome and feeling about the procedure, but you can really move up the number of patients per day. Also what we're seeing is, some neurologists, when they reach the limit that they decide that that's the number they want to do, some of them are -- refer to other colleagues in the community. They're the frequently pain specialists that are very procedure-oriented and are willing to take up the slack. So where that kind of partnership opportunity exists, we're very happy to put these 2 physicians because it's always 2 individuals or 2 group practices together."

And at the time, if I restrict my comment to the U.S., first of all, we didn't realize that a lot of that was not only cash paid but actually it was credit cards paid. And so of course, with hindsight, that market, which at the peak was about 1/3 of our U.S. sales, has really shriveled down to a very negligible part. So I think the next part of the thinking, then, came, and that was my commitment over 1 year ago to you on the sell side as well as the investment community on the buy side, that our job is to improve reimbursement conditions. And as you heard from Jeff's remarks, we have made progress. But then comes the real kind of what I'd call the tough call. Clearly, as a company, we are very committed to high growth and we've been able to do that. So a business like this, which is going the wrong direction, is a drag on that overall growth rate. Now I come to the point about leverageability and scalability. If you think of all of the business areas we're in, ophthalmology and medical aesthetics being very clear, we have a very broad range of products. So we often have multiple scale -- sales forces presenting multiple products, and of course, that gives you the benefits of scale. If we look at the general surgery market where we're present with LAP-BAND, it's basically a one-product entry. And as we've looked at alternatives, that would take us deeper into general surgery, which would be fine, and usually those products are associated with lower gross margin than the ones we have. So really ending the whole stream of thought: It may make better sense either for another company that one would call a strategic to add LAP-BAND and ORBERA overseas, which is the intragastric balloon, to their portfolio. Or it could make sense for a private equity firm to acquire this business because, of course, it's profitable; it's cash generative; it has a great brand name, has very good intellectual property. And finally, of course, just to make it clear, we are assessing the sale because everything comes down to numbers at the end of the day. And so as you know, we could always, if we don't get the numbers we like, choose just to keep this business and run it in a different way."

Well, you're quite right because you're pointing to some of the elements in terms of things that will be boosters of growth. I think you can very clearly feel that the migraine launch and the neurogenic bladder launch and upper limb spasticity in U.S. are doing very well. We want to really repeat that experience particularly in Europe. One quick remark about Europe: Although I'm very dutiful reporting when we get product approvals, the delay between approval date and reimbursement date in many countries can be well over 1 year. And then due to further access impediments governments draw up, it can even spread out maybe another 0.5 year. So Europe, we're looking for some good growth in these new indications in 2013 and '14. Scott Whitcup clearly talks about the bigger opportunity in neurology which is idiopathic bladder. He talks about VOLUMA. He -- those are probably the big ones in terms of what I'd call short-term horizon approvals. Then on the negative side, clearly, we factored in, when Xeomin comes back on the aesthetics side, we have to lose some share. That's clear. We're sanguine. Obviously, we don't plan to lose much. And then I would say, when you look at SANCTURA, it's a pretty small product and, more importantly, as Jeff remarked, really due to royalty obligations really didn't produce any bottom line worth talking about. One other item, which is -- although your questions were really more directed to sales, just as a reminder, we have to pick up the device tax in 2013. For us as a company, it's not that big. We -- obviously, we're not just a med device company. But that's something we will just suck up, and hopefully, you won't really feel that at all when we come out with our guidance or our outlook, which will be in early February, shortly, at the time of our next earnings call.

In terms of bimatoprost for scalp hair growth, we'll finish all the analysis hopefully early next year. We've said consistently that we, to be commercially successful with an Rx product, need to be better than minoxidil which is now generic. So we'll look at those data. If we're substantially better, we would consider going to Phase III. If we are not, what I've said is that we can potentially go higher on the dose and we would then consider doing a Phase IIb with a higher dose because I think, to be commercially successful, we need to be differentiated from minoxidil.

And we also have a research agreement where we can identify novel targets with which we can generate DARPins to fuel our retina pipeline for years to come. So that collaboration is going well.

Before we start, we wish to express our concerns and also our regrets for all of you in the eastern states who have been suffering through the superstorm Sandy.

After careful deliberation, we decided to go ahead with this call as scheduled to avoid the pile-up of earnings that will almost certainly occur later this week after the market reopens.
So getting down to the business. In the third quarter, Allergan sales grew versus the third quarter of 2011 by 9.4% to local currencies, and due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most of the world's currencies, by 6.1% in dollars. With current foreign exchange rates, the difference between local currency and dollar sales growth rates should be less in Q4. Year-to-date, Allergan's total sales have grown by 9.5% in local currencies and by 6.6% in dollars in spite of the challenges in the global economy. In the European region, we're very pleased that our consumer-facing businesses performed strongly in the quarter.
In our press release, we commented that we are exploring strategic options for the obesity intervention business as the sales dynamics do not fit the profile of a high-growth company like Allergan. Rigorous management of our portfolio of businesses has always been integral to our strategy.
Regarding operating performance. We generated in Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.06, marking an increase of 15.2%, even with strong currency pressure, and $0.02 over the top end of the range of expectations provided at the time of our last earnings call. Year-to-date, non-GAAP diluted EPS has increased 13.3%.
During the year, we pursued our long-term strategy of strengthening our R&D pipeline, an example of which is the broadening of our licensing agreement with Molecular Partners in Zürich for a potential dual anti-VEGF/PDGF-B DARPin. Year-to-date, we have invested $688 million in R&D on a non-GAAP basis, marking an increase of 8.9%.
For a reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please consult our press release.
We plan to invest over $1 billion in R&D in 2013. And we opened a new R&D center for clinical development and biostatistics in Bridgewater, New Jersey.
Now commenting the performance of the individual businesses. BOTOX sales in Q3 increased 11.5% in local currencies and 8.8% in dollars, with year-to-date growth of 11.9% in local currencies and 9.5% in dollars. Both the aesthetic and therapeutic businesses grew double digit in Q3 in local currencies.
In Q2, the last quarter for which we have global market data available, we estimate that the world market for neuromodulators grew 12% year-over-year and the global BOTOX share was stable, with share gains in the therapeutic segment being offset by share losses in aesthetics.
The U.S. therapeutic business continued on a strong growth trajectory, driven by chronic migraine, neurogenic bladder and upper limb spasticity. BOTOX sales in Europe have been affected by a broad array of government measures to reduce health care expenses, such as mandated price reductions, tenders to squeeze prices as well as measures to restrict patient access. In fact, the therapeutic side has been a greater challenge in Europe than the issues we have with consumer spending on medical aesthetics procedures.
Since the last earnings call, we have additional country approvals for chronic migraine in Serbia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Egypt and Oman; and for neurogenic overactive bladder in the U.K., the Netherlands, Malta, Turkey, Poland, Korea, Vietnam, Qatar and New Zealand. BOTOX therapeutic growth was particularly strong in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. In the U.S., the REMS for chronic migraine, upper limb spasticity and neurogenic bladder continue on strong trajectories. All the metrics for long-term establishment to the chronic migraine franchise are positive. Access is virtually complete, with 93% of all commercial lines enjoying policy coverage.
Patients without access are at a very low level and on the -- on a declining trend. Since the last earnings report, we have trained 200 more individual physicians. Focus is now on deepening the level of training in local live sessions and preceptorships rather than just training de novo injectors, as well as the goal of increasing injector productivity. Our investments in both branded and non-branded DTC campaigns for BOTOX for chronic migraine are driving patients to our websites for information about the condition and also where to find a headache specialist. In terms of patient satisfaction, only 19% of treated patients feel that their headaches are very severe or extremely severe after BOTOX treatment. We are pleased that, in the recent physician survey, Allergan is now perceived as the #1 company in migraine management by physicians.
Overall, BOTOX U.S. therapeutic market share continues to rise, given the strong growth in the new indications where BOTOX is the sole approved product. In July, U.S. share was close to 95%, with the remaining 5% being shared by Dysport, Xeomin and Myobloc, in descending order. In the cervical dystonia submarket where we have 2 licensed competitors, BOTOX has also been gaining share in the course of the last 12 months, and we estimate that BOTOX in July held 86% of this market.
Regarding the neurogenic overactive bladder launch, we're also making excellent progress. Regarding access, we're at -- now at a very favorable level. Some level of policy coverage exists in 88% of commercial lines and for 100% of all Medicare carriers and almost 100% of Medicaid lives.
Agent profile of spinal cord patients and multiple sclerosis patients are quite different. The number of patients without access is on a declining trend. Since launch, we have trained over 2,000 individual physicians. At the October meeting of the American Urogynecological Society, there was positive data presented on a study conducted by NIH on the use of BOTOX and anticholinergics and neurogenic bladder. Results of this study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Both for chronic migraine and injection into the bladder, we're awaiting action by CMS for their 2013 payment schedules for specific treatment codes.
On the aesthetics side of the business, we enjoyed strong growth in all operating regions of the world. In the U.S., we estimate that the market in Q3 grew double digits in volume. Based on our survey data, we estimate that BOTOX in Q3 increased its share to 82% at the expense of both Dysport and Xeomin, the latter of which still have the residual 2% share. In fact, BOTOX have the same share as in Q3 2011 before Xeomin came onto the market.
As commented in our press release, the injunction prohibiting Merz from commercializing Xeomin remains in place for aesthetics until Jan 9, 2013.
In Europe, we estimate that the aesthetic neuromodulator market was flat in Western Europe and that we have halted our market share losses as a result of launches of Bocouture and Azzalure in new markets. Overall, double-digit growth in the Europe, Africa, Middle East region was driven by Eastern Europe and emerging markets.
From the fourth quarter, we are monitoring the effect of new taxes. In France, the government has imposed a 20% VAT on medical aesthetics procedures, and in Spain, the rate was increased from 8% to 21%. In Asia Pacific, we're recording strong growth across virtually all markets, with exceptional performance in China and Japan. In Australia, we're dealing with the launch of Azzalure by Galderma, which is heavily discounting their product, and in Korea with several local competitive neuromodulators.
Facial aesthetics sales grew 5.0% in local currencies versus Q3 of 2011 and 0.8% in dollars. This was caused by a double-digit decline in U.S x factory sales, offset by massive growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada. The U.S. decline is due to the timing of a Duet Dividend promotion in Q3 2011 as well as the benefits of the ongoing transition at that time to JUVÉDERM with lidocaine. In fact, the U.S. in Q3 2011 had over a 40% growth versus Q3 of 2010, hence the comps that I mentioned. x U.S., we're benefiting from the launch of the VOLUMA, which has stimulated growth in the overall market, and, additionally from good growth from base JUVÉDERM. In the U.S., we estimate that the market in Q3 grew low single digits in volume.
In terms of market share, we estimate that JUVÉDERM, as market leader, enjoyed 36% share in Q3, down 1 share point from Q3 2011, due to the launch of Belotero by Merz, which has garnered 8% share in Q3. Most of Belotero's gain came at the expense of the Restylane franchise, which we gauge to be at 31%. From October, VOLUMA in a new 1-mL package is now available in Brazil and Colombia.
Year-to-date, facial aesthetics sales have increased 8.7% in local currencies. We estimate that the world market in Q2, the last period for which we have data available, increased about 6% year-over-year. The market in the European Union also grew about 6%, which is positive, given the economic situation. Almost all of this growth in the EU was driven by JUVÉDERM and VOLUMA, even with a very large number of competitive products being available.
Breast aesthetics sales increased 7.1% in local currencies and 3.4% in dollars. Growth was strong in the U.S. and Latin America. The Q3 growth rate was slightly lower than in the first 2 quarters, due to the attenuation of growth in Europe as the market share benefits off the aftermath of the PIP scandal wear-off.
Q3 x factory growth was dampened by the timing of sales to certain distributors in Latin America and Asia. In Europe, based on industry data, Q2 growth in implant procedures in the top 5 markets was over 7%, with substantial share gains for Allergan. For Q2, the last data for which -- the last period for which data is available, we estimate worldwide market growth in value at about 4%, which points to our share gains. The shaped anatomical 410 line was approved in Korea and was recently launched with good acceptance by surgeons.
Our Natrelle round silicone gel implants and tissue expanders were approved in Japan and will be launched in early 2013. We are the sole manufacturer with the Japanese Ministry approval. In the U.S., we've been able to hold unit market share, in spite of unit -- the entry of Sientra into the markets and price discounting by Mentor, and have been able to migrate products to higher-value silicone gel and tissue expanders.
Ophthalmic pharmaceutical sales in Q3 were strong, increasing 12.5% in local currencies versus Q3 of 2011 and 8.4% in dollars. Year-to-date, sales x factory increased year-over-year 10.2% in local currencies, with both U.S. and international growth at just over 10%. This growth rate correlates with the end market growth reported by IMS Global for the 6 months up to June, also at 10%. The IMS Q2 report, the last period for which data was -- is available, lays out the world market growing by 7%, boosted by retinal therapeutics and dampened by latanoprost generics. In this data of Q2, Allergan grows by 10%.
Allergan is gaining share with RESTASIS in glaucoma, retina and artificial tears. RESTASIS is now the #2 ophthalmic product worldwide by value after LUCENTIS. In the U.S., we are pleased to report RESTASIS growing in Q3, year-over-year, 19.7% in local currencies.
Since the end of Q2, there's been an acceleration in the growth trend line, with volume growth being reported by IMS at over 10%. We ascribe this to the effectiveness of our TV campaign, growing medical awareness that dry eyes is a progressive disease, deepening patient education that chronic dry eye is a disease and enthusiasm for the product by optometrists.
RESTASIS is also the fastest-growing ophthalmic product in Canada. The LUMIGAN franchise rebounded with 8.2% growth in Q3 in local currency after the weak x factory sales in Q2. In the U.S., acquisition dollar growth for LUMIGAN in Q3 year-over-year, as reported by IMS, was 18%, with most of this attributable to price with only a small gain in volume. LUMIGAN is holding up better than competitive products from the impact of latanoprost generics due to its differentiated profile and perception as the most potent of the broad class. However, the impact of latanoprost generics is greater than we had originally anticipated.
After our August announcement that we will discontinue the manufacture of LUMIGAN 0.03% for the U.S. market by the end of 2012, we are pleased that already over 70% of new prescriptions are being written for the improved 0.01% product. Obviously, this decision reduced sales, x factory, in 2013 (sic)  as we are now reducing overall trade inventory of LUMIGAN before year end.
Regarding 2013 formulary coverage where almost all contract negotiations have been concluded, LUMIGAN will enjoy similar status to the 2012 contracts, with losses being broadly offset by gains.
In Europe, LUMIGAN is widening its share leadership versus the Travatan franchise. In the U.K., Allergan is, for the first time, the #1 company in glaucoma. In Spain, we have launched Optava as a reimbursed pharmaceutical tear, which will mitigate the impact that all other reimbursed tears have been de-reimbursed by the Spanish government.
In France, OZURDEX received a positive reimbursement assessment for uveitis. In Asia, we're enjoying strong growth in India and China, both due to overall market growth as well as the introduction of both international as well as local Allergan products.
Our skin care franchise grew 11.7% in local currencies and 11.4% in dollars versus Q3 of 2011. ACZONE sales continue to grow rapidly, with acquisition dollar sales per IMS VONA increasing year-over-year in the quarter at 57% and year-to-date at 52%. In September, ACZONE enjoy 31.7% share in the dermatology channel and a widening absolute leadership position in the anti-inflammatory acne category. TAZORAC sales per IMS VONA declined by 4% year-over-year in the quarter and were flat year-to-date.
LATISSE sales in the quarter grew 7.9% in local currencies and 7.2% in dollars, with good performance in the U.S., thanks to favorable physician and patient response to our new 5 mL packaging presentation and pricing.
Our press release comments the status of unfair competition action against Athena and its product, RevitaLash Advanced Eyelash Conditioner. We have information that Athena may be resuming shipments of RevitaLash to all states, with the exception of California and Tennessee. We're evaluating our options for further legal action against Athena and a few other companies who are marketing unapproved eyelash growth products.
In Europe, we withdrew our LATISSE Marketing Authorization Application from a decentralized procedure. We plan to submit the application in individual EU countries to optimize the product label.
I'll now pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance and outlook."

We appreciate that you guys have made the effort to join us and hope all is well.
During the third quarter of 2012, Allergan generated solid operating results despite the increasing costs related to U.S. healthcare reform, ongoing overseas pricing pressure and uncertain European economic environment and the challenges that accompany a stronger U.S. dollar environment. As in the past, we benefited from our natural hedges with overseas manufacturing and also foreign exchange option contracts. Despite these challenges, the company achieved non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.02 above the top end of our EPS guidance for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.06, marking a 15.2% increase over 2011 results for the same quarter. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2012 gross margin of 86.4% increased 70 basis points when compared to Q3 2011. This increase in gross margin was driven primarily by favorable product and geographic mix despite continuing pricing pressures we're experiencing around the world.
The non-GAAP selling, general and administration expenses-to-product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 38.6%, totaling $537 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2011 were 39.4% and $517 million, respectively.
As we continue to diligently work to offset the increasing costs of the U.S. healthcare reform and overseas pricing pressures, consistent with our planning comments to the investment community, we are recognizing the benefit of leverage and scale in many of our markets. Our ongoing focus to direct our investments to high-yielding projects, which have been appropriately risk adjusted for economic risks, and traditional market and execution risks. Consistent with our historic trends, you should anticipate a further reduction in non-GAAP SG&A expense-to-net sales ratio in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.6% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $231 million, an increasing spend of approximately $10 million over the third quarter of 2011.
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 57 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 128 days. End-of-quarter DSO levels were slightly higher than our Q2 2012 levels, due primarily to the timing of the quarter end and our efforts to accommodate specific distributor requests.
End-of-quarter DOH levels were slightly higher than prior quarter, primarily due to preparation for various product launches around the world as well as a shift in shipping methods from air to ocean in -- for certain emerging markets.
In the third quarter, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $421 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after CapEx was approximately $1 billion. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and equivalents and short-term investments in cash and equivalents in short term investments net of debt positions totaled $2.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
We currently project capital expenditures of between $150 million and $200 million for the full year of 2012.
For the fourth quarter of 2012, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,470,000,000 to $1,545,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.20.
Regarding full year expectations for 2012. Allergan estimates product net sales ranges of $5,695,000,000 and $5,770,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $4.17 and $4.19, which represents growth of between 14% and 15%.
Our product net sales expectations reflects a reduction of $30 million from the top end of this range provided with our previous expectations. This is primarily attributable to the external events such as increasing U.S. healthcare reform, overseas pricing pressure and fourth quarter generic impact of SANCTURA XR. We currently estimate an increase in U.S. healthcare reform of approximately $10 million, primarily due to an increase in our coverage gap or donut hole exposure. Increasing European austerity measures are expected to lead to an addition of approximately $5 million in overseas pricing pressure. And the genericization of SANCTURA XR in the fourth quarter is expected to have an approximate $10 million impact. As a reminder, SANCTURA XR profitability is negligible.
As previously communicated, our 2012 expectations assume that U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2012, with the full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. Our current estimate of the full year earnings per share impact is between $0.05 and $0.06.
One of our key drivers of Allergan's long-term success has been the continuous evaluation of our portfolio of businesses to ensure that they are delivering high growth. During the past few years, the entire obesity intervention market has faced challenges as the result of economic conditions and reimbursement limitations. Earlier in the year, we committed to improving the reimbursement conditions for LAP-BAND. We've been able to reduce the wait time for surgery by reducing time patients must undergo medically managed weight loss. Now 63% of commercial lives or 120 million patients have this benefit in their policies, an increase of 22 million lives just this year.
While we are confident in the long-term prospects of the business, we also must consider the best potential for future development and clinical advancement may exist outside of the company. Moreover, Allergan's business model strategy emphasizes the importance of leverage and scalability. It is clear to us today that Allergan will have the same ability to achieve this strategic business -- it is not clear today that Allergan will have the same ability to achieve this strategic objective with this business. Therefore, we're exploring strategic options, including, among other things, a potential sale of the business unit.
For your information, expectation for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. So with that, operator, I'd now like now to open the call to questions."

And we expect approval, at least in the U.S., by FDA early 2013. Another major catalyst will be VOLUMA, so that's under review. We expect that, that will go to panel, although that decision is clearly up to FDA. So that would be a catalyst. Once -- if there's a panel, then clearly, there'll be data presented there. And then a number of people have followed the DARPin. So that's in Phase IIb. Those data, we expect some time next year. And again, similar to bimatoprost, once we get those data, we would get that submitted to a major meeting, which I would expect would be not first half of the year but probably second half, just based on the timing to submit.

And I think where we really felt the difference was the pullback in spend and effort on Dysport. And I think that was a realization that the share was beginning to crest. We always felt that they wouldn't really get much beyond 20%. And based on all the numbers I gave you today, it seems to be settling down in the kind of the mid-teens kind of range. And we'll see, of course, what occurs when Merz comes back onto the market in 2013 and whether -- Medicis/Valeant, what they choose to do in terms of defending the share that they have."

If you you'd asked me that question 2 years ago, I'd have got it the wrong way around. You think the consumer would be the problem; I don't think that's the case. I was just looking at my numbers for the consumer-facing businesses again, and wow.  Southern Europe, fantastic. If we can only get rid of this recession one day, we're going to be having a wonderful time in Southern Europe when they really have money to spend. So really, it's the pressures on the therapeutic side. And I think you can see that in other companies across the medical device industry, anything that's hospital based is really tough in Europe. Governments are literally turning off the lights in the operating rooms earlier in the day when the money is running tight. Luckily, of course, we're not really exposed that much to the hospital. But we are exposed to both national and regional tenders issued in several different countries. So I hope that gives you more color. And I do attempt to try and address it through my remarks."

And so that's that flywheel we're working on. I think the second part, though, that partially is new for us is we hear from some portion of neurologists that this greatest results and satisfaction they have from using BOTOX is -- they say, ""I don't want to be doing"" -- I'll exaggerate to make my point -- ""BOTOX 5 days a week. And I do other things as a neurologist."" And that's where we want to improve the procedures in the office so that they can just move the patients through, in a good way, with quality but faster. And of course, that then applies the learnings we've made in the aesthetics business over the years where you can still have a quality outcome and feeling about the procedure, but you can really move up the number of patients per day. Also what we're seeing is some neurologists, when they reach the limit that they decide that that's the number they want to do, some of them are -- refer to other colleagues in the community. They're the frequently pain specialists that are very procedure-oriented and are willing to take up the slack. So where that kind of partnership opportunity exists, we're very happy to put these 2 physicians because it's always 2 individuals or 2 group practices together."

And at the time, if I restrict my comment to the U.S., first of all, we didn't realize that a lot of that was not only cash paid, but actually it was credit cards paid. And so of course, with hindsight, that market, which at the peak was about 1/3 of our U.S. sales, has really shriveled down to a very negligible part. So I think the next part of the thinking, then, came -- and that was my commitment over 1 year ago to you on the sell side as well as the investment community on the buy side -- that our job is to improve reimbursement conditions. And as you heard from Jeff's remarks, we have made progress. But then comes the real kind of what I'd call the tough call. Clearly, as a company, we are very committed to high growth and we've been able to do that. So a business like this, which is going the wrong direction, is a drag on that overall growth rate. Now I come to the point about leverageability and scalability. If you think of all of the business areas we're in, ophthalmology and medical aesthetics being very clear, we have a very broad range of products. So we often have multiple scale -- sales forces presenting multiple products, and of course, that gives you the benefits of scale. If we look at the general surgery market where we're present with LAP-BAND, it's basically a one-product entry. And as we've looked at alternatives, that would take us deeper into general surgery, which would be fine.  But usually those products are associated with lower gross margin than the ones we have. So really ending the whole stream of thought: It may make better sense, either for another company that one would call a strategic to add LAP-BAND and ORBERA overseas, which is the intragastric balloon, to their portfolio. Or it could make sense for a private equity firm to acquire this business because, of course, it's profitable; it's cash generative; it has a great brand name; it has very good intellectual property. And finally, of course, just to make it clear, we are assessing the sale because everything comes down to numbers at the end of the day. And so as you know, we could always -- if we don't get the numbers we like, choose just to keep this business and run it in a different way."

Well, you're quite right because you're pointing to some of the elements in terms of things that will be boosters of growth. I think you can very clearly feel that the migraine launch and the neurogenic bladder launch and upper limb spas",357,"Yes, okay, Larry. Well, you're quite right because you're pointing to some of the elements in terms of things that will be boosters of growth. I think you can very clearly feel that the migraine launch and the neurogenic bladder launch and upper limb spasticity in U.S. are doing very well. We want to really repeat that experience, particularly in Europe. One quick remark about Europe: Although I'm very dutiful reporting when we get product approvals, the delay between approval date and reimbursement date in many countries can be well over 1 year. And then due to further access impediments governments throw out, it can even spread out maybe another 0.5 year. So Europe, we're looking for some good growth in these new indications in 2013 and '14. Scott Whitcup really talked about the bigger opportunity in neurology which is idiopathic bladder. He talks about VOLUMA. He -- those are probably the big ones in terms of what I'd call short-term horizon approvals. Then on the negative side, clearly, we factored in, when Xeomin comes back on the aesthetics side, we have to lose some share. That's clear. We're sanguine. Obviously, we don't plan to lose much. And then I would say, when you look at SANCTURA, it's a pretty small product and, more importantly, as Jeff remarked, really due to royalty obligations really didn't produce any bottom line worth talking about. One other item, which is -- although your questions were really more directed to sales, just as a reminder, we have to pick up the device tax in 2013. For us as a company, it's not that big. We -- obviously, we're not just a med device company. But that's something we will just suck up, and hopefully, you won't really feel that at all when we come out with our guidance or our outlook, which will be in early February, shortly, at the time of our next earnings call. So I think that takes you through all the parts and pieces. And obviously, when we put out the numbers, we'll walk you through all the bits for -- in whatever great detail you like."

So this requires a fairly robust difficult clinical trial. We know that dry eye is a tough area. In terms of RESTASIS X, we haven't said much and aren't going to give exact timing, but the thought is really to try to have a product that's -- improves upon RESTASIS and is differentiated. My advice would be just to follow clintrials.gov (sic) [clinicaltrials.gov], and at an appropriate time, you'll start seeing some trials there.

In terms of the commercial opportunity, this fits extremely well with BOTOX for chronic migraine where it handles a different patient population. It handles more of the acute episodes, so it partners very well from a commercial standpoint with BOTOX for chronic migraine. Physician feedback has been very positive.

But with respect to your decision for running another Phase IIb or starting Phase III, since you have all the data or you'll have it very soon, should we expect you to make that decision in January of next year?

In terms of LATISSE in Europe, as an aesthetics product, the label is critical to our commercial success. And by trying to gain consensus of multiple countries, it's more difficult to optimize the label.

In terms of bimatoprost for scalp hair growth, we'll finish all the analyses hopefully early next year. We've said consistently that we -- to be commercially successful with an Rx product -- need to be better than minoxidil, which is now generic. So we'll look at those data. If we're substantially better, we would consider going to Phase III. If we are not, what I've said is that we can potentially go higher on the dose and we would then consider doing a Phase IIb with a higher dose.  Because I think, to be commercially successful, we need to be differentiated from minoxidil. Again, I don't think we would communicate those, other than you'll see the data at a medical meeting. My guess is that will be your first view, as opposed to potentially seeing a Phase IIb in clinicaltrials.gov. I'm not sure which would occur first.
