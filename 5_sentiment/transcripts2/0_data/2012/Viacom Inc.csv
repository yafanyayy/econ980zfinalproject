Despite headwinds in ad sales, Viacom ended the first quarter of our fiscal year with significant strength. Across the company, we have real momentum. Creative and operational excellence are showing through in every corner of our business and at this early stage, we are seeing ad sales improvement in this second quarter. We're continuing to invest in more and more original programming to strengthen our brand and their deep audience connections. It was true in 2011, and it will be true again in 2012. In fact, in our 2012 fiscal year, Viacom will invest about $3 billion in our Media Networks program. As a result, our Media Networks attract the most desirable audiences, making Viacom a first-choice partner for marketers and distributors alike. These investment and those relationships will drive our success quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year.
We continue to see strong affiliate growth, as both existing and emerging distributors turn to our brand to fuel their products and services. We expect our affiliate revenue to grow on an annualized basis in the high-single to low-double digit for the foreseeable future. As we unlock value for our content across platforms, we're unlocking growth potential across global markets as well, expanding our footprint and margins internationally with our Media Networks and Paramount's rich film library. Creative success and operational discipline are [indiscernible] at Paramount Pictures and the studio remains focused on its strategy of releasing a streamlined slate of franchised tentpoles and reasonably priced films with box office potential, supported by one of the industry's finest distribution and marketing organization.
And that strategy is clearly working as evidenced by Paramount's outstanding performance as the number one studio at the worldwide box office in 2011.
Finally, by operating efficiently, managing costs and seizing every opportunity to monetize our content, we continue to generate significant free cash flow and to make good in our commitment to return substantial capital to our shareholders, both in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the first quarter and share highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions. Let's begin with the numbers.
Viacom's consolidated revenues grew 3% to $3.95 billion in the first quarter, driven by growth in both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Media Networks delivered 3% growth in revenues and a 7% increase in operating income on strong increases in affiliate revenues. Filmed Entertainment grew revenues by 4%, driven by higher theatrical revenues but solid bottom line decline due largely to be comparison with the sale of Marvel Studios' distribution rights in the first fiscal quarter 2011. 
Our net earnings from continuing operations decreased 5% to $591 million in the December quarter and diluted earnings per share increased to $1.06, up 4% over the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased $700 million in stock and in the current quarter, we are on track to buy back another $700 million. 
Let's turn now to our Media Networks. Our portfolio of cable networks is the strongest in the industry, accounting for a far greater share of all basic cable viewing of the U.S. and any other programming group. We built equity with our audiences by knowing and understanding them better than anyone. We have a proven ability to translate consumer insights to compelling original programming, innovative multiplatform content and valuable connections through social media. We will continue to invest judiciously in original programming, research and marketing to keep our Media Networks thriving regardless of changes and media landscape and economic environment. 
As I indicated in December, we did see softness in the overall ad market during our fiscal first quarter. For the quarter, our advertising revenues decreased 3% domestically and 4% internationally. Domestic declines were driven by significant softness in volume in the scatter market, especially after Thanksgiving and previously discussed rating softness. We are seeing signs of recovery in the current quarter scatter with a number of buyers returning to the market. As they do, we are confident that our brands will capture their share of dollars.
Shifting gears to distribution. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased by 16%, driven by significant rate increases and the benefits of digital distribution. During the quarter, we successfully closed a number of affiliate deals and expanded existing agreements, including growing our HD footprint with several cable and telco providers. We also locked up additional distribution deals, including our launch with the debut of Netflix in the U.K. And next week, a new online partner will announce a deal we just signed and involve a wide selection of our library content. Partnerships like these are high-margin opportunities to monetize our content library. We see a significant opportunity for continued growth here.
We are also stressing our relationships with traditional distributors by fueling the expansion of their products and services, including increased offerings across VOD, authenticated websites and apps and iTV. As we continue to innovate and expand our partnerships with our existing distributors, we are constantly evaluating new distribution opportunities for our content both long and short term.
International growth is a key priority for Viacom. Over the last several years, we have made a strategic priority to streamline and strengthen our international organization, strategic initiatives a partnership and launch more channels and more original programming to drive ratings and revenue. We're seeing real progress. As we said in the last call, we are well on our way to achieving our goal of 20-percent plus margins internationally in our next fiscal year.
The first quarter of fiscal 2012 was a very strong quarter for Viacom International Media Networks, driven by affiliate growth and expanded efficiency. We see our affiliate growth continuing and ad sales growth returning as we move forward.
Our priority challenge for global expansion showed strong ratings growth. Internationally, ratings at Nickelodeon and COMEDY were up substantially. The EMAs, MTV's signature international tentpole saw ratings up 37% across global markets. We successfully launched new comedy channels in Holland, India and Africa and yesterday, in Latin America. We'll be announcing more comedy launches soon.
We have also begun a number of consumer product initiatives. Consumer products is another area with significant upside over the next several years. Our pipeline is rich with character-driven content and Nickelodeon and our new Paramount Animation label that will help drive consumer product growth and long-term.
Moving to ratings highlight at our domestic Media Networks. The first quarter of fiscal 2012 was MTV's highest-rated December quarter in 4 years and the network's eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth overall. MTV continues to assert itself as the cultural home of the millennial generation with a smart mix of original reality and scripted programming. Jersey Shore was the number  one show in MTV's target 12 to 34 demo every week it aired and returned this quarter with a premiere episode that attracted 7.6 million viewers. Teen Mom 2 was the number 3 original cable series in the 12 to 34 demo for the quarter and new shows Ridiculousness, Beavis and Butthead and breakout scripted hit Awkward, all placed among the top 25.
MTV also built on a social media dominance, finishing the first quarter as the number one media network on Facebook, the number one brand on Foursquare and Tumblr and the most social cable network of 2011 according to Social Guide. In the current quarter, MTV will see the premieres of new scripted series I Just Want My Pants Back which debuts tonight, the launch of a Jersey Shore spinoff with Paulie D, the return of pop-culture phenomenon, Punk and a new season of 16 and Pregnant.
COMEDY CENTRAL continues to draws [indiscernible] score meal audience with greater program anchored by dominant late-night block, which is stronger than ever with elections [indiscernible] gaining. The Daily Show with Jon Stewart turned in a historic performance in the 2011 calendar year, surpassing NBC's the Tonight Show as the number one late-night show with viewers 18 to 49 for the first time ever.
For the quarter, The Daily Show in the Colbert report were the highest-rated and most-watched late-night shows on all of television with male and total viewers aged 18 to 34. Newcomer Workaholics continue to build its fan base, finishing the calendar year as the number one new comedy in all television with men 18 to 24. And finally, we renewed South Park with 2016, ensuring a milestone 20 seasons in a landmark animated series.
COMEDY CENTRAL has great momentum in the current quarter as well. Just this week, we saw the strong season premiere of Josh.0 [ph], which drew 3.1 million viewers, as well as the series premiere of new sketch comedy show, [indiscernible] which drew 2.1 million total viewers, making it the biggest series in Comedy in more than 2 years.
Despite the measurement issues we mentioned on last quarter's call, Nickelodeon finished the fiscal quarter as the number one cable network with both kids and total viewers for the 67th consecutive quarter. Highlighted by the launch of Kung Fu Panda and the second installment in the Fred TV movie franchise, which averaged 7 million total viewers. Our Nick at Nite, our third annual awards [indiscernible] commitment to service, delivered the tentpoles highest ratings ever with teens and tweens. 
This fiscal year, Nickelodeon will premiere more than 500 episodes original programming more than ever before, and we will keep layering on new shows to rebuild our rating.
The current quarter has been full of live-action premieres, including iCarly that attracted more than 4 million viewers in each of its 3 episodes this quarter and grown ratings in key kids 6 to 11 demo with each episode. House of [indiscernible] are also climbing steadily with ratings improving 10% in the week following its January premiere. Last Saturday, the premier Victorious was the number one program on cable, attracting 3.9 million viewers.
This Saturday, we premiere How to Rock, staring Symphony Miller [ph] and in March, we'll debut a new TV movie from Big Time Rush who along with fresh [indiscernible] where one of 2 Nickelodeon's [indiscernible] to sell out a nationwide concert tour last quarter. Additionally, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. will have new episodes of a gold standard preschool educational programming such as Dora the Explorer and the Bubble Guppies and will launch new series, Mike Tonight and a new CG version of Franklin in France. Nickelodeon will conclude the quarter with the Kids Choice Award, hosted this year by Will Smith on March 31.
BET continue to roll, as the network built on its lineup of original scripted series with Reed Between the Lines, which ranked in the top 5 among new scripted series in basic cable. The BET Hip-Hop Awards 2011 premiered on October drew in 4.1 million viewers, making in the most-watched edition of the franchise tentpole in its 60-year history. The current quarter saw the return of Let's Stay Together, which attracted 3.5 million total viewers with its season premiere and smashed hit THE GAME, which debut its fifth season last month at a premier that attracted 5.3 million viewers [indiscernible] dynamic social media marketing strategy.
VH1's ratings momentum picked up steam in the first quarter with ratings in primetime up 42% year-over-year and 72% in the key women 18 to 34 demographic. The current quarter saw the return of hit series Mob Wives, which attracted 2.4 million total viewers in its premiere broadcast. The 2011 VH1 Divas celebrates soul broadcast Mary J. Blige, Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson scored the franchise's highest rating since its return in 2009, doubling ratings over last year's show.
SPIKE continue to broaden its appeal with men of all ages and through original hits including Auction Hunters and Flip Men. The original comedy, Blue Mountain State delivered its highest-rated season to-date up 20% in the key men 18 to 34 demo. This quarter, SPIKE very successfully launched Ink Master as Dave Navarro hosted tattoo competition, which is building into a bona fide major hit. 
TV Land continued to cement its standing as the home of the sitcom on cable with the return of Hot In Cleveland and the premiere of The Exes. In fact, Hot In Cleveland just won the People's Choice Award for favorite cable TV sitcom and star Betty White won the screen actor's Guild award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a comedy series. TV Land also picked up a Hot In Cleveland spinoff staring [indiscernible] and Macy Nash [ph].
CMT continues to grow its offering of original programming, delivering 4 original series in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, including Sweet Home Alabama. In the current quarter, CMT launched 3 new series including Bayou Billionaires and My Big Red Neck Vacation, which debut as the highest-rated original series telecast in CMT history. 
Let's turn now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount, which proudly celebrates its 100th year in 2012 as the oldest studio in Hollywood ended the calendar year with a record $5.17 billion at the worldwide box office, including its first $1 billion franchise, Transformers.
The first fiscal quarter of 2012 was highlighted by the blockbuster performance of Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, which reinvigorated the Tom Cruise [indiscernible] franchise under the guidance of Brad Bird and producer J.J. Abrams and is now the highest growth Mission: Possible. The successful release of Paranormal Activity 3, which continued the phenomenal profitability of that franchise and the outstanding distribution of Hugo and DreamWorks Animation's Puss in Boots. In the current quarter, we released The Devil Inside, another highly profitable title for us with franchise potential from our Insurge label.
Our original and distribute films also scored a number of Acadamy Awards nomination, led by Hugo, which scored 11 nominations including Best Picture and a directing nod for Martin Scorsese. Our very own Rango, as well as both DreamWorks Animation films were nominated for Best Animated Feature Film. 
Looking ahead, Paramount with Fox, will rerelease Titanic digitally remastered in 3D thanks to a painstaking conversion helmed by director Jim Cameron. Paramount will also release The Dictator, staring Sasha Baron Cohen and directed by Larry Charles, the team behind Borat, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation, the next film in the global franchise starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, and Channing Tatum. 
And the studio, will build value by supporting our international division's launch of Paramount television channel, the first of which will debut in Spain in the coming months. 
In sum, despite some early headwinds, Viacom is off to a strong start in fiscal 2012. As we move forward, our consistent focus on content and brand building will drive creative momentum across the company in the full freight of original programming launching across our network and in the focus and franchise-centric releases from our studio. We will seek out and seize every opportunity on every platform to monetize our content, both in the United States and internationally.
And our disciplined operation and management for top and bottom line growth will give us the continued flexibility to invest in content and return substantial capital to our shareholders for many years to come.
With that, I will turn it over to Jimmy."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation, summarizing the results of our December quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly.

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation, summarizing the results of our December quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. Before I do that, I'd like to note that discontinued operations in the December quarter of this year reflects the $383 million charge related to the earn out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix. In this regard, I would note that we have filed a lawsuit seeking to compel consideration of arguments and evidence that we believe were inappropriately excluded from the dispute resolution process.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues increased 3% to $2.4 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 3%, and international revenues increased 2% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a one percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. 
Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues declined 3% in the quarter. International advertising declined 4%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by one percentage point. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to the timing of event-driven programming.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 16% while international revenues increased 18%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was driven by the availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreement, as well as by rate increases from traditional distributors.
Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high-single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreement, rate and subscriber increases and new channel launches.
Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 13% in the quarter, principally due to lower home entertainment revenues. Media Networks adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion in the quarter increased 7% over last year. The operating margin of 46% improved 190 basis points over the prior year.
The improvement in the margin was driven by revenue growth of 3% and a 1% decline in expenses. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to a 2% decline in programming expense, resulting from the timing of new program launches, as well as the timing of event-driven programming in the prior year.
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter increased 4% to $1.6 billion. Page 11 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues increased 37% to $570 million in the quarter. The increase in theatrical revenues was principally due to the strength of our current quarters leases, including Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, Paranormal Activity 3 and Puss in Boots. 
Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 6% to approximately $600 million. The decrease, primarily reflects lower revenues from third-party distribution titles, partially offset by the performance of Transformers 3 in international market.
License fees increased 9% to approximately $300 million. The increase in TV license fees was due to higher pay-TV revenues, partially offset by lower network TV revenues, resulting from a fewer number of titles available in the quarter. Ancillary revenues declined 46% to $92 million. Ancillary revenues faced difficult comparison as the prior year benefited from the sale of the distribution rights to Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel. Partially offsetting this were higher consumer products and digital revenues.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating loss of $31 million in the quarter, as compared to income of $68 million last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects the difficult comparison to last year sale of distribution rights to Marvel, as well as the timing of P&A expense related to the theatrical release of Mission: Impossible, partially offset by the international home entertainment performance of Transformers 3. 
Now moving below operating income. Total company equity income from investments was $10 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX, which was part of partially offset by losses at our Viacom 18 India TV venture that reflect cost associated with our investments in new channel launches.
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

Let's talk about our cash flow, our debt profile, the return of capital to shareholders, as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year.

Let's talk about our cash flow, our debt profile, the return of capital to shareholders, as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of free cash flow for the quarter, we generated approximately $600 million in operating free cash flow in the December quarter compared to approximately $700 million last year. Page 4 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow.
The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher working capital utilization, partially offset by lower taxes. The working capital used in the quarter was primarily due to the timing of the theatrical releases, including Mission: Impossible 3. 
As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost at the quarter end of 5.5%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable-rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.
During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rate in the public market to refinance certain of our higher coupon notes, as well as to maintain our leverage at our target level. We issued $600 million of 3.875% senior notes due in 2021 and $400 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2016. In conjunction with this, we called the $750 million of outstanding of our 6.85% senior notes due in 2055.
The notes were callable were at par and were redeemed on January 9. The combination of these actions will lower our interest cost by approximately $20 million on an annual basis. 
In addition, during the quarter, we amended our bank line by improving the pricing and extended the maturity base to December 2015, further enhancing our liquidity. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding at approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalent.
At December 31, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.95x. As I just mentioned, we redeemed our 6.85% senior notes on January 9. If you pro forma for the redemption at quarter end, our debt and capital leases outstanding would be $7 billion and our leverage ratio would be 1.8x. The only financial covenant in our a bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 10x.
In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $840 million of capital back to our shareholders in the December quarter. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter. So for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, on an annual basis, we continue to see revenue growth in the high single-digit double-digit range based on 2011 affiliate revenue base, which includes incremental digital agreement. Given that revenue recognition on some of the digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. In the March quarter, we expect the affiliate revenue growth to be in the low-teens.
Our expected growth rate for Media Networks programming expense remains mid- to high-single digits for fiscal 2012. Accordingly, given the pace of programming expense in the December quarter, we anticipate that programming expense will grow in the high-single to low double-digit percentage range for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Our ongoing expense management will enable us to continue to grow our margin, as we invest in our brands. Paramount has achieved global box office expenses with its latest sequel to the Mission: Impossible franchise. Accordingly, Paramount should see healthy growth and profit in the March quarter as it benefits from the performance of Mission: Impossible, as well as from lower and advertising costs. We continue to expect to realize approximately $100 million in cost savings this year related to the restructuring charge we took back in the September quarter. 
For 2012, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. In terms of cash taxes, given the subsetting in December of tax benefits related to accelerated deductions of films and TV production, we expect cash taxes to mirror book taxes for the year. As for our stock buyback program, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for the fiscal 2012 year.
Looking ahead at the studio's slate and development pipeline. In April, Paramount and Fox will release James Cameron's Titanic in 3D and in May, the studio will release The Dictator, which stars Sasha Baron Cohen. Paramount will also be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3 in early June.
In addition, the studio has a number of sequels to existing franchises, as well as new franchises and that meant. This summer, the studio will release G.I. Joe and in the fall, they released the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. Paramount is working on World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt and One-Shot, staring Tom Cruise, which is based on the best-selling novel [indiscernible] business book series. And J.J. Abrams is currently in production on the next installment of Star Trek. 
To wrap up, we continue to operate with the focus of pursuing organic opportunities in our core businesses. And we remain committed to investing in our brand and strengthening their competitive position. This focus on organic investments combined with disciplined management of our core structure will enable us to drive earning per share and drive free cash flow. We are encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands and franchises. The addition of new distribution partners in digital platforms, the opportunity to grow our international business and profitability and the ability to develop franchises with consumer products appeal will enhance our long-term growth. In addition, we remain committed to an aggressive capital return program of share buyback and dividend, which we believe will drive value for our shareholders over the long-term.

And we don't think the availability of the limited amount of Nickelodeon library content that we have on NetFlix has had a significant impact on the rating. Again, remember, the NetFlix universe is a rather small fraction of the overall television household numbers, number one. And number 2, yes, we do get data on our streams, and the bulk of the number of Netflix subscribers and the number of Nickelodeon content stream were pretty much the same between the summer and the fall. So there was no real change accounted for the fall drop, which we did not see in the summer. So it could have been some minimal impact, but it's certainly does not account for the range that we saw. As I said on the last call, we believe there was some ratings systemic issues f again, I don't want to elaborate it because we did in the last call, but the pretty expenses set-top box data that we have was in no way reflect what we're seeing in the Nielsen measurement. That being said, that's the environment we're operating in and we're going to attack it as we always do, which is to attract our audience, and we'll go after that new Nielsen sample and programs will appeal and I'm confident. And as of the year progresses, you will see improvement in Nickelodeon's ratings. And again, finally, at that point, it did impact last quarter's ad revenues in a significant way. But as I said again in the last call, that was the significant quarter where that has a big impact that. In the remainder of the fiscal year, we have a low proportion ad sales that are tied to Nickelodeon, and we have more unit availability in the quarters than you have in that multiweek period, leading up to the holidays in the fourth calendar quarter or first fiscal quarter."

I don't think that something people have put a lot of thought towards historically versus keeping them on EPIX for the foreseeable future?"

As far as exploiting our film library, yes, Paramount, yes, and Lions Gate both committed EPIX and some of our library titles. We are available to license on other pay services and we have been doing as well.

Creative and",2546,"Thank you very much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today. Despite headwinds in ad sales, Viacom ended the first quarter of our fiscal year with significant strength. Across the company, we have real momentum. Creative and operational excellence are showing through in every corner of our business and at this early stage, we are seeing ad sales improvement in the second quarter. We're continuing to invest in more and more original programming to strengthen our brand and their deep audience connections. It was true in 2011 and it will be true again in 2012.  In fact, in our 2012 fiscal year, Viacom will invest about $3 billion in our Media Networks program. As a result, our Media Networks attract the most desirable audiences, making Viacom a first-choice partner for marketers and distributors alike. These investment and those relationships will drive our success quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year.
We continue to see strong affiliate growth as both existing and emerging distributors turn to our brand to fuel their products and services. We expect our affiliate revenue to grow on an annualized basis in the high-single to low-double digit for the foreseeable future. As we unlock value for our content across the platform, we're unlocking growth potential across global markets as well, expanding our footprint and margins internationally with our Media Networks and Paramount's rich film library. Creative success and operational discipline are hand in glove at Paramount Pictures and the studio remains focused on its strategy of releasing a streamlined slate of franchise tentpoles and reasonably priced films with box office potential, supported by one of the industry's finest distribution and marketing organization.  And that strategy is clearly working as evidenced by Paramount's outstanding performance as the #1 studio at the worldwide box office in 2011.
Finally, by operating efficiently, managing costs and seizing every opportunity to monetize our content, we continue to generate significant free cash flow and to make good on our commitment to return substantial capital to our shareholder both in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the first quarter and share highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions. Let's begin with the numbers.
Viacom's consolidated revenues grew 3% to $3.95 billion in the first quarter, driven by growth in both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Media Networks delivered 3% growth in revenues and a 7% increase in operating income on strong increases in affiliate revenues. Filmed Entertainment grew revenues by 4%, driven by higher theatrical revenues, but solid bottom line decline due largely to the comparison with the sale of Marvel Studios' distribution rights in the first fiscal quarter of 2011. Our net earnings from continuing operations decreased 5% to $591 million in the December quarter and diluted earnings per share increased to $1.06, up 4% over the first quarter of fiscal 2011.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased $700 million in stock and in the current quarter, we are on track to buy back another $700 million. 
Let's turn now to our Media Networks. Our portfolio of cable networks is the strongest in the industry, accounting for a far greater share of all basic cable viewing in the U.S. than any other programming group. We built equity with our audiences by knowing and understanding them better than anyone. We have a proven ability to translate consumer insights to compelling original programming, innovative multi-platform content and valuable connections through social media. We will continue to invest judiciously in original programming, research and marketing to keep our Media Networks thriving regardless of changes in media landscape and economic environment. 
As I indicated in December, we did see softness in the overall ad market during our fiscal first quarter. For the quarter, our advertising revenues decreased 3% domestically and 4% internationally. Domestic declines were driven by significant softness in volume in the scatter market, especially after Thanksgiving and previously discussed rating softness. We are seeing signs of recovery in the current quarter scatter with a number of buyers returning to the market. As they do, we are confident that our brands will capture their share of dollars.
Shifting gears to distribution. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased by 16%, driven by significant rate increases and the benefits of digital distribution. During the quarter, we successfully closed a number of affiliate deals and expanded existing agreements, including growing our HD footprint with several cable and telco providers. We also locked up additional distribution deals, including our launch with the debut of Netflix in the U.K. And next week, a new online partner will announce a deal we just signed that involves a wide selection of our library content. Partnerships like these are high-margin opportunities to monetize our content library. We see a significant opportunity for continued growth here.
We are also stressing our relationships with traditional distributors by fueling the expansion of their products and services, including increased offerings across VOD, authenticated websites and apps and ITV. As we continue to innovate and expand our partnerships with our existing distributors, we are constantly evaluating new distribution opportunities for our content both long and short form.
International growth is a key priority for Viacom. Over the last several years, we have made it a strategic priority to streamline and strengthen our international organization, pursue strategic initiatives and partnerships and launch more channels and more original programming to drive ratings and revenue. We're seeing real progress. As we said on the last call, we are well on our way to achieving our goal of 20-percent plus margins internationally in our next fiscal year.
The first quarter of fiscal 2012 was a very strong quarter for Viacom International Media Networks, driven by affiliate growth and expanded efficiency. We see our affiliate growth continuing and ad sales growth returning as we move forward.  
Our priority channels for global expansion showed strong ratings growth. Internationally, ratings at Nickelodeon and Comedy were up substantially. The EMAs, MTV's signature international tentpole saw ratings up 37% across global markets. We successfully launched new comedy channels in Holland, India and Africa and yesterday, in Latin America. We'll be announcing more comedy launches soon.
We have also begun a number of consumer products initiatives. Consumer products is another area with significant upside over the next several years. Our pipeline is rich with character-driven content in Nickelodeon and our new Paramount Animation label that will help drive consumer products growth in the long-term.
Moving to ratings highlights at our domestic Media Networks. The first quarter of fiscal 2012 was MTV's highest-rated December quarter in 4 years and the network's eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth overall. MTV continues to assert itself as the cultural home of the millennial generation with a smart mix of original reality and scripted programming. Jersey Shore was the #1 show in MTV's target 12-34 demo every week it aired and returned this quarter with a premiere episode that attracted 7.6 million viewers. Teen Mom 2 was the #3 original cable series in the 12-34 demo for the quarter and new shows, Ridiculousness, Beavis and Butthead and breakout scripted-hit, Awkward, all placed among the top 25.
MTV also built on a social media dominance, finishing the first quarter as the #1 media network on Facebook, the #1 brand on Foursquare and Tumblr and the most social cable network of 2011 according to SocialGuide. In the current quarter, MTV will see the premieres of a new scripted series, I Just Want My Pants Back, which debuts tonight; the launch of a Jersey Shore spinoff with Pauly D; the return of pop-culture phenomenon, Punk'd and a new season of 16 & Pregnant.
Comedy Central continues to draw its core new audience with great additional program anchored by its dominant late-night block, which is stronger than ever with election 2012 gaining steam. The Daily Show with Jon Stewart turned in a historic performance in the 2011 calendar year, surpassing NBC's The Tonight Show as the #1 late-night show with viewers 18-49 for the first time ever.
For the quarter, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report were the highest-rated and most-watched late-night shows on all of television with male and total viewers aged 18-34. Newcomer, Workaholics, continued to build its fan base, finishing the calendar year as the #1 new comedy on all television with men 18-24. And finally, we renewed South Park to 2016, ensuring a milestone 20 seasons in a landmark animated series.
Comedy Central has great momentum in the current quarter as well. Just this week, we saw the strong season premiere of Tosh.0, which drew 3.1 million viewers as well as the series premiere of new sketch comedy show, Key & Peele, which drew 2.1 million total viewers, making it the biggest series launch on Comedy in more than 2 years.
Despite the measurement issues we mentioned on last quarter's call, Nickelodeon finished the fiscal quarter as the #1 cable network with both kids and total viewers for the 67th consecutive quarter, highlighted by the launch of Kung Fu Panda and the second installment in the Fred TV movie franchise, which averaged 7 million total viewers. Our Nick at Nite, our third annual HALO Award, honoring teens for their commitment to service, delivered the tentpoles' highest ratings ever with teens and tweens. 
This fiscal year, Nickelodeon will premiere more than 500 episodes of original programming more than ever before, and we will keep layering on new shows to rebuild our rating.  The current quarter has been full of live-action premieres, including iCarly, that attracted more than 4 million viewers in each of its 3 episodes this quarter and grown ratings in key kids 6-11 demo with each episode. House of Anubis ratings are also climbing steadily with ratings improving 10% in the week following its January premiere. Last Saturday, the premier of Victorious was the #1 program on cable, attracting 3.9 million viewers.
This Saturday, we premiere How to Rock, staring Cymphonique Miller and in March, we'll debut a new TV movie from Big Time Rush, who along with Fresh Beat Band, were 1 of 2 Nickelodeon kids music act to sell out a nationwide concert tour last quarter. Additionally, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. will have new episodes of a gold standard preschool educational programming such as Dora the Explorer and the Bubble Guppies and will launch new series, Mike Tonight and a new CG version of Franklin and friends. Nickelodeon will conclude the quarter with the Kid's Choice Award, hosted this year by Will Smith on March 31.
BET continue to roll as the network built on its lineup of original scripted series with Reed Between the Lines, which ranked in the top 5 among new scripted series on basic cable. The BET Hip Hop Awards 2011 premier in October drew in 4.1 million viewers, making it the most-watched edition of the franchise tentpole in its 60-year history. The current quarter saw the return of Let's Stay Together, which attracted 3.5 million total viewers with its season premiere and smash hit, THE GAME, which debuted its fifth season last month at a premier that attracted 5.3 million viewers, thanks in part to a dynamic social media marketing strategy.
VH1's ratings momentum picked up steam in the first quarter with ratings in primetime up 42% year-over-year and 72% in the key women 18-34 demographic. The current quarter saw the return of hit series, Mob Wives, which attracted 2.4 million total viewers in its premiere broadcast. The 2011 VH1 DIVAS Celebrates Soul broadcast, featuring Mary J. Blige, Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson, scored the franchise's highest rating since its return in 2009, doubling ratings over last year's show.
Spike continued to broaden its appeal with men of all ages through original hits, including Auction Hunters and Flip Men. The original comedy, Blue Mountain State, delivered its highest-rated season to date, up 20% in the key men 18-34 demo. This quarter, Spike very successfully launched INK MASTER, the Dave Navarro-hosted tattoo competition, which is building into a bona fide major hit. 
TV Land continued to cement its standing as the home of the sitcom on cable with the return of Hot In Cleveland and the premiere of The Exes. In fact, Hot In Cleveland just won the People's Choice Award for favorite cable TV sitcom and star, Betty White, won the Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series. TV Land also picked up a Hot In Cleveland spinoff, starring Cedric ""The Entertainer"" and Niecy Nash.
CMT continues to grow its offering of original programming, delivering 4 original series in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, including Sweet Home Alabama. In the current quarter, CMT launched 3 new series, including Bayou Billionaires and My Big Red Neck Vacation, which debuted as the highest-rated original series telecast in CMT history. 
Let's turn now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount, which proudly celebrates its 100th year in 2012 as the oldest studio in Hollywood ended the calendar year with a record $5.17 billion at the worldwide box office, including its first $1 billion franchise, Transformers. The first fiscal quarter of 2012 was highlighted by the blockbuster performance of Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, which reinvigorated the Tom Cruise-starring franchise under the guidance of director, Brad Bird and producer, J.J. Abrams and is now the-highest grossing Mission: Possible; the successful release of Paranormal Activity 3, which continued the phenomenal profitability of that franchise and the outstanding distribution of Hugo and DreamWorks Animation's Puss In Boots. In the current quarter, we released The Devil Inside, another highly profitable title for us with franchise potential from our Insurge label.
Our original and distributed films also scored a number of Acadamy Award nominations led by Hugo, which scored 11 nominations, including Best Picture and a directing nod for Martin Scorsese. Our very own, Rango, as well as both DreamWorks Animation film were nominated for Best Animated Feature Film. 
Looking ahead, Paramount with Fox will rerelease TITANIC digitally remastered in 3D, thanks to a painstaking conversion helmed by director Jim Cameron. Paramount will also release The Dictator, staring Sasha Baron Cohen and directed by Larry Charles, the team behind Borat and G.I. Joe: Retaliation, the next film in the global franchise starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Channing Tatum.  And the studio will build value by supporting our international division's launch of Paramount television channel, the first of which will debut in Spain in the coming months. 
In sum, despite some early headwinds, Viacom is off to a strong start in fiscal 2012. As we move forward, our consistent focus on content and brand building will drive creative momentum across the company in the full freight of original programming launching across our network and in the focus and franchise-centric releases from our studio. We will seek out and seize every opportunity on every platform to monetize our content both in the United States and internationally.  And our disciplined operation and management for top and bottom line growth will give us the continued flexibility to invest in content and return substantial capital to our shareholders for many years to come.
With that, I will turn it over to Jimmy."
25403751,144398736,214579,"Viacom, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2012",2012-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation, summarizing the results of our December quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through",707,"Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation, summarizing the results of our December quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. Before I do that, I'd like to note that discontinued operations in the December quarter of this year reflects the $383 million charge related to the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix. In this regard, I would note that we have filed a lawsuit seeking to compel consideration of arguments and evidence that we believe were inappropriately excluded from the dispute resolution process.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues increased 3% to $2.4 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 3% and international revenues increased 2% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. 
Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues declined 3% in the quarter. International advertising declined 4% with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 1 percentage point. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to the timing of event-driven programming.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 16% while international revenues increased 18%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was driven by the availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreement as well as by rate increases from traditional distributors.  Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high-single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreement, rate and subscriber increases and new channel launches.
Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 13% in the quarter, principally due to lower home entertainment revenue. Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion in the quarter increased 7% over last year. The operating margin of 46% improved 190 basis points over the prior year.
The improvement in the margin was driven by revenue growth of 3% and a 1% decline in expenses. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to a 2% decline in programming expense, resulting from the timing of new program launches as well as the timing of event-driven programming in the prior year.
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter increased 4% to $1.6 billion. Page 11 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues increased 37% to $570 million in the quarter. The increase in theatrical revenues was principally due to the strength of our current quarters releases, including Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol, Paranormal Activity 3 and Puss In Boots.  Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 6% to approximately $600 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower revenues from third-party distribution titles, partially offset by the performance of Transformers 3 in international market.
TV license fees increased 9% to approximately $300 million. The increase in TV license fees was due to higher pay-TV revenues, partially offset by lower network TV revenues, resulting from a fewer number of titles available in the quarter. Ancillary revenues declined 46% to $92 million. Ancillary revenues faced difficult comparison as the prior year benefited from the sale of the distribution rights to Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel. Partially offsetting this were higher consumer products and digital revenues.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating loss of $31 million in the quarter as compared to income of $68 million last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects the difficult comparison to last year's sale of distribution rights to Marvel as well as the timing of P&A expense related to the theatrical release of Mission: Impossible, partially offset by the international home entertainment performance of Transformers 3. 
Now moving below operating income. Total company equity income from investments was $10 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX, which was partially offset by losses at our Viacom 18 India TV venture that reflect cost associated with our investments in new channel launches.  The effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."
25403751,144398736,214579,"Viacom, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2012",2012-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jimmy, and good morning, everyone. Let's talk about our cash flow, our debt profile, the return of capital to our shareholders as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of free cash flow for the quarter, we generated",1099,"Thanks, Jimmy, and good morning, everyone. Let's talk about our cash flow, our debt profile, the return of capital to our shareholders as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of free cash flow for the quarter, we generated approximately $600 million in operating free cash flow in the December quarter compared to approximately $700 million last year. Page 4 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher working capital utilization, partially offset by lower cash taxes. The working capital used in the quarter was primarily due to the timing of theatrical releases, including Mission: Impossible 3. 
As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost at the quarter end of 5.5%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.
During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rate in the public markets to refinance certain of our higher coupon notes, as well as to maintain our leverage at our target level. We issued $600 million of 3.875% senior notes due in 2021 and $400 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2016. In conjunction with this, we called the $750 million of outstanding of our 6.85% senior notes due in 2055.  The notes were callable at par and were redeemed on January 9. The combination of these actions will lower our interest cost by approximately $20 million on an annual basis. 
In addition, during the quarter, we amended our bank line by improving the pricing and extending the maturity days to December 2015, further enhancing our liquidity. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents.
At December 31, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.95x. As I just mentioned, we redeemed our 6.85% senior notes on January 9. If you pro forma for the redemption at quarter end, our debt and capital leases outstanding would be $7 billion and our leverage ratio would be 1.8x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 10x.
In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $840 million of capital back to our shareholders in the December quarter. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter. So for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, on an annual basis, we continue to see revenue growth in the high single-digit to double-digit range based on 2011 affiliate revenue base, which includes incremental digital agreement. Given that revenue recognition on some of the digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. In the March quarter, we expect the affiliate revenue growth to be in the low-teens.  Our expected growth rate for Media Networks programming expense remains mid- to high-single digits for fiscal 2012. Accordingly, given the pace of programming expense in the December quarter, we anticipate that programming expense will grow in the high-single to low-double-digit percentage range for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Our ongoing expense management will enable us to continue to grow our margin as we invest in our brand. Paramount has achieved global box office success with its latest sequel to the Mission: Impossible franchise. And accordingly, Paramount should see healthy growth in profit in the March quarter as it benefits from the performance of Mission: Impossible as well as from lower print and advertising costs. We continue to expect to realize approximately $100 million in cost savings this year related to the restructuring charge we took back in the September quarter. 
For 2012, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. In terms of cash taxes, given there's some setting in December of tax benefits related to accelerated deductions of films and TV production, we expect cash taxes to mirror book taxes for the year. As for our stock buyback program, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for the fiscal 2012 year.
Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline. In April, Paramount and Fox will rerelease James Cameron's TITANIC in 3D and in May, the studio will release The Dictator, which stars Sasha Baron Cohen. Paramount will also be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3 in early June.
In addition, the studio has a number of sequels to existing franchises as well as new franchises in development. This summer, the studio will release G.I. Joe 2 and in the fall, they released the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. Paramount is working on World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt and One Shot, starring Tom Cruise, which is based on the best-selling novel and Jack Reacher business book series, and J.J. Abrams is currently in production on the next installment of Star Trek. 
To wrap up, we continue to operate with the focus on pursuing organic opportunities in our core businesses. And we remain committed to investing in our brand and strengthening their competitive position. This focus on organic investment, combined with disciplined management of our core structure, will enable us to drive earning per share and drive free cash flow. We are encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands and franchises. The addition of new distribution partners on digital platforms, the opportunity to grow our international business and profitability and the ability to develop franchises with consumer products appeal will enhance our long-term growth.

And we don't think that the availability of the limited amount of Nickelodeon library content that we have on NetFlix has had a significant impact on the rating. Again, remember, the NetFlix universe is a rather small fraction of the overall television household numbers, number one. And number two, yes, we do get data on our streams and the bulk the number of Netflix subscribers and the number of Nickelodeon content streams were pretty much the same between the summer and the fall. So there was no real change that accounted for the fall drop, which we did not see in the summer. So there could have been some minimal impact, but it certainly does not account for the range drop that we saw. We -- as I said on the last call, we believe there was some ratings systemic issues. Again, I don't want to belabor it because we did in the last call. But the pretty extensive set-top-box data that we have does in no way reflect what we're seeing in the Nielsen measurement. That being said, that's the environment we're operating in and we're going to attack it as we always do, and which is to go after our audience. And we'll go after that new Nielsen sample and we'll -- the programs will appeal. And I'm confident that as the year progresses, you will see improvement in Nickelodeon's ratings. And again, finally, on that point, it did impact last quarter's ad revenues in a significant way. But as I said again on the last call, that was the significant quarter, where that has a big impact. In the remainder of the fiscal year, we have a low proportion of ad sales that are tied-in to Nickelodeon, and we have more unit availabilities in the quarters than you have in that multi-week period, leading up to the holidays in the fourth calendar quarter, our first fiscal quarter."

They see how advertising in Nickelodeon moves their product and I think that's a good understanding of what the issues are out there. So we expect a strong upfront for Nickelodeon. As far as exploiting our film library, yes, Paramount, yes, of course, and Lionsgate both very committed to EPIX and some of our older library titles. So we are available to license on other paid services and we have been doing well competitively there. This is -- so the Paramount library, which is of extraordinary quality and continue to build on quality with the new films we're releasing is -- will be a mother lode of opportunity for Paramount for many, many years to come and will be the foundation for building some very valuable assets, EPIX in the U.S. and the Paramount film channels around the world, and we continue to look for more opportunities to monetize those film.

Despite headwinds in ad sales, Viacom ended the first quarter of our fiscal year with significant strength. Across the company, we have real momentum. Creative and operational excellence are showing through in every corner of our business and at this early stage, we are seeing ad sales improvement in the second quarter. We're continuing to invest in more and more original programming to strengthen our brands and their deep audience connections. It was true in 2011 and it will be true again in 2012. In fact, in our 2012 fiscal year, Viacom will invest about $3 billion in our Media Networks programming. As a result, our Media Networks attract the most desirable audiences, making Viacom a first-choice partner for marketers and distributors alike. This investment and those relationships will drive our success quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year.
We continue to see strong affiliate growth as both existing and emerging distributors turn to our brand to fuel their products and services. We expect our affiliate revenue to grow on an annualized basis in the high-single to low-double digit for the foreseeable future. As we unlock value for our content across platform, we're unlocking growth potential across global markets as well, expanding our footprint and margins internationally with our Media Networks and Paramount's rich film library. Creative success and operational discipline are hand in glove at Paramount Pictures, and the studio remains focused on its strategy of releasing a streamlined slate of franchise tentpoles and reasonably priced films with box office potential, supported by one of the industry's finest distribution and marketing organizations.  And that strategy is clearly working as evidenced by Paramount's outstanding performance as the #1 studio at the worldwide box office in 2011.
Finally, by operating efficiently, managing costs and seizing every opportunity to monetize our content, we continue to generate significant free cash flow and to make good on our commitment to return substantial capital to our shareholder both in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the first quarter and share highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions. Let's begin with the numbers.
Viacom's consolidated revenues grew 3% to $3.95 billion in the first quarter, driven by growth in both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Media Networks delivered 3% growth in revenues and a 7% increase in operating income on strong increases in affiliate revenues. Filmed Entertainment grew revenues by 4%, driven by higher theatrical revenues, but solid bottom line decline due largely to the comparison with the sale of Marvel Studios' distribution rights in the first fiscal quarter of 2011. Our net earnings from continuing operations decreased 5% to $591 million in the December quarter and diluted earnings per share increased to $1.06, up 4% over the first quarter of fiscal 2011. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased $700 million in stock and in the current quarter, we are on track to buy back another $700 million. 
Let's turn now to our Media Networks. Our portfolio of cable networks is the strongest in the industry, accounting for a far greater share of all basic cable viewing in the U.S. than any other programming group. We built equity with our audiences by knowing and understanding them better than anyone. We have a proven ability to translate consumer insights into compelling original programming, innovative multi-platform content and valuable connections through social media. We will continue to invest judiciously in original programming, research and marketing to keep our Media Networks thriving regardless of changes in the media landscape and economic environment. 
As I indicated in December, we did see softness in the overall ad market during our fiscal first quarter. For the quarter, our advertising revenues decreased 3% domestically and 4% internationally. Domestic declines were driven by significant softness in volume in the scatter market, especially after Thanksgiving and previously discussed rating softness. We are seeing signs of recovery in the current quarter scatter with a number of buyers returning to the market. As they do, we are confident that our brands will capture their share of dollars.
Shifting gears to distribution. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased by 16%, driven by significant rate increases and the benefits of digital distribution. During the quarter, we successfully closed a number of affiliate deals and expanded existing agreements, including growing our HD footprint with several cable and telco providers. We also locked up additional distribution deals, including our launch with the debut of Netflix in the U.K. And next week, a new online partner will announce a deal we just signed that involves a wide selection of our library content. Partnerships like these are high-margin opportunities to monetize our content library. We see a significant opportunity for continued growth here.
We are also stressing our relationships with traditional distributors by fueling the expansion of their products and services, including increased offerings across VOD, authenticated websites and apps and ITV. As we continue to innovate and expand our partnerships with our existing distributors, we are constantly evaluating new distribution opportunities for our content, both long and short form.
International growth is a key priority for Viacom. Over the last several years, we have made it a strategic priority to streamline and strengthen our international organization, pursue strategic initiatives and partnerships and launch more channels and more original programming to drive ratings and revenue. We're seeing real progress. As we said on the last call, we are well on our way to achieving our goal of 20-percent plus margins internationally in our next fiscal year.
The first quarter of fiscal 2012 was a very strong quarter for Viacom International Media Networks, driven by affiliate growth and expanded efficiencies. We see our affiliate growth continuing and ad sales growth returning as we move forward.  
Our priority channels for global expansion showed strong ratings growth. Internationally, ratings at Nickelodeon and Comedy were up substantially. The EMAs, MTV's signature international tentpole, saw ratings up 37% across global markets. We successfully launched new comedy channels in Holland, India and Africa and yesterday, in Latin America. We'll be announcing more comedy launches soon.
We have also begun a number of consumer products initiatives. Consumer products is another area with significant upside over the next several years. Our pipeline is rich with character-driven content in Nickelodeon and our new Paramount Animation label that will help drive consumer products growth in the long-term.
Moving to ratings highlights at our domestic Media Networks. The first quarter of fiscal 2012 was MTV's highest-rated December quarter in 4 years and the network's eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth overall. MTV continues to assert itself as the cultural home of the millennial generation with a smart mix of original reality and scripted programming. Jersey Shore was the #1 show in MTV's target 12-34 demo every week it aired and returned this quarter with a premiere episode that attracted 7.6 million viewers. Teen Mom 2 was the #3 original cable series in the 12-34 demo for the quarter and new shows, Ridiculousness, Beavis and Butthead and breakout scripted-hit, Awkward, all placed among the top 25.
MTV also built on a social media dominance, finishing the first quarter as the #1 media network on Facebook, the #1 brand on Foursquare and Tumblr and the most social cable network of 2011 according to SocialGuide. In the current quarter, MTV will see the premieres of a new scripted series, I Just Want My Pants Back, which debuts tonight; the launch of a Jersey Shore spinoff with Pauly D; the return of pop-culture phenomenon, Punk'd and a new season of 16 & Pregnant.
Comedy Central continues to draw its core male audience with great original programming anchored by its dominant late-night block, which is stronger than ever with election 2012 gaining steam. The Daily Show with Jon Stewart turned in a historic performance in the 2011 calendar year, surpassing NBC's The Tonight Show as the #1 late-night show with viewers 18-49 for the first time ever.
For the quarter, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report were the highest-rated and most-watched late-night shows on all of television with male and total viewers aged 18-34. Newcomer, Workaholics, continued to build its fan base, finishing the calendar year as the #1 new comedy on all television with men 18-24. And finally, we renewed South Park through 2016, ensuring a milestone 20 seasons in a landmark animated series.
Comedy Central has great momentum in the current quarter as well. Just this week, we saw the strong season premiere of Tosh.0, which drew 3.1 million viewers as well as the series premiere of new sketch comedy show, Key & Peele, which drew 2.1 million total viewers, making it the biggest series launch on Comedy in more than 2 years.
Despite the measurement issues we mentioned on last quarter's call, Nickelodeon finished the fiscal quarter as the #1 cable network with both kids and total viewers for the 67th consecutive quarter, highlighted by the launch of Kung Fu Panda and the second installment in the Fred TV movie franchise, which averaged 7 million total viewers. On Nick at Nite, our third annual HALO Awards, honoring teens for their commitment to service, delivered the tentpoles' highest ratings ever with teens and tweens. 
This fiscal year, Nickelodeon will premiere more than 500 episodes of original programming, more than ever before, and we will keep layering on new shows to rebuild our rating.  The current quarter has been full of live-action premieres, including iCarly, which has attracted more than 4 million viewers in each of its 3 episodes this quarter and grown ratings in key kids 6-11 demo with each episode. House of Anubis ratings are also climbing steadily with ratings improving 10% in the week following its January premiere. Last Saturday, the premier of Victorious was the #1 program on cable, attracting 3.9 million viewers.
This Saturday, we premiere How to Rock, staring Cymphonique Miller and in March, we'll debut a new TV movie from Big Time Rush, who along with Fresh Beat Band, were 1 of 2 Nickelodeon kids music act to sell out a nationwide concert tour last quarter. Additionally, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. will have new episodes of their gold standard preschool educational programming such as Dora the Explorer and the Bubble Guppies and will launch new series, Mike the Knight and a new CG version of Franklin and friends. Nickelodeon will conclude the quarter with the Kid's Choice Award, hosted this year by Will Smith on March 31.
BET continued to roll as the network built on its lineup of original scripted series with Reed Between the Lines, which ranked in the top 5 among new scripted series on basic cable. The BET Hip Hop Awards 2011 premier in October drew in 4.1 million viewers, making it the most-watched edition of the franchise tentpole in its 60-year history. The current quarter saw the return of Let's Stay Together, which attracted 3.5 million total viewers with its season premiere and smash hit, THE GAME, which debuted its fifth season last month with a premier that attracted 5.3 million viewers, thanks in part to a dynamic social media marketing strategy.
VH1's ratings momentum picked up steam in the first quarter with ratings in primetime up 42% year-over-year and 72% in the key women 18-34 demographic. The current quarter saw the return of hit series, Mob Wives, which attracted 2.4 million total viewers in its premiere broadcast. The 2011 VH1 DIVAS Celebrates Soul broadcast, featuring Mary J. Blige, Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson, scored the franchise's highest rating since it returned in 2009, doubling ratings over last year's show.
Spike continued to broaden its appeal with men of all ages through original hits, including Auction Hunters and Flip Men. The original comedy, Blue Mountain State, delivered its highest-rated season to date, up 20% in the key men 18-34 demo. This quarter, Spike very successfully launched INK MASTER, the Dave Navarro-hosted tattoo competition, which is building into a bona fide major hit. 
TV Land continued to cement its standing as the home of the sitcom on cable with the return of Hot In Cleveland and the premiere of The Exes. In fact, Hot In Cleveland just won the People's Choice Award for favorite cable TV sitcom and star, Betty White, won the Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series. TV Land also picked up a Hot In Cleveland spinoff starring Cedric ""The Entertainer"" and Niecy Nash.
CMT continues to grow its offering of original programming, delivering 4 original series in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, including Sweet Home Alabama. In the current quarter, CMT launched 3 new series, including Bayou Billionaires and My Big Red Neck Vacation, which debuted as the highest-rated original series telecast in CMT history. 
Let's turn now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount, which proudly celebrates its 100th year in 2012 as the oldest studio in Hollywood, ended the calendar year with a record $5.17 billion at the worldwide box office, including its first $1 billion franchise, Transformers. The first fiscal quarter of 2012 was highlighted by the blockbuster performance of Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, which reinvigorated the Tom Cruise-starring franchise under the guidance of director, Brad Bird and producer, J.J. Abrams and is now the-highest grossing Mission: Possible; the successful release of Paranormal Activity 3, which continued the phenomenal profitability of that franchise and the outstanding distribution of Hugo and DreamWorks Animation's Puss In Boots. In the current quarter, we released The Devil Inside, another highly profitable title for us with franchise potential from our Insurge label.
Our original and distributed films also scored a number of Acadamy Award nominations led by Hugo, which scored 11 nominations, including Best Picture and a directing nod for Martin Scorsese. Our very own Rango, as well as both DreamWorks Animation films were nominated for Best Animated Feature Film. 
Looking ahead, Paramount with Fox will rerelease TITANIC digitally remastered in 3D, thanks to a painstaking conversion helmed by director Jim Cameron. Paramount will also release The Dictator, starring Sacha Baron Cohen and directed by Larry Charles, the team behind Borat; and G.I. Joe: Retaliation, the next film in the global franchise starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Channing Tatum. And the studio will build value by supporting our international division's launch of Paramount television channel, the first of which will debut in Spain in the coming months. 
In sum, despite some early headwinds, Viacom is off to a strong start in fiscal 2012. As we move forward, our consistent focus on content and brand building will drive creative momentum across the company in the full freight of original programming launching across our network and in the focus and franchise-centric releases from our studio. We will seek out and seize every opportunity on every platform to monetize our content both in the United States and internationally. And our disciplined operation and management for top and bottom line growth will give us the continued flexibility to invest in content and return substantial capital to our shareholders for many years to come.
With that, I will turn it over to Jimmy."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and Web presentation, summarizing the results of our December quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly.

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and Web presentation, summarizing the results of our December quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. Before I do that, I'd like to note that discontinued operations in the December quarter of this year reflects the $383 million charge related to the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix. In this regard, I would note that we have filed a lawsuit seeking to compel consideration of arguments and evidence that we believe were inappropriately excluded from the dispute resolution process.
Now, let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues increased 3% to $2.4 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 3% and international revenues increased 2% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. 
Page 9 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues declined 3% in the quarter. International advertising declined 4% with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 1 percentage point. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to the timing of event-driven programming.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 16% while international revenues increased 18%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was driven by the availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreement as well as by rate increases from traditional distributors. Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high-single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreement, rate and subscriber increases and new channel launches.
Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 13% in the quarter, principally due to lower home entertainment revenue. Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion in the quarter increased 7% over last year. The operating margin of 46% improved 190 basis points over the prior year.
The improvement in the margin was driven by revenue growth of 3% and a 1% decline in expenses. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to a 2% decline in programming expense, resulting from the timing of new program launches as well as the timing of event-driven programming in the prior year.
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter increased 4% to $1.6 billion. Page 11 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues increased 37% to $570 million in the quarter. The increase in theatrical revenues was principally due to the strength of our current quarter's releases, including Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Paranormal Activity 3 and Puss In Boots. Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 6% to approximately $600 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower revenues from third-party distribution titles, partially offset by the performance of Transformers 3 in international market.
TV license fees increased 9% to approximately $300 million. The increase in TV license fees was due to higher pay-TV revenues, partially offset by lower network TV revenues, resulting from a fewer number of titles available in the quarter. Ancillary revenues declined 46% to $92 million. Ancillary revenues faced difficult comparisons as the prior year benefited from the sale of the distribution rights to Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel. Partially offsetting this were higher consumer products and digital revenues.
Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $31 million in the quarter as compared to income of $68 million last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects the difficult comparison to last year's sale of distribution rights to Marvel as well as the timing of P&A expense related to the theatrical release of Mission: Impossible, partially offset by the international home entertainment performance of Transformers 3. 
Now moving below operating income. Total company equity income from investments was $10 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX, which was partially offset by losses at our Viacom 18 India TV venture that reflect cost associated with our investments in new channel launches. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

Let's talk about our cash flow, our debt profile, the return of capital to our shareholders as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of free cash flow for the quarter, we generated approximately $600 million in operating free cash flow in the December quarter compared to approximately $700 million last year. Page 4 of the Web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher working capital utilization, partially offset by lower cash taxes. The working capital used in the quarter was primarily due to the timing of theatrical releases, including Mission: Impossible III. 
As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost at the quarter end of 5.5%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.
During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rates in the public markets to refinance certain of our higher coupon notes, as well as to maintain our leverage at our target level. We issued $600 million of 3.875% senior notes due in 2021 and $400 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2016. In conjunction with this, we called the $750 million of outstanding of our 6.85% senior notes due in 2055.  The notes were callable at par and were redeemed on January 9. The combination of these actions will lower our interest cost by approximately $20 million on an annual basis. 
In addition, during the quarter, we amended our bank line by improving the pricing and extending the maturity date to December 2015, further enhancing our liquidity. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents.
At December 31, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.95x. As I just mentioned, we redeemed our 6.85% senior notes on January 9. If you pro forma for the redemption at quarter end, our debt and capital leases outstanding would be $7 billion and our leverage ratio would be 1.8x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 10x.
In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $840 million of capital back to our shareholders in the December quarter. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter. So for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, on an annual basis, we continue to see revenue growth in the high single-digit to double-digit range based on 2011 affiliate revenue base, which includes incremental digital agreement. Given that revenue recognition on some of the digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. In the March quarter, we expect the affiliate revenue growth to be in the low-teens.  Our expected growth rate for Media Networks programming expense remains mid- to high-single digits for fiscal 2012. Accordingly, given the pace of programming expense in the December quarter, we anticipate that programming expense will grow in the high-single to low-double-digit percentage range for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Our ongoing expense management will enable us to continue to grow our margin as we invest in our brand. Paramount has achieved global box office success with its latest sequel to the Mission: Impossible franchise. And accordingly, Paramount should see healthy growth in profit in the March quarter as it benefits from the performance of Mission: Impossible as well as from lower print and advertising costs. We continue to expect to realize approximately $100 million in cost savings this year related to the restructuring charge we took back in the September quarter. 
For 2012, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. In terms of cash taxes, given the sunsetting in December of tax benefits related to accelerated deductions of films and TV production, we expect cash taxes to mirror book taxes for the year. As for our stock buyback program, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for the fiscal 2012 year.
Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline. In April, Paramount and Fox will rerelease James Cameron's TITANIC in 3D and in May, the studio will release The Dictator, which stars Sacha Baron Cohen. Paramount will also be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3 in early June.
In addition, the studio has a number of sequels to existing franchises as well as new franchises in development. This summer, the studio will release G.I. Joe 2 and in the fall, they release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. Paramount is working on World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt and One Shot, starring Tom Cruise, which is based on the best-selling novel and Jack Reacher business book series, and J.J. Abrams is currently in production on the next installment of Star Trek. 
To wrap up, we continue to operate with the focus on pursuing organic opportunities in our core businesses. And we remain committed to investing in our brand and strengthening their competitive position. This focus on organic investment, combined with disciplined management of our core structure, will enable us to drive earning per share and drive free cash flow. We are encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands and franchises. The addition of new distribution partners on digital platforms, the opportunity to grow our international business and profitability and the ability to develop franchises with consumer products appeal will enhance our long-term growth. In addition, we remain committed to an aggressive capital return program of share buyback and dividend, which we believe will drive value for our shareholders over the long-term.
I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions."

And we don't think that the availability of the limited amount of Nickelodeon library content that we have on Netflix has had a significant impact on the ratings. Again, remember, the Netflix universe is a rather small fraction of the overall television household numbers, number one. And number two, yes, we do get data on our streams and the both the number of Netflix subscribers and the number of Nickelodeon content streams were pretty much the same between the summer and the fall. So there was no real change that accounted for the fall drop, which we did not see in the summer. So there could have been some minimal impact, but it certainly does not account for the range drop that we saw. We -- as I said on the last call, we believe there was some ratings systemic issues. Again, I don't want to belabor it because we did in the last call. But the pretty extensive set-top-box data that we have does in no way reflect what we're seeing in the Nielsen measurement. That being said, that's the environment we're operating in and we're going to attack it as we always do, and which is to go after our audience. And we'll go after that new Nielsen sample and we'll -- the programs will appeal. And I'm confident that as the year progresses, you will see improvement in Nickelodeon's ratings. And again, finally, on that point, it did impact last quarter's ad revenues in a significant way. But as I said again on the last call, that was the significant quarter, where that has a big impact. In the remainder of the fiscal year, we have a low proportion of ad sales that are tied-in to Nickelodeon, and we have more unit availabilities in the quarters than you have in that multi-week period leading up to the holidays in the fourth calendar quarter, our first fiscal quarter."

And of course, when we launch a movie, we want to build that brand quickly. Clearly, we supplement that with social media. But studio spending, there were a lot of titles in the quarter. Studio spending was strong in this past quarter. That was really not an issue. That's not where the demand problem resided. As far as display advertising online, there's clearly -- within that digital marketplace, there's clearly a lot more availability. You saw the Facebook numbers and how they're growing their display advertising numbers. It's certainly taking the wind out of some of their online competitors in display advertising. And it's certainly impacting pricing display advertising in that there's a much larger availability. There's almost unlimited availability of that kind of advertising as opposed to the somewhat tighter or much tighter television market, where there is scarcity for advertisers who want to be on the top shows, the top networks and the ones where viewers have an affinity to the brand and pay more attention than they do with much of display advertising."

I was asked in a December conference to look forward for the company over the next 5 years with the framework, I was asked. And what I said then and I would reiterate today is last year, we did about $200 million of operating income in our international Media Networks. And I expect that to at least triple to quadruple over the next 5 years. And you -- we've reorganized our operations to be much more effective in developing networks and creating revenue opportunities. The digital opportunity international is really significant and opens up avenues for us that were previously closed, where it was more difficult to distribute our content. India is a very successful joint venture. We had great success with the existing networks. We are investing. And as we indicated in our remarks in the last quarter, we -- it was not -- had we just stuck with our existing networks, it would have been a profitable quarter for India, but we chose to invest and build on our strength to launch several networks, and we think we're going to create huge value there. Latin America is a market with a lot of opportunity. We just launched the comedy brand in both Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. So we launched comedy yesterday. We have a lot of opportunities around the world. I think very rapidly in the next 2 to 3 years, you will see in many, many, many countries Paramount channels. The first will be in Spain. We have several others lined up. There's a lot of demand for the library movie channels and of course, Paramount is an exceptional library and brand. So I see a lot of opportunity in emerging markets with opening them up and opportunities in existing markets to launch more of our brands."

They see how advertising in Nickelodeon moves their product, and I think that's a good understanding of what the issues are out there. So we expect a strong upfront for Nickelodeon. As far as exploiting our film library, yes, Paramount, yes, of course, and Lionsgate both very committed to EPIX and some of our older library titles. So we are available to license on other paid services and we have been doing well competitively there. This is -- so the Paramount library, which is of extraordinary quality and continue to build on quality with the new films we're releasing is -- will be a mother lode of opportunity for Paramount for many, many years to come and will be the foundation for building some very valuable assets, EPIX in the U.S. and the Paramount film channels around the world, and we continue to look for more opportunities to monetize those film.

Viacom delivered yet another strong performance in the second quarter of our fiscal year. Across our divisions, we sharpened our focus on execution and efficiency, while continuing to invest in content and connects with audiences worldwide.
A few opening points. Consistent investment and content keeps our brands creatively vibrant and culturally relevant. This fiscal year, our Media Networks are launching and developing more original programming than ever across multiple formats from reality to scripted, live action to animation.
Our programming pipeline has never been more diverse or more tailored to the taste of our audiences. Our affiliate revenue is strong and growing, thanks to brands that remain must carry content for existing and emerging distributors alike.
We are seeing encouraging signs of a strengthening ad market, as we enter the upfront season. Overseas, we continue to make great progress in pursuit of our ambitious targets for expansion and operating income growth, particularly as we increase our offerings for adult audiences with Comedy Central and with the new Paramount Channels, while continuing to expand the Nickelodeon brand.
Paramount Pictures is cementing its reputation as one of the best run studios in Hollywood, capturing efficiencies even as it unlocks value from innovative and highly profitable releases, including the double insight of the second quarter.
Finally, by monetizing our content and our brands and tightly managing costs, we continue to maintain one of the best balance sheet in the business. Our consistent ability to generates substantial free cash flow reinforces our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.
This morning, I will give an overview of our financial results for the second quarter and review highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide additional detail and then we'll open it up  to questions.
First, the numbers. Viacom's consolidated revenues grew 2% to $3.33 billion in the second quarter, driven by growth in our Media Networks segment. Operating income increased 23% and $932 million. Our Media Networks delivered 5% growth in revenues and an 11% increase in adjusted operating income on strong increases in affiliate revenues.
Film Entertainment revenues decreased 5% reflecting lower theatrical revenue due to a less widely distributed mix of releases in the same period last year, which featured significant hits, Rango, No Strings Attached and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never.
Adjusted operating income in Filmed Entertainment increased 195%, driven by lower distribution costs, which more than offset lower revenue. Our adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $535 million in the March quarter and adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.98, up 36% over the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased $700 million in stock under our share repurchase program. We expect to buy back $700 million in stock again this quarter and are on track to purchase $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year.
Our Media Networks remains strong and creatively vibrant, with our nearly $3 billion fiscal year investment in content yielding a greater output of new, original, wholly-owned content than at any time in Viacom's history. In this stage of timeshifting and on-demand viewing across platforms, the value of fresh and compelling original content is greater than ever.
All of our networks are tapping rich development pipelines set by strong brand filters and deep consumer insights. As we pop out more content, we continue to innovate how we market, distribute and build experiences around programming across platforms. Our brands are well out in front in experimentation and advances in social networking applied to television content. In ad sales, we begun to see signs of recovery in the marketplace. We were able to capitalize on this improvement and return to growth domestically. For the quarter, our domestic advertising revenues increased 1%. Worldwide advertising revenues were flat at $1.07 billion for the quarter. We remain encouraged by what we're seeing and expect to capture new opportunities in the market as we head into the upfront season.
I want to point out that for our fiscal third quarter, there are 2-event timing issues that will reduce year-on-year domestic ad sales quarterly comps by a total of about 3 to 4 percentage points. This year, the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards took place in the second quarter and the BET awards will air early in the fiscal fourth quarter, both aired in the third quarter last year.
Distribution continue to be a strong and steady driver of revenue for Viacom. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased 17%, driven by higher revenues from digital distribution agreements, as well as rate increases. During the quarter, we successfully closed a number of digital distribution deals, including an agreement to provide library content to Amazon for its prime instant video service.
We also increased distribution with our existing affiliates with a particular focus on gaining distribution for our HD simulcast. In particular, we made significant gains in TV Land HD.
For our 2012 fiscal year, we expect to grow affiliate revenue by 10%. Our Media Networks remain first choice partners for distributors as they test in market new products and technology. We continue to build on our strong VOD offering by striking agreements to provide additional library content, as well as current episodes from some of our most popular brands and franchises. We remain committed to supporting our distribution partners multi-platform effort with authenticated sites offering on-demand content for MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, VH1 and SPIKE, a BET-authenticated site will launch soon.
We're also exploring opportunities to connect with consumers with tablet devices, a recent study by our strategic insights and research group uncovered that tablets have surpassed laptops as the second screen of choice among consumers. Currently, we partner with Cablevision to make linear fits of our networks available to its in-home streaming tablet app. As we strengthen our existing partnerships, we are aggressively pursuing new distributors for both our long and short-form content.
Internationally, we're moving ahead decisively in our drive to expand our reach in revenue our around the globe. Viacom international Media Networks turned in another strong performance, powered by affiliate revenue growth in both organic and visual distribution and excellent cost management. We set ambitious goals for our international operations. As I've said on prior occasions, we're aiming for margins exceeding 20% in the next fiscal year and OI growth at a 30% compounded rate over the next 5 years. I'm pleased to report that we're very much on track to achieve these goals and we expect to exceed that OI growth rate this year.
Our growing adult-focused business will be a key driver of this growth. We made great progress in the second quarter. Ratings of our international Comedy Central channels were up 35%. In the last 6 months, we've launched 5 new Comedy channels, most recently in Russia, which now puts the network in 5 continents and more than 40 countries.
We debut our first ever Paramount channel in Spain at the end of the second quarter, opening a new Chapter in our international expansions strategy. Based on audience share during its first month, the Paramount Channel is the successful digital terrestrial television channel launched in Spain in the past 12 months and the country's second most successful DTT launch of all time. The channel premiere on March 30 with titles, including The Godfather Trilogy, Breakfast at Tiffany's and American Beauty. We're on target to sign 80 advertisers for the free-to-air channel in each of its first 2 months of operation, with one successful launch under our belt, we're looking to move quickly on future launches in additional markets.
Even as we expand to new markets, we're strengthening our presence in existing ones. We had a very strong quarter in the U.K., one of our most important markets. Range were up 1% a MTV U.K., thanks to Jersey Shore, which just concluded its second season as the highest-rated series ever for the channel. Comedy Central rates are up 67%, thanks to strong U.S.-based acquired programming and our local original, Threesome. Finally, Nickelodeon U.K., as well as the Nick brand and many markets around the world saw ratings gains, driven by Victoria's with strong pipeline in the current quarter as well.
Turning now to ratings highlights from our domestic Media Networks. MTV remains strong with its millennial audience. The network was #1 with its core 12-34 demo in its key 10-spot prime time slots where closest competitor by nearly 50%. For the quarter, MTV had 3 of the top 10 cable series in its core demo, including the returning champ Jersey Shore along with Teen Mom 2 and challenge battle of The Exes. We expect MTV's ratings for the current quarter to grow year-on-year.
MTV also continue to prove its expertise in moving content across platforms, reaching its audiences in innovative new ways through digital events, franchises, social media and mobile. MTV achieved a rare milestone in the second quarter when it surpassed 100 million likes, that's 100 likes on Facebook according to social media tracking firm, Trender. Add to that, it's nearly 6 million Twitter followers and it's top ranking on Foursquare, Tumblr and Instagram and MTV is the #1 most social TV brand.
Comedy Central continues to contract with its core male audience with a diversified slate of originals, specials, stand-up comedy and the unstoppable late-night tandem of Stuart and Colbert. TouchPoint recently concluded its winter season as the #1 show on Tuesday nights on all of television with the networks key men 18-34 demo. The network launched another original hit in the second quarter with sketch series Key & Peele which won its timeslot with men 18-34 in its debut season. Key & Peele will return for a second season in the fall, boasting with many, including the President himself in a recent interview believe to be the best President Obama impersonation on television.
In late-night, the daily show with Jon Stewart and Colbert Report achieved the distinction of being the only late-night talk shows to notch year-over-year growth with adults 18-49. The Daily Show is the #1 late-night talkshow in that demo beating of broadcast and cable competition.
Nickelodeon retained its top spot in the second quarter as the #1 cable network in total. SpongeBob was the #1 animated program on all of television with kids 2  to 11, while iCarly was the #1 kid's program among total viewers. The second quarter also saw the return of the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Award, which in its 25th year reached 15 million total viewers and generated a record 223 million votes online hosted by Will Smith and featuring performances by Katy Perry and OneDirection, the Casey a made a leap into a truly global juggernaut this year, earning its highest ratings ever by a wide margin in key markets, including the U.K., Germany and Australia.
The upcoming launch of the reinvented Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise in the fall is just one element of Nickelodeon's largest slate of original content ever, more than 650 episodes of returning hits and new series overall into 2012-2013 season. In the second quarter, Nick introduced How to Rock, starting Cymphonique Miller, which debuted as the #1 new show in 2012 with teens 9 to 14. Fred The Show which successfully expanded the Fred franchise as the #1 new live-action show with kids 2 to 11 and big time movies starting Big Time Rush, which attracted 26 million total viewers over its Pentecost.
In the current quarter, Nickelodeon debuted animated series The Legend of cora, to 4.5 million total viewers successfully channeling the cult following up of Avatar: the Last Airbender to create the breakout hit.
Cora is Nickelodeon's most-watched animated series premiere in 3 years. Also coming this quarter are new episodes of iCarly, Victorias, SpongeBob and the new original TV movie Rags starting Palmer. And we will continue to pilot on. Nickelodeon is poised to become bigger and better than ever and continues to be an important locomotive of our international and consumer products expansion.
BET continue its reign as the #1 ad-supported cable network for African-Americans 18-49. In the second quarter, the network showed further improve both its prowess in launching buzzworthy tentpole. The 2012 BET Honors were the #1 BET Honors broadcast of all-time, up 69% over last year's show, with 2.5 million total viewers.
The show is a big social driver, with more than 20 separate related topics trending on Twitter during the broadcast. The network's original sitcoms also continued to perform well. For the calendar year-to-date, The Game and Let's Stay Together are the top 2 sitcoms on ad-supported cable among African-American and total viewers.
Throughout our history, our networks, all of our networks have demonstrated an uncanny capacity for reinvention. Across our brands, we've enhanced our ability to develop creative content to a systematic approach, conduct relentless consumer research and refined brand filters based on the evolving taste and needs of the audience.
VH1 Spike in CMT, 3 networks we've earmarked for evolution in recent years, continue to build strong momentum behind this approach. VH1 is shining again. The second quarter was VH1's highest rated quarter in 2 years, with ratings up 37% in prime. The network's third consecutive quarter ratings growth was highlighted by its performance in Monday Prime Time, where it was tops in all cable among women 18-49. The original PIN tiny, The Family Hassle attracted on average 2.4 million total viewers in episode, the highest rated debut season on VH1 in nearly 3 years while 11 Hip Hop 2 scores the network's highest rated series in more than 3.5 years.
VH1 also affirmed its status as pop-culture bellwether, with Of The Moment specials, including Whitney Houston Diva up and greatest women in music, as well as new episodes of behind the music, which scored strong ratings.
VH1 should continue to roll this quarter with the premieres of new series, including Mob Wives Chicago and Couple's Rehab and the return of scripted-hit series, Single Lady. Spike is making great progress as it broaden its appeal with men through more original programming. It's a first quarter with a new USC programming, the network retained its connection with the MMA community through the launch of MMA Uncensored Live, TVs highest-rated MMA news program. Spike also committed to a multi-year extension of its strategic partnership with TNA Entertainment's Impact Wrestling.

The network earns its biggest ratings in primetime since the fourth quarter of 2009, its highest-rated original film in 3 years with Whiskey Business and the highest rated Crossroads episode in 7 years featuring Steven Tyler and Carrie Underwood.
TV Land continues to build the best lineup of original sitcoms on cable. With the show in it's third season, Hans Cleveland's Betty White, won here second consecutive Award for outstanding performance in a comedy the series. The Soul Man, a Han Cleveland spin-off starring Cedric Entertainer and Nash, will debut in June along the with The Exes starring Kristen Johnson, Donald and Wayne.
Meanwhile, Logo posted highest record quarter ever, thanks to the ongoing success of Drag Race, now in its fourth season. Let's turn now to Filmed Entertainment.
Paramount entered its milestone 100th year of operation to resounding critical recognition in Hollywood. Paramount sales were nominated for 18 Academy Awards, winning 6, good for second-best,  among all studios. Martin Scorsese's Hugo, won 5 Oscars, tie for the highest number of wins for a single film, while Gore Verbinski's Rango, took home the award for Best Animated Film.
In terms of theatrical releases, Paramount again showed its ability to launch profitable franchises with the dividend decide we the studio insert label.

Paramount also announced this quarter that it will release Katy Perry: Part Of Me, which will bring Katy to the big screen for the first time ever in 3D on July 5. And in surge and MTV film, Part of Me is a great example of the type of low cost, quick-to-market films that combined with Paramount's franchise-centric film to create the studio strategically balanced and focused release slate.
Beyond the big screen, Paramount continues to add value across Viacom, not only in its partnership for our international division and Nickelodeon but also through EPIX, which continues to increase in value.
To close, the second quarter of our 2012 fiscal year was another strong one for Viacom. We again demonstrated our consistent ability to deliver great financial results and strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to invest in content to develop the most compelling programming, networks and films for our audiences. As we do, we'll manage  our operations for maximum effectiveness and efficiency. This year and over the next several years, our strategy is to drive continued topline and bottom-line growth, with particular acceleration in the international arena.
And over the next several years, we will continue to implement our commitment to return significant capital to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy."

I hope you all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing our results of our March quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's March quarter excludes a loss associated with the redemption of our 6.85% senior notes due 2055, which was $21 million on a pretax basis and $13 million after-tax, as well as $66 million of discrete tax benefit.
Last year's March quarter excluded the charge associated with the tender proportion of our 6.25% senior notes due 2016, which was $87 million on a pretax basis and $54 million after-tax. Now let's take a look at our segment results.
At our Media Networks segment, revenues increased 5% to $2.2 billion in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenues were up 5%. Foreign exchange had 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 10 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 1% in the quarter. International advertising declined 9%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 4 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 15%, while international revenues increased 24%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was driven by the availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreement, as well as by rate increases.
Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single-digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreement, rate and subscriber increases and new channel launches. Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 19% in the quarter principally due to lower Home Entertainment revenue. Media Networks adjusted operating income of $893 million in the quarter increased 11% over last year. The operating margin of 41% improved approximately 200 basis points over the prior year.
The improvement in the margin was driven by topline growth of 5%, partially offset by a 2% increase in expenses. Within expenses, programming expenses grew 8%, while SG&A expense declined 5%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense and savings from our 2011 restructuring, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion expense.
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 5% to $1.2 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 19% to $326 million in the quarter. The decrease in theatrical revenues was principally due to a less widely distributed mix of releases in the current quarter as compared to the releases in the March quarter of last year. This decline was partially offset by higher carryover revenues a from the December quarter slate, which included Mission Impossible 4. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues decreased -- increased 1% to $415 million in the quarter. TV license fees were down 6% to $317 million. The decrease in TV license fees in the quarter was principally due to the availability in mix of title. Ancillary revenues increased 41% to $111 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher digital revenues.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $115 million in the quarter as compared to income of $39 million last year. The increase in operating income principally reflects lower print and advertising costs.
Now moving below operating income. Total company equity income from investments was $5 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%. Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to focus my remarks on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I also want to talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year.
In terms of our free cash flow for the quarter, we generated $869 million of operating free cash flow in the March quarter compared to $812 million last year. Page 5 of the Web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow.
The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income, partially offset by an unfavorable working capital variance and higher cash tax payment. The unfavorable working capital variance in the quarter was impacted by increased participation payments primarily related to Mission Impossible 4 and Transformers 3.
As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 5.1%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago, so we're making great progress on lowering our average cost of debt.
To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we're funding these in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We have no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.
As we noted in our last call on January 9, we redeemed at par, the $750 million outstanding of our 6.85% senior notes due in 2055. During the quarter, we also took advantage of the attractive rates in the public markets to maintain our leverage at our target level. We issued $500 million of 1.25% senior notes that are due in 2015 and $250 million of 4.5% senior notes due in 2042.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding on approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. At march 31, our $2.1 billion dollars bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 1.9x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of our quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 11x.
In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of $837 million of capital back to our shareholders in the March quarter.
Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the June quarter. So for the first 9 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, given that revenue recognition on some of the digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. Accordingly, in the June quarter, we expect affiliate revenue to be down slightly compared to the prior year. However, affiliate revenue will return to double-digit growth in the September quarter.
As Philippe mentioned, we have some timing factors in terms of average size. The Kids' Choice Awards benefited the March quarter and the BET Awards will benefit the September quarter of this year. Whereas last year, both of these events benefited our June quarter. These factors in combination, with the lapping of strong digital revenues in the prior year, will result in slightly lower Media Networks revenues in the June quarter.
However, this should set us up nicely in terms of revenue growth for our September quarter. At this point in the year, we have a fair amount of clarity on our programming expenses at Media Networks and expect it to grow mid-single digits for the full year. Given the pace of programming expense in the first half of the year, we anticipate that programming expense will grow in the high single-digit percentage range for the back half of the year.
Given our ongoing expense management, we expect to grow our margins at Media Networks for fiscal 2012. In terms of the back half of the year, given the timing of revenue that I just spoke about, margin expansion will occur in the September quarter.
For 2012, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%, and we expect that cash taxes will mirror book taxes for the year. As for our stock buyback program, we are on track to repurchase $2.8 billion for fiscal 2012. Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline in May, we will release The Dictator, which stars Sacha Baron Cohen and Paramount will also be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3 in early June and in July, they will release Katy  Perry movie Part of Me in 3D.
As a core part of this strategy, the studio continues to develop a number of new franchises, as well as equals to existing franchise. On June 29, the studio releases G.I. Joe 2 and in the fall, they'll release the fourth installment of our Paranormal Activity. In December, Paramount releases One Shot starring Tom Cruise, which is based on the best-selling novel and Jack Reacher book series. And in the summer of 2013, we are looking forward to the next installment of Star Trek, which is in 3D and the release of World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt.
Looking further out, Paramount is developing a Nickelodeon branded live-action movie based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, which is scheduled to hit theaters in December of 2013 and in conjunction with the significant consumer product initiative. In addition, the studio is working on a CGI-animated SpongeBob movie and they recently announced the sequel to Ackerman, where they will reunite the original cast of Will Farell and Steve Carell and Paul Rudd.
Wrapping up, we remain focused on the levers that drive long-term value. From an operational standpoint, we are investing in organic growth initiative, including expanding our international businesses, developing franchises with consumer products appeal and investing in our brands in order to strengthen their competitive position.
There are incremental opportunities to monetize our brands and franchises on a worldwide basis as we continue to see demand for our content from new distributors on digital platforms. We remain disciplined in managing our operating expenses and drive the efficiencies throughout our businesses in order to enhance our margins and drive earnings per share and free cash flow.
In addition, we are committed to an aggressive capital return program of share buyback and dividend, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders over the long term. I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?"

There's been a lot of people putting out series on Nickelodeon ratings issues. There is no silver bullet, I mean there's a lot of focus by a particular analyst, which is a reverberated elsewhere about the Nickelodeon having some library content on Netflix in particular. Just a few steps on that. And by the way, we are getting nice revenues through these SVOD deals. Netflix is present in less than 1/4 of television households and since we get the streaming data on our content, I can tell you that the time spent on Nickelodeon content on Netflix is approximately 2% of the time spent on our Nickelodeon channel. So even if you view that as being completely kind of ballistic, which is, of course, is not, it serves our customers in places where they might not otherwise be able to watch television and thus serve some promotional value. It would have a minimal impact here. So our approach is to address the issues as we have in the past, BET and MTV, for example, will subsequently reached all-time high in their history ratings, to approach it with content, research, market marketing and building up the brand. Clearly, there are some ratings measurement issues we just talked about in prior calls but we're going to focus on ways in which we can affect the Nickelodeon brand positively. As I mentioned in my remarks, Nickelodeon continues to expand, create value for our distribution and marketing partners alike in the United States and around the world. So we feel very, very good about the direction of the pipeline, it's extremely strong. We're developing more new shows of a popular series and more exciting new series and of course, we're particularly excited about the revival of Eternal franchise.

There are several film makers who are would like to see Paramount in film distribution of their films  So we will go just great and Paramount Hasbro Channel really managed through this strategically and tactically extremely well. As far as international growth, clearly there's some weakness in a number of European markets economically, which has an impact on the revenue category, of course. But we are seeing nice growth as you can see in affiliate revenues, and that really is due to our ability to expand our brands in more and more countries to get ratings success. Comedy, Nickelodeon has been particularly successful. U.K., we've got great success across-the-board. And as Paramount Channel is going through a lot of momentum. I expect that the Paramount channel will be distributed in the next 2  to 3 years across a very wide base of our distribution, across many, many countries. I've never seen as much activity to at grand I travel from around the world as Paramount Channel. The movies resonates, they work well around the world.

We're also committed as we have over the last several years, including through the recession and increasing our investment in programming. We do call it investment even though it appears on an accounting standpoint as an expense. And as we've said, we're going to do it consistently across our portfolio at mid-single digits rate, which is what we target. Now that means because we have so many networks, that we can grow it a little more for particular networks where needed and added a little less in networks where it's not needed. We're also changing the mix of our program. We've been coming off some expenses, third-party licensing deals and we're shifting those dollars, which were not very efficiently deployed, given the lower resonance of generally speaking of network programming. We were able to deploy those dollars to relatively inexpensive original programming, which speaks more to our brands. So that those 2 factors combined will allow us to increase our investment programming but do it in a way that doesn't damage our margins as we go forward. And as far as other expenses, we'll continue to keep a tight lid on them. And more importantly, we're going to focus on growing our revenues. And we have a lot of opportunities to do it. We have, of course, the affiliate revenue line I talked about over the next several years, we expect to grow our consumer products revenue, our international revenues will grow. And our ad revenues as the market and ratings in certain areas continue to improve. So we feel that we'll be able to continue to maintain and improve our margins as we go forward."

Viacom delivered yet another strong performance in the second quarter of our fiscal year. Across our divisions, we sharpened our focus on execution and efficiency, while continuing to invest in content and connects with audiences worldwide.
A few opening points. Consistent investment and content keeps our brands creatively vibrant and culturally relevant. This fiscal year, our Media Networks are launching and developing more original programming than ever across multiple formats, from reality to scripted, live action to animation. Our programming pipeline has never been more diverse or more tailored to the taste of our audiences. Our affiliate revenue is strong and growing, thanks to brands that remain must carry content for existing and emerging distributors alike.
We are seeing encouraging signs of a strengthening ad market as we enter the upfront season. Overseas, we continue to make great progress in pursuit of our ambitious targets for expansion and operating income growth, particularly as we increase our offerings for adult audiences with Comedy Central and with the new Paramount Channels, while continuing to expand the Nickelodeon brand. Paramount Pictures is cementing its reputation as one of the best run studios in Hollywood, capturing efficiencies even as it unlocks value from innovative and highly profitable releases, including the double insight of the second quarter.
Finally, by monetizing our content and our brands and tightly managing costs, we continue to maintain one of the best balance sheets in the business. Our consistent ability to generate substantial free cash flow reinforces our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.
This morning, I will give an overview of our financial results for the second quarter and review highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide additional detail, and then we'll open it up  to questions.
First, the numbers. Viacom's consolidated revenues grew 2% to $3.33 billion in the second quarter, driven by growth in our Media Networks segment. Operating income increased 23% to $932 million. Our Media Networks delivered 5% growth in revenues and an 11% increase in adjusted operating income on strong increases in affiliate revenues. 
Filmed Entertainment revenue decreased 5%, reflecting lower theatrical revenue due to a less widely distributed mix of releases in the same period last year, which featured significant hits, Rango, No Strings Attached and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. Adjusted operating income in Filmed Entertainment increased 195%, driven by lower distribution costs, which more than offset lower revenue. Our adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $535 million in the March quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.98, up 36% over the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased $700 million in stock under our share repurchase program. We expect to buy back $700 million in stock again this quarter and are on track to purchase $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year.
Our Media Networks remains strong and creatively vibrant, with our nearly $3 billion fiscal year investment in content, yielding a greater output of new, original, wholly-owned content than at any time in Viacom's history. In this stage of time-shifting and on-demand viewing across platforms, the value of fresh and compelling original content is greater than ever.
All of our networks are tapping rich development pipelines set by strong brand filters and deep consumer insights. As we pop out more content, we continue to innovate how we market, distribute and build experiences around programming across platforms. Our brands are well out in front in experimentation and advances in social networking applied to television content. 
In ad sales, we begun to see signs of recovery in marketplace. We were able to capitalize on this improvement and return to growth domestically. For the quarter, our domestic advertising revenues increased 1%. Worldwide advertising revenues were flat at $1.07 billion for the quarter. We remain encouraged by what we're seeing and we expect to capture new opportunities in the market as we head into the upfront season.
I want to point out that for our fiscal third quarter, there are 2 event timing issues that will reduce year-on-year domestic ad sales quarterly comps by a total of about 3 to 4 percentage points. This year, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards took place in the second quarter and the BET Awards will air early in the fiscal fourth quarter, both aired in the third quarter last year.
Distribution continue to be a strong and steady driver of revenue for Viacom. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased 17%, driven by higher revenues from digital distribution agreements, as well as rate increases. During the quarter, we successfully closed a number of digital distribution deals, including an agreement to provide library content to Amazon for its Prime Instant Video service. We also increased distribution with our existing affiliates, with a particular focus on gaining distribution for our HD simulcast. In particular, we made significant gains in carriage of TV Land HD. For our 2012 fiscal year, we expect to grow affiliate revenue by 10%. 
Our Media Networks remain first choice partners for distributors as they test in market new products and technologies. We continue to build on our strong VOD offering by striking agreements to provide additional library content, as well as current episodes through some of our most popular brands and franchises. We remain committed to supporting our distribution partners multi-platform efforts, with authenticated sites offering on-demand content for MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, VH1 and SPIKE. A BET-authenticated site will launch soon.
We're also exploring opportunities to connect with consumers through tablet devices. A recent study by our strategic insights and research group uncovered that tablets have surpassed laptops as the second screen of choice among consumers. Currently, we partner with Cablevision to make linear feeds of our networks available to its in-home streaming tablet app. As we strengthen our existing partnerships, we are aggressively pursuing new distributors for both our long- and short-form content.
Internationally, we're moving ahead decisively in our drive to expand our reach in revenue around the globe. Viacom international media networks turned in another strong performance, powered by affiliate revenue growth in both organic and visual distribution and excellent cost management. We set ambitious goals for our international operations. As I've said on prior occasions, we're aiming for margins exceeding 20% in the next fiscal year and OI growth at a 30% compounded rate over the next 5 years. I'm pleased to report that we're very much on track to achieve these goals and we expect to exceed that OI growth rate this year.
Our growing adult-focused business will be a key driver of this growth. We made great progress in the second quarter. Ratings of our international Comedy Central channels were up 35%. In the last 6 months, we've launched 5 new comedy channels, most recently in Russia, which now puts the network in 5 continents and more than 40 countries.
We debuted our first-ever Paramount Channel in Spain at the end of the second quarter, opening a new chapter in our international expansion strategy. Based on audience share during its first month, the Paramount Channel is the most successful digital terrestrial television channel launched in Spain in the past 12 months and the country's second most successful DTT launch of all time. The channel premiere on March 30 with titles including The Godfather trilogy, Breakfast at Tiffany's and American Beauty. We're on target to sign 80 advertisers for the free-to-air channel in each of its first 2 months of operation. With one successful launch under our belt, we're looking to move quickly on future launches in additional markets.
Even as we expand to new markets, we're strengthening our presence in existing ones. We had a very strong quarter in the U.K., one of our most important markets. Ratings were up 21% at MTV U.K., thanks to Jersey Shore, which just concluded its second season as the highest-rated series ever for the channel. Comedy Central ratings are up 67%, thanks to strong U.S.-based acquired programming and our local original comedy, Threesome. Finally, Nickelodeon U.K., as well as the Nick brand in many markets around the world, saw ratings gains, driven by iCarly and Victorious, with a strong pipeline in the current quarter as well.
Turning now to ratings highlights from our domestic Media Networks. MTV remains strong with its millennial audience. The network was #1 with its core 12-34 demo in its key 10-spot prime time slots, where it beat its closest competitor by nearly 50%. For the quarter, MTV had 3 of the top 10 cable series in its core demo, including the returning champ, Jersey Shore, along with Teen Mom 2 and Challenge: Battle Of The Exes. We expect MTV's ratings for the current quarter to grow year-on-year.
MTV also continue to prove its expertise in moving content across platforms, reaching its audiences in innovative new ways through digital events, franchises, social media and mobile. MTV achieved a rare milestone in the second quarter when it surpassed 100 million likes, that's 100 million likes on Facebook according to social media tracking firm, Trendrr. Add to that, it's nearly 6 million Twitter followers and it's top ranking on Foursquare, Tumblr and Instagram, and MTV is the #1 most social TV brand.
Comedy Central continues to connect with its core male audience with a diversified slate of originals, specials, stand-up comedy and the unstoppable late-night tandem of Stewart and Colbert. 
Tosh.0 recently concluded its winter season as the #1 show on Tuesday nights on all of television with the networks key men 18-34 demo. 
The network launched another original hit in the second quarter with sketch series Key & Peele which won its timeslot with men 18-34 in its debut season. Key & Peele will return for a second season in the fall, boasting with many, including the President himself in a recent interview believe to be the best President Obama impersonation on television.
In late night, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report achieved the distinction of being the only late-night talk shows to notch year-over-year growth with adults 18-49. The Daily Show is the #1 late-night talk show in the demo, beating all broadcast and cable competition.
Nickelodeon retained its top spot in the second quarter as the #1 cable network in total day. SpongeBob was the #1 animated program on all of television with kids 2-11, while iCarly was the #1 kid's program among total viewers. The second quarter also saw the return of the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards which, in its 25th year, reached 15 million total viewers and generated a record 223 million votes online, hosted by Will Smith and featuring performances by Katy Perry and One Direction, the KCA's made a leap into a truly global juggernaut this year, earning its highest ratings ever by a wide margin in key markets, including the U.K., Germany and Australia.
The upcoming launch of the reinvented Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise in the fall is just one element of Nickelodeon's largest slate of original content ever. More than 650 episodes of returning hits and new series overall in 2012, 2013 season. 
In the second quarter, Nick introduced How to Rock, starting Cymphonique Miller, which debuted as the #1 new show of 2012 with tweens 9-14. FRED: THE SHOW, which successfully expanded the Fred Figglehorn franchise as the #1 new live-action show with kids 2-11, and Big Time Movie starting Big Time Rush, which attracted 26 million total viewers over its telecast.
In the current quarter, Nickelodeon debuted animated series The Legend of Korra to 4.5 million total viewers successfully channeling the cult following of Avatar: the Last Airbender to create a breakout hit.
Korra is Nickelodeon's most-watched animated series premiere in 3 years. Also coming this quarter are new episodes of iCarly, Victorious, SpongeBob and the new original TV movie Rags starting Keke Palmer, and we will continue to pilot on. Nickelodeon is poised to become bigger and better than ever and continues to be an important locomotive of our international and consumer products expansion.
BET continued its reign as the #1 ad-supported cable network for African-Americans 18-49. In the second quarter, the network showed further proof of its prowess in launching buzz-worthy tentpole. The 2012 BET Honors were the #1 BET Honors broadcast of all-time, up 69% over last year's show, with 2.5 million total viewers. The show is a big social driver, with more than 20 separate artists-related topics trending on Twitter during the broadcast. The network's original sitcoms also continued to perform well. For the calendar year-to-date, THE GAME and Let's Stay Together are the top 2 sitcoms on ad-supported cable among African-American and total viewers.
Throughout our history, our networks, all of our networks have demonstrated an uncanny capacity for reinvention. Across our brands, we've enhanced our ability to develop creative content through a systematic approach, conduct relentless consumer research and refined brand filters based on the evolving tastes and needs of the audience.
VH1, SPIKE and CMT, 3 networks we've earmarked for evolution in recent years, continue to build strong momentum behind this approach. VH1 is shining again. The second quarter was VH1's highest-rated quarter in 2 years, with ratings up 37% in prime. The network's third consecutive quarter ratings growth was highlighted by its performance in Monday prime time, where it was tops in all cable among women 18-49. The original T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle attracted on average 2.4 million total viewers in episode, the highest-rated debut season on VH1 in nearly 3 years, while Love & Hip Hop 2 scores the network's highest-rated series in more than 3.5 years.
VH1 also affirmed its status as pop-culture bellwether, with of the moment specials including Whitney Houston: Death Of A Diva and Greatest Women In Music, as well as new episodes of behind the music, which scored strong ratings.
VH1 should continue to roll this quarter with the premieres of new series, including Mob Wives: Chicago and Couples Rehab and the return of scripted-hit series, Single Ladies. 
SPIKE is making great progress as it broadens its appeal with men through more original programming. In it's first quarter with a new USC programming, the network retained its connection with the MMA community through the launch of MMA Uncensored Live, TV's highest-rated MMA news program. SPIKE also committed to a multi-year extension of its strategic partnership with TNA Entertainment's IMPACT Wrestling.
SPIKE's line-up of original programming gained ground in the second quarter. Breakout hit INK MASTER continue to perform well and new series of American Digger, starting Ric Savage, premiere to 1.2 million viewers, making it SPIKE's most-watched half-hour reality premiere in more than 3 years
CMT delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, featuring the 2 highest-rated series debuts in networks history, like Big Redneck Vacation and Bayou Billionaires. The network earns its best ratings in prime time since the fourth quarter of 2009, its highest-rated original film in 3 years with Whiskey Business and the highest-rated Crossroads episode in 7 years, featuring Steven Tyler and Carrie Underwood.
TV Land continues to build the best lineup of original sitcoms on cable. With the show in it's third season, Hot in Cleveland's Betty White won her second consecutive SAG Award for Outstanding Performance in a Comedy Series. The Soul Man, a Hot in Cleveland spinoff, starring Cedric ""The Entertainer"" and Niecy Nash, will debut in June, along the with The Exes, starring Kristen Johnson, Donald Faison and Wayne Knight.
Meanwhile, Logo posted its highest-rated quarter ever, thanks to the ongoing success of RuPaul's Drag Race now in its fourth season. 
Let's turn now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount entered its milestone 100th year of operation to resounding critical recognition in Hollywood. Paramount sales were nominated for 18 Academy Awards, winning 6, good for second best among all studios. Martin Scorsese's Hugo won 5 Oscars, tie for the highest number of wins for a single film, while Gore Verbinski's Rango took home the award for Best Animated Film.
In terms of theatrical releases, Paramount again showed its ability to launch highly profitable regional franchises with The Devil Inside from the studio's Insurge label. The film far exceeded box-office expectations, earning more than $100 million worldwide to date. In the current quarter, Paramount rerelease James Cameron's TITANIC in stunning 3D. The 3D film has achieved more than $300 million worldwide box office to date and continues to attract new and long-time fans alike. This month, Sacha Baron Cohen's The Dictator invades theaters following June by G.I. Joe: Retaliation, starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Channing Tatum and Bruce Willis. 
Paramount also announced this quarter that it will release KATY PERRY: PART OF ME, which will bring Katy to the big screen for the first time ever in 3D on July 5. In Insurge and MTV film, PART OF ME is a great example of the type of low-cost, quick-to-market films that combined with Paramount's franchise-centric film to create the studio strategically balanced and focused release slate.
Beyond the big screen, Paramount continues to add value across Viacom, not only in its partnership of our international division and Nickelodeon, but also through EPIX which continues to increase in value.
To close, the second quarter of our 2012 fiscal year was another strong one for Viacom. We, again, demonstrated our consistent ability to deliver great financial results and strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to invest in content to develop the most compelling programming, networks and films for our audiences. As we do, we'll manage  our operations for maximum effectiveness and efficiency. This year and over the next several years, our strategy is to drive continued top line and bottom line growth, with particular acceleration in the international arena. And over the next several years, we will continue to implement our commitment to return significant capital to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy."

Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues increased 5% to $2.2 billion in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenues were up 5%. Foreign exchange had a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 10 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 1% in the quarter. International advertising declined 9%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 4 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 15%, while international revenues increased 24%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was driven by the availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreement, as well as by rate increases. 
Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreement, rate and subscriber increases and new channel launches. Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 19% in the quarter, principally due to lower Home Entertainment revenue. 
Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $893 million in the quarter increased 11% over last year. The operating margin of 41% improved approximately 200 basis points over the prior year. The improvement in the margin was driven by top line growth of 5%, partially offset by a 2% increase in expenses. 
Within expenses, programming expenses grew 8%, while SG&A expense declined 5%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense and savings from our 2011 restructuring, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion expense.
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 5% to $1.2 billion. Page 12 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. 
Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 19% to $326 million in the quarter. The decrease in theatrical revenues was principally due to a less widely distributed mix of releases in the current quarter as compared to the releases in the March quarter of last year. This decline was partially offset by higher carryover revenues from the December quarter slate, which included Mission Impossible IV. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $415 million in the quarter. 
TV license fees were down 6% to $317 million. The decrease in TV license fees in the quarter was principally due to the availability in mix of title. Ancillary revenues increased 41% to $111 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher digital revenues.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $115 million in the quarter as compared to income of $39 million last year. The increase in operating income principally reflects lower print and advertising costs.
Now moving below operating income. Total company equity income from investments was $5 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to focus my remarks on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year.
In terms of our free cash flow for the quarter, we generated $869 million of operating free cash flow in the March quarter compared to $812 million last year. Page 5 of the Web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow.
The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income, partially offset by an unfavorable working capital variance and higher cash tax payments. The unfavorable working capital variance in the quarter was impacted by increased participation payments primarily related to Mission Impossible IV and Transformers 3.
As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 5.1%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago, so we are making great progress on lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding these in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.
As we noted in our last call on January 9, we redeemed at par the $750 million outstanding of our 6.85% senior notes due in 2055. During the quarter, we also took advantage of the attractive rates in the public markets to maintain our leverage at our target level. We issued $500 million of 1.25% senior notes that are due in 2015 and $250 million of 4.5% senior notes due in 2042.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. At March 31, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 1.9x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of our quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 11x.
In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of $837 million of capital back to our shareholders in the March quarter.
Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the June quarter. So for the first 9 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, given that revenue recognition on some of the digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. Accordingly, in the June quarter, we expect affiliate revenue to be down slightly compared to the prior year. However, affiliate revenue will return to double-digit growth in the September quarter.
As Philippe mentioned, we have some timing factors in terms of average size. The Kids' Choice Awards benefited the March quarter and the BET Awards will benefit the September quarter of this year, whereas last year, both of these events benefited our June quarter. These factors in combination with the lapping of strong digital revenues in the prior year will result in slightly lower Media Networks revenues in the June quarter. However, this should set us up nicely in terms of revenue growth for our September quarter. 
At this point in the year, we have a fair amount of clarity on our programming expense at Media Networks and expect it to grow mid-single digits for the full year. Given the pace of programming expense in the first half of the year, we anticipate that programming expense will grow in the high single-digit percentage range for the back half of the year.
Given our ongoing expense management, we expect to grow our margins at Media Networks for fiscal 2012. In terms of the back half of the year, given the timing of revenue that I just spoke about, margin expansion will occur in the September quarter.
For 2012, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%, and we expect that cash taxes will mirror book taxes for the year. As for our stock buyback program, we are on track to repurchase $2.8 billion for fiscal 2012. 
Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline in May, we will release The Dictator, which stars Sacha Baron Cohen, and Paramount will also be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3 in early June and in July, they will release Katy  Perry movie, PART OF ME, in 3D. 
As a core part of its strategy, the studio continues to develop a number of new franchises, as well as equals to existing franchise. On June 29, the studio released the G.I. Joe 2 and in the fall, they'll release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. In December, Paramount releases One Shot, starring Tom Cruise, which is based on the best-selling novel and Jack Reacher book series. And in the summer of 2013, we are looking forward to the next installment of Star Trek, which is in 3D, and the release of World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt.
Looking further out, Paramount is developing a Nickelodeon branded live-action movie based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, which is scheduled to hit theaters in December of 2013 in conjunction with the significant consumer product initiative. In addition, the studio is working on a CGI-animated SpongeBob movie, and they recently announced the sequel to Anchorman, where they will reunite the original cast of Will Ferrell, Steve Carell and Paul Rudd.
Wrapping up, we remain focused on the levers that drive long-term value. From an operational standpoint, we are investing in organic growth initiative, including expanding our international businesses, developing franchises with consumer products appeal and investing in our brands in order to strengthen their competitive position.
There are incremental opportunities to monetize our brands and franchises on a worldwide basis, as we continue to see demand for our content from new distributors on digital platforms. We remain disciplined in managing our operating expenses and driving the efficiencies throughout our businesses in order to enhance our margins, and drive earnings per share and free cash flow.
In addition, we are committed to an aggressive capital return program of share buyback and dividend, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders over the long term. 
I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?"

Well, there's been a lot of people putting out series on Nickelodeon ratings issues. There is no silver bullet. There has been a lot of focus lately by a particular analyst, which is a reverberated elsewhere about the Nickelodeon having some library content on Netflix in particular. Just a few steps on that. And by the way, we are getting nice revenues through these SVOD deals. Netflix is present in less than 1/4 of television households. And since we get the streaming data on our content, I can tell you that the time spent on Nickelodeon content on Netflix is approximately 2% of the time spent on our Nickelodeon channel. So even if you view that as being completely kind of ballistic, which is, of course, is not, it serves our customers in places where they might not otherwise be able to watch television, and it thus serve some promotional value. It would have a minimal impact here. So our approach is to address the issues that we have. As we have In the past, BET and MTV, for example, which subsequently reached all-time high in their history ratings, to approach it with content, research, marketing and building up the brand, clearly, there's some ratings measurement issues we've just talked about in prior calls, but we're going to focus on ways in which we can affect the Nickelodeon brand positively. And as I mentioned in my remarks, Nickelodeon continues to expand, create value for our distribution and marketing partners alike in United States and around the world. So we feel very, very good about the direction of the pipeline, it's extremely strong. We're developing more new shows of our popular series and more exciting new series. And of course, we're particularly excited about the revival of the Turtles franchise. Operator, we'll go to our next question, please?"

As far as international growth, clearly, there's some weakness in a number of European markets economically, which has some impact on the ad revenue category, of course.

Comedy, Nickelodeon has been particularly successful; U.K., we've had great success across the board; and this Paramount Channel is going to add a lot of momentum. I expect that the Paramount channel will be distributed over the next 2 to 3 years across a very wide base of our distribution, across many, many countries.

We are also committed as we have been over the last several years, including through the recession, and increasing our investment program We do call it investment even though it appears on accounting standpoint as an expense. And as we've said, we're going to do it consistently across our portfolio at mid-single digits rate, which is what we target. Now that means because we have so many networks, that we can grow it a little more for particular networks where needed and a little less in other networks where it's not needed. We're also changing the mix of our program. We've been coming off some expenses, third-party licensing deals and we are shifting those dollars, which were not very efficiently deployed, given the lower resonance of generally speaking of off-network programming. We've been able to deploy those dollars to relatively inexpensive original programming, which speaks more to our brands. So that -- those 2 factors combined will allow us to increase our investment programming, but do it in a way that doesn't damage our margins as we go forward. And as far as other expenses, we'll continue to keep a tight lid on them. And more importantly, we're going to focus on growing our revenues. And we have a lot of opportunities to do it. We have, of course, the affiliate revenue line I talked about over the next several years; we expect to grow our consumer products revenue; our international revenues will grow; and our ad revenues as the market and ratings in certain areas continue to improve. So we feel that we'll be able to continue to maintain and improve our margins as we go forward."

If you look at Nickelodeon's penetration both on the traditional television screen and of course, the many new platforms, which are unmeasured out there, Nickelodeon is in fact very strong in reaching lots and lots and lots of kids, and our programming is probably being consumed more today than it ever has been before. We need measurements to capture that and measurements once that occurs will be followed by significant monetization. So we're quite confident in the future that Nickelodeon has in terms of its relationship to the kids' marketplace and our ability to generates advertising there."

Our Media Networks are constantly reinventing and reengaging cementing their status as destinations of choice for all audiences all over the world and platforms of preference for a growing number of marketing partners. Paramount Pictures also continues to hone its skills in not only building powerful new global film franchises, but also creating targeted motion picture experiences for our passionate fans.

Viacom delivered yet another strong performance in the second quarter of our fiscal year. Across our divisions, we sharpened our focus on execution and efficiency, while continuing to invest in content that connects with audiences worldwide.
A few opening points. Consistent investment and content keeps our brands creatively vibrant and culturally relevant. This fiscal year, our Media Networks are launching and developing more original programming than ever across multiple formats, from reality to scripted, live action to animation. Our programming pipeline has never been more diverse or more tailored to the taste of our audiences. Our affiliate revenue is strong and growing, thanks to brands that remain must carry content for existing and emerging distributors alike.
We are seeing encouraging signs of a strengthening ad market as we enter the upfront season. Overseas, we continue to make great progress in pursuit of our ambitious targets for expansion and operating income growth, particularly as we increase our offerings for adult audiences with Comedy Central and with the new Paramount Channels, while continuing to expand the Nickelodeon brand. Paramount Pictures is cementing its reputation as one of the best run studios in Hollywood, capturing efficiencies even as it unlocks value from innovative and highly profitable releases, including the double insight of the second quarter.
Finally, by monetizing our content and our brands and tightly managing costs, we continue to maintain one of the best balance sheets in the business. Our consistent ability to generate substantial free cash flow reinforces our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.
This morning, I will give an overview of our financial results for the second quarter and review highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide additional detail, and then we'll open it up to questions.
First, the numbers. Viacom's consolidated revenues grew 2% to $3.33 billion in the second quarter, driven by growth in our Media Networks segment. Operating income increased 23% to $932 million. Our Media Networks delivered 5% growth in revenues and an 11% increase in adjusted operating income on strong increases in affiliate revenues. 
Filmed Entertainment revenue decreased 5%, reflecting lower theatrical revenue due to a less widely distributed mix of releases in the same period last year, which featured significant hits, Rango, No Strings Attached and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. Adjusted operating income in Filmed Entertainment increased 195%, driven by lower distribution costs, which more than offset lower revenue. Our adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $535 million in the March quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.98, up 36% over the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased $700 million in stock under our share repurchase program. We expect to buy back $700 million in stock again this quarter and are on track to purchase $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year.
Our Media Networks remains strong and creatively vibrant, with our nearly $3 billion fiscal year investment in content, yielding a greater output of new, original, wholly-owned content than at any time in Viacom's history. In this age of time-shifting and on-demand viewing across platforms, the value of fresh and compelling original content is greater than ever.
All of our networks are tapping rich development pipelines set by strong brand filters and deep consumer insights. As we pop out more content, we continue to innovate how we market, distribute and build experiences around programming across platforms. Our brands are well out in front in experimentation and advances in social networking applied to television content. 
In ad sales, we began to see signs of recovery in marketplace. We were able to capitalize on this improvement and return to growth domestically. For the quarter, our domestic advertising revenues increased 1%. Worldwide advertising revenues were flat at $1.07 billion for the quarter. We remain encouraged by what we're seeing and we expect to capture new opportunities in the market as we head into the upfront season.
I want to point out that for our fiscal third quarter, there are 2 event timing issues that will reduce year-on-year domestic ad sales quarterly comps by a total of about 3 to 4 percentage points. This year, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards took place in the second quarter and the BET Awards will air early in the fiscal fourth quarter, both aired in the third quarter last year.
Distribution continue to be a strong and steady driver of revenue for Viacom. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased 17%, driven by higher revenues from digital distribution agreements, as well as rate increases. During the quarter, we successfully closed a number of digital distribution deals, including an agreement to provide library content to Amazon for its Prime Instant Video service. We also increased distribution with our existing affiliates, with a particular focus on gaining distribution for our HD simulcast. In particular, we made significant gains in carriage of TV Land HD. For our 2012 fiscal year, we expect to grow affiliate revenue by 10%. 
Our Media Networks remain first choice partners for distributors as they test in market new products and technologies. We continue to build on our strong VOD offering by striking agreements to provide additional library content, as well as current episodes from some of our most popular brands and franchises. We remain committed to supporting our distribution partners multi-platform efforts, with authenticated sites offering on-demand content for MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, VH1 and SPIKE. A BET-authenticated site will launch soon.
We're also exploring opportunities to connect with consumers through tablet devices. A recent study by our strategic insights and research group uncovered that tablets have surpassed laptops as the second screen of choice among consumers. Currently, we partner with Cablevision to make linear feeds of our networks available through its in-home streaming tablet app. As we strengthen our existing partnerships, we are aggressively pursuing new distributors for both our long- and short-form content.
Internationally, we're moving ahead decisively in our drive to expand our reach in revenue around the globe. Viacom international media networks turned in another strong performance, powered by affiliate revenue growth in both organic and visual distribution and excellent cost management. We set ambitious goals for our international operations. As I've said on prior occasions, we're aiming for margins exceeding 20% in the next fiscal year and OI growth at a 30% compounded rate over the next 5 years. I'm pleased to report that we're very much on track to achieve these goals and we expect to exceed that OI growth rate this year.
Our growing adult-focused business will be a key driver of this growth. We made great progress in the second quarter. Ratings of our international Comedy Central channels were up 35%. In the last 6 months, we've launched 5 new comedy channels, most recently in Russia, which now puts the network in 5 continents and more than 40 countries.
We debuted our first-ever Paramount Channel in Spain at the end of the second quarter, opening a new chapter in our international expansion strategy. Based on audience share during its first month, the Paramount Channel is the most successful digital terrestrial television channel launched in Spain in the past 12 months and the country's second most successful DTT launch of all time. The channel premiere on March 30 with titles including The Godfather trilogy, Breakfast at Tiffany's and American Beauty. We're on target to sign 80 advertisers for the free-to-air channel in each of its first 2 months of operation. With one successful launch under our belt, we're looking to move quickly on future launches in additional markets.
Even as we expand to new markets, we're strengthening our presence in existing ones. We had a very strong quarter in the U.K., one of our most important markets. Ratings were up 21% at MTV U.K., thanks to Jersey Shore, which just concluded its second season as the highest-rated series ever for the channel. Comedy Central ratings are up 67%, thanks to strong U.S.-based acquired programming and our local original comedy, Threesome. Finally, Nickelodeon U.K., as well as the Nick brand in many markets around the world, saw ratings gains, driven by iCarly and Victorious, with a strong pipeline in the current quarter as well.
Turning now to ratings highlights from our domestic Media Networks. MTV remains strong with its millennial audience. The network was #1 with its core 12-34 demo in its key 10-spot prime time slots, where it beat its closest competitor by nearly 50%. For the quarter, MTV had 3 of the top 10 cable series in its core demo, including the returning champ, Jersey Shore, along with Teen Mom 2 and Challenge: Battle Of The Exes. We expect MTV's ratings for the current quarter to grow year-on-year.
MTV also continued to prove its expertise in moving content across platforms, reaching its audiences in innovative new ways through digital events, franchises, social media and mobile. MTV achieved a rare milestone in the second quarter when it surpassed 100 million likes, that's 100 million likes on Facebook according to social media tracking firm, Trendrr. Add to that, it's nearly 6 million Twitter followers and it's top ranking on Foursquare, Tumblr and Instagram, and MTV is the #1 most social TV brand.
Comedy Central continues to connect with its core male audience with a diversified slate of originals, specials, stand-up comedy and the unstoppable late-night tandem of Stewart and Colbert. 
Tosh.0 recently concluded its winter season as the #1 show on Tuesday nights on all of television with the networks key men 18-34 demo. 
The network launched another original hit in the second quarter with sketch series Key & Peele which won its timeslot with men 18-34 in its debut season. Key & Peele will return for a second season in the fall, boasting with many, including the President himself in a recent interview believe to be the best President Obama impersonation on television.
In late night, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report achieved the distinction of being the only late-night talk shows to notch year-over-year growth with adults 18-49. The Daily Show is the #1 late-night talk show in the demo, beating all broadcast and cable competition.
Nickelodeon retained its top spot in the second quarter as the #1 cable network in total day. SpongeBob was the #1 animated program on all of television with kids 2-11, while iCarly was the #1 kid's program among total viewers. The second quarter also saw the return of the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards which, in its 25th year, reached 15 million total viewers and generated a record 223 million votes online, hosted by Will Smith and featuring performances by Katy Perry and One Direction, the KCA's made the leap into a truly global juggernaut this year, earning its highest ratings ever by a wide margin in key markets, including the U.K., Germany and Australia.
The upcoming launch of the reinvented Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise in the fall is just one element of Nickelodeon's largest slate of original content ever. More than 650 episodes of returning hits and new series overall in 2012, 2013 season. 
In the second quarter, Nick introduced How to Rock, starring Cymphonique Miller, which debuted as the #1 new show of 2012 with tweens 9-14. FRED: THE SHOW, which successfully expanded the Fred Figglehorn franchise as the #1 new live-action show with kids 2-11, and Big Time Movie starring Big Time Rush, which attracted 26 million total viewers over its telecast.
In the current quarter, Nickelodeon debuted animated series The Legend of Korra to 4.5 million total viewers successfully channeling the cult following of Avatar: the Last Airbender to create a breakout hit.
Korra is Nickelodeon's most-watched animated series premiere in 3 years. Also coming this quarter are new episodes of iCarly, Victorious, SpongeBob and the new original TV movie Rags starring Keke Palmer, and we will continue to pilot on. Nickelodeon is poised to become bigger and better than ever and continues to be an important locomotive of our international and consumer products expansion.
BET continued its reign as the #1 ad-supported cable network for African-Americans 18-49. In the second quarter, the network showed further proof of its prowess in launching buzz-worthy tentpole. The 2012 BET Honors were the #1 BET Honors broadcast of all-time, up 69% over last year's show, with 2.5 million total viewers. The show is a big social driver, with more than 20 separate artists-related topics trending on Twitter during the broadcast. The network's original sitcoms also continued to perform well. For the calendar year-to-date, THE GAME and Let's Stay Together are the top 2 sitcoms on ad-supported cable among African-American and total viewers.
Throughout our history, our networks, all of our networks have demonstrated an uncanny capacity for reinvention. Across our brands, we've enhanced our ability to develop creative content through a systematic approach, conduct relentless consumer research and refined brand filters based on the evolving tastes and needs of the audience.
VH1, SPIKE and CMT, 3 networks we've earmarked for evolution in recent years, continue to build strong momentum behind this approach. VH1 is shining again. The second quarter was VH1's highest-rated quarter in 2 years, with ratings up 37% in prime. The network's third consecutive quarter ratings growth was highlighted by its performance in Monday prime time, where it was tops in all cable among women 18-49. The original T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle attracted on average 2.4 million total viewers an episode, the highest-rated debut season on VH1 in nearly 3 years, while Love & Hip Hop 2 scores the network's highest-rated series in more than 3.5 years.
VH1 also affirmed its status as pop-culture bellwether, with of the moment specials including Whitney Houston: Death Of A Diva and Greatest Women In Music, as well as new episodes of behind the music, which scored strong ratings.
VH1 should continue to roll this quarter with the premieres of new series, including Mob Wives: Chicago and Couples Rehab and the return of scripted-hit series, Single Ladies. 
SPIKE is making great progress as it broadens its appeal with men through more original programming. In it's first quarter with a new USC programming, the network retained its connection with the MMA community through the launch of MMA Uncensored Live, TV's highest-rated MMA news program. SPIKE also committed to a multi-year extension of its strategic partnership with TNA Entertainment's IMPACT Wrestling.
SPIKE's line-up of original programming gained ground in the second quarter. Breakout hit INK MASTER continued to perform well and new series of American Digger, starting Ric Savage, premiere to 1.2 million viewers, making it SPIKE's most-watched half-hour reality premiere in more than 3 years.
CMT delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, featuring the 2 highest-rated series debuts in networks history, by Big Redneck Vacation and Bayou Billionaires. The network earns its best ratings in prime time since the fourth quarter of 2009, its highest-rated original film in 3 years with Whiskey Business and the highest-rated Crossroads episode in 7 years, featuring Steven Tyler and Carrie Underwood.
TV Land continues to build the best lineup of original sitcoms on cable. With the show in it's third season, Hot in Cleveland's Betty White won her second consecutive SAG Award for Outstanding Performance in a Comedy Series. The Soul Man, a Hot in Cleveland spinoff, starring Cedric ""The Entertainer"" and Niecy Nash, will debut in June, along the with The Exes, starring Kristen Johnson, Donald Faison and Wayne Knight.
Meanwhile, Logo posted its highest-rated quarter ever, thanks to the ongoing success of RuPaul's Drag Race now in its fourth season. 
Let's turn now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount entered its milestone 100th year of operation to resounding critical recognition in Hollywood. Paramount sales were nominated for 18 Academy Awards, winning 6, good for second best among all studios. Martin Scorsese's Hugo won 5 Oscars, tied for the highest number of wins for a single film, while Gore Verbinski's Rango took home the award for Best Animated Film.
In terms of theatrical releases, Paramount again showed its ability to launch highly profitable original franchises with The Devil Inside from the studio's Insurge label. The film far exceeded box-office expectations, earning more than $100 million worldwide to date. In the current quarter, Paramount rerelease James Cameron's TITANIC in stunning 3D. The 3D film has achieved more than $300 million worldwide box office to date and continues to attract new and long-time fans alike. This month, Sacha Baron Cohen's The Dictator invades theaters, followed June by G.I. Joe: Retaliation, starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Channing Tatum and Bruce Willis. 
Paramount also announced this quarter that it will release KATY PERRY: PART OF ME, which will bring Katy to the big screen for the first time ever in 3D on July 5. In Insurge and MTV film, PART OF ME is a great example of the type of low-cost, quick-to-market films that combined with Paramount's franchise-centric film to create the studio strategically balanced and focused release slate.
Beyond the big screen, Paramount continues to add value across Viacom, not only in its partnership of our international division and Nickelodeon, but also through EPIX which continues to increase in value.
To close, the second quarter of our 2012 fiscal year was another strong one for Viacom. We, again, demonstrated our consistent ability to deliver great financial results and strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to invest in content to develop the most compelling programming, networks and films for our audiences. As we do, we'll manage  our operations for maximum effectiveness and efficiency. This year and over the next several years, our strategy is to drive continued top line and bottom line growth, with particular acceleration in the international arena. And over the next several years, we will continue to implement our commitment to return significant capital to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and Web presentation, summarizing the results of our March quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. 
This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's March quarter exclude a loss associated with the redemption of our 6.85% senior notes due 2055, which was $21 million on a pretax basis and $13 million after tax, as well as $66 million of discrete tax benefit. Last year's March quarter excluded the charge associated with the tender proportion of our 6.25% senior notes due 2016, which was $87 million on a pretax basis and $54 million after tax. 
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues increased 5% to $2.2 billion in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenues were up 5%. Foreign exchange had a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 10 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 1% in the quarter. International advertising declined 9%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 4 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 15%, while international revenues increased 24%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was driven by the availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreement, as well as by rate increases. 
Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreement, rate and subscriber increases and new channel launches. Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 19% in the quarter, principally due to lower Home Entertainment revenue. 
Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $893 million in the quarter increased 11% over last year. The operating margin of 41% improved approximately 200 basis points over the prior year. The improvement in the margin was driven by top line growth of 5%, partially offset by a 2% increase in expenses. 
Within expenses, programming expenses grew 8%, while SG&A expense declined 5%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense and savings from our 2011 restructuring, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion expense.
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 5% to $1.2 billion. Page 12 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. 
Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 19% to $326 million in the quarter. The decrease in theatrical revenues was principally due to a less widely distributed mix of releases in the current quarter as compared to the releases in the March quarter of last year. This decline was partially offset by higher carryover revenues from the December quarter slate, which included Mission Impossible IV. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $415 million in the quarter. 
TV license fees were down 6% to $317 million. The decrease in TV license fees in the quarter was principally due to the availability in mix of title. Ancillary revenues increased 41% to $111 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher digital revenues.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $115 million in the quarter as compared to income of $39 million last year. The increase in operating income principally reflects lower print and advertising costs.
Now moving below operating income. Total company equity income from investments was $5 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%. 
Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to focus my remarks on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year.
In terms of our free cash flow for the quarter, we generated $869 million of operating free cash flow in the March quarter compared to $812 million last year. Page 5 of the Web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow.
The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income, partially offset by an unfavorable working capital variance and higher cash tax payments. The unfavorable working capital variance in the quarter was impacted by increased participation payments primarily related to Mission Impossible IV and Transformers 3.
As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 5.1%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago, so we are making great progress on lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding these in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.
As we noted in our last call on January 9, we redeemed at par the $750 million outstanding of our 6.85% senior notes due in 2055. During the quarter, we also took advantage of the attractive rates in the public markets to maintain our leverage at our target level. We issued $500 million of 1.25% senior notes that are due in 2015 and $250 million of 4.5% senior notes due in 2042.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. At March 31, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 1.9x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of our quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 11x.
In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of $837 million of capital back to our shareholders in the March quarter.
Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the June quarter. So for the first 9 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, given that revenue recognition on some of the digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. Accordingly, in the June quarter, we expect affiliate revenue to be down slightly compared to the prior year. However, affiliate revenue will return to double-digit growth in the September quarter.
As Philippe mentioned, we have some timing factors in terms of advertising. The Kids' Choice Awards benefited the March quarter and the BET Awards will benefit the September quarter of this year, whereas last year, both of these events benefited our June quarter. These factors in combination with the lapping of strong digital revenues in the prior year will result in slightly lower Media Networks revenues in the June quarter. However, this should set us up nicely in terms of revenue growth for our September quarter. 
At this point in the year, we have a fair amount of clarity on our programming expense at Media Networks and expect it to grow mid-single digits for the full year. Given the pace of programming expense in the first half of the year, we anticipate that programming expense will grow in the high single-digit percentage range for the back half of the year.
Given our ongoing expense management, we expect to grow our margins at Media Networks for fiscal 2012. In terms of the back half of the year, given the timing of revenue that I just spoke about, margin expansion will occur in the September quarter.
For 2012, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%, and we expect that cash taxes will mirror book taxes for the year. As for our stock buyback program, we are on track to repurchase $2.8 billion for fiscal 2012. 
Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline in May, we will release The Dictator, which stars Sacha Baron Cohen, and Paramount will also be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3 in early June and in July, they will release Katy  Perry movie, PART OF ME, in 3D. 
As a core part of its strategy, the studio continues to develop a number of new franchises, as well as sequels to existing franchises. On June 29, the studio releases the G.I. Joe 2 and in the fall, they'll release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. In December, Paramount releases One Shot, starring Tom Cruise, which is based on the best-selling novel and Jack Reacher book series. And in the summer of 2013, we are looking forward to the next installment of Star Trek, which is in 3D, and the release of World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt.
Looking further out, Paramount is developing a Nickelodeon branded live-action movie based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, which is scheduled to hit theaters in December of 2013 in conjunction with the significant consumer product initiative. In addition, the studio is working on a CGI-animated SpongeBob movie, and they recently announced the sequel to Anchorman, where they will reunite the original cast of Will Ferrell, Steve Carell and Paul Rudd.
Wrapping up, we remain focused on the levers that drive long-term value. From an operational standpoint, we are investing in organic growth initiatives, including expanding our international businesses, developing franchises with consumer products appeal and investing in our brands in order to strengthen their competitive position.
There are incremental opportunities to monetize our brands and franchises on a worldwide basis, as we continue to see demand for our content from new distributors on digital platforms. We remain disciplined in managing our operating expenses and driving the efficiencies throughout our businesses in order to enhance our margins, and drive earnings per share and free cash flow.
In addition, we are committed to an aggressive capital return program of share buyback and dividends, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders over the long term. 
I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?"

Well, there's been a lot of people putting out series on Nickelodeon ratings issues. There is no silver bullet. There has been a lot of focus lately by a particular analyst, which has reverberated elsewhere about the Nickelodeon having some library content on Netflix in particular. Just a few stats on that. And by the way, we are getting nice revenues through these SVOD deals. Netflix is present in less than 1/4 of television households. And since we get the streaming data on our content, I can tell you that the time spent on Nickelodeon content on Netflix is approximately 2% of the time spent on our Nickelodeon channel. So even if you view that as being completely kind of ballistic, which is, of course, is not, it serves our customers in places where they might not otherwise be able to watch television, and it thus serve some promotional value. It would have a minimal impact here. So our approach is to address the issues that we have. As we have In the past, BET and MTV, for example, which subsequently reached all-time high in their history ratings, is to approach it with content, research, marketing and building up the brand, clearly, there's some ratings measurement issues we've just talked about in prior calls, but we're going to focus on ways in which we can affect the Nickelodeon brand positively. And as I mentioned in my remarks, Nickelodeon continues to expand, create value for our distribution and marketing partners alike in United States and around the world. So we feel very, very good about the direction of the pipeline, it's extremely strong. We're developing more new shows of our popular series and more exciting new series. And of course, we're particularly excited about the revival of the Turtles franchise. Operator, we'll go to our next question, please?"

As far as international growth, clearly, there's some weakness in a number of European markets economically, which has some impact on the ad revenue category, of course. But we're seeing nice growth as you can see in affiliate revenues, and that really is due to our ability to expand our brands in more and more countries to get ratings success. Comedy, Nickelodeon has been particularly successful; U.K., we've had great success across the board; and this Paramount Channel is going to add a lot of momentum. I expect that the Paramount channel will be distributed over the next 2 to 3 years across a very wide base of our distribution, across many, many countries. I've never seen as much receptivity to a brand as I've seen as I travel around the world for Paramount Channel.

We are also committed as we have been over the last several years, including through the recession, and increasing our investment program We do call it investment even though it appears on an accounting standpoint as an expense. And as we've said, we're going to do it consistently across our portfolio at mid-single digits rate, which is what we target. Now that means because we have so many networks, that we can grow it a little more for particular networks where needed and a little less in other networks where it's not needed. We're also changing the mix of our program. We've been coming off some expenses, third-party licensing deals and we are shifting those dollars, which were not very efficiently deployed, given the lower resonance of generally speaking of off-network programming. We've been able to deploy those dollars to relatively inexpensive original programming, which speaks more to our brands. So that -- those 2 factors combined will allow us to increase our investment programming, but do it in a way that doesn't damage our margins as we go forward. And as far as other expenses, we'll continue to keep a tight lid on them. And more importantly, we're going to focus on growing our revenues. And we have a lot of opportunities to do it. We have, of course, the affiliate revenue line that I talked about over the next several years; we expect to grow our consumer products revenue; our international revenues will grow; and our ad revenues as the market and ratings in certain areas continue to improve. So we feel that we'll be able to continue to maintain and improve our margins as we go forward."

If you look at Nickelodeon's penetration both on the traditional television screen and across the many new platforms, which are unmeasured out there, Nickelodeon is in fact very strong in reaching lots and lots and lots of kids, and our programming is probably being consumed more today than it ever has been before. We need measurements to capture that and measurements once that occurs will be followed by significant monetization. So we're quite confident in the future that Nickelodeon has in terms of its relationship to the kids' marketplace and our ability to generates advertising there."

Despite challenges, Viacom made solid progress on several fronts in the third quarter of our fiscal year. Our industry-leading brands continue to grow and evolve across platforms, as well as geographic and demographic borders. We continued our sustained investment in creative content, especially at Nickelodeon and other key networks, and we are seeing promising signs that this investment will bear fruit.
Our strong audience bonds and the breadth of our network portfolio were big factors not only in our strong performance in the recent advertising upfront but also in our successful, albeit unnecessarily, noisy completion of an extra long-term carriage deal with DirecTV 2 weeks ago.
The DirecTV deal keeps us firmly on the path to generate sustainable, high single to low double-digit annual affiliate revenue growth. We are also now heading in to a period where we will see growing results from our investments in international challenges and consumer products initiatives.
At the same time, Viacom's bottom line benefited from our relentless focus on operational efficiency. This tight rein on costs also serves to fortify our already strong balance sheet. As a result, Viacom remains a reliable generator of significant free cash flow, even in challenging times. And we consistently make good on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders to both dividends and share repurchases.
With this unwavering strategic focus, Viacom will generate significant long-term value for our shareholders. This morning, I will provide an overview for our financial results for the third quarter and review highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will give additional color and then we'll take your questions.
Let's begin with the numbers. Viacom's revenues decreased 14% to $3.24 billion in the third quarter, driven primarily by the mix of our Film Entertainment titles and lower advertising revenues. Adjusted operating income decreased 9% to $903 million. In Media Networks segment, revenue declined 5%, and adjusted operating income declined 10% due to lower advertising and ancillary revenues.
Home Entertainment revenues decreased 29%, reflecting the number and mix of releases in the June quarter in comparison to the same period last year, which features a substantial theatrical hits, including Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Super 8, Marvel's Thor and DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda 2.
Adjusted operating income in Filmed Entertainment decreased $3 million, reflecting the revenue decline and substantially offset by lower expenses.
Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations declined 12% to $512 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 2% to $0.97 in the June quarter. Foreign exchange negatively affected earnings per share by $0.02.
In the quarter, Viacom announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share. Last week, our Board of Directors declared our next quarterly cash dividend to be paid October 1. The company also repurchased $700 million in stock under our share repurchase program in the third quarter, and we expect to buy back $700 million in the stock this quarter for a total of $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year.
Let's move on to highlights of our divisions. Our Media Networks experienced some cyclical rating softness that we are well equipped to overcome, as we have demonstrated in the past. More than any other programmer, Viacom's networks are built for reinvention, powered by our $3 billion investment in content this fiscal year.
Our networks each have clear, established brand filters, which are introducing more and more original content. From BT to MTV to most recently VH1, our brands are consistently able to evolve with audiences, create hits and capture the cultural conversation.
For example, 50% of VH1's current prime time schedule consists of returning hits, the highest percentage in 4 years, and the networks hit ratio was up 22% of our fiscal 2011. Domestic advertising revenues decreased 7% due to the timing of 2 key award shows as we previously signaled in our second quarter earnings call, as well as the rating softness of certain networks.
This year, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards aired in the second quarter, and the BET Awards aired earlier in the fiscal fourth quarter. Both aired in the third quarter last year, resulting in difficult year-on-year quarterly comps.
Worldwide advertising revenues decreased 9% for the quarter due to softness in Europe. As I mentioned earlier, we concluded the June quarter by successfully completing our upfront negotiations. We are very pleased with the outcome. Despite ratings issues in Nickelodeon, we were able to maintain the same share of the kids upfront volume as last year.
Overall, our total upfront dollars were more than $2.8 billion, up from last year, and we secured solid mid-single-digit increases in pricing.
Looking at the current quarter, while it is still early and difficult to predict, we are tracking to sequential improvement in domestic advertising revenue performance. In distribution, domestic revenues decreased 1% in the third quarter, which primarily reflects a significance of additional distribution revenues recorded in the same quarter last year.
Worldwide affiliate fees increased 1%. As we have discussed in the past, revenue recognition requirements relating to digital sales create bumps in our usual usually steady affiliate sales growth path. If you exclude the impact of digital distribution agreement, our domestic affiliate revenue growth was right on target in the high-single digit. In this fourth quarter, domestic affiliate revenue growth will be in double digits.
Throughout the quarter, we continue to deepen our partnerships with our distributors on existing and emerging platforms. Notably, we increased distribution for a number of our HD simulcast, while also completing agreements to make our programming available through Time Warner Cable's in-home streaming apps. As noted earlier, in the current quarter, we successfully completed a challenging renewal negotiation with DirecTV, striking a long-term agreements with an initial rate increase of significantly more than 20% and healthy annual increases in excess of those we had on the expired deal, the remainder of the 7-year term.
In fact, the deal we ultimately signed was materially better for Viacom than the deal that was on the table at the time that DirecTV made an unfortunate decision to drop our networks. In addition to rate increases, we secured increased or new distribution for Nick Toons, and several HD channels. We secured a long-term commitment from DirecTV to distribute our channels in Latin America via Pan Americana and Sky Brazil. And we forged a long-term agreement for DirecTV to continue to offer Paramount films on pay-per-view.
In short, we are extremely pleased with our DirecTV agreement and only disappointed that so many of our viewers were deprived of their favorite channels for 9 long days. We certainly hope this will be the only blip in what had been until now in my 6-year tenure a perfect record of completing affiliate renewals with every our distributor in the U.S. or elsewhere without disruption to customers.
Also notable in the quarter, our continued strategic moves to expand our consumer products business. In the past few weeks, the first toys and merchandise based on Nickelodeon's forthcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles debut on shelves at Toys R Us. In light of action figures, vehicles and more, will available in its entirety across all retailers this month in advance of the much-anticipated series premiere in September.
Products for Nickelodeon's Winx Club have also begun to roll out and will continue to hit retail stores into the fall. Additionally, Comedy Central recently launched Comedy Central Enterprises, in the division that will unite and grow the network's ancillary revenue businesses, including consumer products, home videos, CDs and digital downloads, publishing and live tour for its roster stand-up comedians.
MTV is focused on programming innovation as it continues to diversify its slate with new scripted and reality series that build on a strong base of returning hits. In the third quarter, those hits included Teen Mom, which was the number 1 cable series in the quarter in the key 12-34 demo, Teen Wolf, which was up 6% year-on-year in the quarter and Jersey Shore spinoffs, Snooki and Jay Wow, which was number 1 in its time period across television and the demo.
The new fiscal year will start with a season of Jersey Shore. In addition, MTV will introduce a range of reality and docu series, including Catfish, the Heights and Wait Till Next Year, as well as new scripted comedies, the In Between Us, Underemployed and Zach Stone is Going Be Famous.
In addition, Teen Wolf and Awkward were recently renewed for third seasons to double their original order of episodes.
In Comedy Central, Tosh.0 and Workaholics delivered solid performances in the third quarter as each returned with new episodes. This fall, Comedy Central hits the company trail hard with election coverage in The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which remained dominant in late night. In fact, The Daily Show is the #1 late-night show in all of television with adults 18 to 49. The Daily Show and Colbert are the only 2 late-night shows to grow their viewership in the demo this broadcast season.
While Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert will remain with Comedy Central, thanks to recent contract extensions. On the campaign blitz, Comedy Central will debut Daniel Tosh's new animated series, Brickleberry, along with new seasons of Tosh.0, South Park and Key & Peele this fall.
Despite rating softness, Nickelodeon had success with new episodes of iCarly and SpongeBob SquarePants and the original TV movie, Rags, which reached 14 million total viewers. I the current quarter, the network is beginning to show momentum. Nickelodeon premiered a new SpongeBob special, Super Sponging square Games, on July 22, with average 3.7 million total viewers.
On the episode, Nickelodeon gave fans a sneak peek in an upcoming series, You Got To See This, and the episode retained the overwhelming majority of the SpongeBob audience, including 99% of teens 9 to 14.
A bright spot for Nickelodeon has been its new hit game show Lineup. Figure It Out premiered in the third fiscal quarter with new episodes averaging 2.2 million total viewers and Spread A Lot was added to the schedule in the current quarter, with its retaining 99% of the kids 6 to 11 audience from its Figure It Out lead in.
is also showing of time period gains over the months prior. In addition to new programming, we are aggressively fine-tuning the schedule to drive viewership, which is resulting in significant time period gains for a number of Nickelodeon's signature series.
The recent SpongeBob special posted big gains in its time period versus year ago and the month prior. Big Time Rush is averaging 2.2 million viewers per episode this quarter, up double digits in all key demos versus a year ago.
And just last Saturday, the newest Fred movie, Cap Fred, averaged 3.5 million viewers and ranked as the #1 cable telecast for the week, for ages 9 to 14.
As we've said previously, Nickelodeon is debuting 650 new episodes of original programming for the broadest season, including more than 130 from October to December. And just today, Nickelodeon is announcing a programming slate of 14 new series, TV movies and pilots, adding live-action and animation.
As we have continually seen, fresh content has renewed and expanded engagement, particularly among young viewers. Nickelodeon is now poised for an upsurge and soon.
That includes the long-awaited debut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on September 29, new episodes of animated series, including SpongeBob SquarePants, Kung Fu Panda and the Penguins of Madagascar, new episodes of live-action hits, including Big Time Rush, Victorious and the final season of iCarly; and greater than programming, including worldwide, the HALO Awards and a SpongeBob Christmas special.
This fall, Nick and Night will premiere See That Run, a new family comedy starring Scott Bale. Nick and Night has in recent momentum from Friends, which is seeing a 6% increase in ratings year-over-year. Also this fall, the Nick Mom nightly programming block, which is being enthusiastically received by advertisers, will debut on Nick Junior with 4 new original series.
BET continues to serve African-American audiences with a dynamic mix of scripted originals, including THE GAME and Let's Stay Together, big event programming, including the BET awards, and reliably strong unscripted series, including 106 and Park and Sunday best.
THE GAME and Let's Stay Together continue to anchor BET's prime time lineup, as the #1 and #2 original sitcoms on cable. BET also have several virtual scripted and unscripted series debuting in the coming year, including sitcoms second-generation land, featuring the next-generation of the Wayans family; and new late night series Don't Sleep, hosted by journalist, TJ Holmes.
VH1 is successfully broadening its creative mission with a wide variety of programs and formats for the networks target audience. In the third quarter, VH1's prime time range were up 22%, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year prime time growth in its targeted adult demo. Looking ahead, the networks has a significant number of returning hits series, including We Have Adopted Drew, T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle and video.
Look forward to, with a said to them about in Cleveland and Happily divorced set to return with new episodes this fall. This last month, Hot in Cleveland was picked up for syndication by local TV stations 65% of the U.S. including 9 the top 10 markets.
SPIKE continues to broaden his audience, expanding and diversifying its original programming with the male skewing general entertainment filter. In the third quarter, season 2 SPIKE's original hit series, Option Hunter, attracted about 1.8 million viewers an average. The network also debuted a new series, American Digger, to an average 1.1 million viewers.
In October, SPIKE will look to big rating with the premium of Tattoo Nightmares and Jersey Shore creators Sally and Salsano and the season 2 of the hit series, INK MASTER, hosted by Dave Navarro.
CMT's standout performance in the third quarter came from a successful 2012 CMT music awards, which attracted nearly 3 million viewers. The network also continues to break through with new episodes of its hit series, The Big Redneck Vacation, and its first reality competition series, Redneck Island, which debuted in June.
Moving onto international. We continue to see some softness in the international economic environment, particularly in Europe. However, strong affiliate growth from both digital distribution and organic growth, combined with a strong cost management, offset lower advertising ancillary sales in the quarter.
We continue to expand the region success of our adult focused business internationally. As rates for Comedy Central improved 27% across the board, double-digit increases in markets, including the U.K, Germany, Spain, Poland, The Netherlands, Sweden and Hungary. Paramount Channel performed very well in its first quarter on air, and signed 120 advertisers in its first 3 months of operation despite tough economic conditions in Spain.
Nickelodeon also saw ratings improved by about 5% internationally. Having an effort to drive popular content in the audiences around the world, MTV's Jersey Shore began MTV U.K. Geordie Shore, which is enjoying its highest-rated season so far and remains the highest-rated series in network's history.
The series is a bona fide international hit, attracting big audiences and all the other countries where it is, particularly Spain, Australia and Ireland. Despite difficult economic times, we continue to invest. Comedy Central is fast becoming our third global brand, and we plan on launching at least 5 additional Paramount Channels in 2013.
Let's turn now to our Filmed Entertainment division. Despite a very different mix of films for the third quarter fircal 2012 and the blockbuster-heavy comparable quarter last year, Paramount saw success with TITANIC 3D, which has grossed more than $300 million in worldwide box office to date, and DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. Paramount remains on a great long-term creative path with a nimble approach to distribution will help give its releases maximum visibility within the U.S. and abroad.
Example of the studio move G.I. Joe: Retaliation out of this summer's credit field to March 2013, allowing for 3D conversion of the film and potential entry into the newly expanded Chinese marketplace.
In addition to carefully calibrating its release strategy, Paramount continues judiciously manage costs and effectively reduce overhead.
To conclude, Viacom's good firm in the third quarter of our fiscal year, confronted challenges and again delivered value for shareholders. As we move forward into a fall season, and we'll see an influx of new original content across our networks, we will continue to strengthen our audience connections, giving us a strong path to drive ratings and revenue. We'll continue to put our theatrical releases in the best possible position to succeed at the box office, by aggressively pursuing new opportunities as they arise.
We will operate with an unflinching eye toward operational excellence, capturing efficiencies and managing costs. And as always, we will continue to aggressively return capital to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation, summarizing the results of our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly.
This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's June quarter exclude $11 million of discrete tax benefit. Now let's take a look at our segment results.
At our Media Networks segment, revenues decreased 5% to $2.3 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenues declined 5%, and international revenues were down 7%. Foreign exchange had a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.
As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues were down 7% in the quarter. International advertising declined 18%, the forward exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 6 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional event in the quarter, as well as softness in parts of Europe.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues decreased 1%, while international revenues increased 10%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 4 percentage points.
Decline in domestic affiliate revenues reflects the greater availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreements in the June quarter of last year, partially offset by great increases in the June quarter of this year.
Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single-digit to the quarter.
International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreement, rate in subscriber increases and new channel launches. Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 14% in the quarter, primarily due to lower consumer product licensing and Home Entertainment revenues.
Media Networks adjusted operating income of $934 million in the quarter decreased 10% as compared to the June quarter of last year. The operating margin of 41% decreased approximately 200 basis points versus the prior year.  The decrease in margin was driven by the top line decline of 5%, partially offset by a 2% decrease in expenses.
Within expenses, programming expense grew 6%, while SG&A expense declined 9%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued and incentive-based compensation expense, savings realized from our 2011 restructuring, as well as lower advertising and promotion expense, primarily related to the timing of awardships.
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 29% to $1 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 52% to $283 million in the quarter. The decrease in theatrical revenues was principally due to lower revenues from the current quarters releases. The June quarter of this year had 3 releases as compared to 4 releases in the June quarter of last year.
Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues decreased 8% to $304 million in the quarter, primarily due to the mix of titles released in the quarter.
TV license fees declined 24% to $315 million. The decrease in TV license fees in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in network TV and foreign syndication marketplaces. Ancillary revenues increased 44% to $104 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher digital revenues.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $46 million in the quarter as compared to income of $49 million last year. 
Moving below operating income, total company equity income from investments was $10 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

In terms of our free cash flow for the quarter, we generated $197 million in operating free cash flow in the June quarter compared to $369 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow.
The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to lower operating income and higher cash tax payments, partially offset by lower working capital utilization. The increase in cash taxes paid is due to the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to film and TV production.
As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 5%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago. So we continue to make great progress on lowering our average cost of debt.
To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter end.
During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rates in the public markets to maintain our leverage and our target level. We issued 300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in 2022, and an additional 100 million of 1.25% senior notes due in 2015.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.2 billion of debt and cap leases outstanding and $774 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 11x.
In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $833 million of capital back to our shareholders in June, in the June quarter.
Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately 700 million of our stock in the September quarter. So for our fiscal year, we will have returned a total of approximately $3.4 billion to our shareholders, which is a return on market cap of 14%.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. As for our affiliate revenue, we are confident in our ability to grow these revenues in light of our recent renewal with DirecTV. In the September quarter, we expect that domestic affiliate revenue will grow double digits, taking into consideration both the impact from the DirecTV rate increase and the blackout period.
Additionally, domestic advertising in the September quarter will be impacted by the blackout. This will reduce the domestic advertising growth rate by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. At Media Networks, we expect that programming expense will increase approximately 6% for the full year.
In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to evolve our business model to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to enhance our margins.
In the September quarter, Filmed Entertainment revenues will face difficult comparisons to last year's theatrical and home video performance of Transformers 3, as well as the theatrical performance of Captain America.  However, studio should generate profits comparable to the September quarter of last year, as it benefits from the carryover performance of prior quarter theatrical releases and the availability of them titles and that TV marketplace, as well as lower overhead costs.
For 2012, we continue to forecast a book tax rate of 34.5%. As for our stock buyback program, we are on track to repurchase 2.8 billion for fiscal 2012.
Looking ahead at the studio slate and the development pipeline, in October, they'll release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. In November, the studio will release Flight directed by Academy award winner Robert and starring Academy award winner Denzel Washington. In November, Paramount will be distributing DreamWorks Animation Rise of the Guardian. For the holiday, Paramount will reprise Jack Reacher, which stars Tom Cruise and is based on the best selling book series.
As we look into 2013, the studio will be releasing sequels to existing franchises, including G.I. Joe, retaliation in March and the next installment of Star Trek, directed by J.J. Abrams in May, both of which will be in 3D. In June, they released World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt. Looking at Paramount's development, they have started production on Noah, which is directed by Darren Tarnowski, and stars Russell Crowe and soon, they will begin production on the new installment to the Jack Ryan series, with Chris Pine in the lead role.
Paramount is also in development on the Nickelodeon branded Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, which is being produced by Michael Bai, as well as on a sequel to Anchorman, which would reunite the original cast.
In summary, we remain focused on growing our businesses organically and using our free cash flow and the incremental capacity generated from our balance sheet, to return capital to our shareholders.
While we have experienced rating softness, we remain committed to investing in our brands and increasing the level of original programming on our networks in order to strengthen their competitive position.
We continue to be encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands and franchises on both traditional and digital platforms. The ability to secure long-term growth in our affiliation units at the opportunity to grow our international profitability and to develop global franchises with consumer products appeal will enhance our long-term growth.
We believe our focus on organic investment, combined with disciplined management of our core structure and an aggressive capital return program, will drive value for our shareholders over the long term.

The first is, I remember back like the '06, '09 time period, we were all very nervous about Paramount, was it going to flip into negative operating income. For a couple of years now, I think based on what you said on the call, you generated sort of $300 million-ish of operating income pretty consistently because I think we all struggled with how to model that. I was wondering if you could talk about how much of that something that the structural so to change the cost structure Paramount as opposed to just the vagaries of how well or poorly your films do? And my second question is on the ratings, if things go according to plan, what month do you think we can begin to see ratings improve if the investments work out?"

And as you correctly point out, we're obviously subject to the vagaries of the film business. But we've been very and have been very disciplined on that front as well. As I talked about before, we've modified the strategy, the film strategy of Paramount to focus on a limited number of releases and focus on franchises and our brands, and that reduces the risk. We very much look at this resort situation, and that's why our ROI has been pretty steady at Paramount, and we will endeavor to keep it that way despite the vagaries of the studio business and some of the dynamics you all know about, such as the decrease in DVD. And the marketplace, somewhat off-base offset by digital revenues coming on play. As far as predicting months, what month or what week or whatever rating, we kept -- we don't do that. What we do is we focus on building on the programs that work, expanding them, adding new programs and you can never predict the magnitude of a hit when it comes. When it comes, and you take a lot of it best, when it comes, you just ride it. And we obviously hope to improve it. We're certainly making investment. As I mentioned before, we have intensified our focus on programming talent. And our long history the business shows that, that will bear fruit over time, and we're not able to predict days, weeks or particular months, but the magnitude of the new programs coming on give us reason to believe we're going to see improvement as we head into the new fiscal year."

As far as affiliate revenues, the way we have conducted our renewables over the last several years, we never have more than 20% of our revenues that are up for renewal in any given year. In the year where we have used distributor like DirectTV, that's kind of the high watermark, where it's close to 20%. We just went through that. It'll be a lower percentage of our revenue in the next couple of years, which was your question. So we have a nice portfolio of affiliate revenue, that's why we're able to so confidently predict the affiliate revenue growth as we go forward. We don't have a situation we have an overwhelming amount of our revenue up in a given year. As far as international advertising trends in the quarter, we expect to see some improvement in our performance in this quarter compared to the quarter we just completed. There are a lot of evidence that we had in prior year that didn't replicate. And on any kind of those events, very often of, we look up to do events that are profitable. So it's not all a revenue story. We look to have profitable events so even though the ad revenue they go down because of the absence of an event, it doesn't impact the profitability to that same degree because they're costs associated obviously with that. And that's why we've been able to grow the margins and the profitability in addition to the other steps we're taking in the international. As far as the current scatter market, it's pretty healthy, which is, as Tom said, as our rates improve, we can take advantage of it. Scatter pricing, scatter over scatter right now is up year-on-year, and it's significantly up over upfront. So as Tom said, we'll be able to take advantage as the ratings improve."

Despite challenges, Viacom made solid progress on several fronts in the third quarter of our fiscal year. Our industry-leading brands continue to grow and evolve across platforms, as well as geographic and demographic borders. We continued our sustained investment in creative content, especially at Nickelodeon and other key networks, and we are seeing promising signs that this investment will bear fruit.
Our strong audience bonds and the breadth of our network portfolio were big factors, not only in our strong performance in the recent advertising upfront, but also in our successful, albeit unnecessarily noisy, completion of an extra long-term carriage deal with DIRECTV 2 weeks ago. The DIRECTV deal keeps us firmly on the path to generate sustainable, high single to low double-digit annual affiliate revenue growth. 
We are also now heading into a period where we will see growing results for our investments in international channel launches and consumer products initiatives. At the same time, Viacom's bottom line benefited from our relentless focus on operational efficiency. This tight rein on costs also serves to fortify our already strong balance sheet. As a result, Viacom remains a reliable generator of significant free cash flow even in challenging times. And we consistently make good on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. With this unwavering strategic focus, Viacom will generate significant long-term value for our shareholders. 
This morning, I will provide an overview of our financial results for the third quarter and review highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will give additional color, and then we'll take your questions.
Let's begin with the numbers. Viacom's revenues decreased 14% to $3.24 billion in the third quarter, driven primarily by the mix of our Filmed Entertainment titles and lower advertising revenues. Adjusted operating income decreased 9% to $903 million. In our Media Networks segment, revenue declined 5% and adjusted operating income declined 10% due to lower advertising and ancillary revenues. Home Entertainment revenues decreased 29%, reflecting the number and mix of releases in the June quarter in comparison to the same period last year, which featured substantial theatrical hits, including Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Super 8, Marvel's Thor and DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda 2.
Adjusted operating income in Filmed Entertainment decreased $3 million, reflecting the revenue decline and substantially offset by lower expenses. Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations declined 12% to $512 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 2% to $0.97 in the June quarter. Foreign exchange negatively affected earnings per share by $0.02.
In the quarter, Viacom announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share. Last week, our Board of Directors declared our next quarterly cash dividend to be paid October 1. The company also repurchased $700 million in stock under our share repurchase program in the third quarter, and we expect to buy back $700 million in stock this quarter, with a total of $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year.
Let's move on to highlights in our divisions. Our Media Networks experienced some cyclical rating softness that we are well equipped to overcome, as we have demonstrated in the past. More than any other programmer, Viacom's networks are built for reinvention, powered by our $3 billion investment in content this fiscal year. Our networks each have clear, established brand filters, which are introducing more and more original content. From BET to MTV to most recently VH1, our brands are consistently able to evolve with audiences, create hits and capture the cultural conversation. Example, 50% of VH1's current primetime schedule consists of returning hits, the highest percentage in 4 years, and the networks hit ratio was up 22% of our fiscal 2011. 
Domestic advertising revenues decreased 7% due to the timing of 2 key award shows, as we previously signaled in our second quarter earnings call, as well as rating softness at certain networks. This year, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards aired in the second quarter, and the BET Awards aired early in the fiscal fourth quarter. Both aired in the third quarter last year, resulting in difficult year-on-year quarterly comps.
Worldwide advertising revenues decreased 9% for the quarter due to softness in Europe. As I mentioned earlier, we concluded the June quarter by successfully completing our upfront negotiations. We are very pleased with the outcome. Despite ratings issues in Nickelodeon, we were able to maintain the same share of the kids' upfront volume as last year. Overall, our total upfront dollars were more than $2.8 billion, up from last year, and we secured solid mid-single-digit increases in pricing.
Looking at the current quarter, while it is still early and difficult to predict, we are tracking to sequential improvement in domestic advertising revenue performance. In distribution, domestic affiliate revenues decreased 1% in the third quarter, which primarily reflects the significance of additional distribution revenues recorded in the same quarter last year. Worldwide affiliate fees increased 1%. As we have discussed in the past, revenue recognition requirements relating to digital sales create bumps in our usually steady affiliate sales growth path. If you exclude the impact of digital distribution agreements, our domestic affiliate revenue growth was right on target in the high single digits. In its fourth quarter, domestic affiliate revenue growth will be in double digits.
Throughout the quarter, we continued to deepen our partnerships with our distributors on existing and emerging platforms. Notably, we increased distribution for a number of our HD simulcast while also completing an agreement to make our programming available through Time Warner Cable's in-home streaming app. 
As noted earlier, in the current quarter, we successfully completed a challenging renewal negotiation with DIRECTV, striking a long-term agreement with an initial rate increase of significantly more than 20% and healthy annual increases in excess of those we had in the expired deal for the remainder of the 7-year term. In fact, the deal we ultimately signed was materially better for Viacom than the deal that was on the table at the time that DIRECTV made the unfortunate decision to drop our networks. In addition to rate increases, we secured increased or new distribution for Nicktoons, Tr3s and several HD channels. We secured a long-term commitment from DIRECTV to distribute our channels in Latin America via PanAmericana and Sky Brazil. And we forged a long-term agreement for DIRECTV to continue to offer Paramount films on Pay Per View.
In short, we are extremely pleased with our DIRECTV agreement and only disappointed that so many of our viewers were deprived of their favorite channels for 9 long days. We certainly hope this will be the only blip in what had been until now in my 6-year tenure a perfect record of completing affiliate renewals with every other distributor in the U.S. or elsewhere without disruption to customers.
Also notable in the quarter, our continued strategic moves to expand our Consumer Products business. In the past few weeks, the first toys and merchandise based on Nickelodeon's forthcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series debut on shelves at Toys""R""Us. The line of action figures, vehicles and more will be available in its entirety across all retailers this month in advance of the much-anticipated series premiere in September. Products for Nickelodeon's Winx Club have also begun to roll out and will continue to hit retail stores into the fall. 
Additionally, COMEDY CENTRAL recently launched COMEDY CENTRAL Enterprises, a new division that will unite and grow the network's ancillary revenue businesses, including consumer products, home videos, CDs and digital downloads, publishing and live touring for its roster of stand-up comedians.
MTV is focused on programming innovation as it continues to diversify its slate with new scripted and reality series that's built on a strong base of returning hits. In the third quarter, those hits included Teen Mom, which was the #1 cable series in the quarter in the key 12-34 demo; Teen Wolf, which was up 6% year-on-year in the quarter and Jersey Shore spinoff, Snooki & JWOWW, which was #1 in its time period across television and the demo. 
In the new fiscal year, we'll start with a season of Jersey Shore. In addition, MTV will introduce a range of reality and docu series, including Catfish, The Heights and Wait Till Next Year, as well as new scripted comedies, The Inbetweeners, Underemployed and Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous. In addition, Teen Wolf and Awkward were recently renewed for third seasons or double their original order of episodes.
In COMEDY CENTRAL, Tosh.0 and Workaholics delivered solid performances in the third quarter, as each returned with new episodes. This fall, COMEDY CENTRAL hits the campaign trail hard with election coverage in The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which remained dominant in late night. In fact, The Daily Show is the #1 late-night show in all of television with adults 18 to 49. The Daily Show and Colbert are the only 2 late-night shows to grow their viewership in the demo this broadcast season, while Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert will remain with COMEDY CENTRAL, thanks to recent contract extensions. On the campaign blitz, COMEDY CENTRAL will debut Daniel Tosh's new animated series, Brickleberry, along with new seasons of Tosh.0, South Park and Key & Peele this fall.
Despite rating softness, Nickelodeon had success with new episodes of iCarly and SpongeBob SquarePants and the original TV movie, Rags, which reached 14 million total viewers. In the current quarter, the network is beginning to show momentum. Nickelodeon premiered a new SpongeBob special, Super Spongy Square Games, on July 22 with average 3.7 million total viewers. On the episode, Nickelodeon gave fans a sneak peek in an upcoming series, You Gotta See This!, and the episode retained the overwhelming majority of the SpongeBob audience, including 99% of teens 9 to 14. A bright spot for Nickelodeon has been its new hit game show lineup. Figure It Out premiered in the third fiscal quarter with new episodes averaging 2.2 million total viewers. And Splatalot was added to the schedule in the current quarter, which is retaining 99% of the kids 6 to 11 audience from its Figure It Out lead-in. Splatalot is also showing solid time period gains over the months prior. 
In addition to new programming, we're aggressively fine-tuning the schedule to drive viewership, which is resulting in significant time period gains for a number of Nickelodeon's signature series. The recent SpongeBob special posted big gains in its time period versus a year ago and the month prior. Big Time Rush is averaging 2.2 million viewers per episode this quarter, up double digits in all key demos versus a year ago. And just last Saturday, new -- the newest Fred movie, Camp Fred, averaged 3.5 million viewers and ranked as the #1 cable telecast for the week for teens 9 to 14. 
As we've said previously, Nickelodeon is debuting 650 new episodes of original programming for the upcoming broadcast season, including more than 130 from October to December. And just today, Nickelodeon is announcing a programming slate of 14 new series, TV movies and pilots, adding live-action and animation. As we have continually seen, fresh content has renewed and expanded engagement, particularly among young viewers. Nickelodeon is now poised for an upsurge and soon. That includes the long-awaited debut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on September 29; new episodes of animated series, including SpongeBob SquarePants, Kung Fu Panda and the Penguins of Madagascar; new episodes of live-action hits, including Big Time Rush, Victorious and the final season of iCarly; and great-event programming, including Worldwide Day of Play, The HALO Awards and a SpongeBob Christmas special.
This fall, Nick at Nite will premiere See Dad Run, a new family comedy starring Scott Baio. Nick at Nite has gained recent momentum from Friends, which is seeing a 6% increase in ratings year-over-year. Also this fall, the NickMom nightly programming block, which is being enthusiastically received by advertisers, will debut on Nick Jr. with 4 new original series.
BET continues to serve African-American audiences with a dynamic mix of scripted originals, including The Game and Let's Stay Together; big-event programming, including the BET Awards; and reliably strong unscripted series, including 106 & Park and Sunday Best. The Game and Let's Stay Together continue to anchor BET's primetime lineup as the #1 and #2 original sitcoms on cable. BET also has several original scripted and unscripted series debuting in the coming year, including sitcoms Second Generation Wayans, featuring the next generation of the Wayans family; and new late night series, Don't Sleep, hosted by journalist, T.J. Holmes.
VH1 is successfully broadening its creative mission with a wide variety of programs and formats for the network's adult-stirred target audience. In the third quarter, VH1's primetime range were up 22%, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year primetime growth in its targeted adult demo. Looking ahead, the networks has a significant number of returning hit series, including Rehab with Dr. Drew, We Have Adopted Drew, T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle and Pop Up Video.
TV Land also has a lot to look forward to, with its hit tandem of Hot in Cleveland and Happily Divorced set to return with new episodes this fall. Just last month, Hot in Cleveland was picked up for syndication by local TV stations, earning 65% of the U.S., including 9 of the top 10 markets.
SPIKE continues to broaden its audience, expanding and diversifying its original programming with a male-skewing general entertainment filter. In the third quarter, Season 2 of SPIKE's original hit series, Auction Hunters, attracted about 1.8 million viewers on average. The network also debuted the new series, American Digger, to an average 1.1 million viewers. In October, SPIKE will look to ink big ratings with the premiere of Tattoo Nightmares of Jersey Shore creators Sally Ann Salsano and Season 2 of the hit series Ink Master, hosted by Dave Navarro.
CMT's standout performance in the third quarter came from the successful 2012 CMT Music Awards, which attracted nearly 3 million viewers. The network also continues to break through with new episodes of its hit series, My Big Redneck Vacation, and its first reality competition series, Redneck Island, which debuted in June.
Moving onto international. We continue to see some softness in the international economic environment, particularly in Europe. However, strong affiliate growth from both digital distribution and organic growth, combined with strong cost management, offset lower advertising ancillary sales in the quarter.
We continue to expand the regional success of our adult-focused business internationally, as ratings for COMEDY CENTRAL improved 27% across the board; double-digit increases in markets, including the U.K, Germany, Spain, Poland, The Netherlands, Sweden and Hungary. The Paramount Channel performed very well in its first quarter on air and signed 120 advertisers in its first 3 months of operation despite tough economic conditions in Spain. Nickelodeon also saw ratings improved by about 5% internationally. And in an effort to drive popular content in new audiences around the world, MTV's Jersey Shore began MTV U.K.'s Geordie Shore, which is enjoying its highest-rated season so far and remains the highest-rated series in the network's history. The series is a bona fide international hit, attracting big audiences in all the other countries where it airs, particularly Spain, Australia and Ireland. Despite difficult economic times, we continue to invest. COMEDY CENTRAL is fast becoming our third global brand, and we plan on launching at least 5 additional Paramount Channels in 2013.
Let's turn now to our Filmed Entertainment division. Despite a very different mix of films in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and the blockbuster-heavy comparable quarter last year, Paramount saw success with Titanic 3D, which has grossed more than $300 million in worldwide box office to date; and DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. Paramount remains on a great long-term creative path with a nimble approach to distribution, while it help give its releases maximum visibility, both in the U.S. and abroad. Example, the studio moved G.I. Joe: Retaliation out of this summer's crowded field to March 2013, allowing for 3D conversion of the film and potential entry into the newly expanded Chinese marketplace. In addition to carefully calibrating its release strategy, Paramount continues to judiciously manage costs and effectively reduce overhead.
To conclude, Viacom's good firm in the third quarter of our fiscal year confronted challenges and again delivered value for shareholders. As we move forward into a fall season that we'll see an influx of new original content across our networks, we will continue to strengthen our audience connections, leading us to a strong path to drive ratings and revenue. We'll continue to put our theatrical releases in the best possible position to succeed at the box office, aggressively pursuing new opportunities as they arise. We will operate with an unflinching eye toward operational excellence, capturing efficiencies and managing costs. And as always, we will continue to aggressively return capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our June quarter.

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly.
This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's June quarter exclude $11 million of discrete tax benefit. 
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues decreased 5% to $2.3 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenues declined 5%, and international revenues were down 7%. Foreign exchange had a 4-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenues. 
Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues were down 7% in the quarter. International advertising declined 18%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 6 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter, as well as softness in parts of Europe. 
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues decreased 1%, while international revenues increased 10%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 4 percentage points. Decline in domestic affiliate revenues reflects the greater availability of programming associated with the digital distribution agreements in the June quarter of last year, partially offset by great increases in the June quarter of this year. Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreements, rate in subscriber increases and new channel launches. 
Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 14% in the quarter, primarily due to lower Consumer Product licensing and Home Entertainment revenues. Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $934 million in the quarter decreased 10% as compared to the June quarter of last year. The operating margin of 41% decreased approximately 200 basis points versus the prior year. The decrease in margin was driven by the top line decline of 5%, partially offset by a 2% decrease in expenses.
Within expenses, programming expense grew 6%, while SG&A expense declined 9%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense, savings realized from our 2011 restructuring, as well as lower advertising and promotion expense primarily related to the timing of award shows.
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 29% to $1 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 52% to $283 million in the quarter. The decrease in theatrical revenues was principally due to lower revenues from the current quarter's releases. The June quarter of this year had 3 releases as compared to 4 releases in the June quarter of last year. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues decreased 8% to $304 million in the quarter, primarily due to the mix of titles released in the quarter. TV license fees declined 24% to $315 million. The decrease in TV license fees in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in network TV and foreign syndication marketplaces. Ancillary revenues increased 44% to $104 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher digital revenues. 
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $46 million in the quarter as compared to income of $49 million last year. Moving below operating income, total company equity income from investments was $10 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year.In terms of our free cash flow for the",1018,"Thanks, Jimmy. I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year.
In terms of our free cash flow for the quarter, we generated $197 million in operating free cash flow in the June quarter compared to $369 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to lower operating income and higher cash tax payments, partially offset by lower working cap utilization. The increase in cash taxes paid is due to the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to film and TV production. 
As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter-end of 5%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago. So we continue to make great progress on lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter-end.
During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rates in the public markets to maintain our leverage and our target level. We issued $300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in 2022, and an additional $100 million of 1.25% senior notes due in 2015. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.2 billion of debt and cap leases outstanding and $774 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 11x.
In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $833 million of capital back to our shareholders in June -- in the June quarter. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately 700 million of our stock in the September quarter. So for our fiscal year, we will have returned a total of approximately $3.4 billion to our shareholders, which is a return on market cap of 14%.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. As for our affiliate revenue, we are confident in our ability to grow these revenues in light of our recent renewal with DIRECTV. In the September quarter, we expect that domestic affiliate revenue will grow double digits, taking into consideration both the impact from the DIRECTV rate increase and the blackout period. Additionally, domestic advertising in the September quarter will be impacted by the blackout. This will reduce the domestic advertising growth rate by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. 
At Media Networks, we expect that programming expense will increase approximately 6% for the full year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to evolve our business model to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to enhance our margins.
In the September quarter, Filmed Entertainment revenues will face difficult comparisons to last year's theatrical and home video performance of Transformers 3, as well as the theatrical performance of Captain America. However, the studio should generate profits comparable to the September quarter of last year, as it benefits from the carryover performance of prior quarter theatrical releases and the availability of film titles in the TV marketplace, as well as lower overhead costs. 
For 2012, we continue to forecast a book tax rate of 34.5%. As for our stock buyback program, we are on track to repurchase 2.8 billion for fiscal 2012.
Looking ahead at the studio's slate and the development pipeline, in October, they'll release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. In November, the studio will release Flight, directed by Academy Award winner Robert Zemeckis and starring Academy Award winner Denzel Washington. In November, Paramount will be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. For the Holidays, Paramount will release Jack Reacher, which stars Tom Cruise and is based on the bestselling book series.
As we look into 2013, the studio will be releasing sequels to existing franchises, including G.I. Joe: Retaliation in March; and the next installment of Star Trek, directed by J.J. Abrams, in May, both of which will be in 3D. In June, they'll release World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt. Looking at Paramount's developments, they have started production on Noah, which is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Russell Crowe; and soon, they will begin production on the new installment to the Jack Ryan series, with Chris Pine in the lead role. Paramount is also in development on the Nickelodeon-branded Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, which is being produced by Michael Bay; as well as on a sequel to Anchorman, which will reunite the original cast.
In summary, we remain focused on growing our businesses organically and using our free cash flow and the incremental capacity generated from our balance sheet to return capital to our shareholders. While we have experienced rating softness, we remain committed to investing in our brands and increasing the level of original programming on our networks in order to strengthen their competitive position. We continue to be encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands and franchises on both traditional and digital platforms. The ability to secure long-term growth in our affiliation agreements with the opportunity to grow our international profitability and to develop global franchises with consumer products appeal will enhance our long-term growth. We believe our focus on organic investment, combined with disciplined management of our core structure and an aggressive capital return program, will drive value for our shareholders over the long term.

As far as DIRECTV, as I said, this was not -- we hate to see a blackout occur. It's never -- shall never occur in all the other renewals we've concluded. We look at distribution in a holistic way. We value all of our distribution partnerships. We evaluate what we -- what content we put on new -- so-called new distribution, additional distribution. Mobile is also emerging.

As far as predicting months, what month or what week or whatever rating quarter, we can't -- we don't do that. What we do is we focus on building on the programs that work, expanding them, adding new programs, and you can never predict the magnitude of a hit when it comes.

As far as affiliate revenues, the way we have conducted our renewables over the last several years, we never have more than 20% of our revenues that are up for renewal in any given year. In the year where we have a huge distributor like DIRECTV, that's kind of the high watermark, where it's close to 20%. We just went through that. It'll be a lower percentage of our revenue in the next couple of years, which was your question. So we have a nice portfolio of affiliate revenue. That's why we're able to so confidently predict the affiliate revenue growth as we go forward. We don't have a situation where we have overwhelming amount of our revenue up in a given year. As far as international advertising trends in the quarter, we expect to see some improvement in our performance in this quarter compared to the quarter we just completed. There were a lot of events that we had in prior year that didn't replicate. And in any kind of these events, very often that we look to do events that are profitable. So it's not all a revenue story. We look to have profitable events. So even though the ad revenue they go down because of the absence of an event, it doesn't impact the profitability to that same degree because there are costs associated, obviously, with that. And that's why we've been able to grow the margins and the profitability, in addition to the other steps we're taking in the international. As far as the current scatter market, it's pretty healthy, which is, as Tom said, as our rates improve, we can take advantage of it. Scatter pricing scatter-over-scatter right now is up year-on-year, and it's significantly up over upfront. So as Tom said, we'll be able to take advantage as our ratings improve."

Despite challenges, Viacom made solid progress on several fronts in the third quarter of our fiscal year. Our industry-leading brands continue to grow and evolve across platforms, as well as geographic and demographic borders. We continued our sustained investment in creative content, especially at Nickelodeon and other key networks, and we are seeing promising signs that this investment will bear fruit.
Our strong audience bonds and the breadth of our network portfolio were big factors, not only in our strong performance in the recent advertising upfront, but also in our successful, albeit unnecessarily noisy, completion of an extra long-term carriage deal with DIRECTV 2 weeks ago. The DIRECTV deal keeps us firmly on the path to generate sustainable, high single to low double-digit annual affiliate revenue growth. 
We are also now heading into a period where we will see growing results for our investments in international channel launches and consumer products initiatives. At the same time, Viacom's bottom line benefited from our relentless focus on operational efficiency. This tight rein on costs also serves to fortify our already strong balance sheet. As a result, Viacom remains a reliable generator of significant free cash flow even in challenging times. And we consistently make good on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Through this unwavering strategic focus, Viacom will generate significant long-term value for our shareholders. 
This morning, I will provide an overview of our financial results for the third quarter and review highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will give additional color, and then we'll take your questions.
Let's begin with the numbers. Viacom's revenues decreased 14% to $3.24 billion in the third quarter, driven primarily by the mix of our Filmed Entertainment titles and lower advertising revenues. Adjusted operating income decreased 9% to $903 million. In our Media Networks segment, revenue declined 5% and adjusted operating income declined 10% due to lower advertising and ancillary revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues decreased 29%, reflecting the number and mix of releases in the June quarter in comparison to the same period last year, which featured substantial theatrical hits, including Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Super 8, Marvel's Thor and DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda 2. Adjusted operating income in Filmed Entertainment decreased $3 million, reflecting the revenue decline and substantially offset by lower expenses. Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations declined 12% to $512 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 2% to $0.97 in the June quarter. Foreign exchange negatively affected earnings per share by $0.02.
In the quarter, Viacom announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share. Last week, our Board of Directors declared our next quarterly cash dividend to be paid October 1. The company also repurchased $700 million in stock under our share repurchase program in the third quarter, and we expect to buy back $700 million in stock this quarter, for a total of $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year.
Let's move on to highlights in our divisions. Our Media Networks experienced some cyclical rating softness that we are well equipped to overcome, as we have demonstrated in the past. More than any other programmer, Viacom's networks are built for reinvention, powered by our $3 billion investment in content this fiscal year. Our networks each have clear, established brand filters, to which they are introducing more and more original content. From BET to MTV to most recently VH1, our brands are consistently able to evolve with audiences, create hits and capture the cultural conversation. For example, 50% of VH1's current primetime schedule consists of returning hits, the highest percentage in 4 years, and the networks hit ratio was up 22% of our fiscal 2011. 
Domestic advertising revenues decreased 7% due to the timing of 2 key award shows, as we previously signaled in our second quarter earnings call, as well as rating softness at certain networks. This year, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards aired in the second quarter, and the BET Awards aired early in the fiscal fourth quarter. Both aired in the third quarter last year, resulting in difficult year-on-year quarterly comps.
Worldwide advertising revenues decreased 9% for the quarter due to softness in Europe. As I mentioned earlier, we concluded the June quarter by successfully completing our upfront negotiations. We are very pleased with the outcome. Despite ratings issues in Nickelodeon, we were able to maintain the same share of the kids' upfront volume as last year. Overall, our total upfront dollars were more than $2.8 billion, up from last year, and we secured solid mid-single-digit increases in pricing.
Looking at the current quarter, while it is still early and difficult to predict, we are tracking to sequential improvement in domestic advertising revenue performance. In distribution, domestic affiliate revenues decreased 1% in the third quarter, which primarily reflects the significance of additional distribution revenues recorded in the same quarter last year. Worldwide affiliate fees increased 1%. As we have discussed in the past, revenue recognition requirements relating to digital sales create bumps in our usually steady affiliate sales growth path. If you exclude the impact of digital distribution agreements, our domestic affiliate revenue growth was right on target in the high single digits. In its fourth quarter, domestic affiliate revenue growth will be in double digits.
Throughout the quarter, we continued to deepen our partnerships with our distributors on existing and emerging platforms. Notably, we increased distribution for a number of our HD simulcast, while also completing an agreement to make our programming available through Time Warner Cable's in-home streaming app. 
As noted earlier, in the current quarter, we successfully completed a challenging renewal negotiation with DIRECTV, striking a long-term agreement with an initial rate increase of significantly more than 20% and healthy annual increases in excess of those we had in the expired deal for the remainder of the 7-year term. In fact, the deal we ultimately signed was materially better for Viacom than the deal that was on the table at the time that DIRECTV made the unfortunate decision to drop our networks. In addition to rate increases, we secured increased or new distribution for Nicktoons, Tr3s and several HD channels. We secured a long-term commitment from DIRECTV to distribute our channels in Latin America via PanAmericana and Sky Brazil. And we forged a long-term agreement for DIRECTV to continue to offer Paramount films on Pay Per View.
In short, we are extremely pleased with our DIRECTV agreement and only disappointed that so many of our viewers were deprived of their favorite channels for 9 long days. We certainly hope this will be the only blip in what had been until now, in my 6-year tenure, our perfect record of completing affiliate renewals with every other distributor in the U.S. or elsewhere without disruption to customers.
Also notable in the quarter, our continued strategic moves to expand our consumer products business. In the past few weeks, the first toys and merchandise based on Nickelodeon's forthcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series debut on shelves at Toys ‘R Us. The line of action figures, vehicles and more will be available in its entirety across all retailers this month in advance of the much-anticipated series premiere in September. Products for Nickelodeon's Winx Club have also begun to roll out and will continue to hit retail stores into the fall. 
Additionally, COMEDY CENTRAL recently launched COMEDY CENTRAL Enterprises, a new division that will unite and grow the network's ancillary revenue businesses, including consumer products, home videos, CDs and digital downloads, publishing and live touring for its roster of stand-up comedians.
MTV is focused on programming innovation as it continues to diversify its slate with new scripted and reality series that's built on a strong base of returning hits. In the third quarter, those hits included Teen Mom, which was the #1 cable series in the quarter in the key 12-34 demo; Teen Wolf, which was up 6% year-on-year in the quarter and Jersey Shore spinoff, Snooki & JWOWW, which was #1 in its time period across television and the demo. 
In the new fiscal year, we'll start with a new season of Jersey Shore. In addition, MTV will introduce a range of reality and docu series, including Catfish, The Heights and Wait Till Next Year, as well as new scripted comedies, The Inbetweeners, Underemployed and Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous. In addition, Teen Wolf and Awkward were recently renewed for third seasons for double their original order of episodes.
On COMEDY CENTRAL, Tosh.0 and Workaholics delivered solid performances in the third quarter, as each returned with new episodes. This fall, COMEDY CENTRAL hits the campaign trail hard with election coverage from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which remained dominant in late night. In fact, The Daily Show is the #1 late-night show in all of television with adults 18 to 49. The Daily Show and Colbert are the only 2 late-night shows to grow their viewership in the demo this broadcast season, while Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert will remain with COMEDY CENTRAL, thanks to recent contract extensions. Beyond the campaign blitz, COMEDY CENTRAL will debut Daniel Tosh's new animated series, Brickleberry, along with new seasons of Tosh.0, South Park and Key & Peele this fall.
Despite rating softness, Nickelodeon had success with new episodes of iCarly and SpongeBob SquarePants and the original TV movie, Rags, which reached 14 million total viewers. In the current quarter, the network is beginning to show momentum. Nickelodeon premiered a new SpongeBob special, Super Spongy Square Games, on July 22 with average 3.7 million total viewers. Following the episode, Nickelodeon gave fans a sneak peek in an upcoming series, You Gotta See This!, and the episode retained the overwhelming majority of the SpongeBob audience, including 99% of teens 9 to 14. A bright spot for Nickelodeon has been its new hit game show lineup. Figure It Out premiered in the third fiscal quarter with new episodes averaging 2.2 million total viewers. And Splatalot was added to the schedule in the current quarter, which is retaining 99% of the kids 6 to 11 audience from its Figure It Out lead-in. Splatalot is also showing solid time period gains over the months prior. 
In addition to new programming, we're aggressively fine-tuning the schedule to drive viewership, which is resulting in significant time period gains for a number of Nickelodeon's signature series. The recent SpongeBob special posted big gains in its time period versus a year ago and the month prior. Big Time Rush is averaging 2.2 million viewers per episode this quarter, up double digits in all key demos versus a year ago. And just last Saturday, the new -- the newest Fred movie, Camp Fred, averaged 3.5 million viewers and ranked as the #1 cable telecast for the week for teens 9 to 14. 
As we've said previously, Nickelodeon is debuting 650 new episodes of original programming for the upcoming broadcast season, including more than 130 from October to December. And just today, Nickelodeon is announcing a programming slate of 14 new series, TV movies and pilots, adding live-action and animation. As we have continually seen, fresh content drives renewed and expanded engagement, particularly among young viewers. Nickelodeon is now poised for an upsurge and soon. That includes the long-awaited debut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on September 29; new episodes of animated series, including SpongeBob SquarePants, Kung Fu Panda and the Penguins of Madagascar; new episodes of live-action hits, including Big Time Rush, Victorious and the final season of iCarly; and great-event programming, including Worldwide Day of Play, The HALO Awards and a SpongeBob Christmas special.
This fall, Nick at Nite will premiere See Dad Run, a new family comedy starring Scott Baio. Nick at Nite has gained recent momentum from Friends, which is seeing a 6% increase in ratings year-over-year. Also this fall, the NickMom nightly programming block, which is being enthusiastically received by advertisers, will debut on Nick Jr. with 4 new original series.
BET continues to serve African-American audiences with a dynamic mix of scripted originals, including The Game and Let's Stay Together; big-event programming, including the BET Awards; and reliably strong unscripted series, including 106 & Park and Sunday Best. The Game and Let's Stay Together continue to anchor BET's primetime lineup as the #1 and #2 original sitcoms on cable. BET also has several original scripted and unscripted series debuting in the coming year, including sitcoms Second Generation Wayans, featuring the next generation of the Wayans family; and new late night series, Don't Sleep, hosted by journalist, T.J. Holmes.
VH1 is successfully broadening its creative mission with a wide variety of programs and formats for the network's adult-stirred target audience. In the third quarter, VH1's primetime range were up 22%, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year primetime growth in its targeted adult demo. Looking ahead, the network has a significant number of returning hit series, including Rehab with Dr. Drew, We Have Adopted Drew [ph], T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle and Pop Up Video.
TV Land also has a lot to look forward to, with its hit tandem of Hot in Cleveland and Happily Divorced set to return with new episodes this fall. Just last month, Hot in Cleveland was picked up for syndication by local TV stations, serving 65% of the U.S., including 9 of the top 10 markets.
SPIKE continues to broaden its audience, expanding and diversifying its original programming with a male-skewing general entertainment filter. In the third quarter, Season 2 of SPIKE's original hit series, Auction Hunters, attracted about 1.8 million viewers on average. The network also debuted the new series, American Digger, to an average 1.1 million viewers. In October, SPIKE will look to ink big ratings with the premiere of Tattoo Nightmares from Jersey Shore creators Sally Ann Salsano and Season 2 of the hit series Ink Master, hosted by Dave Navarro.
CMT's standout performance in the third quarter came from the successful 2012 CMT Music Awards, which attracted nearly 3 million viewers. The network also continues to break through with new episodes of its hit series, My Big Redneck Vacation, and its first reality competition series, Redneck Island, which debuted in June.
Moving onto international. We continue to see some softness in the international economic environment, particularly in Europe. However, strong affiliate growth from both digital distribution and organic growth, combined with strong cost management, offset lower advertising ancillary sales in the quarter.
We continue to expand the regional success of our adult-focused business internationally, as ratings for COMEDY CENTRAL improved 27% across the board; with double-digit increases in markets, including the U.K, Germany, Spain, Poland, The Netherlands, Sweden and Hungary. The Paramount Channel performed very well in its first quarter on air and signed 120 advertisers in its first 3 months of operation despite tough economic conditions in Spain. Nickelodeon also saw ratings improved by about 5% internationally. And in an effort to drive popular content in new audiences around the world, MTV's Jersey Shore began MTV U.K.'s Geordie Shore, which is enjoying its highest-rated season so far and remains the highest-rated series in the network's history. The series is a bona fide international hit, attracting big audiences in all the other countries where it airs, particularly Spain, Australia and Ireland. Despite difficult economic times, we continue to invest. COMEDY CENTRAL is fast becoming our third global brand, and we plan on launching at least 5 additional Paramount Channels in 2013.
Let's turn now to our Filmed Entertainment division. Despite a very different mix of films in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and the blockbuster-heavy comparable quarter last year, Paramount saw success with Titanic 3D, which has grossed more than $300 million in worldwide box office to date; and DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. Paramount remains on a great long-term creative path with a nimble approach to distribution, while it help give its releases maximum visibility, both in the U.S. and abroad. For example, the studio moved G.I. Joe: Retaliation out of this summer's crowded field to March 2013, allowing for a 3D conversion of the film and potential entry into the newly expanded Chinese marketplace. In addition to carefully calibrating its release strategy, Paramount continues to judiciously manage costs and effectively reduce overhead.
To conclude, the Viacoms stood firm in the third quarter of our fiscal year, confronted challenges and again delivered value for shareholders. As we move forward into a fall season that we'll see an influx of new original content across our networks, we will continue to strengthen our audience connections, giving us to a strong path to drive ratings and revenue. We'll continue to put our theatrical releases in the best possible position to succeed at the box office by aggressively pursuing new opportunities as they arise. We will operate with an unflinching eye toward operational excellence, capturing efficiencies and managing costs. And as always, we will continue to aggressively return capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly.
This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's June quarter exclude $11 million of discrete tax benefit. 
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues decreased 5% to $2.3 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenues declined 5%, and international revenues were down 7%. Foreign exchange had a 4-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenues. 
Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues were down 7% in the quarter. International advertising declined 18%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 6 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter, as well as softness in parts of Europe. 
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues decreased 1%, while international revenues increased 10%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 4 percentage points. The decline in domestic affiliate revenues reflects the greater availability of programming associated with the digital distribution agreements in the June quarter of last year, partially offset by great increases in the June quarter of this year. Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreements, rate in subscriber increases and new channel launches. 
Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 14% in the quarter, primarily due to lower consumer product licensing and Home Entertainment revenues. Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $934 million in the quarter decreased 10% as compared to the June quarter of last year. The operating margin of 41% decreased approximately 200 basis points versus the prior year. The decrease in margin was driven by the top line decline of 5%, partially offset by a 2% decrease in expenses.
Within expenses, programming expense grew 6%, while SG&A expense declined 9%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense, savings realized from our 2011 restructuring, as well as lower advertising and promotion expense primarily related to the timing of award shows.
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 29% to $1 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 52% to $283 million in the quarter. The decrease in theatrical revenues was principally due to lower revenues from the current quarter's releases. The June quarter of this year had 3 releases as compared to 4 releases in the June quarter of last year. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues decreased 8% to $304 million in the quarter, primarily due to the mix of titles released in the quarter. The TV license fees declined 24% to $315 million. The decrease in TV license fees in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in network TV and foreign syndication marketplaces. Ancillary revenues increased 44% to $104 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher digital revenues. 
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $46 million in the quarter as compared to income of $49 million last year. Moving below operating income, total company equity income from investments was $10 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."
25403751,208515024,339859,"Viacom, Inc., Q3 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2012",2012-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Viacom Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jimmy. I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders.

I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year.
In terms of our free cash flow for the quarter, we generated $197 million in operating free cash flow in the June quarter compared to $369 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to lower operating income and higher cash tax payments, partially offset by lower working cap utilization. The increase in cash taxes paid was due to the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to film and TV production. 
As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter-end of 5%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago. So we continue to make great progress on lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter-end.
During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rates in the public markets to maintain our leverage and our target level. We issued $300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in 2022, and an additional $100 million of 1.25% senior notes due in 2015. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.2 billion of debt and cap leases outstanding and $774 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 11x.
In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $833 million of capital back to our shareholders in June -- in the June quarter. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately 700 million of our stock in the September quarter. So for our fiscal year, we will have returned a total of approximately $3.4 billion to our shareholders, which is a return on market cap of 14%.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. As for our affiliate revenue, we are confident in our ability to grow these revenues in light of our recent renewal with DIRECTV. In the September quarter, we expect that domestic affiliate revenue will grow double digits, taking into consideration both the impact from the DIRECTV rate increase and the blackout period. Additionally, domestic advertising in the September quarter will be impacted by the blackout. This will reduce the domestic advertising growth rate by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. 
At Media Networks, we expect that programming expense will increase approximately 6% for the full year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to evolve our business model to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to enhance our margins.
In the September quarter, Filmed Entertainment revenues will face difficult comparisons to last year's theatrical and home video performance of Transformers 3, as well as the theatrical performance of Captain America. However, the studio should generate profits comparable to the September quarter of last year, as it benefits from the carryover performance of prior quarter theatrical releases and the availability of film titles in the TV marketplace, as well as lower overhead costs. 
For 2012, we continue to forecast a book tax rate of 34.5%. As for our stock buyback program, we are on track to repurchase 2.8 billion for fiscal 2012.
Looking ahead at the studio's slate and the development pipeline, in October, they'll release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. In November, the studio will release Flight, directed by Academy Award winner Robert Zemeckis and starring Academy Award winner Denzel Washington. In November, Paramount will be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. For the Holidays, Paramount will release Jack Reacher, which stars Tom Cruise and is based on the bestselling book series.
As we look into 2013, the studio will be releasing sequels to existing franchises, including G.I. Joe: Retaliation in March; and the next installment of Star Trek, directed by J.J. Abrams, in May, both of which will be in 3D. In June, they'll release World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt. Looking at Paramount's developments, they have started production on Noah, which is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Russell Crowe; and soon, they will begin production on the new installment to the Jack Ryan series, with Chris Pine in the lead role. Paramount is also in development on the Nickelodeon-branded Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, which is being produced by Michael Bay; as well as on a sequel to Anchorman, which will reunite the original cast.
In summary, we remain focused on growing our businesses organically and using our free cash flow and the incremental capacity generated from our balance sheet to return capital to our shareholders. While we have experienced rating softness, we remain committed to investing in our brands and increasing the level of original programming on our networks in order to strengthen their competitive position. We continue to be encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands and franchises on both traditional and digital platforms. The ability to secure long-term growth in our affiliation agreement and the opportunity to grow our international profitability and to develop global franchises with consumer products appeal will enhance our long-term growth. We believe our focus on organic investment, combined with disciplined management of our core structure and an aggressive capital return program, will drive value for our shareholders over the long term.

As far as affiliate revenues, the way we have conducted our renewables over the last several years, we never have more than 20% of our revenues that are up for renewal in any given year. In a year where we have a huge distributor like DIRECTV, that's kind of the high watermark, where it's close to 20%. We just went through that. It'll be a lower percentage of our revenue in the next couple of years, which was your question. So we have a nice portfolio of affiliate revenue. That's why we're able to so confidently predict the affiliate revenue growth as we go forward. We don't have a situation where we have overwhelming amount of our revenue up in a given year. As far as international advertising trends in the quarter, we expect to see some improvement in our performance in this quarter compared to the quarter we just completed. There were a lot of events that we had in prior year that didn't replicate. And in any kind of these events, very often that we look to do events that are profitable. So it's not all a revenue story. We look to have profitable events. So even though the ad revenue, they go down because of the absence of an event, it doesn't impact the profitability to that same degree because there are costs associated, obviously, with that. And that's why we've been able to grow the margins and the profitability, in addition to the other steps we're taking in the international. As far as the current scatter market, it's pretty healthy, which is, as Tom said, as our rates improve, we can take advantage of it. Scatter pricing scatter-over-scatter right now is up year-on-year, and it's significantly up over upfront. So as Tom said, we'll be able to take advantage as our ratings improve."

The affiliate revenue growth story internationally is also a really good story. So we talk a lot about domestic affiliate revenues, but the international affiliate revenue growth story is a good one.

And we thank our employees who continue to support the recovery through the company in their own personal efforts.
Let's move into the discussion of our September quarter and Viacom's 2012 fiscal year. It was a year in which the company achieved success in several key areas of strategic focus even amidst challenges. Our diverse brands continue to engage in entertained audiences on every platform throughout the world.
We're investing consistently in content to ensure that those brands remain vibrant, strong and well positioned to attract greater viewership as audiences evolve and measurement improves.
Those investments, along with key organizational changes, are yielding progress in Nickelodeon and our other networks. We're aggressively pursuing every sensible opportunity to monetize our Media Networks both through advertising and distribution. For the fiscal year, we generated double-digit growth in affiliate revenue as we captured substantial value for our content with existing and emerging distributors alike.
We see fees from traditional and emerging distribution platforms as an important and consistent area of growth well into the future. We're also creating ever greater opportunities for our content internationally, and we're fortifying the position of our core brands in Nickelodeon and MTV, expanding with Comedy and the Paramount Channels and building our consumer products business. This is another big opportunity for future growth where Viacom is extremely well positioned.
In Filmed Entertainment, Paramount Pictures enters fiscal 2013 with a remarkable slate, which will see the return of key franchises such as Star Trek and the launch of new ones, including World War Z.
Even as we increase investment for content on every screen and add programming talent to our organization, we've enhanced operational efficiency, kept a tight rein on costs, maintained a strong balance sheet and continue to generate access free cash flow.
Viacom was able to drive the bottom line growth and significant increases in earnings per share for both the quarter and full year, and we continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the quarter and the full year and provide highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more details, and then we'll gladly take your questions.
Let's begin with the results. Viacom's revenues in the fourth quarter declined 17% to $3.36 billion, with revenues in our Media Networks segment flat and revenues in our Filmed Entertainment segment down 39% due to different mix and lower number of releases compared to the prior year's comparable quarter.
Our fiscal 2012 revenues declined 7% as a result of the decline in advertising sales in Media Networks and theatrical and home entertainment revenues in Filmed Entertainment. Media Networks revenues rose 1% for the full year, driven by an 11% increase in affiliate revenues.
In the September quarter, Viacom's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 14% to $1.21. For fiscal 2012, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.21 per diluted share, an 11% gain over the prior-year period.
Our operating free cash flow was nearly $2.4 billion for the fiscal year. Fueled by our cash generation, we repurchased $700 million in stock in the September quarter under our $10 billion share repurchase program. The company repurchased a total of $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year. In fiscal 2012, Viacom also increased its quarterly dividend 10% to $0.275 per share. As we began fiscal 2013, we are on track to buy back at least $2.5 billion of stock this year.
In the current quarter, we plan to purchase $700 million of our stock. We have consistently in ranked among the top of our peers in returning capital to shareholders.
Let's look now at how our divisions performed in the quarter and the full year. At our Media Networks, we continue to be completely focused, completely focused on creating great content for every screen. We continue to increase our investment in programming to roll out more originals, including more new episodes of hit shows and more new franchises.
In fact, a number of our core networks, including MTV, Nickelodeon, COMEDY CENTRAL, SPIKE and TV Land, are showing sequential improvement in the current quarter over our fiscal fourth quarter.
As any network portfolio, it is inevitable that some networks will be on the rise, while others will be in reinvention. To be sure, the entire broadcast and cable industry is at an inflection point. Prime shifted viewing is growing more prevalent, and our networks are stretching the window for fan engagement with our shows as a result.
In the fourth quarter, rates for MTV's 10 spot, for example, increased 34% when including DVR playback through desk. COMEDY CENTRAL's fast .0 nearly doubled its audience when including DVR playback through desk. Content consumption across platforms is also growing rapidly and exceeding our ability to measure it by a greater margin than ever.
We know that our audiences are viewing more video and more places than ever, but the lack of comprehensive measurement remains a significant roadblock to monetization. However, we are confident that we have the right strategic mix to grow ratings in the short term by investing in original content and enhancing and empowering our creative teams, applying our deep audience insights, maximizing scheduling opportunities across screens and leveraging our unrivaled strength and social media.
This will in turn allow us to restore more robust ad revenues as the year progresses to enhance our otherwise strong financial performance.
As we are investing in the future and making the strategic decisions, particularly in the areas of programming development, marketing and distribution that will position us as a leader in a truly conversion multiplatform, where expanded viewership is accurately accounted for on all screens.
We are not waiting for business to change, we are changing how we do business.
Earlier this week, for example, MTV announced a new addition to its creative leadership team, adding a proven hit maker as its President of Programming. This also the heels of Nickelodeon's moves to create centralized West Coast leadership for all of its content teams and recruit new talent, particularly in animation, as it rolls out an ambitious development slate and expands across platforms.
COMEDY CENTRAL is increasing original programming by 55% in the current fiscal year as it installs digital as a function in every group across the network and even more holistic approach to content development across platforms.
Our advertising revenues were down 6% domestically and 7% worldwide for the quarter. We were able to achieve modest sequential improvement in our domestic advertising revenue performance despite the 10-day blockout of our channels on DIRECTV, which effectively canceled out the benefit of the BET Awards moving into the fourth quarter.
For the full fiscal year, ad revenues declined 4% domestically and 5% worldwide. In the current quarter, we are seeing pricing up in the mid-teens over the upfront and scatter-versus-scatter pricing up in the mid-single digits year-over-year.
Advertiser demand for our content is there, and we are in a position to quickly monetize ratings improvement as it takes hold. In distribution, affiliate revenues increased 12% domestically and 11% worldwide in the fourth quarter. In the full year, affiliate revenues increased to 10% domestically and 11% worldwide.
During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed several distribution agreements in which we secured significant rate increases. As previously noted, we struck a long-term agreement with DIRECTV securing a healthy rate of increase. And we also entered into a deal to provide EPIX films for the Amazon Prime subscriptions streaming service. 
In the current quarter, we renewed and expanded our agreement with Hulu, adding tres at a limited offering from Nickelodeon to the Hulu plus subscription service.
We also made our content available for dialing tone through the video service. Additionally, we increased distribution with existing affiliates, which launched TV line and MTV 2 in HD in the fourth quarter. In the current quarter, we significantly expanded our TV Everywhere partnerships with this distributors by rolling out our video-on-demand websites for ATT, U-Verse, Time Warner Cable and DIRECTV subscribers.
Despite some rating softness, MTV continues to connect with its core 12- to 34-year-old demo, an audience with whom it scores 4 of the top 15 cable series more than any other network, including Teen Mom, Awkward, Snooki & JWOWW and Teen Wolf. The network remained #1 in the demo among ad-supported cable networks in its critical programming spot. The current quarter, MTV has a solid mix of returning hits and new original sin extent that lineup, anchored by Jersey Shore and Teen Mom 2. It's final season to date, Jersey Shore has been the #1 cable telecast on Thursdays in its demo. Leading into the series finale on December 20, MTV will air a week of countdown programming celebrating the event.
Teen Mom 2 returned on Monday this week, a new night from which the hit series will jumpstart the network's line up each week and drew 3.4 million total viewers, up from the final season of Teen Mom and outpacing the Teen Mom 2 season finale. MTV will air seasons 3 and 4 of Teen Mom 2 back to back for the first time, new episodes of the series through April of 2013. 
Teen Mom 2 will serve as a platform to launch several new series debuting through next quarter, including Catfish, a reality look at identity and truth in the social media age, which premiered Monday to an average audience of 2.7 million total viewers and ranked as the highest-rated 11:00 p.m. show premier in MTV history.
We've spoken at length about our efforts to reinvigorate Nickelodeon, and I'm pleased to report that those efforts are yielding results. The viewership, stabilizing and the continued infusion of new original programming coming to air. By addressing ratings issues, half-hour by half-hour, Nick has made improvements across the schedule and is now flat to up in several day parts, including preschool.
The network has reclaimed its leadership of Saturday mornings among kids 2 to 11, thanks to new episodes of the SpongeBob SquarePants and the long-awaited debut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which racked as the highest-rated animated launch on the networks since 2009.
The first straight weeks, SpongeBob have stopped all of television and Ninja Turtles is one of double-digit with a critical 2 to 11 audience. The Ninja Turtles consumer product line has also been selling very well with our partner roommates managing out-of-stock situations for action figures and setting out additional items rapidly.  We expect brisk sales to continue.
From SpongeBob to Avatar, our history has shown that top animated programs typically continue to build audiences over time. While the strength of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles out of the gate, in addition to the success of this consumer products line and the anticipation for the forthcoming live-action feature from Paramount, give us the encouragement that Nickelodeon is a lasting and lucrative hit on its hands.
Additionally, new seasons of returning programs, including iCarly, Victorious and Big Time Rush, had strong premieres in the fourth quarter and continued to perform well in the current quarter. iCarly 1-hour series finale as things giving weekend, and is among a greater number of the event programs throughout the current quarter, including Christmas specials from SpongeBob and Fairly-Odd Parents.
Event programming is that consistent and critical ratings driver for Nickelodeon, and you'll see more and more of it from the network.
On COMEDY CENTRAL, new episodes of Tosh.0 and Workaholics performed well with the network's young male audience in the fourth quarter. COMEDY CENTRAL's newest hit, Key & Peele, solidified its place in the cultural zeitgeist. And in late-night, prove to be strong as they held leadership in late night across all of television with men 18 to 34.
As I mentioned earlier, COMEDy's increasing its original programming significantly, including a loss of 6 new series in the first half of the 2013 calendar year. 
VH1 continues its ratings rise as the network increased its viewership in primetime by 19% among adults 18 to 49 in the fourth quarter. Monday nights on VH1 remain particularly strong with women of yours. During the summer, VH1 was the number one network with women 18 to 49 for its 13 consecutive weeks, thanks to hits Living Hip hop Atlanta and Single Ladies. The network is building on its momentum, with the introduction of a new Friday night comedy block in January, which will feature the Jenna McCarthy show and the return of Best Week Ever.
This series Mob Wives and Lala's Full Court Life return with new seasons in January as well.
So success in the fourth quarter with the Gospel original series, Sunday's Best, which has best season to date and 106 & Park which the network has given a refresh look and new house. In the current quarter, the BET Hip Hop Awards drew 3.1 million viewers, and BET's new reality series, Kesia and Danielle, Family First, successfully premiered with 2.9 million viewers.
In the current quarter, BET will air the 2012 Soul Train Awards later this month, and next quarter, we'll see the return of the networks hit originals, THE GAME and Let's Stay Together.
TV Land had a solid quarter with total day ratings up 5% year-over-year and the networks core 25 to 54 demo. In the current quarter, TV Land will look to build on that momentum with return of Hot In Cleveland and Happily Divorced later this month. As SPIKE prepares for its much-anticipated debut of the mixed martial arts in January, it continues to build out as lineup of originals.
Written a serious Auction Hunters and by rescues shut momentum with buy rescue achieving double-digit ratings gains over its first season. In the current quarter, Tattoo Nightmares was spiked highest-rated series premium among viewers 18 to 49 in nearly 2 years. CMT made progress in the fourth quarter by updating its afternoon and primetime lineup with new acquisitions, including Reba.
In the current quarter, the season 2 premiere of Redneck Island last Saturday attracted more than 1.4 million viewers and stands as the highest-rated season premiere in CMT history.
Moving now to international. Our international Media Networks improved both its operating income and margins in the fourth quarter despite the volatile economic environment abroad, particularly in Europe.
We continue to drive a strong growth in affiliate sales for organic growth, new channel launches and to a lesser extent in prior quarters, digital distribution.
Our continued strength in affiliate sales internationally, combined with significant cost management, have enabled Viacom International Media Networks to mitigate softness in advertising and ancillary sales due to the economic factors mentioned earlier.
In fiscal 2012, we made great progress in driving the reach and success of our adults focused business abroad, a key priority for international. At COMEDY CENTRAL increased nearly 30% internationally for the full year, and this month, we have launched comedy across several markets in Southeast Asia.
Our large marks a major milestone in our efforts to establish COMEDY as our third truly global brand alongside MTV and Nickelodeon. And the current quarter, fans around the world cast a record-breaking 184 million votes beside the winners of last Sunday's 2012 MTV European Music Awards, and early results indicate that the broadcast was estimated TV reach in Europe by 15% over last year's strong ratings.
We are on track to achieve our goal of 20% plus margins in our International Networks in fiscal 2013.
Finally, let's take a look at our from Filmed Entertainment segment. The fourth quarter closed a fiscal year in which Paramount Pictures took recent and decisive action to manage its release schedule and give its films maximum global visibility in theaters, even as it aggressively manage cost behind the screen.  Other which resulted in higher profitability. The studio continues to demonstrate significant long-term progress in enhancing its margins.
In our fiscal 2013, Paramount has diverse and promising slate as we've seen from any studio in recent years, including star driven calls, prestige films and the type of highly targeted margin really that pioneered with the Paranormal Activity franchise.
With the Paranormal Activity, a return to theaters in the current quarter with its fourth installment, which has grossed more than $50 million today at the box office and set the stage for a fifth Paranormal next Halloween. Paramount also released Flight, which earned rave reviews for the performance of two-time Oscar winner, Denzel Washington, and has had 2 strong weekends with the box office for cumulative gross of more than $50 million.
The studio has an additional 5 film theaters at the end of the quarter, including a Tom Cruise action vehicle, Jack Reacher, Guilt Trip, starring Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand, David Chase is not Right Away and DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians.
To wrap up, Viacom delivered significant value for shareholders in fiscal 2012. Our consistent investment in content will continue as we enter a new year, and our audiences will see it on every screen.

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our September quarter. Our 10-K will be filed shortly.This morning, I'm going to take you through",636,"Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our September quarter. Our 10-K will be filed shortly.
This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's September quarter excludes $17 million of discrete tax benefit.
Last year's the September quarter, adjusted results excluded restructuring charges of $130 million on a pretax basis and $90 million after tax, as well as $52 million of discrete tax benefits.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues of $2.3 billion in the quarter were in line with the prior year. Domestic revenues increased 1%, and international revenues were down 6%. Foreign exchange had a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.
Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues were down 6% in the quarter. International advertising declined 14%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 5 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter, as well as softness in Europe.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 12%, while international revenues were up 3%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 5 percentage points. Excluding the impact of the digital distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single-digits in the quarter.  International affiliate growth reflects revenues from new channel launches, as well as rate in subscriber increases.
Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 4% in the quarter, primarily due to lower consumer product licensing and Home Entertainment revenues. Expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Within expenses, programming expense grew 9%, while SG&A expense declined 7%.
The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense and savings realized from our 2011 restructuring.
Media Networks adjusted operating income of $933 million in the quarter was down 3% as compared to the September quarter of last year. The operating margin of 41% decreased approximately 100 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 39% to $1.1 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.
Worldwide threats call revenues decreased 83% to $131 million in the quarter. As anticipated, the studio faced difficult comparisons to the September quarter of last year benefited from carryover revenues from Transformers: Dark of the Moon, as well as the release in the quarter of Captain America: The First Avenger. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues decreased 32% to $345 million in the quarter, primarily due to the mix of titles released in the quarter, including a difficult comparison to last year's release of Transformers 3.
TV license fees increased 19% to $464 million. The increase in TV license fees in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in the pay TV and foreign syndication marketplaces. Ancillary revenues increased 21% to $147 million in the quarter due to higher digital revenues.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $195 million in the quarter as compared to income of $185 million last year. 
Now moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $13 million in the quarter. Losses in the quarter principally relate our investment in EPIX.
On a full year basis, EPIX was profitable. Reported tax rate in the quarter was 31%. The reported rate was favorably impacted by $17 million of discrete tax benefits. For fiscal year 2012, the adjusted effective tax rate was 34.0%.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

Today, I'd like to touch on our full year results, as well as talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year.Now turn",1180,"Thank you, Jimmy. Today, I'd like to touch on our full year results, as well as talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year.
Now turning to the full year results. Media Networks generated revenue of $9.2 billion and adjusted operating income of $3.9 billion. Affiliate revenues grew 11% for the year, and advertising revenue declined 5%.
Media Networks margins of 42% increased 20 basis points over the prior year. The international part of our Media Networks business generated approximately $270 million of profitability for the year and achieved high teens operating margins.
Filmed Entertainment generated revenues of $4.8 billion and adjusted operating income of $325 million. This translates to an operating margin of 7%. As Philippe mentioned, we generated full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.21 and $2.4 billion in operating free cash flow.
Also, we continue to be aggressive and returning capital to our shareholders. For the full year, we repurchased 60 million of our shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 billion. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $3.4 billion of capital back to our shareholders, which is a return on market capitalization of approximately 14%.
If you look back to when we started on our buyback program 2 years ago, we had 609 million shares outstanding. Since then, we have repurchased a total of 121 million of our shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $5.6 billion, which brings our shares outstanding to 502 million as of November 7.
Now moving on to our debt. For the most part, it's fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 5%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago. So we continue to make great progress in lowering our average cost of that.
To the extent, we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter end.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.1 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding, and $848 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x. At September 30, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Last week, we completed an amendment to our revolving credit facility that increased the size from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and extended the maturity 2 years to November of 2017.  This action reflects the strength of our balance sheet and provides us with significant financial flexibility for the next 5 years.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, for fiscal 2013, we continue to see growth in the high-single digit to low double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will fluctuate given that the recognition on some of our digital agreements is tied to product availability. Accordingly, in the December quarter, we expect that the reported affiliate revenue growth will be in the low single digits, which is a combination of lower digital revenues and double-digit than traditional revenues.
For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the high-single digit. Given the timing of shows coming on air, growth will be weighted to the first half of the year. In terms of nonprogramming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve or enhance our margins.
At Filmed Entertainment, in the December quarter, we anticipate a greater loss than in the prior year. This is primarily due to difficult comparisons in the Home Entertainment marketplace. The prior year benefited from carryover revenues from Transformers 3, as well as releases in the quarter, which included Super 8 and Captain America.
However, the studio should see healthy growth in profits in the back half of the fiscal year as they benefit from the availabilities of titles in TV and Home Entertainment marketplaces. For 2013, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix.
We expect cash taxes to be similar to book taxes for the year. As for our stock buyback program, as Philippe mentioned, we plan to purchase approximately 700 million of our stock in the December quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least 2.5 billion for fiscal 2013.
Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline, on November 21, Paramount will be disturbing DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians for the holidays. The studio will release the comedy, Guilt Trip on December 19 starring Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen and which is produced by a Lauren Miches. And on December 21, they will release Jack Reacher, which stars Tom Cruise and is based on the best-selling book series. In addition, Paramount Vantage will be releasing the film Not Fade Away from David Chase, the creator of the Sopranos.
As we look into 2013, we have a number of 3D releases. In January, the studio will release Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, which stars Jeremy Renner. And in March, they will release G.I. Joe: Retaliation. The next installment of Star Trek, which is directed by J.J. Abrams, follows in May and June, Paramount will release World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt. 
Now looking at Paramount's development, they are currently in production on Noah, which is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Russell Crowe, as well as a new installment to the Jack Ryan series, with Chris Pine in the lead role.
The studio is also in development on the Michael Bai directed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and on a SpongeBob movie. They are planning a fourth installment of Transformers, as well as a fifth installment of our low-budget Paranormal Activity franchise. If you look at our for Paranormal films, which have released to date, they have cost only $27 million to produce and have generated over $700 million in worldwide box office.
In summary, we continue to focus on organic investment, disciplined management of our construct are and returning capital to our shareholders. At Media Networks, we remain committed to strengthening our brands through increased investment, as well as by growing the level of original programming on our networks across all platforms and devices.
And we look forward to the day when total content consumption is more accurately measured. At Paramount, we have developed several tentpole franchises and are excited about our upcoming slate and pipeline. We continue to seek ways to reduce our capital commitment in the business in order to enhance our margins, as well as our returns.
And we are committed to aggressively return capital to our shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. And so thank you for listening. Now operator, we'll turn the call over to the questions."

So just wondering if maybe Tom and Philippe, if you could remind us of some the reasons why ratings haven't clearly did as directly with advertising trends? Why advertising hasn't been quite been as bad as your ratings declines. And you guys have been more aggressive on TV Everywhere, particularly with current release windows than your peers. And so really, that's probably one of the reasons they don't correlate. And Tom, you mentioned measurement, and you look forward to a day that those digital viewers can be measured more accurately. So any update on measurement in that way for TV Everywhere would also be helpful."

Naturally, over the long term, you have to rebuild your ratings. The way we focus on is working very closely with our major marketing partners. We do get a pickup from the AC3 measurement in many cases. And so it's a question of mix. We have the ability to shift units from DR to paid advertising. So we operate at all times to maximize the available at dollars. The good news for us is that as ad revenue -- as ratings improve, we can pretty quickly monetize those improved ratings because of the under delivery that we have experienced over the period of weakness that is starting to lift. As far as TV Everywhere and measurement, we believe that in the long term, in order for industry to succeed, we have to provide consumers and particularly our young audiences with the content they want on the gadgets and platforms and the places they wanted. And we're going to do it in a way that intelligently manages the windows and work with our marketers to ensure that we monetize a part of it is measurement. And we are working with Nielsen and others to ensure that, that measurement improves over time. So I'm convinced that we're going to see gradual improvement of that, not as fast as we would like, but it will improve. And in the meantime, we are demonstrating to our major marketers the kind of additional viewing we are getting on the content that they are in partnership with us on. As they understand that, that's the relationship we have with them and going back to the beginning of your question, allows us to maximize our advertising revenues even in the face of weak ratings in some of our networks."

We know that many of you on the call today, like many of us here at Viacom, live, work or have loved ones in areas enduring the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy. We hope that you and your families were able to weather the storm and return to the normal rhythm of life that we too often take for granted. For those still trying to rebuild, we are with you. Viacom remains committed to recovery efforts, whether it's our corporate support of the American Red Cross and other relief organizations or the initiatives of our individual brands, including MTV's Restore the Shore textathon tonight. And we thank our employees who continue to support the recovery through the company and their own personal efforts.
Let's move into the discussion of our September quarter and Viacom's 2012 fiscal year. It was a year in which the company achieved success in several key areas of strategic focus even amidst challenges. Our diverse brands continue to engage and entertain audiences on every platform throughout the world. We're investing consistently in content to ensure that those brands remain vibrant, strong and well positioned to attract greater viewership as audiences evolve and measurement improves. Those investments, along with key organizational changes, are yielding progress in Nickelodeon and our other networks. 
We're aggressively pursuing every sensible opportunity to monetize our Media Networks, both through advertising and distribution. For the fiscal year, we generated double-digit growth in affiliate revenue as we captured substantial value for our content with existing and emerging distributors alike. We see fees from traditional and emerging distribution platforms as an important and consistent area of growth well into the future. 
We're also creating ever-greater opportunities for our content internationally, and we're fortifying the position of our core brands in Nickelodeon and MTV, expanding with COMEDY and the Paramount Channel and building our consumer products business. This is another big opportunity for future growth where Viacom is extremely well positioned. In Filmed Entertainment, Paramount Pictures enters fiscal 2013 with a remarkable slate, which will see the return of key tentpole franchises such as Star Trek and the launch of new ones, including World War Z. 
Even as we increase investment for content on every screen and add programming talent to our organization, we've enhanced operational efficiency, kept a tight rein on costs, maintained a strong balance sheet and continued to generate excess free cash flow. Viacom was able to drive bottom line growth and significant increases in earnings per share for both the quarter and full year, and we continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the quarter and the full year and provide highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions. 
Let's begin with the results. Viacom's revenues in the fourth quarter declined 17% to $3.36 billion with revenues in our Media Networks segment flat and revenues in our Filmed Entertainment segment down 39%, due to a different mix and lower number of releases compared to the prior year's comparable quarter. Our fiscal 2012 revenues declined 7% as a result of the decline in advertising sales in Media Networks and theatrical and home entertainment revenues and Filmed Entertainment. Media Networks revenues rose 1% for the full year, driven by an 11% increase in affiliate revenues.
In the September quarter, Viacom's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 14% to $1.21. For fiscal 2012, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.21 per diluted share, an 11% gain over the prior year period. Our operating free cash flow was nearly $2.4 billion for the fiscal year. 
Fueled by our cash generation, we repurchased $700 million in stock in the September quarter under our $10 billion share repurchase program. The company repurchased a total of $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year. In fiscal 2012, Viacom also increased its quarterly dividend 10% to $0.275 per share. As we begin fiscal 2013, we are on track to buy back at least $2.5 billion of stock this year. In the current quarter, we plan to purchase $700 million of our stock. We have consistently ranked among the top of our peers in returning capital to shareholders.
Let's take a look now at our -- at how our divisions performed in the quarter and the full year. At our Media Networks, we continue to be completely focused, completely focused on creating great content for every screen. We continue to increase our investment in programming to roll out more originals, including more new episodes of hit shows and more new franchises. In fact, a number of our core networks, including MTV, Nickelodeon, COMEDY CENTRAL, SPIKE and TV Land, are showing sequential improvement in the current quarter over our fiscal fourth quarter.
As any network portfolio, it is inevitable that some networks will be on the rise while others will be in reinvention. To be sure, the entire broadcast and cable industry is at an inflection point. Time-shifted viewing is growing more prevalent, and our networks are stretching the window for fan engagement with our shows as a result. In the fourth quarter, ratings for MTV's 10 Spot, for example, increased 34% when including DVR playback through 3 days. COMEDY CENTRAL's Tosh.0 nearly doubles its audience when including DVR playback through  3 days. 
Content consumption across platforms is also growing rapidly and exceeding our ability to measure it by a greater margin than ever. We know that our audiences are viewing more video in more places than ever, but the lack of comprehensive measurement remains a significant roadblock to monetization. However, we are confident that we have the right strategic mix to grow ratings in the short term by investing in original content, enhancing and empowering our creative teams, applying our deep audience insights, maximizing scheduling opportunities across screens and leveraging our unrivaled strength and social media. This will, in turn, allow us to restore a more robust ad revenues as the year progresses to enhance our otherwise strong financial performance.
Across our Media Networks, we are investing in the future and making the strategic decisions, particularly in the areas of programming development, marketing and distribution that will position us as a leader in a truly convergent multi-platform world, where expanded viewership is accurately accounted for on all screens. We are not waiting for business to change. We are changing how we do business.
Earlier this week, for example, MTV announced a new addition to its creative leadership team, adding a proven hit maker as its President of Programming. This follows on the heels of Nickelodeon's moves to create centralized west coast leadership for all of its content teams and recruit new talent, particularly in animation, as it rolls out an ambitious development slate and expands across platforms. COMEDY CENTRAL is increasing original programming by 55% in the current fiscal year as it installs digital as a function in every group across the network, an even more holistic approach to content development across platforms.
Our advertising revenues were down 6% domestically and 7% worldwide for the quarter. We were able to achieve modest sequential improvement in our domestic advertising revenue performance despite the 10-day blackout of our channels on DIRECTV, which effectively canceled out the benefit of the BET Awards moving into the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, ad revenues declined 4% domestically and 5% worldwide. In the current quarter, we're seeing pricing up in the mid-teens over the upfront and scatter-versus-scatter pricing up in the mid-single-digits year-over-year. Advertiser demand for our content is there, and we are in a position to quickly monetize ratings improvement as it takes hold. 
In distribution, affiliate revenues increased 12% domestically and 11% worldwide in the fourth quarter. In the full year, affiliate revenues increased to 10% domestically and 11% worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed several distribution agreements in which we secured significant rate increases. 
As previously noted, we struck a long-term agreement with DIRECTV, procuring a healthy rate of increase. We also enter into a deal to provide EPIX films for the Amazon Prime subscription streaming service. In the current quarter, we renewed and expanded our agreement with Hulu, adding Tr3s at a limited offering from Nickelodeon to the Hulu Plus subscription service. We also made our content available for download to own through the Nook Video service. 
Additionally, we increased distribution with existing affiliates, which launched TV Land and MTV 2 in HD in the fourth quarter. In the current quarter, we significantly expanded our TV Everywhere partnerships with distributors by rolling out our video-on-demand websites for ATT U-Verse, Time Warner Cable and DIRECTV subscribers.
Despite some rating softness, MTV continues to connect with its core 12- to 34-year-old demo, an audience with whom it scores 4 of the top 15 cable series more than any other network, including Teen Mom, Awkward, Snooki & JWOWW and Teen Wolf. The network remained #1 in the demo among ad-supported cable networks in its critical 10 Spot programming slots. In the current quarter, MTV has a solid mix of returning hits and new originals in its 10 Spot lineup, anchored by Jersey Shore and Teen Mom 2. It's final season to date, Jersey Shore has been the #1 cable telecast on Thursdays in its demo. Leading into the series finale on December 20, MTV will air a week of countdown programming celebrating the event. 
Teen Mom 2 returned on Monday this week, a new night from which the hit series will jump-start the network's line up each week and drew 3.4 million total viewers, up from the final season of Teen Mom and outpacing the Teen Mom 2 season finale. MTV will air seasons 3 and 4 of Teen Mom 2 back-to-back for the first time, giving fans new episodes of the series through April of 2013. Teen Mom 2 will serve as a platform to launch several new series debuting through next quarter, including Catfish, a reality look at identity and truth in the social media age, which premiered Monday to an average audience of 2.7 million total viewers and ranked as the highest-rated 11 p.m. show premier in MTV history.
We've spoken at length about our efforts to reinvigorate Nickelodeon, and I'm pleased to report that those efforts are yielding results, the viewership stabilizing and a continued infusion of new original programming coming to air. By addressing ratings issues, half hour by half hour, Nick has made improvements across the schedule and is now flat to up in several day parts, including preschool. 
The network has reclaimed its leadership of Saturday mornings among kids 2 to 11, thanks to new episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants and the long-awaited debut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which ranked as the highest-rated animated launch on the network since 2009. For 4 straight weeks, SpongeBob have stopped all of television and Ninja Turtles has won its time period by double digits with the critical 2 to 11 audience. The Ninja Turtles consumer products line has also been selling very well with our partner Playmates managing out-of-stock situations for action figures and selling out additional items rapidly. We expect brisk sales to continue.
From SpongeBob to Avatar, our history have shown that top animated programs typically continue to build audiences over time. So the strength of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles out of the gate, in addition to the success of its consumer products line and the anticipation for the forthcoming live-action feature from Paramount, give us great encouragement that Nickelodeon has a lasting and lucrative hit on its hands.
Additionally, new seasons of returning programs, including iCarly, Victorious and Big Time Rush, had strong premieres in the fourth quarter and continue to perform well in the current quarter. The iCarly one-hour series finale airs Thanksgiving weekend and is among a greater number of event programs throughout the current quarter, including Christmas specials from SpongeBob and Fairly OddParents. Event programming is a consistent and critical ratings driver for Nickelodeon, and you'll see more and more of it from the network.
On COMEDY CENTRAL, new episodes of Tosh.0 and Workaholics performed well with the network's young male audience in the fourth quarter. COMEDY CENTRAL's newest hit, Key & Peele, solidified its place in the cultural zeitgeist. And in late night, Jon and Stephen again proved to be strong as they held leadership in late night across all of television with men 18 to 34. As I mentioned earlier, COMEDY is increasing its original programming significantly, including the launch of 6 new series in the first half of the 2013 calendar year.  
VH1 continue its ratings rise as the network increased its viewership in primetime by 19% among adults 18 to 49 in the fourth quarter. Monday nights on VH1 remained particularly strong with women viewers. During the summer, VH1 was the #1 network with women 18 to 49 for 13 consecutive weeks, thanks to hits Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta and Single Ladies. The network is building on its momentum with the introduction of a new Friday night comedy block in January, which will feature The Jenna McCarthy Show and the return of Best Week Ever. Hit series Mob Wives and La La's Full Court Life return with new seasons in January as well.
BET saw success in the fourth quarter with its gospel original series, SUNDAY BEST, which has its best season to date, and 106 & Park, which the network has given a refresh look and new hosts. In the current quarter, the BET Hip Hop Awards drew 3.1 million viewers, and BET's new reality series, Keyshia & Daniel: Family First, successfully premiered with 2.9 million viewers. In the current quarter, BET will air the 2012 Soul Train Awards later this month. And next quarter, we'll see the return of the network's hit originals, The Game and Let's Stay Together.
TV Land had a solid quarter with total day ratings up 5% year-over-year, the network's core 25 to 54 demo. In the current quarter, TV Land will look to build on that momentum with return of Hot In Cleveland and Happily Divorced later this month. 
As SPIKE prepares for its much-anticipated debut of Bellator mixed martial arts in January, it continues to build out its lineup of originals. Returning series Auction Hunters and Bar Rescue showed momentum with Bar Rescue achieving double-digit ratings gains over its first season. In the current quarter, Tattoo Nightmares was SPIKE's highest-rated series premiere among viewers 18 to 49 in nearly 2 years. 
CMT made progress in the fourth quarter by updating its afternoon and primetime lineup with new acquisitions, including Reba. In the current quarter, the season 2 premiere of Redneck Island last Saturday attracted more than 1.4 million viewers and stands as the highest-rated season premiere in CMT history.
Moving now to international. Our international Media Networks improved both its operating income and margins in the fourth quarter despite the volatile economic environment abroad, particularly in Europe. We continue to drive strong growth in affiliate sales through organic growth, new channel launches and, to a lesser extent than prior quarters, digital distribution. Our continued strength in affiliate sales internationally, combined with significant cost management, have enabled Viacom International Media Networks to mitigate softness in advertising and ancillary sales due to the economic factors mentioned earlier.
In fiscal 2012, we made great progress in driving the reach and success of our adults-focused business abroad, a key priority for international. Ratings at COMEDY CENTRAL increased nearly 30% internationally for the full year, and this month saw the launch of COMEDY across several markets in Southeast Asia. The launch marks a major milestone in our effort to establish COMEDY as our third truly global brand alongside MTV and Nickelodeon. 
In the current quarter, fans around the world cast a record-breaking 184 million votes to decide the winners of last Sunday's 2012 MTV European Music Awards, and early results indicate that the broadcast grew its estimated TV reach in Europe by 15% over last year's strong ratings. We are on track to achieve our goal of 20% plus margins in our international networks in fiscal 2013.
Finally, let's take a look at our Filmed Entertainment segment. The fourth quarter closed a fiscal year in which Paramount Pictures took reasoned and decisive action to manage its release schedule and give its films maximum global visibility in theaters, even as it aggressively manage cost behind the screen, all of which resulted in higher profitability. The studio continues to demonstrate significant long-term progress in enhancing its margins.
In our fiscal 2013, Paramount has as diverse and promising a slate as we've seen from any studio in recent years, including star-driven tentpoles, prestige films and a type of highly targeted, high-margin releases it pioneered with the Paranormal Activity franchise. The Paranormal Activity return to theaters in the current quarter with its fourth installment, which has grossed more than $50 million today at the box office and set the stage for a fifth Paranormal next Halloween. 
Paramount also released Flight, which earned rave reviews for the performance of 2-time Oscar winner, Denzel Washington, and has had 2 strong weekends at the box office for cumulative gross of more than $50 million. The studio has an additional 5 films hitting theaters through the end of the quarter, including: a Tom Cruise action vehicle, Jack Reacher; The Guilt Trip, starring Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand; David Chase's Not Fade Away; and DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians.
To wrap up, Viacom delivered significant value for shareholders in fiscal 2012. Our consistent investment in content will continue as we enter a new year, and our audiences will see it on every screen, on our television channels around the globe, on the web, on tablets and mobile devices and on the big screens in theaters worldwide. 
As we deepen engagement and drive ratings, we'll continue to connect marketers with our audiences and advance distribution through innovative and fruitful partnerships. At the box office, Paramount Pictures will serve moviegoing audiences with a deep and diverse slate that would drive theatrical revenue through the year. 
Our entire organization will continue to strive for creative excellence, operational excellence and effective cost management. And as a result, we will deliver on our commitment to continue to maximize free cash flow and return capital to shareholders.
Thank you again for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our September quarter. Our 10-K will be filed shortly.This morning, I'm going to take you through",636,"Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our September quarter. Our 10-K will be filed shortly.
This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's September quarter excludes $17 million of discrete tax benefit. Last year's September quarter, adjusted results excluded restructuring charges of $130 million on a pretax basis and $90 million after tax, as well as $52 million of discrete tax benefits.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues of $2.3 billion in the quarter were in line with the prior year. Domestic revenues increased 1%, and international revenues were down 6%. Foreign exchange had a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.
Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues were down 6% in the quarter. International advertising declined 14%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 5 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter, as well as softness in Europe.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 12% while international revenues were up 3%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 5 percentage points. Excluding the impact of the digital distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter.  International affiliate growth reflects revenues from new channel launches, as well as rate in subscriber increases.  
Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 4% in the quarter, primarily due to lower consumer product licensing and home entertainment revenues. 
Expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Within expenses, the programming expense grew 9% while SG&A expense declined 7%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense and savings realized from our 2011 restructuring.
Media Networks adjusted operating income of $933 million in the quarter was down 3% as compared to the September quarter of last year. The operating margin of 41% decreased approximately 100 basis points compared to the prior year.  
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 39% to $1.1 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 83% to $131 million in the quarter. As anticipated, the studio faced difficult comparison to the September quarter of last year benefited from carryover revenues from Transformers: Dark of the Moon, as well as the release in the quarter of Captain America: The First Avenger. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 32% to $345 million in the quarter, primarily due to the mix of titles released in the quarter, including a difficult comparison to last year's release of Transformers 3. TV license fees increased 19% to $464 million. The increase in TV license fees in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in the pay TV and foreign syndication marketplaces. Ancillary revenues increased 21% to $147 million in the quarter due to higher digital revenues.
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $195 million in the quarter as compared to income of $185 million last year. 
Now moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $13 million in the quarter. Losses in the quarter principally relate our investment in EPIX. On a full year basis, EPIX was profitable. 
Reported tax rate in the quarter was 31%. The reported rate was favorably impacted by $17 million of discrete tax benefits. For fiscal year 2012, the adjusted effective tax rate was 34.0%.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

Today, I'm going to touch on our full year results, as well as talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year.Now tur",1179,"Thank you, Jimmy. Today, I'm going to touch on our full year results, as well as talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year.
Now turning to the full year results. Media Networks generated revenue of $9.2 billion and adjusted operating income of $3.9 billion. Affiliate revenues grew 11% for the year, and advertising revenue declined 5%. Media Networks' margins of 42% increased 20 basis points over the prior year. The international part of our Media Networks business generated approximately $270 million of profitability for the year and achieved high-teens operating margins. Filmed Entertainment generated revenues of $4.8 billion and adjusted operating income of $325 million. This translates to an operating margin of 7%. As Philippe mentioned, we generated full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.21 and $2.4 billion in operating free cash flow.
Also, we continue to be aggressive in returning capital to our shareholders. For the full year, we repurchased 60 million of our shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 billion. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $3.4 billion of capital back to our shareholders, which is a return-on-market capitalization of approximately 14%. If you look back to when we started our buyback program 2 years ago, we had 609 million shares outstanding. Since then, we have repurchased a total of 121 million of our shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $5.6 billion, which brings our shares outstanding to 502 million as of November 7.
Now moving on to our debt. For the most part, it's fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 5%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago. So we continue to make great progress in lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent, we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter end.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.1 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $848 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x. At September 30, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Last week, we completed an amendment to our revolving credit facility that increased the size from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and extended the maturity 2 years to November of 2017.  This action reflects the strength of our balance sheet and provides us with significant financial flexibility for the next 5 years.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, for fiscal 2013, we continue to see growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will fluctuate, given that the recognition on some of our digital agreements is tied to product availability. Accordingly, in the December quarter, we expect that the reported affiliate revenue growth will be in the low single digits, which is a combination of lower digital revenues and double-digit growth in traditional revenues.
For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the high single digits. Given the timing of shows coming on air, growth will be weighted to the first half of the year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve or enhance our margins.
At Filmed Entertainment, in the December quarter, we anticipate a greater loss than in the prior year. This is primarily due to difficult comparisons in the home entertainment marketplace. The prior year benefited from carryover revenues from Transformers 3, as well as releases in the quarter, which included Super 8 and Captain America. However, the studio should see healthy growth in profits in the back half of the fiscal year as they benefit from the availabilities of titles in TV and home entertainment marketplaces. 
For 2013, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. We expect cash taxes to be similar to book taxes for the year. 
As for our stock buyback program, as Philippe mentioned, we plan to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the December quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for fiscal 2013.
Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline, on November 21, Paramount will be disturbing DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. For the holidays, the studio will release the comedy, Guilt Trip on December 19, starring Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen and which is produced by Lorne Michaels. And on December 21, they will release Jack Reacher, which stars Tom Cruise and is based on the best-selling book series. In addition, Paramount Vantage will be releasing the film Not Fade Away from David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos.
As we look into 2013, we have a number of 3D releases. In January, the studio will release Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, which stars Jeremy Renner, and in March, they will release G.I. Joe: Retaliation. The next installment of Star Trek, which is directed by J.J. Abrams, follows in May, and in June, Paramount will release World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt.  
Now looking at Paramount's development, they are currently in production on Noah, which is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Russell Crowe, as well as a new installment to the Jack Ryan series, with Chris Pine in the lead role. The studio is also in development on the Michael Bay-directed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and on a SpongeBob movie. They are planning a fourth installment of Transformers, as well as a fifth installment of our low-budget Paranormal Activity franchise. If you look at our 4 Paranormal films, which have released to date, they have cost only $27 million to produce and have generated over $700 million in worldwide box office.
In summary, we continue to focus on organic investment, disciplined management of our cost structure and returning capital to our shareholders. At Media Networks, we remain committed to strengthening our brands through increased investment, as well as by growing the level of original programming on our networks across all platforms and devices. And we look forward to the day when total content consumption is more accurately measured. At Paramount, we have developed several tentpole franchises and are excited about our upcoming slate and pipeline. We continue to seek ways to reduce our capital commitment in the business in order to enhance our margins, as well as our returns. And we are committed to aggressively returning capital to our shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.

So just wondering if -- maybe Tom and Philippe, if you could remind us of some of the reasons why ratings haven't correlated as directly with advertising trends, why advertising hasn't quite been as bad as linear ratings declines. And you guys have been more aggressive on TV Everywhere, particularly with current release windows than your peers. And so, clearly, that's probably one of the reasons they don't correlate. And, Tom, you mentioned the measurement, and you look forward to a day that those digital viewers can be measured more accurately.

Naturally, over the long term, you have to rebuild your ratings. Where we focus on is working very closely with our major marketing partners.

So we operate at all times to maximize the available at dollars. The good news for us is that as ad  -- as ratings improve, we can pretty quickly monetize those improved ratings because of the under-delivery that we have experienced over the period of weakness that is starting to lift. As far as TV Everywhere and measurement, we believe that in the long term, in order for our whole industry to succeed, we have to provide consumers, and particularly our young audiences, with the content they want on the gadgets and platforms and the places they wanted. And we're going to do it in a way that intelligently manages the windows and work with our marketers to ensure that we monetize the viewing, a part of it is measurement. And we are working with Nielsen and others to ensure that, that measurement improves over time. So I'm convinced that we're going to see gradual improvement of that, not as fast as we would like, but it will improve. And in the meantime, we are demonstrating to our major marketers the kind of additional viewing we are getting on the content that they are in partnership with us on.

When is that going to take place? That's over the next 12 to 24 months that those technologies really begin to hit the marketplace very quickly, and that changes a lot of the dynamics in the advertising marketplace and the content measurement marketplace. So we're really excited about that, because we know our content is being consumed aggressively by the younger audiences that we deliver across many devices where measurement isn't completely captured."

I don't expect that this quarter will see us get into positive territory, but we'll see improvement. And we are going to strive very hard to get back into positive territory as the year progresses and continue to improve from there. And as I mentioned earlier, there's -- there is going to be a correlation to the continued trend in ratings improvement. As far as Susanne Daniels, we're fairly excited. We've had our eye on her for a long time, and we're very pleased that she has committed to coming with us and devoting her total energy to exciting program we have in place. And she will bring with her, and you'll see announcements in the near future, some additional talent who will bring to bear more development in both the reality and scripted areas. So we've got a good pipeline now, and this will only triple charge it. And likewise, we have continued to add talent across many other networks. I talked about Nickelodeon, talked about how we changed the structure of the organization, but we've also infused the Nickelodeon organization with new outside talent. We have from Disney. We recently have made a significant hire from Disney and from other places. So we are centrally focused at our company on bringing in great programming talent, developing more series and different genres across all of our networks. Because if we do that, that drives everything else."

Viacom remains committed to recovery efforts, whether it's our corporate support of the American Red Cross and other relief organizations or the initiatives of our individual brands, including MTV's Restore the Shore textathon tonight. And we thank our employees who continue to support the recovery through the company and their own personal efforts.
Let's move into the discussion of our September quarter and Viacom's 2012 fiscal year. It was a year in which the company achieved success in several key areas of strategic focus even amidst challenges. Our diverse brands continue to engage and entertain audiences on every platform throughout the world. We're investing consistently in content to ensure that those brands remain vibrant, strong and well positioned to attract greater viewership as audiences evolve and measurement improves. Those investments, along with key organizational changes, are yielding progress at Nickelodeon and our other networks. 
We're aggressively pursuing every sensible opportunity to monetize our Media Networks, both through advertising and distribution. For the fiscal year, we generated double-digit growth in affiliate revenue as we captured substantial value for our content with existing and emerging distributors alike. We see fees from traditional and emerging distribution platforms as an important and consistent area of growth well into the future. 
We're also creating ever-greater opportunities for our content internationally, where we're fortifying the position of our core brands in Nickelodeon and MTV, expanding with COMEDY and the Paramount Channel and building our consumer products business. This is another big opportunity for future growth where Viacom is extremely well positioned. In Filmed Entertainment, Paramount Pictures enters fiscal 2013 with a remarkable slate, which will see the return of key tentpole franchises such as Star Trek and the launch of new ones, including World War Z. 
Even as we increase investment for content on every screen and add programming talent to our organization, we've enhanced operational efficiency, kept a tight rein on costs, maintained a strong balance sheet and continued to generate excess free cash flow. Viacom was able to drive bottom line growth and significant increases in earnings per share for both the quarter and full year, and we continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the quarter and the full year and provide highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions. 
Let's begin with the results. Viacom's revenues in the fourth quarter declined 17% to $3.36 billion with revenues in our Media Networks segment flat and revenues in our Filmed Entertainment segment down 39%, due to a different mix and lower number of releases compared to the prior year's comparable quarter. Our fiscal 2012 revenues declined 7% as a result of the decline in advertising sales in Media Networks and theatrical and home entertainment revenues and Filmed Entertainment. Media Networks revenues rose 1% for the full year, driven by an 11% increase in affiliate revenues.
In the September quarter, Viacom's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 14% to $1.21. For fiscal 2012, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.21 per diluted share, an 11% gain over the prior year period. Our operating free cash flow was nearly $2.4 billion for the fiscal year. 
Fueled by our cash generation, we repurchased $700 million in stock in the September quarter under our $10 billion share repurchase program. The company repurchased a total of $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year. In fiscal 2012, Viacom also increased its quarterly dividend 10% to $0.275 per share. As we begin fiscal 2013, we are on track to buy back at least $2.5 billion of stock this year. In the current quarter, we plan to purchase $700 million of our stock. We have consistently ranked among the top of our peers in returning capital to shareholders.
Let's take a look now at our -- at how our divisions performed in the quarter and the full year. At our Media Networks, we continue to be completely focused, completely focused on creating great content for every screen. We continue to increase our investment in programming to roll out more originals, including more new episodes of hit shows and more new franchises. In fact, a number of our core networks, including MTV, Nickelodeon, COMEDY CENTRAL, SPIKE and TV Land, are showing sequential improvement in the current quarter over our fiscal fourth quarter.
With any network portfolio, it is inevitable that some networks will be on the rise while others will be in reinvention. To be sure, the entire broadcast and cable industry is at an inflection point. Time-shifted viewing is growing more prevalent, and our networks are stretching the window for fan engagement with our shows as a result. In the fourth quarter, ratings for MTV's 10 Spot, for example, increased 34% when including DVR playback through 3 days. COMEDY CENTRAL's Tosh.0 nearly doubles its audience when including DVR playback through 3 days. 
Content consumption across platforms is also growing rapidly and exceeding our ability to measure it by a greater margin than ever. We know that our audiences are viewing more video in more places than ever, but lack of comprehensive measurement remains a significant roadblock to monetization. However, we are confident that we have the right strategic mix to grow ratings in the short term by investing in original content, enhancing and empowering our creative teams, applying our deep audience insights, maximizing scheduling opportunities across screens and leveraging our unrivaled strength in social media. This will, in turn, allow us to restore more robust ad revenues as the year progresses to enhance our otherwise strong financial performance.
Across our Media Networks, we are investing in the future and making the strategic decisions, particularly in the areas of programming development, marketing and distribution that will position us as a leader in a truly convergent multi-platform world, where expanded viewership is accurately accounted for on all screens. We are not waiting for business to change. We are changing how we do business.
Earlier this week, for example, MTV announced a new addition to its creative leadership team, adding a proven hit maker as its President of Programming. This follows on the heels of Nickelodeon's moves to create centralized west coast leadership for all of its content teams and recruit new talent, particularly in animation, as it rolls out an ambitious development slate and expands across platforms. COMEDY CENTRAL is increasing original programming by 55% in the current fiscal year as it installs digital as a function in every group across the network, for an even more holistic approach to content development across platforms.
Our advertising revenues were down 6% domestically and 7% worldwide for the quarter. We were able to achieve modest sequential improvement in our domestic advertising revenue performance despite the 10-day blackout of our channels on DIRECTV, which effectively canceled out the benefit of the BET Awards moving into the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, ad revenues declined 4% domestically and 5% worldwide. In the current quarter, we're seeing pricing up in the mid-teens over the upfront and scatter-versus-scatter pricing up in the mid-single-digits year-over-year. Advertiser demand for our content is there, and we are in a position to quickly monetize ratings improvement as it takes hold. 
In distribution, affiliate revenues increased 12% domestically and 11% worldwide in the fourth quarter. For the full year, affiliate revenues increased to 10% domestically and 11% worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed several distribution agreements in which we secured significant rate increases. 
As previously noted, we struck a long-term agreement with DIRECTV, securing a healthy rate of increase. We also entered into a deal to provide EPIX films for the Amazon Prime subscription streaming service. In the current quarter, we renewed and expanded our agreement with Hulu, adding Tr3s at a limited offering from Nickelodeon to the Hulu Plus subscription service. We also made our content available for download to own through the Nook Video service. 
Additionally, we increased distribution with existing affiliates, which launched TV Land and MTV 2 in HD in the fourth quarter. In the current quarter, we significantly expanded our TV Everywhere partnerships with distributors by rolling out our video-on-demand websites for ATT U-Verse, Time Warner Cable and DIRECTV subscribers.
Despite some rating softness, MTV continues to connect with its core 12- to 34-year-old demo, an audience with whom it scores 4 of the top 15 cable series more than any other network, including Teen Mom, Awkward, Snooki & JWOWW and Teen Wolf. The network remained #1 in the demo among ad-supported cable networks in its critical 10 Spot programming slot. In the current quarter, MTV has a solid mix of returning hits and new originals in its 10 Spot lineup, anchored by Jersey Shore and Teen Mom 2. In its final season to date, Jersey Shore has been the #1 cable telecast on Thursdays in its demo. Leading into the series finale on December 20, MTV will air a week of countdown programming celebrating the event. 
Teen Mom 2 returned on Monday this week, a new night from which the hit series will jump-start the network's lineup each week and drew 3.4 million total viewers, up from the final season of Teen Mom and outpacing the Teen Mom 2 season finale. MTV will air seasons 3 and 4 of Teen Mom 2 back-to-back for the first time, giving fans new episodes of the series through April of 2013. Teen Mom 2 will serve as a platform to launch several new series debuting through next quarter, including Catfish, a reality look at identity and truth in the social media age, which premiered Monday to an average audience of 2.7 million total viewers and ranked as the highest-rated 11 p.m. show premier in MTV history.
We've spoken at length about our efforts to reinvigorate Nickelodeon, and I'm pleased to report that those efforts are yielding results, with viewership stabilizing and a continued infusion of new original programming coming to air. By addressing ratings issues, half hour by half hour, Nick has made improvements across the schedule and is now flat to up in several day parts, including preschool. 
The network has reclaimed its leadership of Saturday mornings among kids 2 to 11, thanks to new episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants and the long-awaited debut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which ranked as the highest-rated animated launch on the network since 2009. For 4 straight weeks, SpongeBob has stopped all of television and Ninja Turtles has won its time period by double digits with the critical 2 to 11 audience. The Ninja Turtles consumer products line has also been selling very well with our partner Playmates managing out-of-stock situations for action figures and selling out additional items rapidly. We expect brisk sales to continue.
From SpongeBob to Avatar, our history has shown that top animated programs typically continue to build audiences over time. So the strength of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles out of the gate, in addition to the success of its consumer products line and the anticipation for the forthcoming live-action feature from Paramount, give us great encouragement that Nickelodeon has a lasting and lucrative hit on its hands.
Additionally, new seasons of returning programs, including iCarly, Victorious and Big Time Rush, had strong premieres in the fourth quarter and continue to perform well in the current quarter. The iCarly one-hour series finale airs Thanksgiving weekend and is among a greater number of event programs throughout the current quarter, including Christmas specials from SpongeBob and Fairly OddParents. Event programming is a consistent and critical ratings driver for Nickelodeon, and you'll see more and more of it from the network.
On COMEDY CENTRAL, new episodes of Tosh.0 and Workaholics performed well with the network's young male audience in the fourth quarter. COMEDY CENTRAL's newest hit, Key & Peele, solidified its place in the cultural zeitgeist. And in late night, Jon and Stephen again proved to be strong as they held leadership in late night across all of television with men 18 to 34. As I mentioned earlier, COMEDY is increasing its original programming significantly, including the launch of 6 new series in the first half of the 2013 calendar year.  
VH1 continued its ratings rise as the network increased its viewership in primetime by 19% among adults 18 to 49 in the fourth quarter. Monday nights on VH1 remain particularly strong with women viewers. During the summer, VH1 was the #1 network with women 18 to 49 for 13 consecutive weeks, thanks to hits Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta and Single Ladies. The network is building on its momentum with the introduction of a new Friday night comedy block in January, which will feature The Jenny McCarthy Show and the return of Best Week Ever. Hit series Mob Wives and La La's Full Court Life return with new seasons in January as well.
BET saw success in the fourth quarter with its gospel original series, SUNDAY BEST, which has its best season to date, and 106 & Park, which the network has given a refreshed look and new hosts. In the current quarter, the BET Hip Hop Awards drew 3.1 million viewers, and BET's new reality series, Keyshia & Daniel: Family First, successfully premiered with 2.9 million viewers. In the current quarter, BET will air the 2012 Soul Train Awards later this month. And next quarter, we'll see the return of the network's hit originals, The Game and Let's Stay Together.
TV Land had a solid quarter with total day ratings up 5% year-over-year at the network's core 25 to 54 demo. In the current quarter, TV Land will look to build on that momentum with the return of Hot In Cleveland and Happily Divorced later this month. 
As SPIKE prepares for its much-anticipated debut of Bellator mixed martial arts in January, it continues to build out its lineup of originals. Returning series Auction Hunters and Bar Rescue showed momentum with Bar Rescue achieving double-digit ratings gains over its first season. In the current quarter, Tattoo Nightmares was SPIKE's highest-rated series premiere among viewers 18 to 49 in nearly 2 years. 
CMT made progress in the fourth quarter by updating its afternoon and primetime lineup with new acquisitions, including Reba. In the current quarter, the season 2 premiere of Redneck Island last Saturday attracted more than 1.4 million viewers and stands as the highest-rated season premiere in CMT history.
Moving now to international. Our international Media Networks improved both its operating income and margins in the fourth quarter despite the volatile economic environment abroad, particularly in Europe. We continue to drive strong growth in affiliate sales through organic growth, new channel launches and, to a lesser extent than prior quarters, digital distribution. Our continued strength in affiliate sales internationally, combined with significant cost management, have enabled Viacom International Media Networks to mitigate softness in advertising and ancillary sales due to the economic factors mentioned earlier.
In fiscal 2012, we made great progress in driving the reach and success of our adults-focused business abroad, a key priority for international. Ratings at COMEDY CENTRAL increased nearly 30% internationally for the full year, and this month saw the launch of COMEDY across several markets in Southeast Asia. The launch marks a major milestone in our effort to establish COMEDY as our third truly global brand alongside MTV and Nickelodeon. 
In the current quarter, fans around the world cast a record-breaking 184 million votes to decide the winners of last Sunday's 2012 MTV European Music Awards, and early results indicate that the broadcast grew its estimated TV reach in Europe by 15% over last year's strong ratings. We are on track to achieve our goal of 20% plus margins in our international networks in fiscal 2013.
Finally, let's take a look at our Filmed Entertainment segment. The fourth quarter closed a fiscal year in which Paramount Pictures took reasoned and decisive action to manage its release schedule and give its films maximum global visibility in theaters, even as it aggressively managed costs behind the screen, all of which resulted in higher profitability. The studio continues to demonstrate significant long-term progress in enhancing its margins.
In our fiscal 2013, Paramount has as diverse and promising a slate as we've seen from any studio in recent years, including star-driven tentpoles, prestige films and the type of highly targeted, high-margin releases it pioneered with the Paranormal Activity franchise. Indeed, Paranormal Activity returned to theaters in the current quarter with its fourth installment, which has grossed more than $50 million to-date at the box office and set the stage for a fifth Paranormal next Halloween. 
Paramount also released Flight, which earned rave reviews for the performance of 2-time Oscar winner, Denzel Washington, and has had 2 strong weekends at the box office for cumulative gross of more than $50 million. The studio has an additional 5 films hitting theaters through the end of the quarter, including: a Tom Cruise action vehicle, Jack Reacher; The Guilt Trip, starring Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand; David Chase's Not Fade Away; and DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians.
To wrap up, Viacom delivered significant value for shareholders in fiscal 2012. Our consistent investment in content will continue as we enter a new year, and our audiences will see it on every screen, on our television channels around the globe, on the web, on tablets and mobile devices and on the big screens in theaters worldwide. 
As we deepen engagement and drive ratings, we'll continue to connect marketers with our audiences and advance distribution through innovative and fruitful partnerships. At the box office, Paramount Pictures will serve movie-going audiences with a deep and diverse slate that will drive theatrical revenue through the year. Our entire organization will continue to strive toward creative excellence, operational excellence and effective cost management. And as a result, we will deliver on our commitment to continue to maximize free cash flow and return capital to shareholders.
Thank you again for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy."

I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our September quarter. Our 10-K will be filed shortly.
This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's September quarter excludes $17 million of discrete tax benefit. Last year's September quarter adjusted results excluded restructuring charges of $130 million on a pretax basis and $90 million after tax, as well as $52 million of discrete tax benefit.
Now let's take a look at our segment results. In our Media Networks segment, revenues of $2.3 billion in the quarter were in line with the prior year. Domestic revenues increased 1%, and international revenues were down 6%. Foreign exchange had a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.
Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues were down 6% in the quarter. International advertising declined 14%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 5 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter, as well as softness in Europe.
In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 12% while international revenues were up 3%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 5 percentage points. Excluding the impact of the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter.  International affiliate growth reflects revenues from new channel launches, as well as rate in subscriber increases.  
Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 4% in the quarter, primarily due to lower consumer product licensing and home entertainment revenues. 
Expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Within expenses, the programming expense grew 9% while SG&A expense declined 7%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense and savings realized from our 2011 restructuring.
Media Networks adjusted operating income of $933 million in the quarter was down 3% as compared to the September quarter of last year. The operating margin of 41% decreased approximately 100 basis points compared to the prior year.  
Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 39% to $1.1 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 83% to $131 million in the quarter. As anticipated, the studio faced difficult comparison to the September quarter of last year benefited from carryover revenues from Transformers: Dark of the Moon, as well as the release in the quarter of Captain America: The First Avenger. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 32% to $345 million in the quarter, primarily due to the mix of titles released in the quarter, including a difficult comparison to last year's release of Transformers 3. 
TV license fees increased 19% to $464 million. The increase in TV license fees in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in the pay TV and foreign syndication marketplaces. Ancillary revenues increased 21% to $147 million in the quarter due to higher digital revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $195 million in the quarter as compared to income of $185 million last year. 
Now moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $13 million in the quarter. Losses in the quarter principally relate our investment in EPIX. On a full year basis, EPIX was profitable. 
The reported tax rate in the quarter was 31%. The reported rate was favorably impacted by $17 million of discrete tax benefits. For fiscal year 2012, the adjusted effective tax rate was 34.0%.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."

Today I'm going to touch on our full year results, as well as talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year.Now turn",1179,"Thank you, Jimmy. Today I'm going to touch on our full year results, as well as talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year.
Now turning to the full year results. Media Networks generated revenue of $9.2 billion and adjusted operating income of $3.9 billion. Affiliate revenues grew 11% for the year, and advertising revenue declined 5%. Media Networks' margins of 42% increased 20 basis points over the prior year. The international part of our Media Networks business generated approximately $270 million of profitability for the year and achieved high-teens operating margins. Filmed Entertainment generated revenues of $4.8 billion and adjusted operating income of $325 million. This translates to an operating margin of 7%. As Philippe mentioned, we generated full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.21 and $2.4 billion in operating free cash flow.
Also, we continue to be aggressive in returning capital to our shareholders. For the full year, we repurchased 60 million of our shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 billion. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $3.4 billion of capital back to our shareholders, which is a return-on-market capitalization of approximately 14%. If you look back to when we started our buyback program 2 years ago, we had 609 million shares outstanding. Since then, we have repurchased a total of 121 million of our shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $5.6 billion, which brings our shares outstanding to 502 million as of November 7.
Now moving on to our debt. For the most part, it's fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 5%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago. So we continue to make great progress in lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter end.
In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.1 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $848 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x. At September 30, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Last week, we completed an amendment to our revolving credit facility that increased the size from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and extended the maturity 2 years to November of 2017.  This action reflects the strength of our balance sheet and provides us with significant financial flexibility for the next 5 years.
Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, for fiscal 2013, we continue to see growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will fluctuate, given that the recognition on some of our digital agreements is tied to product availability. Accordingly, in the December quarter, we expect that the reported affiliate revenue growth will be in the low single digits, which is a combination of lower digital revenues and double-digit growth in traditional revenues.
For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the high single digits. Given the timing of shows coming on air, growth will be weighted to the first half of the year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve or enhance our margins.
At Filmed Entertainment, in the December quarter, we anticipate a greater loss than in the prior year. This is primarily due to difficult comparisons in the home entertainment marketplace. The prior year benefited from carryover revenues from Transformers 3, as well as releases in the quarter, which included Super 8 and Captain America. However, the studio should see healthy growth in profits in the back half of the fiscal year as they benefit from the availabilities of titles in TV and home entertainment marketplaces. 
For 2013, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. We expect cash taxes to be similar to book taxes for the year. 
As for our stock buyback program, as Philippe mentioned, we plan to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the December quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for fiscal 2013.
Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline, on November 21, Paramount will be disturbing DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. For the holidays, the studio will release the comedy, Guilt Trip on December 19, starring Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen and which is produced by Lorne Michaels. And on December 21, they will release Jack Reacher, which stars Tom Cruise and is based on the best-selling book series. In addition, Paramount Vantage will be releasing the film Not Fade Away from David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos.
As we look into 2013, we have a number of 3D releases. In January, the studio will release Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, which stars Jeremy Renner, and in March, they will release G.I. Joe: Retaliation. The next installment of Star Trek, which is directed by J.J. Abrams, follows in May, and in June, Paramount will release World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt.  
Now looking at Paramount's development, they are currently in production on Noah, which is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Russell Crowe, as well as a new installment to the Jack Ryan series, with Chris Pine in the lead role. The studio is also in development on the Michael Bay-directed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and on a SpongeBob movie. They are planning a fourth installment of Transformers, as well as a fifth installment of our low-budget Paranormal Activity franchise. If you look at our 4 Paranormal films, which have released to date, they have cost only $27 million to produce and have generated over $700 million in worldwide box office.
In summary, we continue to focus on organic investment, disciplined management of our cost structure and returning capital to our shareholders. At Media Networks, we remain committed to strengthening our brands through increased investment, as well as by growing the level of original programming on our networks across all platforms and devices. And we look forward to the day when total content consumption is more accurately measured. At Paramount, we have developed several tentpole franchises and are excited about our upcoming slate and pipeline. We continue to seek ways to reduce our capital commitment in the business in order to enhance our margins, as well as our returns. And we are committed to aggressively returning capital to our shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. 
I want to thank you for listening. And now, operator, we'll turn the call over to the questions."

So just wondering if, maybe Tom and Philippe, if you could remind us of some of the reasons why ratings haven't correlated as directly with advertising trends, why advertising hasn't quite been as bad as linear ratings declines. And you guys have been more aggressive on TV Everywhere, particularly with current release windows than your peers. And so, clearly, that's probably one of the reasons they don't correlate. And, Tom, you mentioned the measurement, and you look forward to a day that those digital viewers can be measured more accurately. So any update on measurement in that way for TV Everywhere would also be helpful."

Naturally, over the long term, you have to rebuild your ratings. Where we focus on is working very closely with our major marketing partners. We do get a pickup from the C3 measurement in many cases, and so it's a question of mix. We have the ability to shift units from DR to paid advertising. So we operate at all times to maximize the available ad dollars. The good news for us is that as ad  -- as ratings improve, we can pretty quickly monetize those improved ratings because of the under-delivery that we have experienced over the period of weakness that is starting to lift. As far as TV Everywhere and measurement, we believe that in the long term, in order for our whole industry to succeed, we have to provide consumers, and particularly our young audiences, with the content they want on the gadgets and platforms and the places they want it. And we're going to do it in a way that intelligently manages the windows and work with our marketers to ensure that we monetize that viewing, a part of it is measurement. And we are working with Nielsen and others to ensure that, that measurement improves over time. And I'm convinced that we're going to see gradual improvement of that; not as fast as we would like, but it will improve. And in the meantime, we are demonstrating to our major marketers the kind of additional viewing we are getting on the content that they are in partnership with us on. And as they understand that, that cements the relationship we have with them and, going back to the beginning of your question, allows us to maximize our advertising revenues even in the face of weak ratings in some of our networks."

But, Anthony, we also look forward to the day -- Facebook and Google actually bill based on delivered impressions, and I think there's opportunities down the road for traditional media to begin to go down that road. And that would be an exciting new day. Add that to the possibility of dynamic commercial insertion, where commercials are inserted at the time when the content is consumed, which in today's day and age, based on video-on-demand and all the technologies that are available to deliver our content discretely to a consumer, you got to get very excited about that, that power of that concept and that delivery capability. When is that going to take place? That's over the next 12 to 24 months that those technologies really begin to hit the marketplace very quickly, and that changes a lot of the dynamics in the advertising marketplace and the content measurement marketplace. So we're real excited about that, because we know our content is being consumed aggressively by the younger audiences that we deliver across many devices where measurement isn't completely captured."

We've had our eye on her for a long time, and we're very pleased that she has committed to coming with us and devoting her total energy to the exciting programming we have in place. And she will bring with her, and you'll see announcements in the near future, some additional talent who will bring to bear more development in both the reality and scripted areas. So we've got a good pipeline now, and this will only turbo charge it. And likewise, we have continued to add talent across many other networks. I talked about Nickelodeon, talked about how we changed the structure of the organization, but we've also infused the Nickelodeon organization with new outside talent. From Disney, we recently have made a significant hire from Disney and from other places. So we are centrally focused at our company on bringing in great programming talent, developing more series and different genres across all of our networks.

We have a lot to do in growing organically. We have the brands. We have the resources. We have a lot of opportunities. We are living in a world where the media business is transitioning. We are extremely well positioned to grow in that transition because we have a deeper understanding of the young audiences that are driving that transition than any media group out there. So we have opportunities to grow with them on multiple platforms. We have opportunities to grow internationally. We may have some discrete small-priced M&A opportunities that are almost operational investments, particularly in the international arena where it makes sense. But we just have so much opportunity that's more -- that creates more value than large M&A, which, as you know, has a number of pitfalls generally associated with them. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders. As far as the scatter marketplace with our marketing clients, there is demand out there. We don't have a demand issue on our networks. We've -- what we've had, we've experienced is a supply issue, meaning ratings. So we are engaging in self-help. We are going to create the supply, create the inventory, so that we can capture the demand that we have out there so that we can take the demand, take the dollars in. And that's why it's so important for us to focus on building our programming and building our ratings, scheduling segment by scheduling segment, network by network."

But we've -- we're getting to the point of bottoming out on that, and the consumer product franchise Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will continue to build the bottom line. It's not significantly material. But it's nice, steady business, high-margin business that we will grow, not just in the U.S. but significantly internationally. So we will build on that.
