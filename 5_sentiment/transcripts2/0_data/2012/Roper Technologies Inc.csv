So we'll walk you through briefly how the fourth quarter looked, what our full year enterprise results for 2011 were and what some of those implications are for positioning ourselves in 2012. We'll go through the segment detail in terms of how we see 2012 by segment, talk about our guidance for the coming year and then open it up for Q&A. 
So next slide here. With the overview of the fourth quarter. It was an all-time record quarter for us for any quarter in the history of the company. And that the most revenue, the most net earnings, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, operating and free cash flow. Total sales were up 9%, organic sales were up 7%. Frankly better organic sales growth than we would have expected back 6 or 7 months ago. So things to favorable in that arena. Gross margins were up to 54.9%, demonstrating or certainly not under a lot of a price pressure in the marketplace and then everything we're doing continues to work exceptionally well. EBITDA was $222 million in the quarter, which is beyond a spectacular number in our opinion. EBITDA margins were 30.1%. It's certainly a milestone for Roper. It speaks to the quality of the businesses that we have. Our earnings in the quarter were $1.23, we talked about that in the income statement here up from $1.10. Last year, fourth quarter and operating cash flow was another sort of a spectacular $193 million in the quarter, that represented 158% of net earnings on a conversion basis and represented 26% of sales. Free cash flow was $181 million. Same story, 149% of net earnings here for conversions. So it was quite a strong finish in the fourth quarter to what was a historic year for us. 
Next slide. Here if we look at the fourth quarter income statement, you'll see that bookings were basically flat. There are couple of reasons for that. Fourth quarter last year, our orders were up 23% over the prior year so it was an exceptionally unusual and difficult comp. And we had 3 things happen that we detailed. Last year, we had quite a substantial order for Neptune that tends to be a nonrecurring type of item when those happened, there are some unique shipments in the counter arena around some specific CapEx that was going on in China. And then we had Gaz de France project, that was largely both of them that was completed in the fourth quarter this year. So those over unusual headwinds that exceeded $30 million. The backlog is up though, as you can see by 5.5%. So backlog was $128 million, which is an all-time record for year ending backlog number for us. Net sales were up 9%, 7% organic. Gross profit as we covered was up 20 bps, operating income of $187 million was up 13% and operating margin was at above 25% here up 80 bps in the quarter. You can see the tax rate was a little bit of a negative headwind for us in the quarter compared to last year. We had a particularly favorable tax rate Q4 last year of 27.7% for us and the fourth quarter was 29%. So that cost us $0.02 a share. Nonetheless, we still are in that $1.23 debt.
Next slide. If you look at fourth quarter cash flow. It's, for us, just breathtaking accomplishment. $183 million of operating cash flow in the quarter and that's up dramatically last year, a record year was $155 million. And if you look at fourth quarter 2009, it was $120 million. So we just continue to pileup the cash. And if you look at the variances, it's up 24%, as you can see on this slide from the fourth quarter a year ago and 61% from 2009. 
Next slide. Here we'll start to look at the full year enterprise results. Next slide. We again achieved a record result on an annual basis, as well as a quarter. On an annual basis, again includes everything. Kitchen sink here, historic levels of orders, backlog, sales, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow. Sales for the year were up 17%, organic growth for 2011 was 13%. Remember when we established guidance of the beginning of the year, we organic growth might be 9% or 11%, so substantially stronger than we had expected. Gross margin was up 8 bps to 54.4%, operating margin up at 200 bps to 23.6%, which is really an incredible achievement for all of our 28 P&Ls around the world that are so terrifically focused on margin and cash and growth. Our EBITDA for the year was up $164 million to $802 million. By the way, we had a remeasurement gain in the second quarter and that were excluding that from the $602 million number, otherwise it would have been $809 million, but that's not a recurring item. The EBITDA margin expanded to 28.7% for the full year and operating cash flow for the full year was $602 million or 22% of revenue. Free cash flow at $561 million was 20% of sales. So another terrific year for the Roper family of businesses. 
Next slide. Here if we look at the full year income statement, you'll see bookings were up 11% on the year. Net sales up 17%, organic 13%. Gross margin up 80 bps operating margin up 200 as we said it. Tax rate on the year came in at 29.4, which was a 130 bps headwinds compared to the prior year. So that cost us $0.08 a share. Despite that, we've reported debts of $4.34 and the one thing we point out there again is that re- measurement gain is at the GAAP number of $4.34. 
Next slide. Here if we look at our EBITDA growth, you can see the trends and performance in terms of capturing our gross margins in the form of EBITDA for our investors. We had EBITDA of $802 million as we mentioned, which is up $300 million from 2 years ago. Our EBITDA margin in 2 years ago were 24.5% and common question are how are you ever going to keep those margins? They've got to degrade nobody can have a margins like this. They are going to progress artificial S&P 500 companies are stuck with. But that's not the case here. As you can see our margins went up to 24.5% to 26.7% last year and just continue forward at 28.7% this year. That's a 420 basis point improvement in just 2 years in our EBITDA margins. 
Next slide. Our full year cash flow again tells the story of Roper's business model. $602 million in operating cash flow representing 22% of revenue. Free cash flow of 20% of revenue. Terrific execution throughout the enterprise. Networking capital still in our definition of inventory receivables less payables and accruals is like 6% or less. So just spectacular performance from the field here. And you can see that trend up from $367 million of operating cash flow in '09 to $500 million to $602 million, and we're forecasting continued growth in 2012. 
Next slide. We have a really terrific balance sheet. We closed the year a very strong position. You can see cash was up $68 million to $338 million. Our undrawn revolver is totally undrawn at $750 million last year. We had $520 million. And we get the benefit of trailing EBITDA coming up at $802 million. Last year it was $638 million. So we when you think about all those investment grade characteristics, and multiply times EBITDA and you look at the outer we have, we've got a really a spectacular balance sheet. Gross debt to capitalizations is 25.4. And when you look at the net debt number, we have about $1,085,000,000 in gross debt with the $338 million in cash, net debt of $747 million, against $802 million of trailing EBITDA. So it goes without saying that 2012 is likely going to be a strongly above average acquisition year for Roper and we're very excited about our prospects in that arena. 
Next slide. Here we'll get into the individual segments. All of them are just faithfully executed the business models that they drive. And you can see there's just no softness anywhere inside the full year activity. RF Technology's sales were up 17%, operating profit up 35% and margins up 300 bps. Industrial Technology was up 21%, OP up 29% and margins up 150. And boy, when you're up 150 and used 28.2% OP margin for industrial flow control businesses, I just can't take my head off another to the quality of people we have in advantages move to the service. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging sales were up 11%, OP was up 14 and margins were up 50. And then Energy Systems and Controls was up 19% with OP up 31 and margins up to 50. Overall, the team produced 13% organic growth. They feel good about going into 2012 and the broad-based margin expansion we enjoyed this year we think will continue next year. 
Next slide. So here we'll look with the smallest segment. As a function of the total of 21% of Medical and Scientific Imaging. They had an unusual fourth quarter just mathematically were talking about that. But really the story is that medical growth continues with even better prospects of Northern Digital than we originally identified. Got significant O&M business that we believe is coming online in 2012. We had organic sales decline in the fourth quarter really caused by 2 primary events. We had lower camera sales for which an original equipment manufacturing videoconferencing series of things that go on of 1 particular large clients and they were declined this past year in the fourth quarter really brought that to a hit. And then our Rugged Mobile computer shipments, which we've really talked about because it's certainly not key to our medical or scientific imaging businesses, they enjoyed unusual activity in the fourth quarter last year with their Rugged Mobile applications in the certain overnight shipping arrangements and those are really weighted this year in the fourth quarter. We had a very strong margin performance in the fourth quarter against an all-time record last year in the fourth quarter. So we wound up with 25% OP in the fourth quarter. For the full year, you can see sales were up 11%, OP 14, and margin up 50. As we look to 2012, what we've seen this is a medical growth we expected to continue. We have several new product launches that are recurring, generally starting in Europe and then coming into North America. We expect those to provide a lift in the second half of the year. We'll get the benefit of some growth from the Northern Digital acquisition in the first part of the year and that will turn into organic growth in the second. But we expect very strong first quarter from Northern Digital. We've got significant backlog in the Scientific Imaging arena, that supports the modest growth for the year. It certainly going to be the probably the low point of 2012 organic growth for Roper. But that said, given fierce around research funding, as we've gone through our planning reviews with people, people seem reasonably confident and certainly the physical signs aspect of this looks better than the nuclear and biological aspects does but on balance, it should be a net gain for us in 2012. And we are confident we are going to have a margin expansion from growth in the other arenas. 
Next slide. If we look at the energy systems and controls. Here you can see just virtually all the divisions here with the exception of Zetec's engine activity have had a very strong growth across the segment. They all have record margin performance. We continue to get our diesel engine system shut off that we talked about frequently continue to grow at a very rapid pace. We don't see any pullback in that area. We have had record results really for Compressor Controls and primarily due to the continuing expansion projects around the world. And you can see for the full year, our revenue was up 19%, OP up 31 and margin up 250. To have OP in the fourth quarter at 30.5% is really quite substantial performance. If you look at 2012, we don't really see any headwinds here. We would expect that this segment to grow the fastest of our 4 segments in 2012. It's got major drivers, none of which are waining in any way with the oil and gas markets remaining favorable. Compressor Controls has a backlog that assures its success for the year. And the bolt-on acquisitions, which we haven't talked a lot about because they're small United Controls down earlier this year, gives us access to very substantial OEMs that we haven't been involved within the past. We're company in the U.K. that's coming on board now. It's a modest revenue but it gives us a lot of technology and allow us to get compressor control even more and better than software activity. And then is a Chinese company, is our first Chinese acquisition that we acquired from. Is enjoying very nice growth probably everyone is aware of it. The manufacturing CapEx is doing well and the things that's it can do for us in China are similar to what we do in the U.S. We have a lot of new products coming online and having our own in-house manufacturing capability and distribution channel reached directly in China for the rubber industry is quite useful for us. 
Next slide. Here if we look at Industrial Technology. In the fourth quarter was up 20% in sales, 25% in OP, margins at 29.2%. Let's not be confused. Those are not gross margins of initial company. Those are the operating margins of our flow controlling businesses. Fluid handling, very rapid growth from new customers, expanding oil and gas markets here. Certainly frac-ing is driving a significant portion of our growth. Very important indicator for us, our Materials Test business that's headquartered in Denmark along with the Tinisco business I just mentioned were 2 of 3 indicators 2008 about the downturn for '09 that people are going to experience and they finished the fourth quarter of the very strong rate up over 20%. Very strong as well. So we haven't seen any sign of any deterioration and forward activity. Neptune is continuing to grow in the U.S. despite the concerns that we and others would have about the municipal market. And the fourth quarter was favorable for Neptune. And we delivered both growth and execution with these record margins. Full year you can see sort of similar 20% in the fourth quarter, 21 for the year, OP up 29, margin up 150 basis points. For this coming year, we really don't see anything that's going to arrest the trend, the major drivers. We get a big benefit from the Toronto project at Neptune, which will roll out more rapidly in 2012 than it did in '11. We don't see any pullback in any of our flow control businesses. And then we have a new products in material test that will allow that continue to grow. So it will do nicely at any high-end of any range we established for organic growth. 
Then we look at the RF Technology business. And here in the fourth quarter, we had sales of 4%, OP up 12% and a significant margin improvement up 190 bps. The organic was flatter, was far better than what it looks here because we had the completion of France Technolog Gaz de France automatic meter reading project, which was completed. So from a revenue it helped us all year but in the prior year it had been in the bookings. So that was certainly an artificial headwind on a comparative basis. We had very strong shipments that offset somewhat less project work in the tolling in the fourth quarter. But we continue to have growth in our Software-as-a-Service subscription and software maintenance businesses. We had really a terrific contribution throughout the year from our college campus software and integrated security solutions out of CBORD. They accounted for a significant portion of our growth and in the full year. And importantly, you can see the full year sales growth for RF was up 17%, OP up 35 and margin up 300. And we are encouraged by margin in general in RF. So when we look to 2012, what we see is continued growth in the software and SaaS businesses and that we have. We think toll project and maintenance growth will be stronger next year while tag shipments will be lower. We have this headwind that we have to get through with the Gaz de France project that won't reoccur although we have ongoing service with it. So that will be a drag into 2012. But the operating margin expansion that we expect to see by having software businesses becoming a bigger portion of the segments and the backlog that we have in this segment gives us confidence that we will produce both more cash and operating profit in 2012 in RF. 
Next slide.
Here as we get into the 2012 guidance. Next slide, the full year guidance for us is $467 million to $487 million and assumptions around that is that organic growth would be up from a 5% of the low end of the range of 8% or more at the high end of the range. Last year we said 9% to 11%, I believe that. This year, 5% to 8% given all the uncertainty the word seems like a rational approach to this. We're assuming currency is the same as it was January 31, 2012, the tax rate we're assuming is going to be about 30%. Share count creeps up a little bit from 98.5 million diluted shares to 99.5 million. First quarter, we'd see coming in between $1.01 and $1.05. And full year operating cash flow should exceed $650 million in 2012. I'm sure some people worry we haven't commented much about Europe in here. It's not overly significant for us. We don't see much difficulty in Europe. Our businesses there our exporters to emerging markets. So we remain pretty comfortable what's happening in Europe. 
Next slide. If you look at the 2011 summary then, we had an all-time performance record for orders and sales, net earnings, cash flow and EBITDA. We had terrific margin leverage. And when we looked back on the year, one of the things that I didn't cover that's worth really talking about in the income statement is, if we look at the difference, we were up operating income reached $661 million, up from $514 million, so that's $147 million up in operating income, while sales were up by $411 million. So you take that $147 million OP and divide it by an incremental $411 million in net sales, you get an operating profit leverage of 36%. So our leverage is still world-class, and we expect that to continue in 2012. 
Operating cash flow at $602 million speaks for itself, 20% free cash flow to sales. I don't think you can find people doing that. And our family of businesses and our end markets are continuing to look quite reasonable for 2012. So we expect to have another record year in 2012 and certainly are off to a good start. So with that, John, I think we're open for questions."

So we get a whole lot of several year out from new CapEx activity where people want to see us deploy better technology for their controls than perhaps they had in the original purchase. This is a phenomenon that's not unusual. So people who are looking for productivity or more throughput or less consumption in the gas and the pipeline, frequent they're going to choose us. That business we've really become quite effective in distribution channels around the world. And growing in China as well. And so we really have -- anybody who wants to have LNG operations that are as efficient as possible in getting the least consumption of the gas inside their gas turbines is likely to look to us as a solution provider. That reputation just continues to build. So from an aftermarket perspective, the projects that we get a bit on, it would be not the least but unusual for us to have 6 months of backlog at Compressor Controls and non service work that's going to fill things of it. So in fact, we completely redesigned our headquarters last year, created a much, much more engineering oriented facility that gives people an opportunity to work in teams in a very different way. It certainly, among our most exciting businesses, we've got just world class resources in that business. Early phases of our growth, frankly, and good heavens if we've got the exporting gas and LNG, it would be phenomenal what will happen to our business in that area."

But we had some unusual situations in Q4 last year, large Mexico City project that we revealed to people in industrial in the fourth quarter from an order perspective and then obviously, wouldn't repeat in the fourth quarter this year. So that alone explains most of the book to bill in industrial. And then RF is lumpy situation. Book to bill in RF was weak at like 0.9 or something like that. But we're not really worried about that. We have huge backlog in RF and the non-toll project activity is quite robust going into 2012. So it's not much of a factor. If we had a poor book to bill in the first quarter then we would be talking more about that. But we wouldn't establish organic guidance in 5% to 8% or more if we are worried about book to bill. But it's a fair thing to point out because normally, we would expect it to be not be worse 0.97, this time it was 0.94. But there were this 3 unusual event with cameras and the Rugged Mobile and Mexico that aren't really core to the overall nature of activity. So the rest of it was much more in our wheelhouse.

And then, we have the third the sales force, which is the sales force, which is a more generic but they are selling products that are in the thousands of dollars, not the hundreds of thousand dollars, not really CapEx for the most part. Those people have very specific people they call on. It's organized into an acute care activity and private practice activity. It's easy for them to add things in those 2 areas, increasingly we're investing outside the U.S. in channel presence and that's doing really well.

So this point, there 20 years, impressive to be in the early phases of growth. But it's a software driven mainly, very small part of it.

And so very nice job there. And then of course with a high degree of recurring revenue that comes out of our TransCore total entropic business, that is a business that will naturally kind of be in the mid-single digits also and that's kind of what it did in 2011. And then the variation that we see in that business is largely due to the timing of shipments based upon when customers are going to replenish their inventory. They've done a very nice job outside the U.S. our total entropic business has with expansion of electronic tolling opportunities in Puerto Rico and continuing with the largest tolling project in the world in Dubai.

So we'll walk you through briefly how the fourth quarter looked, what our full year enterprise results for 2011 were and what some of those implications are for positioning ourselves in 2012.

So we'll walk you through briefly how the fourth quarter looked, what our full year enterprise results for 2011 were and what some of those implications are for positioning ourselves in 2012. We'll go through the segment detail in terms of how we see 2012 by segment, talk about our guidance for the coming year and then open it up for Q&A. 
So next slide here would be an overview of the fourth quarter. It was an all-time record quarter for us for any quarter in the history of the company. And we had the most revenue, the most net earnings, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, operating and free cash flow. Total sales were up 9%, organic sales were up 7%. Frankly better organic sales growth than we would have expected back 6 or 7 months ago. So things still look pretty favorable in that arena. Gross margins were up to 54.9%, demonstrating or certainly not under a lot of a price pressure in the marketplace, and then everything we're doing continues to work exceptionally well. EBITDA was $222 million in the quarter, which is beyond a spectacular number in our opinion. EBITDA margins were 30.1%. It's certainly a milestone for Roper. It speaks to the quality of the businesses that we have. Our earnings in the quarter were $1.23, we talked about that in the income statement here up from $1.10. Last year, fourth quarter and operating cash flow was another sort of a spectacular $193 million in the quarter, that represented 158% of net earnings on a conversion basis and represented 26% of sales. Free cash flow was $181 million. Same story, 149% of net earnings here for conversions. So it was quite a strong finish in the fourth quarter to what was a historic year for us. 
Next slide. Here if we look at the fourth quarter income statement, you'll see that bookings were basically flat. There are couple of reasons for that. The fourth quarter last year, our orders were up 23% over the prior year, so it was an exceptionally unusual and difficult comp. And we had 3 things happen that we detailed. Last year, we had quite a substantial Mexican order for Neptune that tends to be a nonrecurring type of item when those happened. Some unique shipments in the camera arena around some specific CapEx that was going on in China. And then we had Gaz de France project largely booked and that was completed in the fourth quarter of this year. So those were unusual headwinds that exceeded $30 million. 
The backlog is up though, as you can see by 5.5%. So backlog was $828 million, which is an all-time record for our year-ending backlog number for us. Net sales were up 9%, 7% organic. Gross profit, as we covered, was up 20 bps, operating income at $187 million was up 13% and operating margin was at above 25% here, up 80 bps in the quarter. You can see the tax rate was actually a little bit of a negative headwind for us in the quarter compared to last year. We had a particularly favorable tax rate Q4 last year of 27.7% for us, and the fourth quarter was 29%. So that cost us $0.02 a share. Nonetheless, we still are in at $1.23 on DEPS.
Next slide. If you look at fourth quarter cash flow. It's, for us, just a breathtaking accomplishment. $193 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, and that's up dramatically. Last year, our record year was $155 million. And if you look at fourth quarter 2009, it was $120 million. So we just continue to pileup the cash. And if you look at the variances, it's up 24%, as you can see on this slide from the fourth quarter a year ago at 61% from 2009. 
Next slide. Here we'll start to look at the full year enterprise results. Next slide. We again achieved a record result on an annual basis, as well as a quarter. On an annual basis, again, includes everything in the kitchen sink here, historic levels of orders, backlog, sales, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow. Sales for the year were up 17%, organic growth for 2011 was 13%. Remember, when we established guidance at the beginning of the year, we thought organic growth might be 9% to 11%, so it came in substantially stronger than we had expected. Gross margin was up 8 bps to 54.2%, operating margin up 200 bps to 23.6%, which is really an incredible achievement for all of our 28 P&Ls around the world that are so terrifically focused on margin and cash and growth. 
Our EBITDA for the year was up $164 million to $802 million. By the way, we had a remeasurement gain in the second quarter, and we're excluding that from this $802 million number, otherwise it would have been $809 million, but that's a nonrecurring item. The EBITDA margin expanded to 28.7% for the full year and operating cash flow for the full year was $602 million or 22% of revenue. Free cash flow at $561 million was 20% of sales. So another terrific year for the Roper family of businesses. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at the full year income statement, you'll see bookings were up 11% on the year. Net sales up 17%, organic 13%. Gross margin up 80 bps, operating margin up 200, as we said. Tax rate on the year came in at 29.4, which was a 130 bps headwinds compared to the prior year. So that cost us $0.08 a share. Despite that, we've reported DEPS of $4.34. And the one thing we point out there, again, is that remeasurement gain is in the GAAP number at $4.34. 
Next slide. Here if we look at our EBITDA growth, you can see the trends and performance in terms of capturing our gross margins in the form of EBITDA for our investors. We had EBITDA of $802 million as we mentioned, which is up $300 million from 2 years ago. Our EBITDA margins, 2 years ago, were 24.5%. And a common question asked always, how are you ever going to keep those margins? They've got to degrade. Nobody can have a margins like this. They're going to regress to some artificial mean that S&P 500 companies are stuck with. But that's not the case here. As you can see our margins went up from 24.5% to 26.7% last year, and just continued forward at 28.7% this year. That's a 420 basis point improvement in just 2 years in our EBITDA margins. 
Next slide. Our full year cash flow, again, tells the story of Roper's business model. $602 million in operating cash flow, representing 22% of revenue. Free cash flow, 20% of revenue. A terrific execution throughout the enterprise. Networking capital, still, in our definition of inventory receivables less payables. And accruals is like 6% or less. So just spectacular performance from the field here. And you can see that trend up from $367 million of operating cash flow in '09 to $500 million to $602 million, and we're forecasting continued growth in 2012. 
Next slide. We have a really terrific balance sheet. We closed out the year in a very strong position. You can see cash was up $68 million to $338 million. Our undrawn revolver is totally undrawn at $750 million last year. We had $520 million. And we get the benefit of trailing EBITDA coming up at $802 million. Last year it was $638 million. So we when you think about all those kind of investment-grade characteristics and multiply it times EBITDA and you look at the power that we have, we've got a really a spectacular balance sheet. 
Gross debt to capitalizations is 25.4%. And when you look at the net debt number, we have about $1,085,000,000 in gross debt with the $338 million in cash. You had net debt of $747 million, against $802 million of trailing EBITDA. So it goes without saying that 2012 is likely going to be a strongly above average acquisition year for Roper, and we're very excited about our prospects in that arena. 
Next slide. Here we'll get into the individual segments. All of them are just faithfully executing the business models so that they drive. And you can see there's just no softness anywhere inside the full year activity. RF Technology's sales were up 17%, operating profit up 35% and margins up 300 bps. Industrial Technology was up 21%, OP up 29% and margins up 150. And boy, when you're up 150 and have 28.2% OP margin for industrial flow control businesses, I can't take my hat off enough to the quality of people we have and the niches we've chosen to serve. Our Medical & Scientific Imaging sales were up 11%, OP was up 14% and margins were up 50. And then Energy Systems & Controls was up 19%, with OP up 31% and margins up to 50. Overall, the team produced 13% organic growth. They feel quite good about going into 2012. And the broad-based margin expansion we enjoyed this year, we think will continue next year. 
Next slide. So here we'll look with the smallest segment. As a function of the total of 21% is Medical & Scientific Imaging. They had an unusual fourth quarter, just mathematically we'll talk about. But really, the story is that Medical growth continues with an even better prospects of Northern Digital than we originally identified. We got significant OEM business that we believe is coming online in 2012. We had organic sales decline in the fourth quarter, really, caused by 2 primary events. We had lower camera sales, which an original equipment manufacturing videoconferencing series of things that go on of 1 particular large client and they were in decline this past year, and the fourth quarter really brought that to a hit. 
And then our Rugged Mobile computer shipments, which we rarely talk about, because it's certainly not the key to our Medical or Scientific Imaging businesses. But they enjoyed unusual activity in the fourth quarter last year with their Rugged Mobile applications and a certain overnight shipping arrangements, and those are really waned this year in the fourth quarter. We had a very strong margin performance in the fourth quarter against an all-time record last year in the fourth quarter. So we wound up with 25% OP in the fourth quarter. For the full year, you can see sales were up 11%, OP 14% and margin up 50. 
As we look to 2012, what we see in the segment is that Medical growth we expect to continue. We have several new product launches that are recurring, generally starting in Europe and then coming into North America. We expect those to provide a lift in the second half of the year. We'll get the benefit of some growth from the Northern Digital acquisition in the first part of the year, and then it will turn into organic growth in the second. But we expect a very strong first quarter from Northern Digital. We've got significant backlog in the Scientific Imaging arena, that supports modest growth for the year. It certainly going to be, probably, the low point of 2012 organic growth for Roper. But that said, given fears around research funding, as we've gone through our planning reviews with people, people seem reasonably confident. And certainly the physical science aspect of this looks better than the molecular and biological aspects does. But on balance, it should be a net gain for us in 2012. And we are confident we're going to have a margin expansion from growth in the other arenas. 
Next slide. If we look at the Energy Systems & Controls. Here you can see just virtually all the divisions here, with the exception of Zetec's enablers or steam gen activity, all have had a very strong growth across the segment. They all have record margin performance. We continue to get our diesel engine shut-off systems that we've talked about frequently, continue to grow at a very rapid pace. We don't see any pullback in that area. We have had record results, really, for Compressor Controls and primarily due to the continuing expansion projects around the world. And you can see for the full year, our revenue was up 19%, OP up 31% and margin up 250. To have OP in the fourth quarter at 30.5% is really quite substantial performance. 
If you look at 2012, we don't really see any headwinds here. We would expect that this segment the one to grow the fastest of our 4 segments in 2012. It's got major drivers, none of which are waning in any way with the oil and gas markets remaining favorable. Compressor Controls has a backlog that assures its success for the year. And the bolt-on acquisitions, which we haven't talked a lot about because they're small, United Controls down earlier this year, gives us access to very substantial OEMs that we haven't been involved within the past. Trinity, is a software company in the U.K. that's just coming on board now. It's a modest revenue but it gives us a lot of technology and can allow us to get Compressor Control even more and better than software activity. And then Hao Ying, is a Chinese company, it's our first Chinese acquisition that we acquired for Dynisco. Dynisco is enjoying very nice growth. Probably everyone is aware of that tire manufacturing CapEx is doing well. And the things that Hao Ying can do for us in China are similar to what we do in the U.S. We have a lot of new products coming online and having our own in-house manufacturing capability and distribution channel reached directly in China for the rubber industry is quite useful for us. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at Industrial Technology, the fourth quarter was up 20% in sales, 25% in OP, margins at 29.2%. Let's not be confused, those are not gross margins of an industrial company, those are the operating margins of our flow control businesses. Fluid handling, very rapid growth from new customers, expanding oil and gas markets here. Certainly, frac-ing is driving a significant portion of our growth. Very important indicator for us, our Material Test business, that's headquartered in Denmark, along with the Dynisco business I just mentioned, were 2 of 3 indicators that the in 2008 about the downturn for '09 that people are going to experience. And they finished the fourth quarter at a very strong rate up over 20%. Dynisco finished very strong as well. So we haven't seen any sign of any deterioration and forward activity. 
Neptune is continuing to grow in the U.S., despite the concerns that we and others would have had about the municipal market. And the fourth quarter was -- it was favorable for Neptune. And we delivered both growth and execution with these record margins. Full year, you can see sort of similar 20% in the fourth quarter, 21% for the year, OP up 29% and margin up 150 basis points. 
For this coming year, we really don't see anything that's going to arrest the trend, the major drivers. We get a big benefit from the Toronto project at Neptune, which will roll out more rapidly in 2012 than it did in '11. We don't see any pullback in any of our flow control businesses. And then we have new products in Material Test that will allow that continue to grow. So we think it'll do nicely in a high end of any range we've established for organic growth. 
Then we look at the RF Technology business. And here in the fourth quarter, we had sales up 4%, OP up 12% and a significant margin improvement up 190 bps. The organic was flatter than -- it was far better than what it looks here because we had the completion of the France -- Gaz de France automatic meter reading project, which was completed. So from a revenue view point, it helped us all year. But in the prior year, as it did in the bookings. So that was a certain artificial headwind on a comparative basis. 
We have very strong toll tag shipments that offset somewhat less project work in tolling in the fourth quarter. But we continue to have growth in our Software-as-a-Service subscription and software maintenance businesses. We had, really, a terrific contribution throughout the year from our college campus software and integrated security solutions out of CBORD. They accounted for a significant portion of our growth in the full year. And importantly, you can see the full year sales growth for RF was up 17%, OP up 35%and margin up 300. And we're encouraged by margins in general in RF. So when we look to 2012, what we see is continued growth in the software and SaaS businesses that we have. We think toll project and maintenance growth will be stronger next year, while tag shipments will be lower. We have this headwind that we have to get through with the Gaz de France project that won't reoccur, although we'll have ongoing service with it. So that will be a drag into 2012. But the operating margin expansion that we expect to see by having the software businesses becoming a bigger portion of the segment, and the backlog that we have in the segment, gives us confidence that we'll produce both more cash and operating profit in 2012 in RF. 
Next slide. Here, is we get into the 2012 guidance. Next slide. The full year guidance for us is $467 million to $487 million, and the assumptions around that is that organic growth would be up from a 5% at the low end of the range to 8% or more at the high end of the range. Last year, we said 9% to 11%, I believe. This year, 5% to 8%, given all the uncertainty in the world, seems like a rational approach to this. We're assuming currency is the same as it was at January 31, 2012. The tax rate, we're assuming is going to be about 30%. Share count creeps up a little bit from 98.5 million diluted shares to 99.5 million. First quarter, we'd see coming in between $1.01 and $1.05. And full year operating cash flow should exceed $650 million in 2012. I'm sure some people worry we haven't commented much about Europe in here, it's not overly significant for us. We don't see much difficulty in Europe. Our businesses there are often exporters to emerging markets. So we remain pretty comfortable with what's happening in Europe. 
Next slide. If you look at the 2011 summary then, we had an all-time performance record for orders and sales, net earnings, cash flow and EBITDA. We had terrific margin leverage. And when we looked back on the year, one of the things that I didn't cover that's worth really talking about in the income statement is, if we look at the difference, we were up, operating income reached $661 million, up from $514 million. So that's $147 million up in operating income, while sales were up by $411 million. So you take that $147 million OP and divide it by an incremental $411 million in net sales, you get operating profit leverage of 36%. So our leverage is still world-class, and we expect that to continue in 2012. 
Operating cash flow at $602 million speaks for itself, 20% free cash flow to sales. I don't think you can find people doing that. And our family of businesses and our end markets are continuing to look quite reasonable for 2012. So we expect to have another record year in 2012, and we certainly are off to a good start. So with that, John, I think we're open for questions."

So we get a whole lot of several year out from new CapEx activity, where people want to see us deploy better technology for their controls than perhaps they had in the original purchase. It's just a phenomenon that's not unusual. So people who are looking for productivity or more throughput or less consumption in the gas and the pipeline, frequently are going to choose us. In that business we've really become quite effective in distribution channels around the world and we're sort of growing in China as well. So we really have -- anybody who wants to have LNG operations that are as efficient as possible in getting the least consumption of gas inside their gas turbines, is likely to look to us as a solution provider. That reputation just continues to build. So from an aftermarket perspective, the projects that we get a bit on -- I mean, it would be not the least, but unusual for us to have 6 months of backlog at Compressor Controls and know service work that's going to fill things of it. So in fact, we completely redesigned our Des Moines headquarters last year, created a much, much more engineering-oriented facility that gives people an opportunity to work in teams in a very different way. It's certainly among our most exciting businesses. We've got just world-class human resources in that business. We're at the early phases of our growth, frankly. And good heavens, if we got to exporting gas and LNG. It would be phenomenal what will happen to our business in that area."

We have huge backlog in RF and the non-toll project activity is quite robust going into 2012, so it's not much of a factor.

And then we have the third the sales force, which is the Verathon sales force, which is a more generic. But they're selling products that are in the thousands of dollars, not the hundreds of thousand of dollars, not really CapEx for the most part. Those people have very specific people they call on. It's organized into an acute care activity and a private practice activity. It's easy for them to add things in those 2 areas. Increasingly we're investing outside the U.S. in channel presence, and that's doing really well.

And of course, you also had some headwinds like higher tax rate and so on. But guidance for this year is only 9.9%, less than 10% above 2011. Actually, it's a little bit higher than the consensus, which was looking for a 9.5% increase. So it's not a big surprise. But one of the reasons could be that you didn't make very many big acquisitions last year, so you have to depend more on the organic growth this year. But also, are there any big headwinds -- could you just go over the things that made last year above average and might be responsible for making this year below average in terms of EPS growth? Because, I think, investors are kind of looking for a continuation of the long-term trend, which is about 20%."

In the next 3 years, good heavens, we're given one year guidance at $650 million, so it's obviously -- we'd expect well over $2 billion in cash in the next 3 years so that it's easy to see how that appearing. When that does, you'll get a lot more revenue, so the overall revenue will be going up. So in any one year, you can't look at a step change, you have to look at it what it is over time. We don't see any disruption in any long-term trends around Roper. We're just going to continue to have compound growth that's favorable. It just doesn't look like organic growth on an acquisition until a year later."

Our organic growth in the fourth quarter, I think, is best-in-class. Our projection around organic growth for 2012, I haven't seen anybody projecting 8% or more. So if we were simply at the high end of our organic growth and we captured the kind of leverage we expect to capture, we have more or like 13% diluted earnings per share year-over-year variance, Alex. And that's without acquisitions. So I don't think we're going through the year without acquisitions. So if you said, ""Can you get several points out of our earnings related to acquisitions?"" The answer is yes. So I don't think -- to go back over all those things that were favorable, we kind of -- we're doing that in the slides. If you look at our statement going into '12, we aren't really describing any deterioration. And all you're doing is having a slower rate of organic growth based on abysmal global GDP forecast and fears that people have in Europe. So we're hoping not to participate in those negatives."

We've got a few things that affect us there in RF because we have that headwind around the Gaz de France project.

We'll go through the segment detail in terms of how we see 2012 by segment, talk about our guidance for the coming year and then open it up for Q&A. 
So next slide here would be an overview of the fourth quarter. It was an all-time record quarter for us for any quarter in the history of the company. And we had the most revenue, the most net earnings, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, operating and free cash flow. 
Total sales were up 9%, organic sales were up 7%. Frankly better organic sales growth than we would have expected back 6 or 7 months ago. So things still look pretty favorable in that arena. Gross margins were up to 54.9%, demonstrating that we're certainly not under a lot of a price pressure in the marketplace, and then everything we're doing continues to work exceptionally well. EBITDA was $222 million in the quarter, which is beyond a spectacular number in our opinion. EBITDA margins were 30.1%. It's certainly a milestone for Roper. It speaks to the quality of the businesses that we have. 
Our earnings in the quarter were $1.23. We talked about that in the income statement here, up from $1.10 last year. Fourth quarter and operating cash flow was another sort of a spectacular $193 million in the quarter. That represented 158% of net earnings on a conversion basis and represented 26% of sales. Free cash flow was $181 million. Same story, 149% of net earnings here for conversions. So it was quite a strong finish in the fourth quarter to what was a historic year for us. 
Next slide. Here if we look at the fourth quarter income statement, you'll see bookings were basically flat. There are couple of reasons for that. The fourth quarter last year, our orders were up 23% over the prior year, so it was an exceptionally unusual and difficult comp. And we had 3 things happen that we detailed. Last year, we had quite a substantial Mexican order for Neptune that tends to be a nonrecurring type of item when those happen. Some unique shipments in the camera arena around some specific CapEx that was going on in China. And then we had a Gaz de France project largely booked and that was completed in the fourth quarter of this year. So those were unusual headwinds that exceeded $30 million. 
The backlog is up though, as you can see, by 5.5%. So backlog was $828 million, which is an all-time record for our year-ending backlog number for us. Net sales were up 9%, 7% organic. Gross profit, as we covered, was up 20 bps. Operating income at $187 million was up 13% and operating margin was at above 25% here, up 80 bps in the quarter. 
You can see the tax rate was actually a little bit of a negative headwind for us in the quarter compared to last year. We had a particularly favorable tax rate in Q4 last year, 27.7% for us, and the fourth quarter this year was 29%. So that cost us $0.02 a share. Nonetheless, we still are in at $1.23 on DEPS.
Next slide. If you'll look at fourth quarter cash flow, it's, for us, kind of just a breathtaking accomplishment. $193 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, and that's up dramatically. Last year, our record year was $155 million. And if you'll look at fourth quarter 2009, it was $120 million. So we just continue to pileup the cash. And if you look at the variances, it's up 24%, as you can see on this slide, from the fourth quarter a year ago, and 61% from 2009. 
Next slide. Here we'll start to look at the full year enterprise results. Next slide. We again achieved a record result on an annual basis, as well as a quarter. On an annual basis it just, again, includes everything in the kitchen sink here: historic levels of orders, backlog sales, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow. 
Sales for the year were up 17%. Organic growth for 2011 was 13%. Remember, when we established guidance at the beginning of the year, we thought organic growth might be 9% to 11%, so it came in substantially stronger than we had expected. Gross margin was up 80 bps to 54.2%, operating margin up 200 bps to 23.6%, which is really an incredible achievement for all of our 28 P&Ls around the world that are so terrifically focused on margin and cash and growth. 
Our EBITDA for the year was up $164 million to $802 million. By the way, we had a remeasurement gain in the second quarter, and we're excluding that from this $802 million number. Otherwise it would have been $809 million, but that's a nonrecurring item. The EBITDA margin expanded to 28.7% for the full year and operating cash flow for the full year was $602 million or 22% of revenue. Free cash flow at $561 million was 20% of sales. So another terrific year for the Roper family of businesses. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at the full year income statement, you'll see bookings were up 11% on the year. Net sales up 17%, organic 13%. Gross margin up 80 bps, operating margin up 200 bps, as we said. 
Tax rate on the year came in at 29.4, which was a 130 bps headwinds compared to the prior year. So that cost us $0.08 a share. Despite that, we've reported DEPS of $4.34. And the one thing we point out there, again, is that remeasurement gain is in the GAAP number at $4.34. 
Next slide. Here if we look at our EBITDA growth, you can see the trends and performance in terms of capturing our gross margins in the form of EBITDA for our investors. We had EBITDA of $802 million as we mentioned, which is up $300 million from 2 years ago. Our EBITDA margins 2 years ago were 24.5%. And  common questions to us always are, ""How are you ever going to keep those margins? They've got to degrade. Nobody can have a margins like this. They're going to regress to some artificial mean that S&P 500 companies are stuck with."" But that's not the case here. As you can see our margins went up from 24.5% to 26.7% last year, and just continued forward at 28.7% this year. That's a 420 basis point improvement in just 2 years in our EBITDA margins. 
Next slide. Our full year cash flow, again, tells the story of Roper's business model. $602 million in operating cash flow, representing 22% of revenue. Free cash flow, 20% of revenue. A terrific execution throughout the enterprise. Networking capital, still, in our definition of inventory receivables less payables and accruals is like 6% or less. So just spectacular performance from the field here. And you can see that trend up from $367 million of operating cash flow in '09 to $500 million to $602 million, and we're forecasting continued growth in 2012. 
Next slide. We have a really terrific balance sheet. We closed out the year in a very strong position. You can see cash was up $68 million to $338 million. Our undrawn revolver is totally undrawn at $750 million. Last year it was -- we had $520 million. And we get the benefit of trailing EBITDA coming up at $802 million. Last year it was $638 million. So we when you think about all those kind of investment-grade characteristics and multiply it times EBITDA and you look at the power that we have, we've got really a spectacular balance sheet. 
Gross debt to capitalization is 25.4%. And when you look at the net debt number, we have about $1,085,000,000 in gross debt. With the $338 million in cash, you'd have net debt of $747 million against $802 million of trailing EBITDA. So it goes without saying that 2012 is likely going to be a strongly above average acquisition year for Roper, and we're very excited about our prospects in that arena. 
Next slide. Here we'll get into the individual segments. All of them are just faithfully executing the business models so that they drive. And you can see there's just no softness anywhere inside the full year activity. RF Technology's sales were up 17%, operating profit up 35% and margins up 300 bps. Industrial Technology was up 21%, OP up 29% and margins up 150. And boy, when you're up 150 and you show [ph] 28.2% OP margin for industrial flow control businesses, I can't take my hat off enough to the quality of people we have and the niches we've chosen to serve. 
Medical & Scientific Imaging sales were up 11%, OP was up 14% and margins were up 50. And then Energy Systems & Controls was up 19%, with OP up 31% and margins up to 50. Overall, the team produced 13% organic growth. They feel quite good about going into 2012. And the broad-based margin expansion we enjoyed this year, we think will continue next year. 
Next slide. So here we'll look with the smallest segment as a function of the total up 21% is Medical & Scientific Imaging. They had an unusual fourth quarter, just mathematically we'll talk about. But really, the story is the Medical growth continues with an even better prospects at Northern Digital than we originally identified. We've got significant OEM business that we believe is coming online in 2012. 
We had organic sales decline in the fourth quarter, really, caused by 2 primary events. We had lower camera sales for a -- an original equipment manufacturing videoconferencing series of things that go on with 1 particular large client and they were in decline this past year, and the fourth quarter really brought that to a head. And then our Rugged Mobile computer shipments, which we rarely talk about because it's certainly not the key to our Medical or Scientific Imaging businesses. But they enjoyed unusual activity in the fourth quarter last year with their Rugged Mobile applications and the certain overnight shipping arrangements, and those are really waned this year in the fourth quarter. 
We had very strong margin performance in the fourth quarter against an all-time record last year in the fourth quarter. So we wound up with 25% OP in the fourth quarter. For the full year, you can see sales were up 11%, OP 14% and margin up 50. 
As we look to 2012, what we see in the segment is that Medical growth we expect to continue. We have several new product launches that are occuring, generally starting in Europe and then coming into North America. We expect those to provide a lift in the second half of the year. We'll get the benefit of some growth from the Northern Digital acquisition in the first part of the year, and then it will turn into organic growth in the second. But we expect a very strong first quarter from Northern Digital. 
We've got significant backlog in the Scientific Imaging arena that supports modest growth for the year. It certainly going to be, probably, the low point of 2012 organic growth for Roper. But that said, given fears around research funding, as we've gone through our planning reviews with people, people seem reasonably confident. And certainly the physical science aspect of this looks better than the molecular and biological aspect does. But on balance, it should be a net gain for us in 2012. And we are confident we're going to have margin expansion from growth in the other arenas. 
Next slide. If we look at the Energy Systems & Controls. Here you can see just virtually all the divisions here, with the exception of Zetec's nuclear steam gen activity, have had very strong growth across the segment. They all have record margin performance. We continue to get our diesel engine shut-off systems that we've talked about frequently, continue to grow at a very rapid pace. We don't see any pullback in that area. We have had record results, really, for Compressor Controls and -- primarily due to the continuing expansion of projects around the world. And you can see for the full year, our revenue was up 19%, OP up 31% and margin up 250. To have OP in the fourth quarter at 30.5% is really quite substantial performance. 
If you look at 2012, we don't really see any headwinds here. We would expect that this segment ought to grow the fastest of our 4 segments in 2012. It's got major drivers, none of which are waning in any way with the oil and gas markets remaining favorable. Compressor Controls has a backlog that assures its success for the year. And the bolt-on acquisitions, which we haven't talked a lot about because they're small, United Controls down earlier this year, gives us access to very substantial OEMs that we haven't been involved within the past. 
Trinity, is a software company in the U.K. that's just coming onboard now. It's a modest revenue but it gives us a lot of technology and can allow us to get Compressor Control even more and better than software activity. And then Hao Ying is a Chinese company. It's our first Chinese acquisition that we acquired for Dynisco. Dynisco is enjoying very nice growth. Probably everyone is aware of that tire manufacturing CapEx is doing well. And the things that Hao Ying can do for us in China are similar to what we do in the U.S. We have a lot of new products coming online and having our own in-house manufacturing capability and distribution channel reach directly in China for the rubber industry is quite useful for us. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at Industrial Technology, the fourth quarter was up 20% in sales, 25% in OP, margins at 29.2%. Let's not be confused, those are not gross margins of an industrial company, those are the operating margins of our flow control businesses. Fluid handling, very rapid growth from new customers expanding oil and gas markets here. Certainly, fracking is driving a significant portion of our growth. 
A very important indicator for us, our Material Test business that's headquartered in Denmark, along with the Dynisco business I just mentioned, were 2 of 3 indicators that late in 2008 about the downturn for '09 that people are going to experience. And they finished the fourth quarter at a very strong rate, up over 20%. Dynisco finished very strong as well. So we haven't seen any sign of any deterioration in forward activity. 
Neptune is continuing to grow in the U.S., despite the concerns that we and others would have had about the municipal market. And the fourth quarter was -- it was favorable for Neptune. And we delivered both growth and execution with these record margins. Full year, you can see sort of similar, 20% in the fourth quarter, 21% for the year, OP up 29% and margin up 150 basis points. 
For this coming year, we really don't see anything that's going to arrest the trend, the major drivers. We get a big benefit from the Toronto project at Neptune, which will roll out more rapidly in 2012 than it did in '11. We don't see any pullback in any of our flow control businesses. And then we have new products in Material Test that ought to allow that continue to grow. So we think it'll do nicely in the high end of any range we've established for organic growth. 
Then we look at the RF Technology business. And here in the fourth quarter, we had sales up 4%, OP up 12% and a significant margin improvement up 190 bps. The organic was flatter than -- it was far better than what it looked here because we had the completion of the France -- Gaz de France automatic meter reading project, which was completed. So from a revenue view point, it helped us all year but in the prior year it had been in the bookings. So that was a certain artificial headwind on a comparative basis. 
We had very strong toll tag shipments that offset somewhat less project work in tolling in the fourth quarter. But we continue to have growth in our Software-as-a-Service subscription and software maintenance businesses. We had, really, a terrific contribution throughout the year from our college campus software and integrated security solutions out of CBORD. They accounted for a significant portion of our growth in the full year. 
And importantly, you can see that full year sales growth for RF was up 17%, OP up 35% and margin up 300. And we're encouraged about margins in general in RF. So when we look to 2012, what we see is continued growth in the software and SaaS businesses that we have. We think toll project and maintenance growth will be stronger next year, while tag shipments will be lower. 
We have this headwind that we have to get through with the Gaz de France project that won't reoccur, although we'll have ongoing service with it. So that will be a drag into 2012. But the operating margin expansion that we expect to see by having the software businesses becoming a bigger portion of the segment, and the backlog that we have in this segment gives us confidence that we'll produce both more cash and operating profit in 2012 in RF. 
Next slide. Here, as we get into the 2012 guidance -- next slide. The full year guidance for us is $467 million to $487 million, and the assumptions around that is that organic growth would be up from a 5% at the low end of the range to 8% or more at the high end of the range. Last year, we said 7% to -- or 9% to 11%, I believe. This year, 5% to 8%, given all the uncertainty in the world, seems like a rational approach to this. 
We're assuming currency is the same as it was at January 31, 2012. The tax rate, we're assuming is going to be about 30%. Share count creeps up a little bit from 98.5 million diluted shares to 99.5 million. First quarter we'd see coming in between $1.01 and $1.05, and full year operating cash flow should exceed $650 million in 2012. I'm sure some people worry that we haven't commented much about Europe in here. It's not overly significant for us. We don't see much difficulty in Europe. Our businesses there are often exporters to emerging markets, so we remain pretty comfortable with what's happening in Europe. 
Next slide. If you'll look at the 2011 summary then, we had an all-time performance record for orders and sales, net earnings, cash flow and EBITDA. We had terrific margin leverage. And when we looked back on the year, one of the things that I didn't cover that's worth really talking about in the income statement is, if we look at the difference, we were up -- operating income reached $661 million, up from $514 million. So that's $147 million up in operating income, while sales were up by $411 million. So you take that $147 million OP and divide it by an incremental $411 million in net sales, you get operating profit leverage of 36%. So our leverage is still world-class, and we expect that to continue in 2012. 
Operating cash flow at $602 million speaks for itself, 20% free cash flow to sales. I don't think you can find people doing that. And our family of businesses and our end markets are continuing to look quite reasonable for 2012. So we expect to have another record year in 2012, and we certainly are off to a good start. So with that, John, I think we're open for questions."

So we're largely indifferent to that. And also, remember, an awful lot of this is about building the base and expanding into some channels that we hadn't been before.

So we get a whole lot of several year out from new CapEx activity, where people want to see us deploy better technology for their controls than perhaps they had in the original purchase. It's just a phenomenon that's not unusual. So people who are looking for productivity or more throughput or less consumption in the gas and the pipeline frequently are going to choose us. That business -- we've really become quite effective in distribution channels around the world and we're sort of growing in China as well. So we really have -- anybody who wants to have LNG operations that are as efficient as possible in getting the least consumption of gas inside their gas turbines is likely to look to us as a solution provider. That reputation just continues to build. So from an aftermarket perspective, the projects that we get a bid on -- I mean, it would be not the least bit unusual for us to have 6 months of backlog at Compressor Control and known service work that's going to fill things up. So in fact, we completely redesigned our Des Moines headquarters last year, created a much, much more engineering-oriented facility that gives people an opportunity to work in teams in a very different way. It's certainly among our most exciting businesses. We've got just world-class human resources in that business. We're at the early phases of our growth, frankly. And good heavens, if we got to exporting gas and LNG, it would be phenomenal what will happen to our business in that area."

The large Mexico City project that we revealed to people in industrial in fourth quarter from an order perspective. And then, obviously, it wouldn't repeat in the fourth quarter this year. So that alone explains most of the book to bill in industrial. And then RF is a lumpy situation. Book to bill in RF was weak at like 0.9 or something like that. But we're not really worried about that. We have huge backlog in RF and the non-toll project activity is quite robust going into 2012, so it's not much of a factor. If we had a poor book to bill in the first quarter, then we'd be talking more about that. But we're -- we wouldn't have established organic guidance at 5%, 8% or more if we are really worried about book to bill. But it's a fair thing to point out, because normally we would expect it to not be worse than 0.97. This time it was 0.94 but there were this 3 unusual events with cameras and Rugged Mobile and Mexico that aren't really core to the overall nature of activity.

There's big leverage to be able to drop in a new medical line into an existing sales force.

Then we have the technical sell around radiation oncology, which is a unique specific trade calling on a very small niche in a hospital and has to really be joined at the hip with the major OEM manufacturers that are involved in that equipment. And then we have the third sales force, which is the Verathon sales force, which is a more generic. But they're selling products that are in the thousands of dollars, not the hundreds of thousand of dollars. Not really CapEx for the most part. Those people have very specific people they call on. It's organized into an acute care activity and a private practice activity. It's easy for them to add things in those 2 areas. Increasingly we're investing outside the U.S. in channel presence, and that's doing really well. So it is certainly possible that we can do bolt-on acquisitions and take advantage of our existing sales force in that area. But we look at a lot of things in Medical and I have to say a number of things we look at are in software and medical and we find those to be exceptionally exciting."

Neil is an M&A pro, former CFO of a publicly traded company running the revenue business in Medical. Just a world-class guy. But we want to marry him up with a world-class software guy. We brought Joe Bergera in, who's worked for Wolters Kluwer and Sage for his career. Joe's a domain expert around architecture, platforms and software and trying to get our software leaders more capable of doing more bolt-ons and activities. So we have dramatically enhanced our internal capability to assimilate both software and medical companies, which we really needed to do. I think the rest of us here in Sarasota, we were only interested in doing transactions that brought world-class management teams and didn't take too much more of our time.

And that's started with the CCC, which by the way, I was happy to hear that you think you're still in the early phases of growth with CCC given that you acquired it almost 20 years ago. In September of 1992, it was $17 million in sales. So at this point, after 20 years, it's pretty impressive to be in the early phases of growth. But it's software-driven mainly, very -- equipment's only a small part of it. So going forward, are you really going to go into standalone software, or are you just going to continue to acquire equipment businesses that have a high component of software? Could you clarify that?"

We acquired another company called Getloaded, pure software. They have a link up in Canada of pure software. Certainly, a lot of acquisitions that were moving through the pipeline now are software-driven things. I think every once in a while, we'll look at an equipment business.

Neptune continued to do extremely well during the year, and they'll give continued benefit out of Toronto, but even excluding Toronto, they were up kind of in the mid-single digits in 2011 in the U.S, which I don't think most people looking at the municipal market would've expected something like that. So I think Neptune did a very nice job there. And then of course with the high degree of recurring revenue that comes out of our TransCore total entropic business, that is a business that will naturally kind of be in the mid-single digits, also. And that's kind of what it did in 2011. And then the variation that we see in that business is largely due to the timing of tag shipments based upon when customers are going to replenish their inventory. They've done a very nice job outside the U.S., our total entropic business has, with the expansion of electronic tolling opportunities in Puerto Rico, and continuing with the largest tolling project in the world in Dubai. So we have a nice global footprint there and a large installed base that gives us a lot of visibility and good recurring revenue."

So we'll walk you through briefly how the fourth quarter looked, what our full year enterprise results for 2011 were and what some of those implications are for positioning ourselves in 2012. We'll go through the segment detail in terms of how we see 2012 by segment, talk about our guidance for the coming year and then open it up for Q&A. 
So next slide here would be an overview of the fourth quarter. It was an all-time record quarter for us for any quarter in the history of the company. And we had the most revenue, the most net earnings, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, operating and free cash flow. 
Total sales were up 9%, organic sales were up 7%. Frankly better organic sales growth than we would have expected back 6 or 7 months ago. So things still look pretty favorable in that arena. Gross margins were up to 54.9%, demonstrating that we're certainly not under a lot of a price pressure in the marketplace, and then everything we're doing continues to work exceptionally well. EBITDA was $222 million in the quarter, which is beyond a spectacular number in our opinion. EBITDA margins were 30.1%. It's certainly a milestone for Roper. It speaks to the quality of the businesses that we have. 
Our earnings in the quarter were $1.23. We talked about that in the income statement here, up from $1.10 last year. Fourth quarter and operating cash flow was another sort of a spectacular $193 million in the quarter. That represented 158% of net earnings on a conversion basis and represented 26% of sales. Free cash flow was $181 million. Same story, 149% of net earnings here for conversions. So it was quite a strong finish in the fourth quarter to what was a historic year for us. 
Next slide. Here if we look at the fourth quarter income statement, you'll see bookings were basically flat. There are couple of reasons for that. The fourth quarter last year, our orders were up 23% over the prior year, so it was an exceptionally unusual and difficult comp. And we had 3 things happen that we detailed. Last year, we had quite a substantial Mexican order for Neptune that tends to be a nonrecurring type of item when those happen. Some unique shipments in the camera arena around some specific CapEx that was going on in China. And then we had a Gaz de France project largely booked and that was completed in the fourth quarter of this year. So those were unusual headwinds that exceeded $30 million. 
The backlog is up though, as you can see, by 5.5%. So backlog was $828 million, which is an all-time record for our year-ending backlog number for us. Net sales were up 9%, 7% organic. Gross profit, as we covered, was up 20 bps. Operating income at $187 million was up 13% and operating margin was at above 25% here, up 80 bps in the quarter. 
You can see the tax rate was actually a little bit of a negative headwind for us in the quarter compared to last year. We had a particularly favorable tax rate in Q4 last year, 27.7% for us, and the fourth quarter this year was 29%. So that cost us $0.02 a share. Nonetheless, we still are in at $1.23 on DEPS.
Next slide. If you'll look at fourth quarter cash flow, it's, for us, kind of just a breathtaking accomplishment. $193 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, and that's up dramatically. Last year, our record year was $155 million. And if you'll look at fourth quarter 2009, it was $120 million. So we just continue to pileup the cash. And if you look at the variances, it's up 24%, as you can see on this slide, from the fourth quarter a year ago, and 61% from 2009. 
Next slide. Here we'll start to look at the full year enterprise results. Next slide. We again achieved a record result on an annual basis, as well as a quarter. On an annual basis it just, again, includes everything in the kitchen sink here: historic levels of orders, backlog sales, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow. 
Sales for the year were up 17%. Organic growth for 2011 was 13%. Remember, when we established guidance at the beginning of the year, we thought organic growth might be 9% to 11%, so it came in substantially stronger than we had expected. Gross margin was up 80 bps to 54.2%, operating margin up 200 bps to 23.6%, which is really an incredible achievement for all of our 28 P&Ls around the world that are so terrifically focused on margin and cash and growth. 
Our EBITDA for the year was up $164 million to $802 million. By the way, we had a remeasurement gain in the second quarter, and we're excluding that from this $802 million number. Otherwise it would have been $809 million, but that's a nonrecurring item. The EBITDA margin expanded to 28.7% for the full year and operating cash flow for the full year was $602 million or 22% of revenue. Free cash flow at $561 million was 20% of sales. So another terrific year for the Roper family of businesses. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at the full year income statement, you'll see bookings were up 11% on the year. Net sales up 17%, organic 13%. Gross margin up 80 bps, operating margin up 200 bps, as we said. 
Tax rate on the year came in at 29.4, which was a 130 bps headwinds compared to the prior year. So that cost us $0.08 a share. Despite that, we've reported DEPS of $4.34. And the one thing we point out there, again, is that remeasurement gain is in the GAAP number at $4.34. 
Next slide. Here if we look at our EBITDA growth, you can see the trends and performance in terms of capturing our gross margins in the form of EBITDA for our investors. We had EBITDA of $802 million as we mentioned, which is up $300 million from 2 years ago. Our EBITDA margins 2 years ago were 24.5%. And  common questions to us always are, ""How are you ever going to keep those margins? They've got to degrade. Nobody can have a margins like this. They're going to regress to some artificial mean that S&P 500 companies are stuck with."" But that's not the case here. As you can see our margins went up from 24.5% to 26.7% last year, and just continued forward at 28.7% this year. That's a 420 basis point improvement in just 2 years in our EBITDA margins. 
Next slide. Our full year cash flow, again, tells the story of Roper's business model. $602 million in operating cash flow, representing 22% of revenue. Free cash flow, 20% of revenue. A terrific execution throughout the enterprise. Networking capital, still, in our definition of inventory receivables less payables and accruals is like 6% or less. So just spectacular performance from the field here. And you can see that trend up from $367 million of operating cash flow in '09 to $500 million to $602 million, and we're forecasting continued growth in 2012. 
Next slide. We have a really terrific balance sheet. We closed out the year in a very strong position. You can see cash was up $68 million to $338 million. Our undrawn revolver is totally undrawn at $750 million. Last year it was -- we had $520 million. And we get the benefit of trailing EBITDA coming up at $802 million. Last year it was $638 million. So we when you think about all those kind of investment-grade characteristics and multiply it times EBITDA and you look at the power that we have, we've got really a spectacular balance sheet. 
Gross debt to capitalization is 25.4%. And when you look at the net debt number, we have about $1,085,000,000 in gross debt. With the $338 million in cash, you'd have net debt of $747 million against $802 million of trailing EBITDA. So it goes without saying that 2012 is likely going to be a strongly above average acquisition year for Roper, and we're very excited about our prospects in that arena. 
Next slide. Here we'll get into the individual segments. All of them are just faithfully executing the business models so that they drive. And you can see there's just no softness anywhere inside the full year activity. RF Technology's sales were up 17%, operating profit up 35% and margins up 300 bps. Industrial Technology was up 21%, OP up 29% and margins up 150. And boy, when you're up 150 and you show [ph] 28.2% OP margin for industrial flow control businesses, I can't take my hat off enough to the quality of people we have and the niches we've chosen to serve. 
Medical & Scientific Imaging sales were up 11%, OP was up 14% and margins were up 50. And then Energy Systems & Controls was up 19%, with OP up 31% and margins up to 50. Overall, the team produced 13% organic growth. They feel quite good about going into 2012. And the broad-based margin expansion we enjoyed this year, we think will continue next year. 
Next slide. So here we'll look with the smallest segment as a function of the total up 21% is Medical & Scientific Imaging. They had an unusual fourth quarter, just mathematically we'll talk about. But really, the story is the Medical growth continues with an even better prospects at Northern Digital than we originally identified. We've got significant OEM business that we believe is coming online in 2012. 
We had organic sales decline in the fourth quarter, really, caused by 2 primary events. We had lower camera sales for a -- an original equipment manufacturing videoconferencing series of things that go on with 1 particular large client and they were in decline this past year, and the fourth quarter really brought that to a head. And then our Rugged Mobile computer shipments, which we rarely talk about because it's certainly not the key to our Medical or Scientific Imaging businesses. But they enjoyed unusual activity in the fourth quarter last year with their Rugged Mobile applications and the certain overnight shipping arrangements, and those are really waned this year in the fourth quarter. 
We had very strong margin performance in the fourth quarter against an all-time record last year in the fourth quarter. So we wound up with 25% OP in the fourth quarter. For the full year, you can see sales were up 11%, OP 14% and margin up 50. 
As we look to 2012, what we see in the segment is that Medical growth we expect to continue. We have several new product launches that are occurring, generally starting in Europe and then coming into North America. We expect those to provide a lift in the second half of the year. We'll get the benefit of some growth from the Northern Digital acquisition in the first part of the year, and then it will turn into organic growth in the second. But we expect a very strong first quarter from Northern Digital. 
We've got significant backlog in the Scientific Imaging arena that supports modest growth for the year. It certainly going to be, probably, the low point of 2012 organic growth for Roper. But that said, given fears around research funding, as we've gone through our planning reviews with people, people seem reasonably confident. And certainly the physical science aspect of this looks better than the molecular and biological aspect does. But on balance, it should be a net gain for us in 2012. And we are confident we're going to have margin expansion from growth in the other arenas. 
Next slide. If we look at the Energy Systems & Controls. Here you can see just virtually all the divisions here, with the exception of Zetec's nuclear steam gen activity, have had very strong growth across the segment. They all have record margin performance. We continue to get our diesel engine shut-off systems that we've talked about frequently, continue to grow at a very rapid pace. We don't see any pullback in that area. We have had record results, really, for Compressor Controls and -- primarily due to the continuing expansion of projects around the world. And you can see for the full year, our revenue was up 19%, OP up 31% and margin up 250. To have OP in the fourth quarter at 30.5% is really quite substantial performance. 
If you look at 2012, we don't really see any headwinds here. We would expect that this segment ought to grow the fastest of our 4 segments in 2012. It's got major drivers, none of which are waning in any way with the oil and gas markets remaining favorable. Compressor Controls has a backlog that assures its success for the year. And the bolt-on acquisitions, which we haven't talked a lot about because they're small, United Controls down earlier this year, gives us access to very substantial OEMs that we haven't been involved within the past. 
Trinity, is a software company in the U.K. that's just coming onboard now. It's a modest revenue but it gives us a lot of technology and can allow us to get Compressor Control even more and better than software activity. And then Hao Ying is a Chinese company. It's our first Chinese acquisition that we acquired for Dynisco. Dynisco is enjoying very nice growth. Probably everyone is aware of that tire manufacturing CapEx is doing well. And the things that Hao Ying can do for us in China are similar to what we do in the U.S. We have a lot of new products coming online and having our own in-house manufacturing capability and distribution channel reach directly in China for the rubber industry is quite useful for us. 
Next slide. Here, if we look at Industrial Technology, the fourth quarter was up 20% in sales, 25% in OP, margins at 29.2%. Let's not be confused, those are not gross margins of an industrial company, those are the operating margins of our flow control businesses. Fluid handling, very rapid growth from new customers expanding oil and gas markets here. Certainly, frac-ing is driving a significant portion of our growth. 
A very important indicator for us, our Material Test business that's headquartered in Denmark, along with the Dynisco business I just mentioned, were 2 of 3 indicators that late in 2008 about the downturn for '09 that people are going to experience. And they finished the fourth quarter at a very strong rate, up over 20%. Dynisco finished very strong as well. So we haven't seen any sign of any deterioration in forward activity. 
Neptune is continuing to grow in the U.S., despite the concerns that we and others would have had about the municipal market. And the fourth quarter was -- it was favorable for Neptune. And we delivered both growth and execution with these record margins. Full year, you can see sort of similar, 20% in the fourth quarter, 21% for the year, OP up 29% and margin up 150 basis points. 
For this coming year, we really don't see anything that's going to arrest the trend, the major drivers. We get a big benefit from the Toronto project at Neptune, which will roll out more rapidly in 2012 than it did in '11. We don't see any pullback in any of our flow control businesses. And then we have new products in Material Test that ought to allow that continue to grow. So we think it'll do nicely in the high end of any range we've established for organic growth. 
Then we look at the RF Technology business. And here in the fourth quarter, we had sales up 4%, OP up 12% and a significant margin improvement up 190 bps. The organic was flatter than -- it was far better than what it looked here because we had the completion of the France -- Gaz de France automatic meter reading project, which was completed. So from a revenue view point, it helped us all year but in the prior year it had been in the bookings. So that was a certain artificial headwind on a comparative basis. 
We had very strong toll tag shipments that offset somewhat less project work in tolling in the fourth quarter. But we continue to have growth in our Software-as-a-Service subscription and software maintenance businesses. We had, really, a terrific contribution throughout the year from our college campus software and integrated security solutions out of CBORD. They accounted for a significant portion of our growth in the full year. 
And importantly, you can see that full year sales growth for RF was up 17%, OP up 35% and margin up 300. And we're encouraged about margins in general in RF. So when we look to 2012, what we see is continued growth in the software and SaaS businesses that we have. We think toll project and maintenance growth will be stronger next year, while tag shipments will be lower. 
We have this headwind that we have to get through with the Gaz de France project that won't reoccur, although we'll have ongoing service with it. So that will be a drag into 2012. But the operating margin expansion that we expect to see by having the software businesses becoming a bigger portion of the segment, and the backlog that we have in this segment gives us confidence that we'll produce both more cash and operating profit in 2012 in RF. 
Next slide. Here, as we get into the 2012 guidance -- next slide. The full year guidance for us is $467 million to $487 million, and the assumptions around that is that organic growth would be up from a 5% at the low end of the range to 8% or more at the high end of the range. Last year, we said 7% to -- or 9% to 11%, I believe. This year, 5% to 8%, given all the uncertainty in the world, seems like a rational approach to this. 
We're assuming currency is the same as it was at January 31, 2012. The tax rate, we're assuming is going to be about 30%. Share count creeps up a little bit from 98.5 million diluted shares to 99.5 million. First quarter we'd see coming in between $1.01 and $1.05, and full year operating cash flow should exceed $650 million in 2012. I'm sure some people worry that we haven't commented much about Europe in here. It's not overly significant for us. We don't see much difficulty in Europe. Our businesses there are often exporters to emerging markets, so we remain pretty comfortable with what's happening in Europe. 
Next slide. If you'll look at the 2011 summary then, we had an all-time performance record for orders and sales, net earnings, cash flow and EBITDA. We had terrific margin leverage. And when we looked back on the year, one of the things that I didn't cover that's worth really talking about in the income statement is, if we look at the difference, we were up -- operating income reached $661 million, up from $514 million. So that's $147 million up in operating income, while sales were up by $411 million. So you take that $147 million OP and divide it by an incremental $411 million in net sales, you get operating profit leverage of 36%. So our leverage is still world-class, and we expect that to continue in 2012. 
Operating cash flow at $602 million speaks for itself, 20% free cash flow to sales. I don't think you can find people doing that. And our family of businesses and our end markets are continuing to look quite reasonable for 2012. So we expect to have another record year in 2012, and we certainly are off to a good start. So with that, John, I think we're open for questions."

So we get a whole lot of several year out from new CapEx activity, where people want to see us deploy better technology for their controls than perhaps they had in the original purchase. It's just a phenomenon that's not unusual. So people who are looking for productivity or more throughput or less consumption in the gas and the pipeline frequently are going to choose us. That business -- we've really become quite effective in distribution channels around the world and we're sort of growing in China as well. So we really have -- anybody who wants to have LNG operations that are as efficient as possible in getting the least consumption of gas inside their gas turbines is likely to look to us as a solution provider. That reputation just continues to build. So from an aftermarket perspective, the projects that we get a bid on -- I mean, it would be not the least bit unusual for us to have 6 months of backlog at Compressor Control and known service work that's going to fill things up. So in fact, we completely redesigned our Des Moines headquarters last year, created a much, much more engineering-oriented facility that gives people an opportunity to work in teams in a very different way. It's certainly among our most exciting businesses. We've got just world-class human resources in that business. We're at the early phases of our growth, frankly.

And then we have the third sales force, which is the Verathon sales force, which is a more generic. But they're selling products that are in the thousands of dollars, not the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Not really CapEx for the most part. Those people have very specific people they call on. It's organized into an acute care activity and a private practice activity. It's easy for them to add things in those 2 areas. Increasingly we're investing outside the U.S. in channel presence, and that's doing really well.

But one of the reasons could be that you didn't make very many big acquisitions last year, so you have to depend more on your organic growth this year. But also, are there any big headwinds that you're -- could you just go over the things that made last year above average and might be responsible for making this year below average in terms of EPS growth? Because, I think, investors are kind of looking for a continuation of the long-term trend, which is about 20%."

When that does, you'll get a lot more revenue, so the overall revenue will be going up. So in any one year, you can't look at a step change, you have to look at it -- what it is over time. We don't see any disruption in any long-term trends around Roper. We're just going to continue to have compound growth that's favorable. It just doesn't look like organic growth on an acquisition until a year later."

Our organic growth in the fourth quarter, I think, is best-in-class. Our projection around organic growth for 2012 -- I haven't seen anybody projecting 8% or more. So if we were simply at the high end of our organic growth and we capture the kind of leverage we expect to capture, we have more like 13% diluted earnings per share year-over-year variance, Alex. And that's without acquisitions. I don't think we're going through the year without acquisitions. So if you said, ""Can you get several points out of earnings related to acquisitions,"" the answer is yes. So yes, I don't think it's -- to go back over all those things that were favorable, we kind of -- we're doing that in the slides. If you look at our statements going into '12, we aren't really describing any deterioration. All you're doing is having a slower rate of organic growth based on an abysmal global GDP forecast and fears people have in Europe. So we're hoping not to participate in those negatives."

And that's kind of what it did in 2011. And then the variation that we see in that business is largely due to the timing of tag shipments based upon when customers are going to replenish their inventory. They've done a very nice job outside the U.S., our total entropic business has, with the expansion of electronic tolling opportunities in Puerto Rico, and continuing with the largest tolling project in the world in Dubai.

We'll update you on our established guidance for the second quarter and our full year guidance and then take your questions. So next slide, please.
The first quarter here was another spectacular quarter. We achieved all-time records for revenue, orders, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow in the quarter. Total sales were up 10% and, importantly, organic revenue was up 8%. Our book-to-bill ratio was above 1 at a strong 1.03. Gross margin reached 55%, which is really quite remarkable. And our operating margin leverage was spectacular and the quarter operating margins were up 200 basis points to 24%, and our incremental operating margins were 43% in the first quarter. We closed out the quarter with $205 million in EBITDA and an EBITDA margin of 28.9%. The diluted earnings per share were up 20% to $1.09. More importantly, the free cash flow was up 69% to $131 million in the quarter. It is an all-time record first quarter for us and a great start for 2012.
Next slide. Our first quarter income statement, you can see here at the revenue was up 10%, 8% organic and book-to-bill at 1.03. Gross profit up another 70 basis points to 55%. Operating margins up -- operating income was up 20%. Tax rate was a little bit higher than the first quarter of a year ago, 40 basis points higher, which cost us $0.01. Still net earnings were up 22%, and you can see the slide at 1.09.
Next slide. We had terrific EBITDA growth in the quarter. And if you just continue to look at our trend, you can see on this chart our trailing 12-month EBITDA now is $830 million, up from $685 million last year on a trailing 12-month basis and $519 million on a trailing basis at the end of Q1 2010. So we've added 60% to our EBITDA in just the last 2 years. And our EBITDA margins on a trailing basis are up 400 basis points from 25% in 2010 to 29% in 2012. People from time to time investors ask when are you going to have that deterioration in margin, our plan would be never. We were just going to continue to move up that line because of the culture and focus we have here.
Next slide. Q1 cash flow, you can see another blowout kind of a quarter here. Our cash conversion was very strong. We had $141 million in operating cash flow, which was $0.20 of every dollar of revenue. The conversion on that 131% of net earnings. We invested about $10 million in capital in the quarter, which was 1.4% of revenue right within our kind of 1.2% to 1.6% of revenue plans. So free cash flow was $131 million, 18% of revenue, and the conversion 121, a remarkable performance against last year's first quarter where we had $78 million of free cash flow last year in the first quarter and $131 million this year in the quarter.
Next slide. Our asset velocity continues to improve. I know people keep saying it can't be done, it won't get better, but it does get better. If you look at the same period, inventories now down to 7.5%. Receivables actually dropped down to 14.5%, payables and accruals 14.9%. So our inventory plus receivables less payables and accruals lows closed out at 7.1%. And if you look at the trend in 2009, it was 9.6%, finally breaking below 10%, and people would ask us if you could get any better and the answer is, oh, yes, you can get better. 250 basis points improvement over that 3-year period closing out at 7.1%, very exceptional performance.
Next slide. Balance sheet is pretty strong here. Cash, if we look at a year-ago, we had $261 million of cash, and we closed out this quarter with $452 million of cash. We had drawn a little bit against our revolver, which has $750 million in capacity this time a year ago. Now our undrawn revolver is just that we don't have any drawn against it, so it take that cash and the undrawn revolver and you get a little over $1.2 billion. 
Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is now up to $830 million, quite a substantial increase over the trailing EBITDA at this point in 2011. So it of course has a very dramatic positive effect on all of our credit status. Our gross debt is less than it was a year ago, and our shareholder equity has increased by $450 million in the year from $2,882,000,000 to $3,332,000,000 which then brings down the gross debt to cap number from 30% to 24.4% and gives us a gross debt to EBITDA line at 1.3. You can kind of do the math on the net debt to EBITDA line, and you'll come up with quite a remarkable number. 
Segment details here in the next slide. Really all of the segments had extraordinary performance. They all had double-digit growth in operating profit. Next slide, we'll start with the RF segment. Revenue was up 2% but operating profit was up 12%. Operating margin was 24.6% for our RF of 220 basis points. And they finished the quarter with a gross margin of 52%. They had very strong leverage in higher-margin areas obviously when revenues up to and OP up 12%. We certainly had a headwind on that revenue line because the gas to fronts project which was in 2011 was substantial in Q1 and quite substantial in Q2 was completed last year. So we don't have anything other than administrative revenue associated with that now, which makes tough comps for RF a little bit difficult first couple of quarters of this year. We continue to have expansion in both the security and cashless payment systems that we have for higher education that drove substantial growth in the software platform. And then our SaaS-based solution networks have added subscribers both in our freight systems area and our food service areas and our European expansion continued. Our total entropic traffic service business was led by electronic tolling conversion we're doing in Puerto Rico that adds to our growth and offsets the sort of weakness in other areas around transportation. 
For the rest of 2012, we have fighting as particularly Q2 the Gaz de France project, which is completed. That takes some revenue away, makes for difficult comp. Our toll project activity in the last year second quarter was a record and the last 3 years and quite disproportionate to the rest of the year. So that's a difficult comp. That said, we'll still perform better because of the strength of the rest of the businesses in the RF segment. We expect to have continued growth in software and the SaaS network businesses, particularly in the campus area and the growth of subscribers in our network.
Next slide. Industrial Technology, here, you can see revenue was up double digits at 15%, operating profit was up 25% and our OP margins really are spectacular at 29.5% OP. Compared at the most people's gross margins, that's really quite a remarkable achievement, 29.5% OP, up 230 basis points. Our gross margins in the segment were 51%. 
In the quarter, fluid handling was very strong once again as we continue to gain share in the oil and gas industry with the shale activity that's going on. We have a variety of new products there going into agricultural applications around irrigation, and those are doing very well, and then we've had some pumping activity we do in the transport industrial, which was quite strong in the quarter as well. 
The Toronto water meter project is kind of moving ahead as planned, which gave us some growth in the first quarter. And then the U.S. municipal market in Q1 was relatively strong for Neptune. We have a significant increase in our material analysis equipment and consumables business in Denmark, as industrial production around the world continues to expand that business, continues to have double-digit growth. And the margins in the quarter, as I said, really, were remarkable. It's an all-time record OP margin for us, which is coming from capturing a leverage off of the growth. For the remainder of the year in 2012, with segment backlog is quite strong, and that supports continued growth even if orders were to moderate. And the industrial and shale and markets remain quite favorable to us. And these outstanding margins that we captured in the first quarter, we believe that the things we've done to get better margins are sustainable and will continue throughout 2012 at these higher levels.
Next slide. In the Medical & Scientific Imaging segment, here, you've got revenue growth again double-digit at 12%, OP growth at 24%, operating margin up 250 basis points to 26.6%. We were benefited by having Northern Digital in the first quarter, which delivered exactly what we expected out of them on the revenue side and even better margins. We've had a very, very strong first quarter with it and and the electron microscopy arena, these end markets are pretty good, and we've recently introduced some products there in the last 15 months, which are continuing to grow and add to enhance strength. Our medical expansion internationally continued in the quarter, gave us some growth as well. And then this margin performance that we've gotten from the operating leverage here in Medical really was terrific, and it offset what otherwise would've been a tough first quarter because North American research funding has been quite soft in the Life Science area around our photonics camera businesses was weak. 
For the second quarter, we'll have some continued weakness around those North American research markets. We don't see that ticking up, but it may get better than it was in the first quarter. We expect to continue to grow the Medical business. We are experiencing an increase in consumables as we think organic share in the end markets are favorable in each of the product categories that we participate. 
Northern Digital in the second half of the year will become organic for us, and that will help organic growth profile and the backlog, which is quite heavy we'd like to see that shipments improve in Q2 but they certainly are going to improve strongly in the second half of the year gives us confidence for the full year as a whole.
Next slide. Gross margins I guess I can say were a modest 65% in Medical and Imaging in the quarter. 
Next slide, Energy Systems & Controls, same old story isn't it. Revenue up 15%, operating profit up 23%, OP margins 24%. Energy systems Q1 OP margins are usually the worst of the year, but these are pretty good at 24% but will improve. In the first quarter, our Compressor Controls business continued to grow nicely with projects in both LNG and upstream activities. The oil and gas markets continue to be very favorable to us, and our diesel engine safety shutoff systems in the valves that we provide both oil and gas in marine. Very good instrument sales for the petrochem refining markets and we acquired a small but important company called Cambridge Viscosity, which gives us online Internet capacity around measuring data. I asked John to talk a little bit about the small acquisition."

We just recently completed the Cambridge acquisition just within the last month of the quarter so they've been contributing awful lot. You can see it on a cash flow statement kind of the range that we paid there. But what this really provides is viscosity measurement for fluids, both in the oil area but also in the petrochemical. So it adds additional technology to our existing set a businesses there. And so Cambridge will be able to kind of come into an existing sales channel but also provides additional online work. So outside of the laboratory, into the process. So it's a nice fit both for us as well as for Cambridge and additional technology and they'll be able to benefit from our expanded reach and we'll be able to benefit from their technology. So I think it's a nice acquisition for us, will start to contribute in the second quarter and beyond."

We're going to have for the rest of the year double-digit growth, we believe. In energy we've got the record backlog at the moment, we have continuing strength in incoming orders and we've got favorable industrial and markets for our one",537,"Okay, thank you. We're going to have for the rest of the year double-digit growth, we believe. In energy we've got the record backlog at the moment, we have continuing strength in incoming orders and we've got favorable industrial and markets for our one business that kind of fits to the industrial area, Dynisco Business, and we expect that that should continue to be okay throughout the year. We've got great operating leverage in the remainder of the year and the execution and focus of everybody in this business is quite strong.
Next slide. This will be our introduction into our 2012 guidance. I'll talk a little bit about the quarter and then the full year and of course we've raised our guidance. 
Next slide. For the full year, we've raised the guidance to $4.75, which is an $0.08 increase on the bottom end and to $4.91, which is an increase on the high-end as well. And in the second quarter, we'll have some headwinds and a little bit of confusing data. Last year, we reported, as you can see on the slide, $1.03, excluding a $0.05 remeasurement gain for foreign currency that we had, and absolutely we treaded that throughout the year on a GAAP basis though and some reporting services, you'll see $1.0, which includes the $0.05 remeasurement gain. But our baseline is $1.0. And the second quarter last year was extraordinary compared to the rest of the year as it was about $1.03 in the second quarter in 2010 was $0.74. So our guidance for the second quarter of this year is $1.11 to $1.15. At the midpoint of that, still a double-digit growth over last year. We do have some comparative headwinds around the gas to fronts contract, which was large last year, that we have this North American research softness and we have some toll shipment timing things that occurred last year. It was the best quarter for the TransCore business in the 3 years in the second quarter last year on a full year basis of course the modest growth trend, and that we expect will continue this year but we won't have to outsize the second quarter. That said, we still look for quite strong results in the second quarter and much stronger results for the second half and the full year. We've raised our operating cash flow projection. We had said it could be $650 million, we're now saving it ought to be between that and $675 million for the full year.
Next slide. So if we recap here before we go to Q&A, the first quarter produced all-time records for revenue, orders, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow, spectacular gross margin at 55%. Very strong cash conversion around the operating cash flow and the free cash flow with free cash flow being up 69%. Book-to-bill strongly above 1 at 1.03. Terrific operating leverage, which just speaks to the quality of our different operating teams around the world, and we've raised the guidance as we go into the balance of the year. Certainly, expect to have record performance for 2012 as a whole. And I think with that, John, we can open it up to questions  ."

We're more along in how they go about on the production side once they've ramped up there. So realtime information I think you may be able to get better color on that from someone else. Now our activity there is both on the natural gas side as well as on the oil side. So what we have been seeing at least over the last quarter or so is some of those rigs start to move and really ramp up more on the oil side and less on the gas side as you're talking about. And so -- and we still see very solid activity of course as we have more pumps that are deployed, we'll see more aftermarket revenue associated with that as well. And then the LNG and the other investments in order to make sure that the transport and processing of the gas, particularly, and as well as on the oil side but mostly on the gas side, those investments are continuing, and those are in our backlog in one of our businesses in particular. So embedded in our expectation for the rest of the year, I wouldn't say is a ramp-up of activity, it's kind of the steady-state of what we're seeing today. And that's our expectation based upon the backlog and the cold activity out of our businesses."

We'll update you on",1942,"Thanks, John. Today, we'll kind of go through the first quarter enterprise financial results, and then we'll get into the specific segment detail on the outlook for each of the 4 segments for the second quarter and balance of the year. We'll update you on our established guidance for the second quarter and our full year guidance and then take your questions. So next slide, please.
The first quarter here was another spectacular quarter. We achieved all-time records for revenue, orders, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow in the quarter. Total sales were up 10% and importantly, organic revenue was up 8%. Our book-to-bill ratio was above 1 at a strong 1.03. Gross margins reached 55%, which is really quite remarkable. And our operating margin leverage was spectacular and the quarter operating margins were up 200 basis points to 24%, and our incremental operating margins were 43% in the first quarter. We closed out the quarter with $205 million in EBITDA and an EBITDA margin of 28.9%. The diluted earnings per share were up 20% to $1.09. More importantly, the free cash flow was up 69% to $131 million in the quarter. It is an all-time record first quarter for us and a great start for 2012.
Next slide. Our first quarter income statement, you can see here that the revenue was up 10%, 8% organic and book-to-bill at 1.03. Gross profit, up another 70 basis points to 55%. Operating margin's up. Operating income was up 20%. The tax rate was a little bit higher than the first quarter of a year ago, 40 basis points higher, which cost us $0.01. Still, net earnings were up 22%, and you can see the DEPs line at $1.09.
Next slide. We had terrific EBITDA growth in the quarter and if you just continue to look at our trend, you can see on this chart our trailing 12 months EBITDA now is $830 million, up from $685 million last year on a trailing 12-month basis and $519 million on a trailing basis at the end of Q1 2010. So we've added 60% to our EBITDA in just the last 2 years. And our EBITDA margins, on a trailing basis, are up 400 basis points from 25% in 2010 to 29% in 2012. People from time to time, investors ask, when are you going to have that deterioration in margin? Our plan would be never. We're just going to continue to move up that line because of the culture and focus we have here.
Next slide. Q1 cash flow, you can see another blowout kind of a quarter here. Our cash conversion was very strong. We had $141 million in operating cash flow, which was $0.20 of every dollar of revenue.  The conversion on that, 131% of net earnings. We invested about $10 million in capital in the quarter, which was 1.4% of revenue right within our kind of 1.2% to 1.6% of revenue plans. So free cash flow was $131 million, 18% of revenue, and the conversion, 121. A remarkable performance against last year's first quarter, where we had $78 million of free cash flow last year in the first quarter and $131 million this year in the quarter.
Next slide. Our asset velocity continues to improve. I know people keep saying it can't be done, it won't get better, but it does get better. If you look at the same period, inventory is now down to 7.5%. Receivables actually dropped down to 14.5%, payables and accruals at 14.9%. So our inventory plus receivables less payables and accruals closed out at 7.1%. And if you look at the trend in 2009, it was 9.6%, finally breaking below 10%. And people would ask us if you could get any better. The answer is, oh, yes, you can get better. 250 basis points improvement over that 3-year period, closing out at 7.1%, very exceptional performance.
Next slide. The balance sheet is pretty strong here. Cash, if we look at a year ago, we had $261 million of cash, and we closed out this quarter with $452 million of cash. We had drawn a little bit against our revolver, which has $750 million in capacity this time a year ago. Now our undrawn revolver is just that we don't have anything drawn against it. So you take that cash and the undrawn revolver, and you get a little over $1.2 billion. 
Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is now up to $830 million, quite a substantial increase over the trailing EBITDA at this point in 2011, so it of course has a very a positive effect on all of our credit stats. Our gross debt is less than it was a year ago, and our shareholder equity has increased by $450 million in the year from $2,882,000,000 to $3,332,000,000, which then brings down the gross debt-to-cap number from 30% to 24.4%, and gives us a gross debt to EBITDA line at 1.3. You can kind of do the math on the net debt to EBITDA line, and you'll come up with quite a remarkable number. 
Segment details here in the next slide. Really, all of the segments had extraordinary performance. They all had double-digit growth in operating profit. Next slide, we'll start with the RF segment. Revenue was up 2%, but operating profit was up 12%. Operating margin was 24.6% for RF, up 220 basis points, and they finished the quarter with a gross margin of 52%. They had very strong leverage in the higher-margin areas, obviously, when revenues' up 2%, then OP's up 12%. We certainly had a headwind on that revenue line because the Gaz de France project, which was in 2011, and was substantial in Q1 and quite substantial in Q2, was completed last year. So we don't have anything other than administrative revenue associated with that now, which makes tough comps for RF a little bit difficult the first couple quarters of this year. We continue to have expansion in both the security and cashless payment systems that we have for higher education that drove substantial growth in the software platform. And then our SaaS-based solution networks have added subscribers both in our freight systems area, and our food service areas and our European expansion continued. 
Our toll and traffic service business was led by electronic tolling conversion we're doing in Puerto Rico that adds to our growth and offsets the sort of weakness in other areas around transportation.  For the rest of 2012, we have fighting that's particularly in Q2, the Gaz de France project, which is completed. That takes some revenue away, makes for difficult comp. Our toll project activity in the last year second quarter was a record in the last 3 years and quite disproportionate to the rest of the year. So that's a difficult comp. That said, we'll still perform better because of the strength of the rest of the businesses in the RF segment. We expect to have continued growth in software and the SaaS network businesses, particularly in the campus area and the growth of subscribers in our networks.
Next slide. Industrial Technology, here, you can see revenue was up double digits at 15%. Operating profit was up 25% and our OP margins, really, are spectacular at 29.5% OP. Compare that to most people's gross margins, that's really quite a remarkable achievement, 29.5% OP, up 230 basis points. Our gross margins in the segment were 51%. 
In the quarter, fluid handling was very strong once again, as we continue to gain share in the oil and gas industry with the shale activity that's going on. We have a variety of new products there going into agricultural applications around irrigation, and those are doing very well. And then we've had some pumping activity we do in the transport industrial arena, which was quite strong in the quarter as well. 
The Toronto water meter project is kind of moving ahead as planned, which gave us some growth in the first quarter. And then the U.S. municipal market in Q1 was relatively strong for Neptune. We had a significant increase in our material analysis equipment and consumables business in Denmark, as industrial production around the world continues to expand that business, continues to have double-digit growth. And the margins in the quarter, as I said, really, were remarkable. It's an all-time record OP margin for us, which is coming from capturing a leverage off of the growth. For the remainder of the year, in 2012, we -- the segment backlog is quite strong, and that supports continued growth even if orders were to moderate, and the industrial and shale end markets remain quite favorable to us. And these outstanding margins that we captured in the first quarter, we believe that the things we've done to get better margins are sustainable and will continue throughout 2012 at these higher levels.
Next slide. In the Medical & Scientific Imaging segment, here, you've got revenue growth again double-digit at 12%, OP growth at 24%, operating margin, up 250 basis points to 26.6%. We were benefited by having Northern Digital in the first quarter, which delivered exactly what we expected out of them on the revenue side and even better margins. We've had a very, very strong first quarter with Gatan in the electron microscopy arena. Those end markets are pretty good, and we've recently introduced some products there in the last 15 months, which are continuing to grow and add to Gatan's strength. Our medical expansion internationally continued in the quarter, gave us some growth as well. And then this margin performance that we've gotten from the operating leverage here in medical really was terrific, and it offset what otherwise would have been a tough first quarter because North American research funding has been quite soft, and the life science area around our photonics camera businesses was weak. 
For the second quarter, we'll have some continuing weakness around those North American research markets. We don't see that ticking up, but it may get better than it was in the first quarter. We expect to continue to grow the medical business. We're experiencing an increase in consumables as we take organic share, and the end markets are favorable in each of the product categories that we participate. 
Northern Digital in the second half of the year will become organic for us, and that will help organic growth profile and Gatan's backlog, which is quite heavy, and we'd like to see that shipments improve in Q2, but they certainly are going to improve strongly in the second half of the year. It gives us confidence for the full year as a whole.
Next slide. Gross margins, I guess, I could say were a modest 65% in Medical & Imaging in the quarter. 
Next slide there, Energy Systems & Controls, same old story, isn't it? Revenue, up 15%; operating profit, up 23%; OP margins, 24%. Energy systems' Q1 OP margins are usually the worst of the year, but these are pretty good at 24%, but will improve, I've been assured. In the first quarter, our Compressor Controls business continued to grow nicely with projects in both LNG and upstream activities. The oil and gas markets continue to be very favorable to us in our diesel engine safety shutoff systems and in the valves that we provide both to oil and gas and marine. Very good instrument sales for the petrochem and refining markets, and we acquired a small but important company called Cambridge Viscosity, which gives us online Internet capacity around measuring data. I'd ask John to talk a little bit about the small acquisition."

We just recently completed the Cambridge acquisition just within the last month of the quarter, so been contributing an awful lot. You can see it on the cash flow statement kind of the range that we paid there. But what this really provides is viscosity measurement for fluids, both in the oil area, but also in the petrochemical. So it adds additional technology to our existing set of businesses there. And so Cambridge will be able to kind of come into an existing sales channel, but also provides additional online work, so outside of the laboratory into the process. So it's a nice fit both for us as well as for Cambridge and additional technology, and they'll be able to benefit from our expanded reach and we'll be able to benefit from their technology. So I think that's going to be a nice acquisition for us that will start to contribute in the second quarter and beyond."

We're going to have for the rest of the year double-digit growth, we believe. In energy, we got the record backlog at the moment. We have continuing strength in incoming orders, and we've got favorable industrial end markets for our one business that kind of fits to the industrial area, our Dynisco Business, and we expect that, that should continue to be okay throughout the year. We've got great operating leverage in the remainder of the year, and the execution and focus of everybody in this businesses is quite strong.
Next slide. This will be our introduction into our 2012 guidance. I'll talk a little bit about the quarter and then the full year and of course, we've raised our guidance. 
Next slide. For the full year, we've raised the guidance to $4.75, which is an $0.08 increase on the bottom end and to $4.91, which is an increase on the high end as well. And in the second quarter, we'll have some headwinds and a little bit of confusing data. Last year, we reported, as you can see on the slide, $1.03, excluding a $0.05 remeasurement gain for foreign currency that we had. And absolutely, we treated that throughout the year on a GAAP basis, though, in some reporting services, you'll see $1.08, which includes the $0.05 remeasurement gain, but our baseline is $1.03. And the second quarter last year was extraordinary compared to the rest of the year as it was $1.03. In the second quarter in 2010, it was $0.74. So our guidance for the second quarter of this year is $1.11 to $1.15. At the midpoint of that, still a double-digit growth over last year. We do have some comparative headwinds around the Gaz de France contract, which was large last year. Then we have this North American research softness, and we have some toll shipment timing things that occurred last year. It was the best quarter for the TransCore business in 3 years in the second quarter last year on a full year basis, of course, a modest growth trend, and that we expect will continue this year, but we won't have the outsize to second quarter. That said, we still look for quite strong results in the second quarter and much stronger results for the second half and the full year. We've raised our operating cash flow projection. We had said it could be $650 million. We're now saving it ought to be between that and $675 million for the full year.
Next slide. So if we recap here before we go to Q&A, the first quarter produced all-time records for revenue, orders, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow, a spectacular gross margin at 55%. Very strong cash conversion around the operating cash flow and the free cash flow, with free cash flow being up 69%. Book-to-bill, strongly above 1 at 1.03. Terrific operating leverage, which just speaks to the quality of our different operating teams around the world, and we've raised the guidance as we go into the balance of the year. Certainly expect to have record performance for 2012 as a whole. And I think with that, John, we can open it up to questions."

Now our activity there is both on the natural gas side as well as on the oil side. So what we have been seeing at least over the last quarter or so is some of those rigs start to move and really will ramp up more on the oil side and less on the gas side as you're talking about, and so -- and we still see very solid activity. Of course, as we have more pumps that are deployed, we'll see more aftermarket revenue associated with that as well. And then the LNG and the other investments in order to make sure that the transport and processing of the gas, particularly and as well as on the oil side, but mostly on the gas side, those investments are continuing, and those are in our backlog in one of our businesses in particular. So embedded in our expectation for the rest of the year, I wouldn't say is a ramp-up of activity. It's kind of the steady-state about what we're seeing today. And that's our expectation based upon the backlog and the quote activity out of our businesses."

And that's largely driven by the investments that are happening, and that's still off of a relatively small base. So I don't want to overplay this, but it does add to our backlog and add to the LNG position that we have where I think that we were largely seen as the best control systems provider for any type of LNG plant anywhere around the world. So the fact that they're making strong investments there at the Gorgon site as well as in others is going to continue to benefit us, we think."

It was just -- it was really the change in Europe was purely from the Gaz de France contract that we had that was unique, and was just something that occurred and it was down sharply.

Today, we'll kind of go through the first quarter enterprise financial results, and then we'll get into the specific segment detail on the outlook for each of the 4 segments for the second quarter and balance of the year. We'll update you on",1947,"Thanks, John. Today, we'll kind of go through the first quarter enterprise financial results, and then we'll get into the specific segment detail on the outlook for each of the 4 segments for the second quarter and balance of the year. We'll update you on our established guidance for the second quarter and our full year guidance and then take your questions. So next slide, please.
The first quarter here was another spectacular quarter. We achieved all-time records for revenue, orders, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow in the quarter. Total sales were up 10%, and importantly, organic revenue was up 8%. Our book-to-bill ratio was above 1 at a strong 1.03. Gross margins reached 55%, which is really quite remarkable. And our operating margin leverage was spectacular. In the quarter, our operating margins were up 200 basis points to 24%, and our incremental operating margins were 43% in the first quarter. We closed out the quarter with $205 million in EBITDA and an EBITDA margin of 28.9%. The diluted earnings per share were up 20% to $1.09. More importantly, the free cash flow was up 69% to $131 million in the quarter. It is an all-time record first quarter for us and a great start for 2012.
Next slide. Our first quarter income statement, you can see here that the revenue was up 10%, 8% organic and book-to-bill at 1.03. Gross profit, up another 70 basis points to 55%. Operating margin's up -- operating income was up 20%. The tax rate was a little bit higher than the first quarter of a year ago, 40 basis points higher, which cost us $0.01. Still, net earnings were up 22%, and you can see the DEPS line at $1.09.
Next slide. We had terrific EBITDA growth in the quarter, and if you just continue to look at our trend, you can see on this chart our trailing 12 months EBITDA now is $830 million, up from $685 million last year on a trailing 12-month basis and $519 million on a trailing basis at the end of Q1 2010. So we've added 60% to our EBITDA in just the last 2 years. And our EBITDA margins, on a trailing basis, are up 400 basis points from 25% in 2010 to 29% in 2012. People from time to time, investors ask, when are you going to have that deterioration in margin? Our plan would be never. We're just going to continue to move up that line because of the culture and focus we have here.
Next slide. Q1 cash flow, you can see another blowout kind of a quarter here. Our cash conversion was very strong. We had $141 million in operating cash flow, which was $0.20 of every dollar of revenue.  The conversion on that, 131% of net earnings. We invested about $10 million in capital in the quarter, which was 1.4% of revenue right within our kind of 1.2% to 1.6% of revenue plans. So free cash flow was $131 million, 18% of revenue, and the conversion, 121. A remarkable performance against last year's first quarter, where we had $78 million of free cash flow last year in the first quarter and $131 million this year in the quarter.
Next slide. Our asset velocity continues to improve. I know people keep saying it can't be done, it won't get better, but it does get better. If you look at the same period, inventory is now down to 7.5%. Receivables actually dropped down to 14.5%, payables and accruals at 14.9%. So our inventory plus receivables, less payables and accruals, closed out at 7.1%. And if you look at the trend in 2009, it was 9.6%, finally breaking below 10%. And people would ask us if you could get any better. The answer is, oh, yes, you can get better. 250 basis points improvement over that 3-year period, closing out at 7.1%, very exceptional performance.
Next slide. The balance sheet is pretty strong here. Cash, if we look at a year ago, we had $261 million of cash, and we closed out this quarter with $452 million of cash. We had drawn a little bit against our revolver, which has $750 million in capacity this time a year ago. Now our undrawn revolver is just that. We don't have anything drawn against it. So you take that cash and the undrawn revolver, and you get a little over $1.2 billion. 
Our trailing 12 months EBITDA is now up to $830 million, quite a substantial increase over the trailing EBITDA at this point in 2011, so it, of course, has a very a positive effect on all of our credit stats. Our gross debt is less than it was a year ago, and our shareholder equity has increased by $450 million in the year from $2,882,000,000 to $3,332,000,000, which then brings down the gross debt-to-cap number from 30% to 24.4% and gives us a gross debt to EBITDA line at 1.3. You can kind of do the math on the net debt to EBITDA line, and you'll come up with quite a remarkable number. 
Segment details here in the next slide. Really, all of the segments had extraordinary performance. They all had double-digit growth in operating profit. Next slide, we'll start with the RF segment. Revenue was up 2%, but operating profit was up 12%. Operating margin was 24.6% for RF, up 220 basis points, and they finished the quarter with a gross margin of 52%. They had very strong leverage in the higher-margin areas, obviously, when revenue’s up 2% but OP's up 12%. We certainly had a headwind on that revenue line because the Gaz de France project, which was in 2011 and was substantial in Q1 and quite substantial in Q2, was completed last year. So we don't have anything other than administrative revenue associated with that now, which makes comps for RF a little bit difficult the first couple quarters of this year. We continue to have expansion in both the security and cashless payment systems that we have for higher education. That drove substantial growth in the software platform. And then our SaaS-based solution networks have added subscribers both in our freight systems area and in our food service areas, and our European expansion continued. 
Our toll and traffic service business was led by electronic tolling conversion we're doing in Puerto Rico that adds to our growth and offsets the sort of weakness in other areas around transportation.  For the rest of 2012, we have fighting us, particularly in Q2, the Gaz de France project, which is completed. That takes some revenue away, makes for difficult comp. Our toll project activity in last year’s second quarter was a record in the last 3 years and quite disproportionate to the rest of the year. So that's a difficult comp. That said, we'll still perform better because of the strength of the rest of the businesses in the RF segment. We expect to have continued growth in software and the SaaS network businesses, particularly in the campus area and the growth of subscribers in our networks.
Next slide. Industrial Technology, here, you can see revenue was up double digits at 15%. Operating profit was up 25%, and our OP margins, really, are spectacular at 29.5% OP. Compare that to most people's gross margins. That's really quite a remarkable achievement, 29.5% OP, up 230 basis points. Our gross margins in the segment were 51%. 
In the quarter, fluid handling was very strong once again, as we continue to gain share in the oil and gas industry with the shale activity that's going on. We have a variety of new products that are going into agricultural applications around irrigation, and those are doing very well. And then we've had some pumping activity we do in the transport industrial arena, which was quite strong in the quarter as well. 
The Toronto water meter project is kind of moving ahead as planned, which gave us some growth in the first quarter. And then the U.S. municipal market in Q1 was relatively strong for Neptune. We had a significant increase in our material analysis equipment and consumables business in Denmark, as industrial production around the world continues to expand that business, continues to have double-digit growth. And the margins in the quarter, as I said, really, were remarkable. It's an all-time record OP margin for us, which is coming from capturing a leverage off of the growth. For the remainder of the year, in 2012, we -- the segment backlog is quite strong, and that supports continued growth, even if orders were to moderate, and the industrial and shale end markets remain quite favorable to us. And these outstanding margins that we captured in the first quarter, we believe that the things we've done to get better margins are sustainable and will continue throughout 2012 at these higher levels.
Next slide. In the Medical & Scientific Imaging segment, here, you've got revenue growth again double-digit at 12%; OP growth at 24%; operating margin, up 250 basis points to 26.6%. We were benefited by having Northern Digital in the first quarter, which delivered exactly what we expected out of them on the revenue side and even better margins. We've had a very, very strong first quarter with Gatan in the electron microscopy arena. Those end markets are pretty good, and we've recently introduced some products there in the last 15 months, which are continuing to grow and add to Gatan's strength. Our medical expansion internationally continued in the quarter, gave us some growth as well. And then this margin performance that we've gotten from the operating leverage here in medical really was terrific, and it offset what otherwise would have been a tough first quarter because North American research funding has been quite soft, and the life science area around our photonics camera businesses was weak. 
For the second quarter, we'll have some continuing weakness around those North American research markets. We don't see that ticking up, but it may get better than it was in the first quarter. We expect to continue to grow the medical business. We're experiencing an increase in consumables as we think we’re gaining share, and the end markets are favorable in each of the product categories that we participate. 
Northern Digital in the second half of the year will become organic for us, and that will help our organic growth profile and Gatan's backlog, which is quite heavy, and we'd like to see that -- shipments improve in Q2, but they certainly are going to improve strongly in the second half of the year. It gives us confidence for the full year as a whole.
Next slide. Gross margins, I guess, I could say were a modest 65% in Medical & Imaging in the quarter. 
Next slide there, Energy Systems & Controls. Same old story, isn't it? Revenue, up 15%; operating profit, up 23%; OP margins, 24%. Energy Systems' Q1 OP margins are usually the worst of the year, but these are pretty good at 24%, but will improve, I've been assured. In the first quarter, our Compressor Controls business continued to grow nicely with projects in both LNG and upstream activities. The oil and gas markets continue to be very favorable to us in our diesel engine safety shutoff systems and in the valves that we provide both to oil and gas and marine.

We recently completed the Cambridge acquisition just within the last month of the quarter, so it didn’t contribute an awful lot. You can see it on the cash flow statement, kind of the range that we paid there. But what this really provides is viscosity measurement for fluids, both in the oil area, but also in the petrochemical. So it adds additional technology to our existing set of businesses there. And so Cambridge will be able to kind of come into an existing sales channel but also provides additional online work, so outside of the laboratory into the process. So it's a nice fit both for us as well as for Cambridge and additional technology, and they'll be able to benefit from our expanded reach, and we'll be able to benefit from their technology. So I think that's going to be a nice acquisition for us that will start to contribute in the second quarter and beyond."

We're going to have for the rest of the year double-digit growth, we believe. In energy, we got record backlog at the moment.

We're going to have for the rest of the year double-digit growth, we believe. In energy, we got record backlog at the moment. We have continuing strength in incoming orders, and we've got favorable industrial end markets for our one business that kind of fits to the industrial area, our Dynisco Business, and we expect that, that should continue to be okay throughout the year. We've got great operating leverage in the remainder of the year, and the execution and focus of everybody in this business is quite strong.
Next slide. This will be our introduction into our 2012 guidance. I'll talk a little bit about the quarter and then the full year. And of course, we've raised our guidance. 
Next slide. For the full year, we've raised the guidance to $4.75, which is an $0.08 increase on the bottom end, and to $4.91, which is an increase on the high end as well. And in the second quarter, we'll have some headwinds and a little bit of confusing data. Last year, we reported, as you can see on the slide, $1.03, excluding a $0.05 remeasurement gain for foreign currency that we had. And that’s the way we treated that throughout the year on a GAAP basis, though, in some reporting services, you'll see $1.08, which includes the $0.05 remeasurement gain, but our baseline is $1.03. And the second quarter last year was extraordinary compared to the rest of the year as it was $1.03. In the second quarter in 2010, it was $0.74. So our guidance for the second quarter of this year is $1.11 to $1.15. At the midpoint of that, still a double-digit growth over last year. We do have some comparative headwinds around the Gaz de France contract, which was large last year. Then we have this North American research softness, and we have some toll shipment timing things that occurred last year. It was the best quarter for the TransCore business in 3 years in the second quarter last year on a full year basis, of course, a modest growth trend, and that we expect will continue this year, but we won't have the outsized second quarter. That said, we still look for quite strong results in the second quarter and much stronger results for the second half and the full year. We've raised our operating cash flow projection. We had said it could be $650 million. We're now saying it ought to be between that and $675 million for the full year.
Next slide. So if we recap here before we go to Q&A, the first quarter produced all-time records for revenue, orders, net earnings, EBITDA, operating and free cash flow, spectacular gross margin at 55%. Very strong cash conversion around the operating cash flow and the free cash flow, with free cash flow being up 69%. Book-to-bill, strongly above 1 at 1.03. Terrific operating leverage, which just speaks to the quality of our different operating teams around the world, and we've raised the guidance as we go into the balance of the year. Certainly expect to have record performance for 2012 as a whole. And I think with that, John, we can open it up to questions."

Now our activity there is both on the natural gas side as well as on the oil side. So what we have been seeing at least over the last quarter or so is some of those rigs start to move and, really, a ramp-up more on the oil side and less on the gas side as you're talking about, and so -- and we still see very solid activity. Of course, as we have more pumps that are deployed, we'll see more aftermarket revenue associated with that as well. And then the LNG and the other investments in order to make sure that the transport and processing of the gas, particularly and as well as on the oil side, but mostly on the gas side, those investments are continuing, and those are in our backlog in one of our businesses in particular.

And in fact, our leader of Verathon is on a plane, as we speak right now, going over to have some meetings over there with people on the subject. So I think that's pretty good. We have some CIVCO and MEDTEC products that are launching in the second half and some things that they've been working on that are -- we kind of know are going to be beneficial in the second half of the year.

If you could please turn to Slide 2. We begin with our updated Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as further detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Brian?"

Today, we'll go through the enterprise financial results for the quarter, talk a little bit about specific segment detail and the outlook for each of the segments, give you an overview of the Sunquest acquisition and then establish our third quarter and full year guidance and take your questions. I think we had indicated in our first quarter call that we expected going into the second quarter would be our most difficult challenge for the year. We had really an outstanding quarter compared to what we expected, because we had quite a few headwinds this quarter. Certainly, had the uncertain economy we're able to blow through that. We had very difficult comps going into Q2 because of the Gaz de France revenue last year and outsized performance and shipments last year in our 10 technology business that we knew wouldn't be repeated. And then, of course, we had currency, which became a bigger surprise than we expected, it cost us about $0.01 a share versus our guidance and about $0.02 a share versus the prior year. 
That said, let's look at what we did in Q2.
Next slide. We had record results in the second quarter, pretty well across-the-board, highest level of orders in our history, highest level of sales in our history in the second quarter. This backlog that we entered the second quarter with record net earnings and record EBITDA performance for the quarter. Our orders were up 8%, and revenue was up 4% despite those headwinds and the effect of currency. Our book-to-bill ratio was actually quite high at 1.05. Our gross margins reached 54.9% in the quarter, and our operating margin was really quite spectacular, it came up 130 basis points to 24.7%. If you look at the incremental OP and the incremental sales, our operating leverage in the quarter was 59% and there's no smoke and mirrors in that, it's just 59%. Our EBITDA was up 214 -- was $214 million and our EBITDA margin reached 29.5%. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $119 million, slightly lower than we would expect in the second quarter but we had a higher cash tax rate, and that won't happen again in the rest of the year. Our first half operating cash flow was $261 million and will project what we believe will be for the full year later this morning.
Our diluted earnings per share were $1.15 versus $1.03 last year. That $1.15 would've been $0.01 higher if based on our guidance if it weren't for the currency scenario. And the $1.03 is the number that we used with the remeasurement gained last year, you might remember it was about $0.05 a share so GAAP it would have been $1.08 but was really adjusted at $1.03. Net earnings were up 13%. We're very happy with the performance, because we had about $30 million headwind between our Scientific camera business and Gaz de France and some European activity coming into the quarter and we were able to really blow through that. Very solid revenue throughout the world with the exception of Europe,, which was down about 18%. Record performance really in an uncertain economic environment.
Next slide. In the Q2 income statement, you'll see orders were $763 million, up 7% organically. Revenue, book-to-bill came in at 1.05. Gross profit was up 100 basis points to 54.9% from 53.9 a year ago. And our operating income was an amazing 24.7%, up 130 basis points from a year ago. Our interest expense about flat. Tax rate was consistent with the guidance we established for the quarter, came in at 29.6%. And net earnings were $115million versus $102 million last year, up 13%.
Next slide. If you look at our EBITDA performance, our trailing 12 months EBITDA has now reached $845 million. It's up from last year. Trailing number this time of $739 million and 2 years ago $540 million. So EBITDA is up 57% over the last 2 years. And our EBITDA margins continue to soar, we were 25.2% in 2010 and 29.3% on the trailing 12 months calculation now and of course, this quarter at 29.5%.
Next. If we look here at the cash flow performance, you'll see Q2 cash flow at $119 million of operating cash flow and $109 million of free cash flow. Very good performance again but working capital. Our inventory actually improved by 30 bps from 7.5% to 7.2% of revenue. And our accounts receivable improved by 50 bps from 15.6% to 15.1%. And when you adjust that for payables and accruals, we were still below 7%. 
In the first half cash flow, it normally our first half cash flow is about 40% of the full year. This year, it will second half of the year is stronger because of the acquisition of Sunquest and how cash accretive it really is. So you can see that our full year operating cash flow, we've now raised our guidance to be about $700 million for the full year. That will put our operating cash flow at a very high percentage of revenue. It could reach 23% of revenue, in fact. It's really driven by expanded margins. It's driven by the Sunquest acquisition that we expect to close in the last 4 months of the year and some cash tax benefits that we are acquiring in the Sunquest transaction. It does exclude the deal cost and refinancing charges associated with the new credit facility we put in place effective this past Friday.
And you can see here that free cash or operating cash goes up to $700 million, our estimate this year up from $602 million last year and $500 million a year before. So that would be a 40% increase in cash flow over the last 2 years.
Next slide. On Friday, we closed the new credit facility, a $1.5 billion revolver. So if you look at our normal credit stats here, a year ago on 6/30/11, you can see that we had $196 million in cash and $595 million in an undrawn revolver, which gave us acquisition powder investment powder of about $791 million. When we closed out the quarter on June 30, our cash had increased to $519 million in our undrawn revolver was at its capacity at $750 million, giving us $1.269 billion. As of Friday, with the new $1.5 billion revolver and a cash from the end of the quarter, we now have capacity in excess of $2 billion. Our gross debt on the other hand is only  $1.69 billion. Our gross debt to capitalization is at 23.8, but if you look at the net debt-to-EBITDA, you'll see it's actually cut in half from a year ago, it was 1.4. And at the end of the quarter, it was 0.7. Even with the financing of the Sunquest acquisition at $1.4 billion, we'll have ample capacity to pursue other opportunities in the near-term and the pipeline remains very, very exciting.
If we look the next slide here, the Sunquest details -- the segment details, we'll start with the RF Technology slide. Next. So on RF Technology, really, very, very outstanding orders in the quarter. They were up 18%. So those orders and the execution really in the telegraph business kind of got us up to the high-end of our range despite the European pressures and helped us deliver. You can see the OP margin was amazing at 27%, up 290 basis points. And if you want to look at leverage, revenue was down 2% and operating profit was up 10%. So what would speak strongly to the execution that's occurring in those businesses. The softer businesses continue to help us on the margin expansion as they grow. We've got a very significant win again in Houston. We are going to upgrade the entire Lane Hardware in the Houston area with our united toll systems technology, which is really an advancement over what was in place in the past. We think that contract ought to produce about $65 million in revenue between maintenance and the change out. 
Our CBORD cash flow system business continue to grow, it had a record quarter in the second quarter for any time. And that involved both university and good management wins in both higher education and healthcare. And we had of course it's difficult headwind for our Technolog business, Gaz dez France, which had that sort of onetime large install last year, and that held us back by about $500 million in the quarter.
In the second half, we will have a continued difficult comp with the Gaz dez France, because it went throughout the year last year. But our increased toll project and maintenance activity that will be led by this Texas wins will easily offset any challenges we have and the rest of those types of activities in the segment. And then the software business, was had Software-as-a-Service activity is continuing to increase and both iTrade and Freight Matching continue to roll along with the sort of nominal organic growth but outstanding cash growth.
Next slide. If we look at the Industrial Technology segment, gee it's again spectacular performance. Revenue was up 11%. The operating profit margins reached 30.4%. That's an all-time record for the segment. The highest previous we ever had was at 29.2% in the fourth quarter last year. This 30.4% to just add some perspective around how amazing it is, the S&P 500 industrials gross margins had it grew by 30.8%. Roper's operating profit for industrial is 30.4%. So we've got an all-time record here in OP margin. Again, leverage off the growth, terrific execution everywhere. Fluid handling continues to grow in both agriculture, food and the shale activity. Our General Industrial markets have performed well. We're not seeing any early indicators of any softness in any of those businesses. The material test business, which is primarily European business, actually had a record second quarter, very strong North America and Asia sales offset any weakness that we had in Europe. And then Neptune business continued to grow, driven by the Toronto project and some higher shipments in the U.S. In the second half of the year, we would expect that the shale activity growth would moderate, not stall, but certainly moderate with gas activity on shale being down but the oil activity on shale being up. To the industrial end markets, again, no signs of any falloff. The outstanding margins we expected continue throughout the second half of the year. And just personal note to our people and investor, we just couldn't be more proud of these teams as we watch them execute in a very tough market.
Next slide. If we look at our Energy Systems & Controls business, here, you can see revenue was up 6%, OP up 7%. Margin at 26% was up 200 basis points from the first quarter margin and energy. Organic growth in the quarter was 5%. Compressor Controls continues to do very well on LNG projects and the field service activity that we do drove double-digit growth for them. The bolt-on acquisitions that we did in the last year, very small United Controls Trinity and Cambridge, all have noncash amortization charges in them. They're actually putting a little bit of a drag on the OP margins even though at 26% it's hard to see a drag, but they actually would've been about 120 basis points higher in OP without all that amortization drag and the on those 3 businesses. That said, they're performing well. They're all on plan from an integration viewpoint. They will add to growth in the second half of the year. 
Our European markets weakened. In fact, in energy, they were down about 18%, but our U.S. was up by about 18%. So the U.S. business being larger, that was a benefit. And the Rest of the World was quite strong in the Middle East and Asia, Australia. Brazil not quite as strong. Cost actions are underway for the second half on a very selective basis where people are executing some contingency plans in those things that relate to any softness that they see. We think Europe continue to be soft but we'll have continued growth in both North America and Middle East and Asia to offset that. But the exception of our petrochem business, which is down about 20%, and that's a worldwide shortfall, we're not seeing any strength anywhere in that business. Very solid backlog though. Compressor controls gives us confidence that growth in the second half. And then we would expect a normal, very strong Q4 seasonal activity in energy would be repeated this year.
Next slide. So here we look at Medical & Scientific Imaging. This is one of those things where looks like nothing happened, but there is great variability throughout the different businesses here. And while revenue was flat and operating margin was up 20 bps, what really was going on is Europe and the North American academic research funding softness impacted our camera portion of the Photonics businesses. Cameras are not a big part of Roper, but they do come in around $125 million to $140 million with the total revenue, and they were down as much as 20% in some cases. And we don't see any real turnaround as it relates to these research markets for the camera technology business. And while they perform relative well, they certainly are drag on short-term growth. 
Our medical businesses continue to grow organically. The channel expansion that we've been able to provide them in Asia is offsetting any weakness that they have in Europe. And the Northern Digital business performed very well, expanding its offerings to OEM customers. And also we were able to do a bolt-on acquisition in the quarter called Ascension Technology Corporation, which is in the state of Vermont. And Ascension does 3D tracking for minimally invasive surgery, which you probably all know is a rapidly growing aspect in surgical applications. We paid about $18 million for Ascension. We expect it ought to deliver 3 plus million dollars in EBITDA over the next 12 months. In the second half, we expect to have continued weakness in this academic research area, which will affect our Photonics businesses. Fortunately, the medical expansion is going to continue. Markets remain pretty favorable. Ascension will give us a live bit of for Digital. The Japan business has a substantial backlog, which we expect to be able to do ship during the second half of the year, which will add to our growth. And then we have this transformational Sunquest acquisition, which will add substantial amount of revenue and EBITDA to our medical platform. We would expect it to add somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 million of revenue in last 4 months of the year. It's going to add well over 35% to the Medical and Scientific segment for the next year in revenue. It's going to add quite a substantial amount to Roper's overall revenue base for 2013.
Next slide. So as we look at the Sunquest acquisition, I'll talk a bit about the transaction, and John will talk a little more in-depth about this specific business. 
Next slide. So if we look at the Sunquest acquisition, you can see that it meets all of our acquisition criteria. It's really an amazing fit where we're able to take our software platforms inside RF and the medical platforms inside Medical & Scientific Imaging and hook them up in a very creative way with the Sunquest business, which is truly a software business but it's also a Medical business. If you look at our criteria, we talk about all the time asset like low CapEx. Absolutely it's almost no CapEx, and that exceptionally light asset business. 
Focusing on the market structures and driving forces at work, we've done probably more marketplace diligence on this business, because we've  actually looked at it in 2010 and have maintained in the business forever and really felt that based on the work that we have done and the things that we thought they could and should be looking at and then seeing how they've done, our diligence revealed a lot of strategic competitive advantages that Sunquest enjoys. And they have a lot of whitespace opportunities for growth that are beyond our core traditional business. They've done a great job in transforming their business. It was acquired by in 2007 and certainly was a high-margin business. But, could be better. And to the Sunquest leadership teams efforts, they've done an incredible job in making that a transformational business that we are acquiring now compared to what it was in 2007.
The incentives is always a link to the commitments that the leadership teams made and those are in place. It has the technology advantages that are clear and easily measured against competition, and it has very deep application expertise. It really is a niche business and the lab market. Management continuity is always valued and every on that team has the groups that in place. The communication for the Sunquest employees is taking place this morning in Tucson. We've asked them as always to preserve what's made by very good company and core values that stimulate progress. In this area the progress is going to come in the form of even more investment and the sales and marketing arena and some faster execution in the development area. This is a business that when we talk about growing, once you buy, Mike, this business has higher margins than we do. It has twice the EBITDA margins that Roper enjoys. And when you look at those kind of margins and you recognize the incredible strength of the company, it has 2/3 of its revenue comes on a recurring basis. 98% of its customers sign up annually for the software programs that it has. It has negative working capital and very low CapEx. And we expect in 2013 it will generate $140 million or more EBITDA for us. Fourth quarter run rate, which we just completed their fiscal company May 31 and just had their audit and signed are prior to our  closing actually supports our expectations for '13 -- 2013 nicely. It's really a business, when John talkies about it, you want to think about what do they do and where are they located and why do they win because it is a phenomenal management team and outstanding group of employees that have really done things in this space that no one can really replicate.
So with that, we'll turn to the next slide and John Humphrey."

So just talk a little bit more about kind of what Sunquest is and what it's able to provide for its customers. Further, the global market leader for providing the underlying software information solution for laboratories and hospitals",415,"Sure. Thanks, Brian. So just talk a little bit more about kind of what Sunquest is and what it's able to provide for its customers. Further, the global market leader for providing the underlying software information solution for laboratories and hospitals and large academic medical centers, with a headquarter in Tucson, Arizona, locations both in the U.K. and the development center in Bangalore. They have a global footprint that allows them to serve that customer base. With their customer base are those folks who for whom the effectiveness and efficiency of the lab is of critical importance. The lab ends up with in many cases hundreds of thousands of tests being done each month to support the diagnostic decisions that are made on the hospital. And they rely upon the Sunquest information and the quality and safety associated with that to help drive those decisions. The comprehensive solutions is about improving the productivity with workflow automation tools. You see on the right-hand side both the Sunquest laboratories 7.0 and the cool cat solution, both of those are about workflow automation to make sure that the right test is done on the right patient at the right time, leading to the right diagnosis. So those things also reach beyond just the lab and also go out to the collection manager, one of the modules that Sunquest has. So that nurse has a point of collection tool that integrates back with the lab so you have full connectivity between both of those parts of the hospital.
The very large customer base, very high retention rates, over 98% retention each year, continue to utilize and depend upon the software set of solutions. And is really supported by a 30-year history. These are very long-term relationships, relationships that are supported by the decade of application expertise Sunquest has developed about what the hospital lab needs and their unique set of needs that Sunquest is going to be able to meet. And as Brian talked about, it's a proven team, it's a great culture, everything that we varied diligence process continues to support the fact that their culture of excellence and execution is really phenomenal. And I think they're going to be a great addition to the team. And I thin the company is very well-positioned to capture the growth opportunities that they've identified over the coming years.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Brian to talk a little bit about guidance and the summary for the quarter."
22751,213643538,334281,"Roper Industries Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2012",2012-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Okay. So after we get that guidance, we move to the guidance slide. We've raised our full year guidance to $4.84 to $5. That reflects about a $0.04 reduction due to currency. We had started out at $4.75 to $4.91, you might remember $0.04 comes off the bot",674,"Okay. So after we get that guidance, we move to the guidance slide. We've raised our full year guidance to $4.84 to $5. That reflects about a $0.04 reduction due to currency. We had started out at $4.75 to $4.91, you might remember $0.04 comes off the bottom your 4 71 and $0.05 off the top for 4.86 running back $0.12 and $0.14 on GAAP accretion for Sunquest, excluding any deal cost. And then in addition, of course, we've got other things that we are absorbing and other things that are good. So $4.84 to $5 on full year guidance. The quarter comes in at $1.19 to $1.25 in the third quarter. Most importantly, we now expect our full year operating cash flow to be approximately $700 million. 
And just a couple of footnotes, you'll notice their the acquisition of Sunquest we expect to close at the end of August. We will have the HSR filing and since there's no competitive issues, it should move along quickly. We have some deferred revenue that's unusual. Sunquest some other businesses when you acquire them, there's some GAAP issues around that. And so we'll have to kind of reveal that to you each quarter as we report out. And this does exclude whatever cost we will have that will be registered in the third quarter. That will be related to the acquisition and removal of the remaining amortization and the old revolver.
Next slide. So looking at the summary of the second quarter, we go back to the top point being that it's again an all-time record for the second quarter in our history, highest level of orders, revenue, backlog, net earnings and EBITDA. Organic quarter growth at 7% was really a pleasant benefit for the quarter. The operating margins at 24.70, EBITDA at 29 5 and gross margins at 54 9 really terrific. Leverage is kind of breathtaking at 59%. We used to talk about 30% to 35% leverage, and the target leverage is going to be about 40% for a long time.
Doing a new revolver a big help, $1.5 billion. The old revolver was put in place in July of 2008 and would have had to be replaced in July of 2013. So this removes any refinancing risk around that for next year. It gives us twice as much capacity to write checks against as we had previously. And $1.5 billion is pretty sizable revolver for Roper. That was completed last Friday, a timely completion, we might add, relative to the deal closing on Saturday. Sunquest, just an exceptional financial profile. Higher gross margins than we have at twice the EBITDA margins. Terrific fit. You couldn't find a business that sort of marry what we're doing in software and what we're doing in medical that would benefit both so much Sunquest. It's got great development people. Our software people spent last week in Bangalore, visiting and talking with people. We've done tremendous diligence around their robustness of the software platforms in place for Sunquest and how they can be used. All of these then creates an opportunity for us to be positioned again in 2012 for an all-time record year. $700 million in operating cash flow. And perhaps most importantly, the transformation process that we're doing here continues as we get more and more technology. If you think about where we are, and how we continue this, we have more technology content, we have higher margins, higher cash returns, more recurring revenue and just a much different company than what you would look at in 2002. And the next 5 years, we added Neptune and TransCore. And then if you look at 2007 and you look at the forward 5 years here 2012, you CBORD and Horizon and iTrade and Technolog. And now Sunquest. So technology content gets better margins get better cash return gets better and the available forward acquisition powder for growth will be better than it ever has been in the past. And with that, I think we're ready for questions."

I think we entered the quarter with more concern and turned out to be justified. So those like any early indicators of things that would make us nervous that would be in energy or industrial, we really haven't seen that. There's just a little bit of activity, mostly in petrochem and oil and gas that we're going to modest internal retrenchment on. But on balance, it's pretty good. We never really talk about a quarter in which we're in. But I would say things remain pretty decent. We're going to expect organic growth actually kind of picked up in the second quarter, and we would expect it to continue to be mid-single digits, really, for the rest of the year.

Here again, we do about a niche, which is think is unrelated in that activity. And this niche has done an opportunity very hard return for people investing it is in the hospital space and then the clinics space and then private care space. If you basically lab work is critical to every aspects of people diagnosing folks, and that happens at a variety d of different places. We think we have the preeminent technology to do that and we think we can make people more productive and more efficient and what they do when they do it. It has been hard, I think on the last couple of years to get the intention of hospitals that have had these mandates to do a variety of thing around health records. Now we get the chance to make an investment i n things like this business that will give them a natural return. So we think it's got pretty exciting growth. And these guys, they've brought in a new sales executive, a woman that we have great confidence in that we think is going to drive better focus on organic growth. It's been a very high cash contributor. And it's same old situation, private equity has done in this case a really amazing job than it has been what they acquired in 2007, but it can grow more.

And I'll tell you, sometimes it will get people ideas or whatever. We wonder about what they're going to do, I think these people have done just a spectacular job of taking advantage of some momentum that we thought would be available to them. And they've done that. So we have some transactions that are similar to those that we've been talking to people off and on about for several years. I think that depending on who owns the asset and what people thing is going to happen between now and the end of the year around the tax structure, going into next year, you have higher levels of seller activity if they believe nothing is going to change and they don't have a capital gains that they are worried about, they may hold on. If on the other hand, they are candidate think that getting a higher percentage of something is better than a lower percentage of something else, we may close the valuation gap, I don't know. So I think it's possible that we would do another transaction, probably not quite as large as $1.4 billion, however."

Their cash returns are more than 50% better than they were like 5 years ago. They give us tremendous EPS performance, because they don't have the non-GAAP or amortization charges that lay against them. There is certainly an increasing inflection point where you look at this and say what about this situation. We're in a marvelous place where since we maintain the autonomy of each one of these businesses, we can always decouple business and not have any problem doing that. It's not like some other strategic that's got everything so embedded that one factory is making 5 items and one information system can't go with the business. So all our businesses are total isolated and independent and anyone could be spun off to another party. I think people largely have some ideas about which things might become available.

So who's willing to pay what, but we're not an active seller, but we have some assets that are probably more valuable to others than they are to us."

22751,213643538,334465,"Roper Industries Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2012",2012-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Well, good morning, everybody.

Today, we'll go through the enterprise financial results for the quarter, talk a little bit about specific segment detail and the outlook for each of the segments, give you an overview of the Sunquest acquisition and then establish our third quarter and full year guidance and take your questions. 
I think we had indicated in our first quarter call that we expected going into the second quarter would be our most difficult challenge for the year. We had really an outstanding quarter compared to what we expected because we had quite a few headwinds this quarter. Certainly, we had the uncertain economy and we're able to blow through that. 
We had very difficult comps going into Q2 because of the Gaz de France revenue last year and the outsized performance and toll tag shipments last year in our Gatan technology business that we knew wouldn't be repeated. And then of course, we had currency, which became a bigger surprise than we expected. It costs us about $0.01 a share versus our guidance and about $0.02 a share versus the prior year. That said, let's look at what we did in Q2.
Next slide. We had record results in the second quarter, pretty well across-the-board, highest level of orders in our history, highest level of sales in our history in the second quarter, biggest backlog that we've entered the second quarter with record net earnings and record EBITDA performance for the quarter. 
Our orders were up 8%, and revenue was up 4%, despite those headwinds and the effect of currency. Our book-to-bill ratio was actually quite high at 1.05. Our gross margins reached 54.9% in the quarter, and our operating margin was really quite spectacular. It came up 130 basis points to 24.7%. 
If you look at the incremental OP and the incremental sales, our operating leverage in the quarter was 59%, and there are no smoke and mirrors in that. It's just 59%. Our EBITDA was up 214 -- or sorry, was $214 million, and our EBITDA margin reached 29.5%. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $119 million, slightly lower than we would expect in the second quarter, but we had a higher cash tax rate, and that won't happen again in the rest of the year. Our first half operating cash flow was $261 million and will project what we believe will be for the full year later this morning.
Our diluted earnings per share were $1.15 versus $1.03 last year. That $1.15 would've been $0.01 higher if -- based on our guidance, if it weren't for the currency scenario. And the $1.03 is the number that we used with the remeasurement gained last year. You might remember, it was about $0.05 a share. So on GAAP, it would have been $1.08 but was really adjusted at $1.03. 
Net earnings were up 13%. We're very happy with the performance, because we had about $30 million headwind between our scientific camera business and Gaz de France and some European activity coming into the quarter, and we were able to really blow through that. Very solid revenue throughout the world with the exception of Europe, which was down about 18%, record performance, really, in an uncertain economic environment.
Next slide. In the Q2 income statement, you'll see orders were $763 million, up 7% organically. Revenue book-to-bill came in at 1.05. Gross profit was up 100 basis points to 54.9% from 53.9 a year ago, and our operating income was an amazing 24.7%, up 130 basis points for a year ago. Our interest expense is about flat. Tax rate was consistent with the guidance we established for the quarter, came in at 29.6%, and net earnings were $115million versus $102 million last year, up 13%.
Next slide. If we look at our EBITDA performance, our trailing 12 months EBITDA has now reached $845 million. It's up from last year's trailing number this time of $739 million and 2 years ago, $540 million. So EBITDA is up 57% over the last 2 years, and our EBITDA margins continue to soar. We were 25.2% in 2010 and 29.3% on the trailing 12 months calculation now, and of course, this quarter at 29.5%.
Next. If we look here at the cash flow performance, you'll see Q2 cash flow at $119 million of operating cash flow and $109 million of free cash flow. Very good performance again to working capital. Our inventory actually improved by 30 bps from 7.5% to 7.2% of revenue, and our accounts receivable improved by 50 bps from 15.6% to 15.1%. And when you adjust that for payables and accruals, we were still below 7%. 
In the first half cash flow, it normally, our first half cash flow, is about 40% of the full year. This year, it'll -- the second half will be even a little stronger because of the acquisition of Sunquest and how cash accretive it really is. So you can see that our full year operating cash flow, we've now raised our guidance to be about $700 million for the full year. That'll put our operating cash flow at a -- at very high percentage of revenue. It could reach 23% of revenue, in fact. 
It's really driven by expanded margins. It's driven by the Sunquest acquisition that we expect to close in the last 4 months of the year and some cash tax benefits that we're acquiring in the Sunquest transaction. It does exclude the deal cost and refinancing charges associated with the new credit facility we put in place effective this past Friday.
And you can see here that free cash flow or operating cash flow goes up to $700 million. Our estimate this year up from $602 million last year and $500 million a year before. So that would be a 40% increase in cash flow over the last 2 years.
Next slide. On Friday, we closed the new credit facility, a $1.5 billion revolver. So if you look at our normal credit stats here, a year ago on 6/30/11, you can see that we had $196 million in cash and $595 million in an undrawn revolver, which gave us acquisition powder investment powder of about $791 million. When we closed out the quarter at June 30, our cash had increased to $519 million, and our undrawn revolver was at its capacity of $750 million, giving us $1.269 billion. As of Friday, with the new $1.5 billion revolver and the cash from the end of the quarter, we now have capacity in excess of $2 billion. 
Our gross debt, on the other hand, is only $1.069 billion. Our gross debt to capitalization is at 23.8%, but if you look at the net debt to EBITDA, you'll see it's actually been cutting in half from a year ago. It was 1.4. And at the end of the quarter, it was 0.7. Even with the financing of the Sunquest acquisition at $1.4 billion, we will have ample capacity to pursue other opportunities in the near term, and the pipeline remains very, very exciting.
If we look next slide here at the Sunquest details -- or sorry, the segment details, we'll start with the RF Technology slide. Next. 
So on RF Technology, really, a very, very outstanding orders in the quarter. They were up 18%. So those orders and the execution, really, in the toll and traffic business kind of got us up to the high end of our range, despite the European pressures, and helped us deliver. 
You can see the OP margin was amazing at 27%, up 290 basis points. And if you want to look at leverage, revenue was down 2% and operating profit was up 10%. So that would speak strongly to the execution that's occurring in those businesses. 
The software businesses continue to help us on the margin expansion as they grow. We've got a very significant win again in Houston. We're going to upgrade the entire lane hardware in the Houston area with our United Toll Systems technology, which is really an advancement over what was in place in the past. We think that contract ought to produce about $65 million in revenue between maintenance and the change-out. 
Our CBORD cashless system business continue to grow. It had a record quarter in the second quarter for it, for anytime, and that involve both university and food management wins in both higher education and healthcare. 
And we had -- of course, it's difficult headwind for our Technolog business, Gaz de France, which had that sort of onetime large install last year, and that held us back by about $5 million in the quarter. In the second half, we'll have the continued difficult comp with the Gaz de France, because it went throughout the year last year. But our increased toll project and maintenance activity that will be led by this -- these Texas wins will easily offset any challenges we have and the rest of those types of activities in the segment. 
And in the software businesses and the Software-as-a-Service activity, it's continuing to increase. And both iTrade and Freight Matching continue to roll along with the sort of nominal organic growth but outstanding cash growth.
Next slide. If we look at the Industrial Technology segment, gee, it's just, again, spectacular performance. Revenue was up 11%. The operating profit margins reached 30.4%. That's an all-time record for the segment. The highest previous we ever had was at 29.2% in the fourth quarter last year. 
This 30.4%, to just add some perspective around how amazing it is, the S&P 500 Industrials gross margins, as a group, were 30.8%. Roper's operating profit for Industrial is 30.4%. So we've got an all-time record here in OP margin, again, leveraged off the growth, terrific execution everywhere. 
Fluid handling continues to grow in both agriculture, food and the shale activity. Our general industrial markets have performed well. We're not seeing any early indicators of any softness in any of those businesses. 
The Material Test business, which is primarily a European business, actually had a record second quarter, very strong North America and Asia sales offset any weakness that we had in Europe. And the Neptune business continued to grow, driven by the Toronto project and some higher shipments in the U.S. 
In the second half of the year, we would expect that the shale activity growth would moderate, not stall, but certainly moderate, with gas activity on shale being down but the oil activity on shale being up. The industrial end markets, again, no signs of any falloff. The outstanding margins we expected continue throughout the second half of the year. And just a personal note to all our people and investor, we just couldn't be more proud of these teams as we watch them execute in a very tough market.
Next slide. If we look at our Energy Systems & Controls business, here, you can see revenue was up 6%; OP, up 7%. Margin at 26% was up 200 basis points from the first quarter margin in Energy. Organic growth in the quarter was 5%. Compressor Controls continues to do very well on LNG projects, and the field service activity that we do drove double-digit growth for them. 
The bolt-on acquisitions that we did in the last were very small, United Controls Group, Trinity and Cambridge, all have noncash amortization charges in them. They're actually putting a little bit of a drag on the OP margins, even though at 26%, it's hard to see a drag. But they actually would have been about 120 basis points higher in OP without all that amortization drag and integration on those 3 businesses. That said, they're performing well. They're all on plan from an integration viewpoint. They will add to growth in the second half of the year. 
Our European markets weakened. In fact, in Energy, they were down about 18%, but our U.S. was up by about 18%. So the U.S. business being larger, that was a benefit. And the rest of the world was quite strong in the Middle East and Asia, Australia. Brazil not quite as strong. 
Targeted cost actions are underway for the second half on a very selective basis, where people are executing some contingency plans in those things that relate to any softness that they see. We think Europe continue to be soft, but we'll have continued growth in both North America and Middle East and Asia to offset that. 
With the exception of our petrochem business, which is down about 20%, and that's a worldwide shortfall, we're not seeing any strength anywhere in that business. Very solid backlog, though, at Compressor Controls. It gives us confidence about growth in the second half. And then we would expect the normal, very strong Q4 seasonal activity in Energy would be repeated this year.
Next slide. So here we look at Medical & Scientific Imaging. This is one of those things where looks like nothing happened, but there is great variability throughout the different businesses here. And while revenue was flat and operating margin was up 20 bps, what really was going on is the Europe and the North American academic research funding softness impacted our camera portion of the photonics businesses. 
Cameras are not a big part of Roper, but they do come in around $125 million to $140 million with their total revenue. And they were down as much as 20% in some cases. And we don't see any real turnaround as it relates to these research markets for the camera technology businesses. And while they perform relative well, they certainly are drag on short-term growth. 
Our Medical businesses continue to grow organically. The channel expansion we've been able to provide them in Asia is offsetting any weakness that they have in Europe. And the Northern Digital business performed very well, expanding its offerings to OEM customers. And also, we were able to do a bolt-on acquisition in the quarter called Ascension Technology Corp., which is in the state of Vermont. And Ascension does 3D tracking for minimally invasive surgery, which you probably all know is a rapidly growing aspect in surgical applications. We paid about $18 million for Ascension. We expect it ought to deliver $3-plus million in EBITDA over the next 12 months. 
In the second half, we expect to have continued weakness in this academic research area, which will affect our photonics businesses. Fortunately, the Medical expansion is going to continue. Markets remain pretty favorable. Ascension will give us a little bit of a growth spurt for Northern Digital. 
The Gatan business have a substantial backlog, which we expect to be able to ship during the second half of the year, which will add to our growth. And then we have this transformational Sunquest acquisition, which will add substantial amount of revenue and EBITDA to our Medical platform. We would expect it ought to add somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 million of revenue in last 4 months of the year. It's going to add well over 35% to the Medical & Scientific segment for the next year in revenue. It's going to add quite a substantial amount to Roper's overall revenue base for 2013.
Next slide. So as we look at the Sunquest acquisition, I'll talk a bit about the transaction, and John will talk a little more in-depth about this specific business. 
Next slide. So if we look at the Sunquest acquisition, you can see that it meets all of our acquisition criteria. It's really an amazing fit, where we're able to take our software platforms inside RF and the medical platforms inside Medical & Scientific Imaging and hook them up in a very creative way with the Sunquest business, which is truly a software business but it's also a medical business. 
And if you look at our criteria, we talk about it all the time. Asset light, like low CapEx, absolutely. It's almost no CapEx, and exceptionally light-asset business. 
Focusing on the market structures and driving forces at work, we've done probably more marketplace diligence on this business. Because we actually looked at it in 2010 and have maintained  interest in the business forever and really felt that based on the work that we had done and the things that we thought they could and should be looking at and then seeing how they've done, our diligence revealed a lot of strategic competitive advantages that Sunquest enjoys, and they have a lot of whitespace opportunities for growth that are beyond our core traditional business. 
They've done a great job in transforming their business. It was acquired by Vista in 2007 and certainly was a high-margin business, but it could be better. And to the Sunquest leadership teams' efforts, they've done an incredible job in making that a transformational business that we're acquiring now compared to what it was in 2007.
The incentives is always linked to the commitments that the leadership teams made and those are in place. It has technology advantages that are clear and easily measured against competition, and it has very deep application expertise. It really is a niche business in the lab market. 
Management continuity is always as valued, and everybody on that team has agreed to stay in place. The communication for the Sunquest employees is taking place this morning in Tucson. We've asked them, as always, to preserve what's made them a very good company in core values that stimulate progress. In this area, the progress is going to come in the form of even more investment in the sales and marketing arena and some faster execution in the development area. 
This is a business that when we talk about growing, once you buy -- mind you, this business has higher margins than we do. It has twice the EBITDA margins that Roper enjoys. And when you look at those kind of margins and you recognize the incredible strength of the company, it has 2/3 of its revenue comes on a recurring basis. 98% of its customers sign up annually for the software programs that it has. 
It has negative working capital and very low CapEx. And we expect, in 2013, that it'll generate $140 million or more EBITDA for us. And the fourth quarter run rate, which they just completed their fiscal company May 31 and just had their audit and signed up prior to our closing, actually supports our expectations for '13 -- 2013 nicely. 
It's really a business, when John talks about it, you want to kind of think about, well, what do they do and where are they located and why do they win, because it is a phenomenal management team and outstanding group of employees that have really done things in this space that no one can really replicate.
So with that, we'll turn to the next slide and John Humphrey."

So just talk a little bit more about kind of what Sunquest is and what it is able to provide for its customers. They are the global market leader for providing the underlying software information solution for laboratories and hospital",425,"Sure. Thanks, Brian. So just talk a little bit more about kind of what Sunquest is and what it is able to provide for its customers. They are the global market leader for providing the underlying software information solution for laboratories and hospitals and large academic medical centers with a headquarter in Tucson, Arizona, locations both in the U.K. and a development center in Bangalore. They have a global footprint that allows them to serve that customer base. 
Who are their customer base? So those folks who -- for whom the effectiveness and efficiency of the lab is of critical importance. The lab ends up with, in many cases, hundreds of thousands of tests being done each month to support the diagnostic decisions that are made on the hospital, and they rely upon the Sunquest information and the quality and safety associated with that to help drive those decisions. 
Their comprehensive solutions is about improving the productivity with workflow automation tools. You see on the right-hand side both the Sunquest Laboratory 7.0 and the CoPath solution. Both of those are about workflow automation to make sure that the right test is done on the right patient at the right time, leading to the right diagnosis. So those things also reach beyond just the lab and also go out to the collection manager, which is one of the modules that Sunquest has. So that nurse has a point of collection tool that integrates back with the lab so you have full connectivity between both of those parts of the hospital.
The very large customer base, very high retention rates, over 98% retention each year, continue to utilize and depend upon their software set of solutions. And it's really supported by a 30-year history, and these are very long-term relationships. Relationships that are supported by the decades of application expertise that Sunquest has developed about what the hospital lab needs and their unique set of needs that Sunquest is going to be able to meet. 
And as Brian talked about, it's a proven team. It's a great culture. Everything that we learned through the diligence process continues to support the fact that their culture of excellence and execution is really phenomenal, and I think they're going to be a great addition to the team. And I think the company is very well positioned to capture the growth opportunities that they've identified over the coming years.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Brian to talk a little bit about guidance and the summary for the quarter."

So after we get the title sheet on guidance, we move to the guidance slide. We've raised our full year guidance to $4.84 to $5. That reflects about a $0.04 reduction due to currency. We had started out at $4.75 to $4.91. You might remember that $0.0",706,"Okay. So after we get the title sheet on guidance, we move to the guidance slide. We've raised our full year guidance to $4.84 to $5. That reflects about a $0.04 reduction due to currency. We had started out at $4.75 to $4.91. You might remember that $0.04 comes off the bottom of your $4.71 and $0.05 off the top here, $4.86, and we're adding back $0.12 and $0.14 on a GAAP accretion for Sunquest, excluding any of the deal cost. And then in addition, of course, we've got other things that we're absorbing and other things that are good. So $4.84 to $5 on full year guidance. The quarter comes in at $1.19 to $1.25 in the third quarter. Most importantly, really, is that we now expect our full year operating cash flow to be approximately $700 million. 
And just a couple of footnotes. You'll notice there the acquisition of Sunquest we expect to close at the end of August. We'll have the HSR filing. And since there is no competitive issues, it should move along quickly. 
We have some deferred revenue that's unusual in Sunquest and some of our some other businesses. When you acquire them, there are some GAAP issues around that. And so we'll have to -- we'll kind of reveal that to you each quarter as we report out. And this does exclude whatever cost we will have that will be registered in the third quarter that will be related to the acquisition and removal of the remaining amortization in the old revolver.
Next slide. So looking at the summary of the second quarter, we go back to the top point, being that it's, again, an all-time record for any second quarter in our history, highest level of orders, revenue, backlog, net earnings and EBITDA. Organic quarter growth at 7% was really a pleasant benefit for the quarter. The operating margin's at 24.7%, the EBITDA at 29.5% and gross margins at 54.9%, really terrific. Leverage is kind of breathtaking at 59%. We used to talk about 30% to 35% leverage, and it's hard to see how our leverage isn't going to be above 40% for a long time.
Doing a new revolver, a big help, $1.5 billion. The old revolver was put in place on July of 2008 and would have had to be replaced in July of 2013. So this removes any refinancing risk around that for next year. It gives us twice as much capacity to write checks against, as we had previously, and $1.5 billion is pretty sizable revolver for Roper. That was completed last Friday, a timely completion, we might add, relative to the deal closing on Saturday. 
Sunquest, a -- just an exceptional financial profile, higher gross margins than we have at twice the EBITDA margins, a terrific fit. You couldn't find a business that sort of marry what we're doing in software and what we're doing in Medical that would benefit both so much as Sunquest. It's got great development people. Our software people spent last week in Bangalore, visiting and talking with people. We've done tremendous diligence around the robustness of the software platforms in place for Sunquest and how they can be used. 
All of these then creates an opportunity for us to be positioned again in 2012 for an all-time record year, $700 million in operating cash flow. And perhaps, most importantly, the transformation process that we're doing here continues as we get more and more technology. If you think about where we are, and how we continue this, we have more technology content. We have higher margins, higher cash returns, more recurring revenue and just a much different company than what you would've looked at in 2002. And then in the next 5 years, we added Neptune and TransCore. And then if you look at 2007 and you look at the forward 5 years here to 2012, you've picked up CBORD and Horizon and iTrade and Technolog and, now, Sunquest. So the technology content gets better, margins get better, cash return gets better and the available forward acquisition powder for growth will be better than it ever has been in the past. 
And with that, I think we're ready for questions."

There's just a little bit of activity, mostly in petrochem and oil and gas, that we're going to do some very modest internal retrenchment on. But on balance, it's pretty good. We never really talk about a quarter in which we're in, but I would say things remain pretty decent. We're going to expect -- organic growth actually kind of picked up in the second quarter, and we would expect it to continue to be mid-single digits, really, for the rest of the year.

Here, again, we've picked out a niche that we think is unrelated to that activity, and this niche has got an opportunity, very high return, for people investing in this, in the hospital space and in the clinic space and in private care space. Basically, lab work is critical to every aspects of people diagnosing folks, and it happens in a variety of different places. We think we have the preeminent technology to do that, and we think we can make people more productive and more efficient than what they do when they do it. It has been hard, I think, the last couple of years to get the attention of hospitals that have had these mandates to do a variety of thing around health records. Now they get a chance to make an investment in things like this business, so it'll give them an actual return. So we think it's got pretty exciting growth. And these guys, they've -- they have brought in a new sales executive, a woman who we have great confidence in, that we think is going to drive better focus on organic growth.

That growth is moderating, but it's not totally negative at all. That's a pretty small part of the overall enterprise. And our Roper Pump business continues to grow quite substantially. So I think -- gosh, I'm just not really at all close to Gardner Denver, but I think they're building a lot of stuff that maybe is going into rental and platforms and that stuff. We have some rental business with Cornell, but it's not the core component of what we do. So we're still making pumps for waste water activity, agricultural irrigation and those kind of things."

22751,213643538,334506,"Roper Industries Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2012",2012-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Well, good morning, everybody.

Today, we'll go through the enterprise financial results for the quarter, talk a little bit about specific segment detail and the outlook for each of the segments, give you an overview of the Sunquest acquisition and then establish our third quarter and full year guidance and take your questions. 
I think we had indicated in our first quarter call that we expected going into the second quarter would be our most difficult challenge for the year. We had really an outstanding quarter compared to what we expected because we had quite a few headwinds this quarter. Certainly, we had the uncertain economy and were able to blow through that. 
We had very difficult comps going into Q2 because of the Gaz de France revenue last year and outsized performance and toll tag shipments last year in our Gatan technology business that we knew wouldn't be repeated. And then of course, we had currency, which became a bigger surprise than we expected. It cost us about $0.01 a share versus our guidance and about $0.02 a share versus the prior year. That said, let's look at what we did in Q2.
Next slide. We had record results in the second quarter, pretty well across-the-board, highest level of orders in our history, highest level of sales in our history in the second quarter, biggest backlog that we've entered the second quarter with, record net earnings and record EBITDA performance for the quarter. 
Our orders were up 8%, and revenue was up 4%, despite those headwinds and the effect of currency. Our book-to-bill ratio was actually quite high at 1.05. Our gross margins reached 54.9% in the quarter, and our operating margin was really quite spectacular. It came up 130 basis points to 24.7%. 
If you look at the incremental OP and the incremental sales, our operating leverage in the quarter was 59%, and there are no smoke and mirrors in that. It's just 59%. Our EBITDA was up 214 -- or sorry, was $214 million, and our EBITDA margin reached 29.5%. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $119 million, slightly lower than we would expect in the second quarter, but we had a higher cash tax rate, and that won't happen again in the rest of the year. Our first half operating cash flow was $261 million, and we’ll project what we believe it will be for the full year later this morning.
Our diluted earnings per share were $1.15 versus $1.03 last year. That $1.15 would've been $0.01 higher if -- based on our guidance, if it weren't for the currency scenario. And the $1.03 is the number that we used with the remeasurement gain last year. You might remember, it was about $0.05 a share. So on GAAP, it would have been $1.08, but it was really adjusted at $1.03. 
Net earnings were up 13%. We're very happy with the performance because we had about $30 million headwind between our scientific camera business and Gaz de France and some European activity coming into the quarter, and we were able to really blow through that. Very solid revenue throughout the world with the exception of Europe, which was down about 18%. Record performance, really, in an uncertain economic environment.
Next slide. In the Q2 income statement, you'll see orders were $763 million, up 7% organically. Revenue book-to-bill came in at 1.05. Gross profit was up 100 basis points to 54.9% from 53.9% a year ago, and our operating income was an amazing 24.7%, up 130 basis points for a year ago. Our interest expense is about flat. Tax rate was consistent with the guidance we established for the quarter, came in at 29.6%, and net earnings were $115 million versus $102 million last year, up 13%.
Next slide. If we look at our EBITDA performance, our trailing 12 months EBITDA has now reached $845 million. It's up from last year's trailing number at this time of $739 million and, 2 years ago, $540 million. So EBITDA is up 57% over the last 2 years, and our EBITDA margins continue to soar. We were 25.2% in 2010 and 29.3% on the trailing 12 months calculation now, and of course, this quarter at 29.5%.
Next. If we look here at the cash flow performance, you'll see Q2 cash flow at $119 million of operating cash flow and $109 million of free cash flow. Very good performance again in working capital. Our inventory actually improved by 30 bps from 7.5% to 7.2% of revenue, and our accounts receivable improved by 50 bps from 15.6% to 15.1%. And when you adjust that for payables and accruals, we were still below 7%. 
In the first half cash flow, normally, our first half cash flow, is about 40% of the full year. This year, it'll -- the second half will be even a little stronger because of the acquisition of Sunquest and how cash accretive it really is. So you can see that our full year operating cash flow, we've now raised our guidance to be about $700 million for the full year. That'll put our operating cash flow at a very high percentage of revenue. It could reach 23% of revenue, in fact. 
It's really driven by expanded margins. It's driven by the Sunquest acquisition that we expect to close in the last 4 months of the year and some cash tax benefits that we're acquiring in the Sunquest transaction. It does exclude the deal cost and refinancing charges associated with the new credit facility we put in place effective this past Friday.
And you can see here that free cash -- or operating cash flow goes up to $700 million, our estimate this year up from $602 million last year and $500 million the year before. So that would be a 40% increase in cash flow over the last 2 years.
Next slide. On Friday, we closed a new credit facility, a $1.5 billion revolver. So if you look at our normal credit stats here, a year ago on 6/30/11, you can see that we had $196 million in cash and $595 million in an undrawn revolver, which gave us acquisition powder, investment powder of about $791 million. When we closed out the quarter on June 30, our cash had increased to $519 million, and our undrawn revolver was at its capacity at $750 million, giving us $1.269 billion. As of Friday, with the new $1.5 billion revolver and the cash from the end of the quarter, we now have capacity in excess of $2 billion. 
Our gross debt, on the other hand, is only $1.069 billion. Our gross debt to capitalization is at 23.8%, but if you look at the net debt to EBITDA, you'll see it's actually been cut in half from a year ago. It was 1.4. And at the end of the quarter, it was 0.7. Even with the financing of the Sunquest acquisition at $1.4 billion, we will have ample capacity to pursue other opportunities in the near term, and the pipeline remains very, very exciting.
If we look next slide here at the Sunquest details -- or sorry, the segment details, we'll start with the RF Technology slide. Next. 
So on RF Technology, really, very, very outstanding orders in the quarter. They were up 18%. So those orders and the execution, really, in the toll and traffic business kind of got us up to the high end of our range, despite the European pressures, and helped us deliver. 
You can see the OP margin was amazing at 27%, up 290 basis points. And if you want to look at leverage, revenue was down 2%, and operating profit was up 10%. So that would speak strongly to the execution that's occurring in those businesses. 
The software businesses continue to help us on the margin expansion as they grow. We got a very significant win again in Houston. We're going to upgrade the entire lane hardware in the Houston area with our United Toll Systems technology, which is really an advancement over what was in place in the past. We think that contract ought to produce about $65 million in revenue between maintenance and the change-out. 
Our CBORD cashless system business continued to grow. It had a record quarter in the second quarter for it, for anytime, and that involved both university and food management wins in both higher education and healthcare. 
And we had, of course, this difficult headwind for our Technolog business, Gaz de France, which had that sort of onetime large install last year, and that held us back by about $5 million in the quarter. In the second half, we'll have the continued difficult comp with the Gaz de France because it went throughout the year last year. But our increased toll project and maintenance activity that will be led by this -- these Texas wins will easily offset any challenges we have and the rest of those types of activities in the segment. 
And then software businesses and the Software-as-a-Service activity is continuing to increase. And both iTrade and Freight Matching continue to roll along with the sort of nominal organic growth but outstanding cash growth.
Next slide. If we look at the Industrial Technology segment, gee, it's just, again, spectacular performance. Revenue was up 11%. The operating profit margins reached 30.4%. That's an all-time record for the segment. The highest previous we ever had was at 29.2% in the fourth quarter last year. 
This 30.4%, to just add some perspective around how amazing it is, the S&P 500 Industrials gross margins, as a group, were 30.8%. Roper's operating profit for Industrial is 30.4%. So we've got an all-time record here in OP margin, again, leveraged off the growth, terrific execution everywhere. 
Fluid handling continues to grow in both agriculture, food and the shale activity. Our general industrial markets have performed well. We're not seeing any early indicators of any softness in any of those businesses. 
The Material Test business, which is primarily a European business, actually had a record second quarter. Very strong North America and Asia sales offset any weakness that we had in Europe. And the Neptune business continued to grow, driven by the Toronto project and some higher shipments in the U.S. 
In the second half of the year, we would expect that the shale activity growth would moderate, not stall, but certainly moderate, with the gas activity on shale being down but the oil activity on shale being up. The industrial end markets, again, no signs of any falloff. The outstanding margins we expect to continue throughout the second half of the year. And just a personal note to all our people in Industrial, we just couldn't be more proud of these teams as we watch them execute in a very tough market.
Next slide. If we look at our Energy Systems & Controls business, here, you can see revenue was up 6%; OP, up 7%. Margin at 26% was up 200 basis points from the first quarter margin in Energy. Organic growth in the quarter was 5%. Compressor Controls continues to do very well on LNG projects, and the field service activity that we do drove double-digit growth for them. 
The bolt-on acquisitions that we did in the last year were very small, United Controls Group, Trinity and Cambridge, all have noncash amortization charges in them. They're actually putting a little bit of a drag on the OP margins, even though at 26%, it's hard to see a drag. But they actually would have been about 120 basis points higher in OP without all that amortization drag and integration on those 3 businesses. That said, they're performing well. They're all on plan from an integration viewpoint. They will add to growth in the second half of the year. 
Our European markets weakened. In fact, in Energy, they were down about 18%, but our U.S. was up by about 18%. So the U.S. business being larger, that was a benefit. And the rest of the world was quite strong in the Middle East and Asia, Australia. Brazil not quite as strong. 
Targeted cost actions are underway for the second half on a very selected basis, where people are executing some contingency plans in those things that relate to any softness that they see. We think Europe continued to be soft, but we'll have continued growth in both North America and Middle East and Asia to offset that. 
With the exception of our petrochem business, which is down about 20%, and that's a worldwide shortfall, we're not seeing any strength anywhere in that business. Very solid backlog, though, at Compressor Controls. It gives us confidence about growth in the second half. And then we would expect the normal, very strong Q4 seasonal activity in Energy would be repeated this year.
Next slide. So here we’ll look at Medical & Scientific Imaging. This is one of those things where it looks like nothing happened, but there is great variability throughout the different businesses here. And while revenue was flat and operating margin was up 20 bps, what really was going on is that Europe and the North American academic research funding softness impacted our camera portion of the photonics businesses. 
Cameras are not a big part of Roper, but they do come in around $125 million to $140 million worth of total revenue. And they were down as much as 20% in some cases. And we don't see any real turnaround as it relates to these research markets for the camera technology businesses. And while they perform relative well, they certainly are a drag on short-term growth. 
Our Medical businesses continue to grow organically. The channel expansion that we've been able to provide them in Asia is offsetting any weakness that they have in Europe. And the Northern Digital business performed very well, expanding its offerings to OEM customers. And also, we were able to do a bolt-on acquisition in the quarter called Ascension Technology Corp., which is in the state of Vermont. And Ascension does 3D tracking for minimally invasive surgery, which you probably all know is a rapidly growing aspect in surgical applications. We paid about $18 million for Ascension. We expect it ought to deliver $3-plus million in EBITDA over the next 12 months. 
In the second half, we expect to have continued weakness in this academic research area, which will affect our photonics businesses. Fortunately, the Medical expansion is going to continue. Markets remain pretty favorable. Ascension will give us a little bit of a growth spurt for Northern Digital. 
The Gatan business has a substantial backlog, which we expect to be able to ship during the second half of the year, which will add to our growth. And then we have this transformational Sunquest acquisition, which will add substantial amount of revenue and EBITDA to our Medical platform. We would expect it ought to add somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 million of revenue in last 4 months of the year. It's going to add well over 35% to the Medical & Scientific segment for the next year in revenue. It's going to add quite a substantial amount to Roper's overall revenue base for 2013.
Next slide. So as we look at the Sunquest acquisition, I'll talk a bit about the transaction, and John will talk a little more in-depth about the specific business. 
Next slide. So if we look at the Sunquest acquisition, you can see that it meets all of our acquisition criteria. It's really an amazing fit, where we're able to take our software platforms inside RF and the medical platforms inside Medical & Scientific Imaging and hook them up in a very creative way with the Sunquest business, which is truly a software business but it's also a medical business. 
And if you look at our criteria, we talk about all the time, asset light, low CapEx, absolutely. It's almost no CapEx and exceptionally light-asset business. 
Focusing on the market structures and driving forces at work, we've done probably more marketplace diligence on this business. Because we actually looked at it in 2010 and have maintained an interest in the business forever and really felt that based on the work that we had done and the things that we thought they could and should be looking at and then seeing how they've done, our diligence revealed a lot of strategic competitive advantages that Sunquest enjoys, and they have a lot of whitespace opportunities for growth that are beyond their core traditional business. 
They've done a great job in transforming their business. It was acquired by Vista in 2007 and certainly was a high-margin business, but it could be better. And to the Sunquest leadership teams’ efforts, they've done an incredible job in making that a transformational business that we're acquiring now compared to what it was in 2007.
The incentives, as always, are linked to the commitments that the leadership teams made, and those are in place. It has technology advantages that are clear and easily measured against competition, and it has very deep application expertise. It really is a niche business in the lab market. 
Management continuity, as always, is valued, and everybody on that team has agreed to stay in place. The communication for the Sunquest employees is taking place this morning in Tucson. We've asked them, as always, to preserve what's made them a very good company in core values that stimulate progress. In this area, the progress is going to come in the form of even more investment in the sales and marketing arena and some faster execution in the development area. 
This is a business that when we talk about growing what you buy -- my goodness, this business has higher margins than we do. It has twice the EBITDA margins that Roper enjoys. And when you look at those kind of margins and you recognize the incredible strength of the company, it has -- 2/3 of its revenue comes on a recurring basis. 98% of its customers sign up annually for the software programs that it has. 
It has negative working capital and very low CapEx. And we expect, in 2013, that it'll generate $140 million or more EBITDA for us. The fourth quarter run rate, which they just completed their fiscal company May 31 and just had their audit and signed up prior to our closing, actually supports our expectations for '13 -- 2013 nicely. 
It's really a business, when John talks about it, you want to kind of think about, well, what do they do and where are they located and why do they win, because it is a phenomenal management team and outstanding group of employees that have really done things in this space that no one can really replicate.
So with that, we'll turn to the next slide and John Humphrey."
22751,213643538,334506,"Roper Industries Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2012",2012-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Sure. Thanks, Brian. So just talking a little bit more about kind of what Sunquest is and what it is able to provide for its customers. They are the global market leader for providing the underlying software and information solution for laboratories and h",426,"Sure. Thanks, Brian. So just talking a little bit more about kind of what Sunquest is and what it is able to provide for its customers. They are the global market leader for providing the underlying software and information solution for laboratories and hospitals and large academic medical centers with a headquarter in Tucson, Arizona, locations both in the U.K. and a development center in Bangalore. They have a global footprint that allows them to serve that customer base. 
Really, their customer base are those folks who -- for whom the effectiveness and efficiency of the lab is of critical importance. The lab ends up with, in many cases, hundreds of thousands of tests being done each month to support the diagnostic decisions that are made in a hospital, and they rely upon the Sunquest information and the quality and safety associated with that to help drive those decisions. 
Their comprehensive solutions is about improving the productivity with workflow automation tools. You see on the right-hand side both the Sunquest Laboratory 7.0 and the CoPath solution. Both of those are about workflow automation to make sure that the right test is done on the right patient at the right time, leading to the right diagnosis. So those things also reach beyond just the lab and also go out to the collection manager, which is one of the modules that Sunquest has. So that nurse has a point of collection tool that integrates back with the lab so you have full connectivity between both of those parts of the hospital.
The very large customer base, very high retention rates, over 98% retention each year, continue to utilize and depend upon the software set of solutions. And it's really supported by a 30-year history, and these are very long-term relationships. Relationships that are supported by the decades of application expertise that Sunquest has developed about what the hospital lab needs and their unique set of needs that Sunquest is going to be able to meet. 
And as Brian talked about, it's a proven team. It's a great culture. Everything that we learned during the diligence process continues to support the fact that their culture of excellence and of execution is really phenomenal, and I think they're going to be a great addition to the team. And I think the company is very well positioned to capture the growth opportunities that they've identified over the coming years.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Brian to talk a little bit about guidance and the summary for the quarter."
22751,213643538,334506,"Roper Industries Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2012",2012-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Roper Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Okay. So after we get the title sheet on guidance, we move to the guidance slide. We've raised our full year guidance to $4.84 to $5. That reflects about a $0.04 reduction due to currency. We had started out at $4.75 to $4.91. You might remember, if $0.04",706,"Okay. So after we get the title sheet on guidance, we move to the guidance slide. We've raised our full year guidance to $4.84 to $5. That reflects about a $0.04 reduction due to currency. We had started out at $4.75 to $4.91. You might remember, if $0.04 comes off the bottom, you’re at $4.71, and $0.05 off the top, you’re at $4.86, and we're adding back $0.12 and $0.14 on a GAAP accretion for Sunquest, excluding any of the deal cost. And then in addition, of course, we've got other things that we're absorbing and other things that are good. So $4.84 to $5 on full year guidance. The quarter comes in at $1.19 to $1.25 in the third quarter. Most importantly, really, is that we now expect our full year operating cash flow to be approximately $700 million. 
And just a couple of footnotes. You'll notice there the acquisition of Sunquest we expect to close at the end of August. We'll have the HSR filing. And since there is no competitive issues, it should move along quickly. 
We have some deferred revenue that's unusual in Sunquest. Similar to some other businesses, when you acquire them, there are some GAAP issues around that. And so we'll have to -- we'll kind of reveal that to you each quarter as we report out. And this does exclude whatever cost we will have that will be registered in the third quarter. That will be related to the acquisition and removal of the remaining amortization in the old revolver.
Next slide. So looking at the summary of the second quarter, we go back to the top point being that it's, again, an all-time record for any second quarter in our history, highest level of orders, revenue, backlog, net earnings and EBITDA. Organic quarter growth at 7% was really a pleasant benefit for the quarter. The operating margin's at 24.7%, the EBITDA at 29.5% and gross margin’s at 54.9%, really terrific. Leverage is kind of breathtaking at 59%. We used to talk about 30% to 35% leverage, and it's hard to see how our leverage isn't going to be above 40% for a long time.
Doing a new revolver, a big help, $1.5 billion. The old revolver was put in place on July of 2008 and would have had to be replaced in July of 2013. So this removes any refinancing risk around that for next year. It gives us twice as much capacity to write checks against as we had previously, and $1.5 billion is a pretty sizable revolver for Roper. That was completed last Friday, a timely completion, we might add, relative to the deal closing on Saturday. 
Sunquest, a -- just an exceptional financial profile, higher gross margins than we have at twice the EBITDA margins, a terrific fit. You couldn't find a business that sort of married what we're doing in software and what we're doing in Medical that would benefit both so much as Sunquest. It's got great development people. Our software people spent last week in Bangalore, visiting and talking with people. We've done tremendous diligence around the robustness of the software platforms in place for Sunquest and how they can be used. 
All of this then creates an opportunity for us to be positioned again in 2012 for an all-time record year, $700 million in operating cash flow. And perhaps, most importantly, the transformation process that we're doing here continues as we get more and more technology. If you think about where we are and how we’ve continued this, we have more technology content. We have higher margins, higher cash returns, more recurring revenue and just a much different company than what you would've looked at in 2002. And then in the next 5 years, we added Neptune and TransCore. And then if you look at 2007 and you look at the forward 5 years here to 2012, you've picked up CBORD and Horizon and iTrade and Technolog and, now, Sunquest. So the technology content gets better, margins get better, cash return gets better and the available forward acquisition powder for growth will be better than it ever has been in the past. 
And with that, I think we're ready for questions."

I think we entered the quarter with more concern than turned out to be justified. So those any like early indicators of things that would make us nervous that would be in Energy or Industrial, we really haven't seen that. There's just a little bit of activity, mostly in petrochem and oil and gas, that we're going to do some very modest internal retrenchment on. But on balance, it's pretty good. We never really talk about a quarter in which we're in, but I would say things remain pretty decent. We're going to expect -- organic growth actually kind of picked up in the second quarter, and we would expect it to continue to be mid-single digits, really, for the rest of the year.

We think people have been paying a lot of attention to Electronic Health Records and companies that are in the EHR space. Here, again, we've picked out a niche that we think is unrelated to that activity, and this niche has got an opportunity, very high return, for people investing in this, in the hospital space and in the clinic space and in private care space. Basically, lab work is critical to every aspect of people diagnosing folks, and it happens in a variety of different places. We think we have the preeminent technology to do that, and we think we can make people more productive and more efficient in what they do when they do it. It has been hard, I think, the last couple of years to get the attention of hospitals that have had these mandates to do a variety of thing around health records. Now they get a chance to make an investment in things like this business, so it'll give them an actual return. So we think it's got pretty exciting growth. And these guys, they've brought in a new sales executive, a woman who we have great confidence in, that we think is going to drive better focus on organic growth. It's been a very high cash contributor, and it's the same old situation. Private equity has done, in this case, a really amazing job with this business versus what they acquired in '07, but it can grow more. And it has -- it does have opportunities for share gain and expansion around the world. I mean, this business, it doesn't do much in certain portions of the world, and we do a lot in other portions of the world than they do.

So we have some transactions that are similar to this that we have been talking to people off and on about for several years. I think that depending on who owns the asset and what people think is going to happen between now and the end of the year around the tax structures, going into next year, you have higher levels of seller activity.

Joining us this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller, and Jason Conley, Head of Investor Relations for us. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We've prepared slides to accompany today's call which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. 
Now if you please turn to slide to, we begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page and as detailed in our SEC filings appear. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
Now if you please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on a non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures was included in our press release this morning and is also a part of this presentation, which is available at our website. 
The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures as talking about today is really made up of the following 3 discrete items: First, a fair value adjustment to acquire deferred revenue at Sunquest. For the quarter, this impact was $3.1 million to revenue and operating profit. This adjustment represents revenue that absent our acquisition, Sunquest would have recognized. We believe showing our results on this basis provides additional insight into the ongoing and recurring results of the business. 
Second, we incurred $6.3 million of acquisition-related costs specific to Sunquest. 
Finally, we recorded a $1 million non-cash charge to earnings in the quarter for the early termination of our credit facility. 
We believe discussing our results, excluding these 3 discrete items, provide investors with additional insight and improves understanding of the trends of our business. 
And now, if you please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

Net earnings were an all-time record as well as EBITDA and cash flow both on an operating and free cash flow bases. 
Our revenue was up 5%, but that included a $0.02 headwind on foreign exchange otherwise revenue would have been up 7% with organic growth up 3%. If you look at the operating margin expansion, it was really remarkable at 220 basis points up from what already best-in-class operating margins to 25.7%. 
Our operating leverage was kind of beyond remarkable and I have to put this in the spectacular category. If you look at incremental sales and incremental OP, operating leverage in the quarter was 67%. 
This really is attributable to the nimble business model that we have with break even analysis and various analysis. When we get to the end, we kind of talk about year-to-date just how well our operating leverage is going and why that is so important for the fourth quarter and into 2013. 
Our EBITDA in the quarter was $231 million. EBITDA margin was also 220 basis points, the 30.8% at the enterprise level. Our GAAP operating cash flow is $205 million over 27% of revenue and it's also up 23% from the third quarter last year and our diluted earnings per share were $1.24, up from $1.12 in the prior year. 
Cash conversion was spectacular. We'll talk about that with when we get into the balance sheet cash flow, but really exceptional margin expansion throughout the enterprise. 
Next slide. If we look at the income statement in Q3, I start out with orders being basically flat to the prior year, up $1 million and the reason for that is we've had a lot of variability book-to-bill over the last 2.5 years almost always due to just project pushouts coming in, plus we have that difficult gap to broadcom that finally goes away in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, book-to-bill is the same as it generally is and these quarterly variances we don't read too much into it as long they are driven by what happened with product bookings which we really have any control over. So orders were probably better than they really look in this chart. 
Revenue at $751 million was up 3% organically. Our gross profit moved from 53.7%, up to 55.9% remarkable 220 basis points improvement. 
And our operating income, who went up from the same another 23 5 to 25 7, another 220 basis points with that 67% incremental leverage. 
Tax rate was worse in the third quarter than last year It cost us $0.03 a share compared to last year's baseline numbers because we had fewer 10 40 roll offs in the third quarter of this year than we did last year and our reported $1.24 includes about $2 million of restructuring expense in energy that would added a penny if we would have excluded that to hit $1.25. 
Sort of a note July was quite okay and September was strong with August being kind of down, we'll talk more about that when we get to the segment so we actually feel better today than we did in the middle of the quarter. Our Q3 operating reviews were much more optimistic when we held those in October than our mid-quarter discussions in August. 
Next slide. Our EBITDA growth trend continues as you see. Our Q3 trailing 12 months EBITDA back in 2010 was $585 million. We've added $287 million to that to reach $872 million on a trailing 12-month basis now and question that we always get our how are you going to be able to hold this 25% EBITDA margins and our answer to our people and to everybody is we're not going to sell for 25% EBITDA margins, we don't have to sell for that kind of a number and here you see, we're up another 390 basis points in the last 2 years to 29.8% EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, 49% over the last 2 years. 
Next slide. On our Q3 cash flow, it's just simply spectacular. $205 million of operating cash flow represents 27% of revenue. $197 million free cash flow represents 26% of revenue. It's 15th consecutive year where free cash flow exceeded net earnings. You could see we moved up here from $437 million of trailing cash flow in 2010's third quarter to $618 million now. 
Year-to-date, our cash conversion is quite strong and we'll have an even stronger performance in the fourth quarter. 
Our cash conversion in the third quarter was 176% on a GAAP basis. It was 166% on a non-GAAP basis. And all these numbers are all-time record numbers of cash flow. 
Next slide. If we look at the Q3 balance sheet you'll see even after absorbing the $1.4 billion acquisition of Sunquest in August, we still have an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Cash has improved our undrawn revolver is less than it was or at the same as it was, down a little bit. 
Our trailing 12-month EBITDA that we're showing here at $779 million at September a year ago, $872 million now, that excludes any pro forma from Sunquest, which would add dramatically to that number. 
So when you look at the statistics around gross debt cap, they're 37% if we get net debt to net cap, it could be 32.8%.  
Our gross debt to EBITDA is only 2.4 and if you perform Sunquest, of course, it would be much closer to 2. 
We really have ample capacity to do any kind of transaction that we'd like to do and we still do a number of things in the pipeline that we're discussing look attractive to us. 
Next slide. We get into specifics around segment details here, next slide. 
In the third quarter, our segments performance was again remarkable. Across the board in all the segments, you can see gross margins hit 52%, 52%, 55% and 66% and you can see EBITDA margins within each segment they were all above 30% and all of those are just leading us with tremendous amount of flexibility with our balance sheet and ability to reinvest for growth in our existing business. 
Next slide. We start with RF Technology, which is our largest percentage of revenue at 29% within the quarter. You can see on an organic basis I had a modest fall off of 8/10 of 1% in revenue, which was really due to the specific pushout in a job we have and assets that we expect to start to deliver in the third quarter, which looks like it might even move to the first half of next year, but we had great margin expansion. As you can see operating profit was up 10% and operating profit margins were up 280 basis points. 
We had some project activity that we expected to come in that really cost us between $5 million and $10 million against what we thought was possible that we were kind of assuming it's going to come in to the first half of next year. Some chance that it could move in to the fourth quarter of this year some of that. 
Overall, the growth is really massed by 5% headwind from Q4 projects last year that were unusual to onetime install trend and very large installation project to Miami University receivable. 
Our SaaS-based businesses continue to grow in this quarter led by our Freight Matching subscriber base increase, which was quite substantial. 
These pushouts that we have had we have very high confidence that they're going to be entering our order book within the next 6 months. So once again, we feel a bit better about orders than are book-to-bill flatline number looks like. 
In the fourth quarter, we have growth expected to improve in our toll and traffic project activity based on the timing that we have and we know that our margin expansion as the SaaS business continued to grow as a portion of business will continue to give us improved margins. Got important job in the Middle East with one of airports most of the other things we have going on unfortunately we just can't talk about it yet because they're not public. 
Next slide. On Industrial Technology, we had organic growth in Industrial Technology of 10%. So we continue to perform frankly better than our expectations. It did have 3% of foreign-currency headwind. The operating margin there is just amazing. I mean our operating profit in the quarter was 30.8%. That's an all-time operating profit margin, which was driven by terrific execution as people are prepared to take out costs if there's any kind of downturn and just on top of every one of their variances. 
The next is Toronto project where we continue we're now about 25% complete with several years ahead of us. We have over 100,000 units installed in the field in Canada now. 
Our Fluid Handling business remained very strong in the quarter. The oil shale activity that we have around directional growing was technology there offsets the expected reduced demand we had on pressure pumps and the natural gas application. So that really came in stronger than we might have guessed. 
And our Material Test business has continued to grow both in North America and actually had modest improvement in Europe and Europe, as a whole, for the enterprise not just Industrial Technology actually on organic basis was flat in the third quarter where many people are reporting organic negative growth. 
In the fourth quarter, you'll see our outstanding margins. In industrial, we expect to continue. We do have some growth comparisons that are going to become difficult for us in the fourth quarter. At Neptune, we get a benefit possibly from modest improvement in housing starts, however, in the fourth quarter, that tends not to help out much. That's going to have to be more of once you have or turn to better climate activity in 2013, but that's going to be offset by a 4-year long program we have with individual customers that is rolling off and that's going to be about $5 million revenue headwind within the quarter. 
And then we have, of course, the follow-up in shale activity for pressure pumps in the natural gas application, but the rest of the activity industrial looks strong in the quarter. 
Next slide. The Energy Systems & Controls segment. It had organic growth of 4%, but we've got of course, being generally a lot of non-U.S. activity there. FX 5 3% [ph]. We had very solid margin expansion despite taking a $2 million charge in 2 of our businesses in energy for a little bit of retention and the cost share certainly good investment might be a tiny bit more of than even in fourth quarter. 
Revenue was up 5%. Operating profit was up double digits at 11% and the operating profit margin came in at 27.1%, up 140 basis points. 
The Compressor Controls business, which has always been project oriented and still is project oriented is growing its field service activity at such a fast as the field services beginning to change our book-to-bill ratio dynamics in the segment because the field services while it's not subscription-based, it certainly, is a continue input around activity. And then kind of a fresh benefit had nuclear plant inspection added to grow third quarter, which is the first time we can say something positive about Vtech in a long time. 
Refinery instrumentation demand though remain very weak and a lot of that is a European business activity. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect to have strong seasonal Q4 demand and the nuclear inspection activity is going to continue. It's already scheduled. And we expect to get margin expansion from both growth and some of the benefits of these cost actions that we've already taken. 
Next slide. In the fourth quarter, sorry -- in the Medical and Scientific Imaging business you see here this is where you are beginning to see the initial affect of Sunquest coming in. It will be -- you'll see that in a much larger way of course, in the fourth quarter and into 2013, but even given that, you can see revenue in the quarter was up 12%, operating profit was up 28% and the operating profit margin was up 340 basis point to 28.1%. 
Now acquisitions are 16% of that. We had actually a negative organic growth of 3% in the segment because of the academic research markets being down double-digit. 
The good news for us is that medical already represents more than 2/3 of the revenue in the segment and the medical is approaching much higher percentage in the total operating profit in the segment as the Imaging business has become far, far less important to our portfolio. 
The Sunquest acquisitions is completed. Off to a very good start around administrative and financial processes. It's absolutely been the easiest transition we've ever had with any acquisition at our history. We have very gifted organization of employees, not only from a marketplace and customer delivery perspective, Sunquest, but the administrative functions and processes are the best that we've seen in an acquisition any time in our history. 
We have mid single-digit organic growth in medical, driven mostly by OEM systems revenue out of our Northern Digital acquisition a couple of years ago and Verathon's client scope demand, which continues to be quite substantial. 
I mentioned the weakness that we had in the academic research markets, which primarily impact the camera businesses but platonic in general down double-digit. 
In the fourth quarter, those research markets are going to remain weak, but we finally lapsed them so the comparisons become easier. Some of those businesses actually have increased revenue in the fourth quarter over both the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the year-ago. 
We'll have continued strength in the medical platform. We get the full quarter benefit as Sunquest acquisition coming in there and quite a nice boost from Northern Digital on OEM products that we've introduced and arrangements that we've made with the important large brand manufacturers. We get a little bit of benefit from our extension acquisition, which is getting nested inside Northern Digital and then amongst continuing improvement out of Verathon. 
We will have your dramatic margin expansion in the fourth quarter as we get the benefit of some things we've done in the core businesses and then the much better margins that will be added to us as a result of the Sunquest. 
One little noise factor that we've seen in the administrative and the academic research market is around some people concerned about China with the Japanese and Taiwanese customers who frequently export there and the noise around that is something that's hard to calibrate, but does appear to be real. 
Next slide. So here we'll talk about the 2012 guidance and where we stand. Next slide. 
We look at the full year we've initiated a full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share number of $4.91 to $4.97. This raises the midpoint to 4 94. The mid point had been $4.92 on 44 to $5 number. 
Last year, our non-GAAP EPS was $4.29 a share. Remember we, had a remeasurement of gain of a nickel that brought the GAAP numbers from 4 34, dow to $4.29 so that midpoint represents more than a 15% increase in EPS but, of course, the real story for us is going to be the catch. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP number we've established $1.43 to $1.49. That gives us an improvement over last year's $1.23, somewhere between 16% and 21% in the fourth quarter. That midpoint of $1.46 is higher than consensus and if you'll hit the midpoint, you'd be about 19% above last year on a non-GAAP measurement and again, cash flow being more important, in our opinion, than the measurement. 
Very exciting thing about fourth quarter for us is we're going to hit a new milestone for Roper that we've never seen before where in the fourth quarter our EBITDA will exceed $250 million a quarter, meaning we'll have in excess of $1 billion EBITDA run rate in the fourth quarter, which we're quite excited about. 
Next slide. If we look at the summary of activity in the third quarter, you can see that we've got demonstrated all these records of delayed orders revenue backlog, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow. 
We had across-the-board margin expansion in all 4 segments, which was very comforting for us given the uncertain economic environment. 
Organic revenue was plus 3%. We would have liked to seen that a little bit higher, but when you adjust for the Technolog gap fronts in the core and a little bit of pushout in tolling, I guess, it was better than most. 
Gross margins, spectacular. We hit 55.9%. Our operating margins at 25.7%. Year-to-date, if you take the first 9 months and you'll look at the revenue, you'll look at the OP, you see that calculation you'll see that our operating leverage throughout the year is now above 50% of revenue. 
Now we used to talk about 25% to 30% leverage out of EBITDA and then occasionally, we get up to say, well, maybe 30, maybe 35. My goodness, it's above 50% through out the entire year at this point. 
Our free cash flow of $197 million was 26% of revenue. I don't think there's any people that could point to stuff like that. 
Sunquest we had very smooth transition, a lot of exciting opportunities we're already looking at some bolt-on things from that arena and doing some things we think will have big payoffs for 2013. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have ample capacity to continue to invest in transactions. We've got only record year that we know will deliver in the 2012 year, but I think we can now say we're positioned for another record year in 2013. 
So with that, I would like to open it up to questions."

The industrial business is the 10% organic growth in the third quarter, which is kind of comforting. We know what our challenges are in 2013 at behalf of some struggling activity unless starts to pick up Neptune that we need to overcome, but our toll and traffic businesses are going to be more robust next year than they have been. The medical scenario is going to be better. We have some great clarity around varies things that we're doing there. The seaboard is going to win at major Northeastern University that we can't yet announce. It's very important large opportunity for us.

The other thing is that they are of course, better than other people's businesses. The worst portion of the margin side of OP in the company. So if they're down they don't have kind of negative spend. It's not quite having any of the other businesses have negative variances.

We've continue to grow in the expense of the competitor in this arena and anyone that's close to those market space know that we've been gaining share and expect to continue to gain share because our folks are really focused on this space and are compromised with other possible things that this one competitor seems to be involved with. So it's really beneficial competitive environment, if you will, for seaboard that they're seizing on and we continue to beef up our delivery capability at seaboard. We had quite a bit of talent in the project management arena we have promoted somebody into the key role there and we quite happy with the way they're focused. I think our new software executive ad we have a Business Development architect that can help people think creatively about how to expand their existing product offerings as well. So I think it's going to be a long-term continuing contributor to the company."

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Jason Conley, who heads our Planning  and Investor Relations for us. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. 
Now if you please turn to slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on a non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures was included in our press release this morning and is also a part of this presentation, which is available on our website. 
The difference between the GAAP and the non-GAAP measures as we'll be talking about them today is really made up of the following 3 discrete items: First, a fair value adjustment to acquire deferred revenue at Sunquest. For the quarter, this impact was $3.1 million to revenue and operating profit. This adjustment represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, Sunquest would have recognized. We believe showing our results on this basis provides additional insight into the ongoing and recurring results of the business.  Second, we incurred $6.3 million of acquisition-related costs specific to Sunquest.  Finally, we recorded a $1 million noncash charge to earnings in the quarter for the early termination of our credit facility.  We believe discussing our results, excluding these 3 discrete items, provide investors with additional insight and improves understanding of the trends of our business. 
And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

We'll go through the Q3 enterprise financial results, which were really quite good, look at the segment detail and then take a look at our Q4 guidance and what the implications are for the full year. I'll give you",3124,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We'll go through the Q3 enterprise financial results, which were really quite good, look at the segment detail and then take a look at our Q4 guidance and what the implications are for the full year. I'll give you a summary, and then take questions from people. 
So next slide.  We look at the Q3 enterprise financial results, we had an all-time third quarter record for almost everything that counts, most orders in the history, highest level of revenue sales, biggest level of backlog, $1 billion almost again. Net earnings were an all-time record as well as EBITDA and cash flow both on an operating and a free cash flow basis. 
Our revenue was up 5%, but that included a $0.02 headwind on foreign exchange, otherwise revenue would have been up 7%, with organic growth up 3%. If you look at the operating margin expansion, it was really remarkable at 220 basis points, up from what already is the best-in-class operating margins to 25.7%. 
Our operating leverage was kind of beyond remarkable, and I have to put this in the spectacular category. If you look at incremental sales and incremental OP, operating leverage in the quarter was 67%. 
This really attribute to the nimble business model that we have with break-even analysis and various analysis. When we get to the end, we'll kind of talk about year-to-date, just how well our operating leverage is going, and why that's so important for the fourth quarter and 2013. 
Our EBITDA in the quarter was $231 million. EBITDA margin was also 220 basis points, the 30.8% at the enterprise level. Our GAAP operating cash flow is $205 million or 27% of revenue, and it's also up 23% from the third quarter last year. And our diluted earnings per share were $1.24, up from $1.12 in the prior year.  Cash conversion was spectacular. We'll talk about that when we get into the balance sheet and cash flow, but really exceptional margin expansion throughout the enterprise. 
Next slide. If we look at the income statement in Q3, I start out with orders being basically flat to the prior year, up $1 million. And the reason for that is in -- we've had a lot of variability in book-to-bill over the last 2.5 years almost always due to just project pushouts coming in, plus we have that difficult gap to broad comp [ph], finally goes away in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, book-to-bill is the same as it generally is, and these quarterly variances, we don't read much into, as long they're only driven by what happened with project bookings, which we really have any control over. So orders were probably better than they really look in this chart. 
Revenue at $751 million was up 3% organically. Our gross profit moved from 53.7%, up to 55.9% remarkable 220 basis points improvement.  And our operating income, went up from the same 23.5% to 25.7% , another 220 basis points with that 67% incremental leverage. 
Tax rate was worse in the third quarter than last year. Our cost is $0.03 a share compared to last year's baseline numbers, because we had fewer FIN 48 roll offs than the third quarter of this year than we did last year. And our reported $1.24 includes about $2 million of restructuring expense in energy that would have added $0.01 if we would have excluded that to hit $1.25. 
Sort of a note to -- July was quite okay, and September was strong with August, being kind of down within the quarter. We'll talk more about that when we get to the segment. So we actually feel better today than we did in the middle of the quarter. Our Q3 operating reviews were much more optimistic when we held those in October than our mid-quarter discussions in August. 
Next slide. Our EBITDA growth trend continues as you see. Our Q3 trailing 12 months EBITDA back in 2010 was $585 million. We've added $287 million to that to reach $872 million on a trailing 12-month basis now. And question that we always get are, ""How are you going to be able to hold this 25% EBITDA margins?"" And our answer to our people and -- say everybody is, ""We're not going to settle for 25% EBITDA margins. We don't have to settle for that kind of a number."" And here you see, we're up another 390 basis points in the last 2 years to 29.8% EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, 49% over the last 2 years. 
Next slide. On our Q3 cash flow is -- it's just simply spectacular. $205 million of operating cash flow represents 27% of revenue. Our $197 million of free cash flow represents 26% of revenue. It's the 15th consecutive year, where free cash flow has exceeded net earnings. You can see we've moved up here from $437 million of trailing cash flow in 2010's third quarter to $618 million now.  
Year-to-date, our cash conversion is quite strong, and will have an even stronger performance in the fourth quarter.  Our cash conversion in the third quarter was 176% on a GAAP basis. It was 166% on a non-GAAP basis. And all these numbers are all-time record numbers of cash flow. 
Next slide. If we look at the Q3 balance sheet, you'll see even after absorbing the $1.4 billion acquisition of Sunquest in August, we still have an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Cash has improved. Our undrawn revolver is less than it was -- or at about same as it was, down a little bit. 
Our trailing 12-month EBITDA that we're showing here at $779 million at September a year ago, $872 million now, that excludes any pro forma from Sunquest, which would add dramatically to that number.  So when you look at the statistics around gross debt to cap, they're 37%. If we get net debt to net cap, it could be 32.8%.  
Our gross debt to EBITDA is only 2.4 and if you pro forma Sunquest, of course, it would be much closer to 2.  We really have ample capacity to do any kind of transaction that we'd like to do, and we still see a number of things in the pipeline that we're discussing look attractive to us. 
Next slide. We get into specifics around segment details here. Next slide.  In the third quarter, our segment performance was, again, remarkable. Across the board in all the segments, you can see gross margins at the 52%, 52%, 55% and 66%. And you can see EBITDA margins within each segment, they were all above 30%. And all of those are just leading us with a tremendous amount of flexibility with our balance sheet and ability to reinvest for growth in our existing business. 
Next slide. We start with RF Technology, which is our largest percentage of revenue at 29% within the quarter. You can see on an organic basis I had a modest fall off, 0.8% % in revenue, which was really due to a specific pushout in a job we have and assets that we expected to start to deliver in the third quarter, which looks like it might even move in the first half of next year, but we had great margin expansion. As you can see, operating profit was up 10%, and operating profit margins were up 280 basis points. 
We had some project activity that we expected to come in at -- really cost us between $5 million and $10 million against what we thought was possible that we were kind of assuming is going to come in to the first half of next year. Some chance that it could move in to the fourth quarter of this year, some of that. 
Overall, the growth is really amassed by 5% headwind from Q3 projects last year that were unusual,  the onetime install trend [ph] and very large installation project that Miami University received. Our SaaS-based businesses continue to grow, in this quarter led by our Freight Matching subscriber base increase, which was quite substantial. 
These pushouts that we have had, we have very high confidence that they're going to be entering our order book within the next 6 months. So once again, we feel a bit better about orders than book-to-bill flatline number looks like. 
In the fourth quarter, we have growth expected to improve in our toll and traffic project activity based on the timing that we have. And we know that our margin expansion as the SaaS business continue to grow as a portion of the business will continue to give us improved margins. That important job in the Middle East with one of  the airports, most of the other things we have going on, unfortunately, we just can't talk about it yet, because they're not public. 
Next slide. On Industrial Technology, we had organic growth in Industrial Technology of 10%. So we continue to perform, frankly, better than our expectations. It did have 3% of foreign-currency headwind. The operating margin there is just amazing. I mean, our operating profit in the quarter was 30.8%. That's an all-time operating profit margin, which was driven by terrific execution, as people are prepared to take out costs if there's any kind of downturn and just on top of every one of their variances. 
The Neptune Toronto rollout continued, we're now about 25% complete, with several years ahead of us. We have over 100,000 units installed in the field in Canada now.  Our Fluid Handling business remained very strong in the quarter. The oil shale activity that we have around directional drilling will simulate technology there, offset the expected reduced demand we had on pressure pumps and the natural gas application. So that really came in stronger than we might have guessed. 
And our Material Test business continued to grow both in North America and actually had modest improvement in Europe. And Europe, as a whole, for the enterprise, not just Industrial Technology, actually, on organic basis, was flat in the third quarter, where many people are reporting organic negative growth. 
In the fourth quarter, you'll see our outstanding margins. In Industrial, we expect to continue. We do have some growth comparisons that are going to become difficult for us in the fourth quarter. At Neptune, we get a benefit, possibly from modest improvement in housing starts. However, in the fourth quarter, that tends not to help out much. That's going to have to be more of -- once you have or turn into better climate activity in 2013, but that's going to be offset by a 4-year-long program we've had with an individual customer that's rolling off. And that's going to be about a $5 million revenue headwind within the quarter.  And then we have, of course, the follow-up in shale activity for pressure pumps in the natural gas application. But the rest of the activity, Industrial looks strong in the quarter. 
Next slide. The Energy Systems & Controls segment. It had organic growth of 4%, but we've got of course, being generally a lot of non-U.S. activity there. FX sort of is like 3%. We had very solid margin expansion despite taking a $2 million charge in 2 of our businesses in energy for a little bit of retention. And they'll cost us $0.01 a share. It's certainly good investment, might be a tiny bit more of that even in fourth quarter.  Revenue was up 5%. Operating profit was up double digits at 11%. And the operating profit margin came in at 27.1%, up 140 basis points. 
The Compressor Controls business, which has always been project oriented and still is project oriented is growing its field service activity at such a fast cliff that the field service is beginning to change our book-to-bill ratio dynamics in the segment, because the field service is, while it's not subscription-based, it certainly is a -- continue input around activity. And then kind of a fresh benefit is that we had nuclear plant inspections added to grow third quarter, which is the first time we could say something positive about VTech in a long time.  Refinery instrumentation demand though remain very weak, and that -- a lot of that's a European business activity. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect to have strong seasonal Q4 demand, and the nuclear inspection activity is going to continue. It's already scheduled. And we expect to get margin expansion from both growth and some of the benefits of these cost actions that we've already taken. 
Next slide. In the fourth quarter, sorry -- in the Medical and Scientific Imaging business, you could see here -- this is where you're beginning to see the initial affect of Sunquest coming in. It'll be -- you'll see that in a much larger way, of course, in the fourth quarter and into 2013. But even given that, you can see revenue in the quarter was up 12%, operating profit was up 28%, and the operating profit margin was up 340 basis points to 28.1%.  Now acquisitions are 16% of that. We had actually a negative organic growth of 3% in the segment, because of the academic research markets being down double digits. 
The good news for us is that medical already represents more than 2/3 of the revenue in the segment and that Medical is approaching much higher percentage in total operating profit in the segment as the Imaging business has become far, far less important to our overall portfolio. 
The Sunquest acquisition's is completed. Off to a very good start around administrative and financial processes. It's absolutely been the easiest transition we've ever had with any acquisition at our history. We have very gifted organization of employees, not only from a marketplace and customer delivery perspective at Sunquest, but the administrative functions and processes are the best that we've seen in an acquisition any time in our history. 
We have mid single-digit organic growth in medical, driven mostly by OEM systems revenue out of our Northern Digital acquisition a couple of years ago and Verathon's GlidesScope demand, which continues to be quite substantial.  I mentioned the weakness that we had in the academic research markets, which primarily impact the camera businesses, but photonics, in general, down double digit. 
In the fourth quarter, those research markets are going to remain weak, but we finally lapped them, so the comparisons become easier. And some of those businesses actually have increased revenue in the fourth quarter over both the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the year ago. 
We'll have continued strength in the medical platform. We get the full quarter benefit as Sunquest acquisition coming in there. And quite a nice boost from Northern Digital on OEM products that we've introduced and arrangements that we've made with the important large brand key manufacturers. We get a little bit of benefit from our extension acquisition, which is getting nested inside Northern Digital and then a modest continued improvement out of Verathon.  We will have very dramatic margin expansion in the fourth quarter, as we get the benefit of some things we've done in the core businesses and then the much better margins that'll be added to us, as a result of Sunquest. 
One little noise factor that we've seen in the administrative and the academic research market is around some people concerned about China, with the Japanese and Taiwanese customers who frequently export there. And the noise around that is something that's hard to calibrate, but does appear to be real. 
Next slide. So here we'll talk about the 2012 guidance and where we stand. Next slide. We look at the full year we've -- initiate a full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share number of $4.91 to $4.97. This raises the midpoint to $4.94. The midpoint had been $4.92 on a $4 to $5 number. 
Last year, our non-GAAP EPS was $4.29 a share. Remember we, had a remeasurement of gain of a $0.05 that brought the GAAP numbers from $4.34, down to $4.29, so that midpoint represents more than a 15% increase in EPS but, of course, the real story for us is going to be the catch. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP DEPS number, we've established $1.43 to $1.49. That gives us an improvement over last year's $1.23, somewhere between 16% and 21% in the fourth quarter. That midpoint of $1.46 is higher than consensus. And if you only get the midpoint, you'd be about 19% above last year on a non-GAAP DEPS measurement and again, cash flow being more important, in our opinion, than the DEPS measurement. 
Very exciting thing about fourth quarter for us is that we're going to hit a new milestone for Roper that we've never seen before, where in the fourth quarter, our EBITDA will exceed $250 million in the quarter, meaning, we'll have in excess of $1 billion EBITDA run rate in the fourth quarter, which we're quite excited about. 
Next slide. If we look at the summary of activity in the third quarter, you can see that we've got demonstrated all these records of delayed orders revenue backlog, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow.  We had across-the-board margin expansion in all 4 segments, which was very comforting for us, given the uncertain economic environment. 
Organic revenue was plus 3%. We would have liked to -- seen that a little bit higher, but when you adjust for the Technolog gap fronts and the core and a little bit of pushout in tolling, I guess, it was better than most. 
Gross margins, spectacular, hit 55.9%. Our operating margins at 25.7%. Year-to-date, if you take the first 9 months, and you look at the revenue, you look at the OP, you do that calculation and you'll see that our operating leverage throughout the year is now above 50% of revenue. 
Now we used to talk about 25% to 30% leverage out of EBITDA, and then occasionally, we'd get up to say, well, maybe 305, maybe 35%. My goodness, it's above 50% throughout the entire year at this point. 
Our free cash flow of $197 million was 26% of revenue. I don't think there's many people that could point to stuff like that. 
Sunquest, we said very smooth transition, lots of exciting opportunities. We're already looking at some bolt-on things from that arena and doing some things we think will have big payoffs for 2013. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have ample capacity to continue to invest in transactions. We've got not only record year that we know will deliver in the 2012 year, but I think we can now say we're positioned for another record year in 2013. 
So with that, we'd like to open it up to questions."

But our toll and traffic businesses are going to be more robust next year than they have been. The medical scenario is going to be better. We have some great clarity around various things we're doing there. The CBORD's going to win a major northeastern university that we can't yet announce. It's a very important large opportunity for us. We have some things that are going on in projects that we know are going to come to fruition. So we -- all these things that are negative, we kind of have those scoped out in our opinion, unless there's some kind of much more precipitous fall off.

So that requires a little bit of investment for people, but not massive one. They are expensive people, because of where they're physically located. And then in terms of the order processes, they're always lumpy in CCC. There's not anything you could do about that. People order their technology from us with a long lead time, so it's not unusual to get an 18-month out order. We only book things that are shippable within 12 months, so we don't create a massive backlog and stuff that don't hit our next forward 12 months of activity. And we have a very strong knowledge about who we're working with in various CCC projects and what the likely outcome is going to be. Those tend not to be so much what equity projects.

Joining me this morning is Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Soni, Vice President and Controller; and Jason Conley, who heads our Planning  and Investor Relations for us. 
Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and also available on our website at www.roperind.com. 
Now if you please turn to slide 2. We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described on this page, and as detailed in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. 
Now if you'll please turn to Slide 3. Today, we will be discussing our income statement results for the quarter, primarily on a non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures was included in our press release this morning and is also a part of this presentation, which is available on our website. 
The difference between the GAAP and the non-GAAP measures as we'll be talking about them today is really made up of the following 3 discrete items: First, a fair value adjustment to acquire deferred revenue at Sunquest. For the quarter, this impact was $3.1 million to revenue and operating profit. This adjustment represents revenue that, absent our acquisition, Sunquest would have recognized. We believe showing our results on this basis provides additional insight into the ongoing and recurring results of the business.  Second, we incurred $6.3 million of acquisition-related costs specific to Sunquest.  Finally, we recorded a $1 million noncash charge to earnings in the quarter for the early termination of our credit facility.  We believe discussing our results, excluding these 3 discrete items, provide investors with additional insight and improves understanding of the trends of our business. 
And now if you'll please turn to Slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Brian Jellison, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. And after his prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Brian?"

We'll go through the Q3 enterprise financial results, which were really quite good, look at the segment detail and then take a look at our Q4 guidance and what the implications are for the full year. I'll give you",3131,"Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We'll go through the Q3 enterprise financial results, which were really quite good, look at the segment detail and then take a look at our Q4 guidance and what the implications are for the full year. I'll give you a summary, and then take questions from people. 
So next slide.  We look at the Q3 enterprise financial results, we had an all-time third quarter record for almost everything that counts, most orders in the history, highest level of revenue sales, biggest level of backlog, $1 billion almost again. Net earnings were an all-time record as well as EBITDA and cash flow both on an operating and a free cash flow basis. 
Our revenue was up 5%, but that included a $0.02 headwind on foreign exchange, otherwise revenue would have been up 7%, with organic growth up 3%. If you look at the operating margin expansion, it was really remarkable at 220 basis points, up from what already is the best-in-class operating margins to 25.7%. 
Our operating leverage was kind of beyond remarkable, and I have to put this in the spectacular category. If you look at incremental sales and incremental OP, operating leverage in the quarter was 67%. 
This really is a tribute to the nimble business model that we have with break-even analysis and various analysis. When we get to the end, we'll kind of talk about year-to-date, just how well our operating leverage is going, and why that's so important for the fourth quarter and in 2013. 
Our EBITDA in the quarter was $231 million. EBITDA margin was also up 220 basis points to 30.8% at the enterprise level. Our GAAP operating cash flow is $205 million or 27% of revenue, and it's also up 23% from the third quarter last year. And our diluted earnings per share were $1.24, up from $1.12 in the prior year.  Cash conversion was spectacular. We'll talk about that when we get into the balance sheet and cash flow, but really exceptional margin expansion throughout the enterprise. 
Next slide. If we look at the income statement in Q3, I start out with orders being basically flat to the prior year, up $1 million. And the reason for that is in -- we've had a lot of variability in book-to-bill over the last 2.5 years almost always due to just project pushouts coming in, plus we have that difficult gap to broad comp [ph], finally goes away in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date book-to-bill is the same as it generally is, and these quarterly variances we don't read much into, as long they're only driven by what happened with project bookings, which we rarely have any control over. So orders were probably better than they really look in this chart. 
Revenue at $751 million was up 3% organically. Our gross profit moved from 53.7% up to 55.9%, a remarkable 220 basis points improvement.  And our operating income went up from the same 23.5% to 25.7%, another 220 basis points with that 67% incremental leverage. 
Tax rate was worse in the third quarter than last year. Our cost is $0.03 a share compared to last year's baseline numbers because we had fewer FIN 48 roll offs than the third quarter of this year than we did last year. And our reported $1.24 includes about $2 million of restructuring expense in energy that would have added $0.01 if we would have excluded that to hit $1.25. 
Sort of a note to -- July was quite okay, and September was strong with August being kind of down within the quarter. We'll talk more about that when we get to the segment. So we actually feel better today than we did in the middle of the quarter. Our Q3 operating reviews were much more optimistic when we held those in October than our mid-quarter discussions in August. 
Next slide. Our EBITDA growth trend continues as you see. Our Q3 trailing 12 months EBITDA back in 2010 was $585 million. We've added $287 million to that to reach $872 million on a trailing 12-month basis now. And questions that we always get are, ""How are you going to be able to hold this 25% EBITDA margins?"" And our answer to our people and -- say everybody is, ""We're not going to settle for 25% EBITDA margins. We don't have to settle for that kind of a number."" And here you see, we're up another 390 basis points in the last 2 years to 29.8% EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, 49% over the last 2 years. 
Next slide. On our Q3 cash flow is -- it's just simply spectacular. $205 million of operating cash flow represents 27% of revenue. Our $197 million of free cash flow represents 26% of revenue. It's the 15th consecutive year where free cash flow has exceeded net earnings. You can see we've moved up here from $437 million of trailing cash flow in 2010's third quarter to $618 million now.  
Year-to-date, our cash conversion is quite strong, and will have an even stronger performance in the fourth quarter.  Our cash conversion in the third quarter was 176% on a GAAP basis. It was 166% on a non-GAAP basis. And all these numbers are all-time record numbers of cash flow. 
Next slide. If we look at the Q3 balance sheet, you'll see even after absorbing the $1.4 billion acquisition of Sunquest in August, we still have an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Cash has improved. Our undrawn revolver is less than it was -- or at about same as it was, down a little bit. 
Our trailing 12-month EBITDA that we're showing here at $779 million at September a year ago, $872 million now, that excludes any pro forma from Sunquest which would add dramatically to that number.  So when you look at the statistics around gross debt to cap, they're 37%. If we did net debt to net cap, it could be 32.8%.  
Our gross debt to EBITDA is only 2.4 and if you pro forma Sunquest, of course, it would be much closer to 2.  We really have ample capacity to do any kind of transaction that we'd like to do, and we still see a number of things in the pipeline that we're discussing look attractive to us. 
Next slide. We get into specifics around segment details here. Next slide.  In the third quarter, our segment performance was, again, remarkable. Across the board in all the segments, you can see gross margins at the 52%, 52%, 55% and 66%. And you can see EBITDA margins within each segment, they were all above 30%. And all of those are just leading us with a tremendous amount of flexibility with our balance sheet and ability to reinvest for growth in our existing business. 
Next slide. We start with RF Technology, which is our largest percentage of revenue at 29% within the quarter. You can see on an organic basis I had a modest fall off, 0.8% in revenue, which was really due to a specific pushout in a job we have and assets that we expected to start to deliver in the third quarter, which looks like it might even move in the first half of next year, but we had great margin expansion. As you can see, operating profit was up 10%, and operating profit margins were up 280 basis points. 
We had some project activity that we expected to come in at -- really cost us between $5 million and $10 million against what we thought was possible that we were kind of assuming is going to come in to the first half of next year. Some chance that it could move in to the fourth quarter of this year, some of that. 
Overall, the growth is really amassed by 5% headwind from Q3 projects last year that were unusual,  the onetime install trend [ph] and very large installation project that Miami University received. Our SaaS-based businesses continue to grow, in this quarter led by our Freight Matching subscriber base increase, which was quite substantial. 
These pushouts that we have had, we have very high confidence that they're going to be entering our order book within the next 6 months. So once again, we feel a bit better about orders than that book-to-bill flatline number looks like. 
In the fourth quarter, we have growth expected to improve in our toll and traffic project activity based on the timing that we have. And we know that our margin expansion as the SaaS business continues to grow as a portion of the business will continue to give us improved margins. That important job in the Middle East with one of  the airports, most of the other things we have going on, unfortunately, we just can't talk about it yet because they're not public. 
Next slide. On Industrial Technology, we had organic growth in Industrial Technology of 10%. So we continue to perform frankly better than our expectations. It did have 3% of foreign-currency headwind. The operating margin there is just amazing. I mean, our operating profit in the quarter was 30.8%. That's an all-time operating profit margin, which was driven by terrific execution, as people are prepared to take out costs if there's any kind of downturn and just on top of every one of their variances. 
The Neptune Toronto rollout continued, we're now about 25% complete with several years ahead of us. We have over 100,000 units installed in the field in Canada now.  Our Fluid Handling business remained very strong in the quarter. The oil shale activity that we have around directional drilling will simulate technology there, offset the expected reduced demand we had on pressure pumps and the natural gas application. So that really came in stronger than we might have guessed. 
And our Material Test business continued to grow both in North America and actually had modest improvement in Europe. And Europe, as a whole, for the enterprise, not just Industrial Technology, actually, on organic basis, was flat in the third quarter, where many people are reporting organic negative growth. 
In the fourth quarter, you'll see our outstanding margins in Industrial we expect to continue. We do have some growth comparisons that are going to become difficult for us in the fourth quarter. At Neptune, we get a benefit possibly from modest improvement in housing starts. However, in the fourth quarter, that tends not to help out much. That's going to have to be more of -- once you have or turn into better climate activity in 2013, but that's going to be offset by a 4-year-long program we've had with an individual customer that's rolling off. And that's going to be about a $5 million revenue headwind within the quarter.  And then we have, of course, the follow-up in shale activity for pressure pumps in the natural gas application. But the rest of the activity, Industrial looks strong in the quarter. 
Next slide. The Energy Systems & Controls segment. It had organic growth of 4%, but we've got of course, being generally a lot of non-U.S. activity there. FX sort of is like 3%. We had very solid margin expansion despite taking a $2 million charge in 2 of our businesses in energy for a little bit of retention. And they'll cost us $0.01 a share. It's certainly good investment, might be a tiny bit more of that even in fourth quarter.  Revenue was up 5%. Operating profit was up double digits at 11%. And the operating profit margin came in at 27.1%, up 140 basis points. 
The Compressor Controls business, which has always been project oriented and still is project oriented is growing its field service activity at such a fast cliff that the field service is beginning to change our book-to-bill ratio dynamics in the segment, because the field service is, while it's not subscription-based, it certainly is a continuous input around activity. And then kind of a fresh benefit is that we had nuclear plant inspections added to grow third quarter, which is the first time we could say something positive about VTech in a long time.  Refinery instrumentation demand though remain very weak, and that -- a lot of that's a European business activity. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect to have strong seasonal Q4 demand, and the nuclear inspection activity is going to continue as it’s already scheduled. And we expect to get margin expansion from both growth and some of the benefits of these cost actions that we've already taken. 
Next slide. In the fourth quarter, sorry -- in the Medical and Scientific Imaging business, you could see here -- this is where you're beginning to see the initial affect of Sunquest coming in. It'll be -- you'll see that in a much larger way, of course, in the fourth quarter and into 2013. But even given that, you can see revenue in the quarter was up 12%, operating profit was up 28%, and the operating profit margin was up 340 basis points to 28.1%.  Now acquisitions are 16% of that. We had actually a negative organic growth of 3% in the segment, because of the academic research markets being down double digits. 
The good news for us is that medical already represents more than 2/3 of the revenue in the segment and that Medical is approaching much higher percentage in total operating profit in the segment as the Imaging business has become far, far less important to our overall portfolio. 
The Sunquest acquisition's is completed. Off to a very good start around administrative and financial processes. It's absolutely been the easiest transition we've ever had with any acquisition in our history. We have very gifted organization of employees, not only from a marketplace and customer delivery perspective at Sunquest, but the administrative functions and processes are the best that we've seen in an acquisition any time in our history. 
We have mid single-digit organic growth in medical, driven mostly by OEM systems revenue out of our Northern Digital acquisition a couple of years ago and Verathon's GlidesScope demand, which continues to be quite substantial.  I mentioned the weakness that we had in the academic research markets, which primarily impact the camera businesses, but photonics in general down double digit. 
In the fourth quarter, those research markets are going to remain weak, but we finally lapped them, so the comparisons become easier. And some of those businesses actually have increased revenue in the fourth quarter over both the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the year ago. 
We'll have continued strength in the medical platform. We get the full quarter benefit as Sunquest acquisition coming in there. And quite a nice boost from Northern Digital on OEM products that we've introduced and arrangements that we've made with the important large brand key manufacturers. We get a little bit of benefit from our extension acquisition, which is getting nested inside Northern Digital and then a modest continued improvement out of Verathon.  We will have very dramatic margin expansion in the fourth quarter, as we get the benefit of some things we've done in the core businesses and then the much better margins that'll be added to us as a result of Sunquest. 
One little noise factor that we've seen in the administrative and the academic research market is around some people concerned about China, with the Japanese and Taiwanese customers who frequently export there. And the noise around that is something that's hard to calibrate, but does appear to be real. 
Next slide. So here we'll talk about the 2012 guidance and where we stand. Next slide. We look at the full year we've -- initiated a full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share number of $4.91 to $4.97. This raises the midpoint to $4.94. The midpoint had been $4.92 on a $4 to $5 number. 
Last year, our non-GAAP EPS was $4.29 a share. Remember, we had a remeasurement of gain of a $0.05 that brought the GAAP numbers from $4.34 down to $4.29, so that midpoint represents more than a 15% increase in EPS but of course the real story for us is going to be the catch. 
Our Q4 non-GAAP DEPS number we've established at $1.43 to $1.49. That gives us an improvement over last year's $1.23, somewhere between 16% and 21% in the fourth quarter. That midpoint of $1.46 is higher than consensus. And if you only get the midpoint, you'd be about 19% above last year on a non-GAAP DEPS measurement and again, cash flow being more important, in our opinion, than the DEPS measurement. 
Very exciting thing about the fourth quarter for us is that we're going to hit a new milestone for Roper that we've never seen before, where in the fourth quarter our EBITDA will exceed $250 million in the quarter, meaning we'll have in excess of $1 billion EBITDA run rate in the fourth quarter, which we're quite excited about. 
Next slide. If we look at the summary of activity in the third quarter, you can see that we've got demonstrated all these records of delayed orders revenue backlog, net earnings, EBITDA and cash flow.  We had across-the-board margin expansion in all 4 segments, which was very comforting for us, given the uncertain economic environment. 
Organic revenue was plus 3%. We would have liked to -- seen that a little bit higher, but when you adjust for the Technolog gap fronts and the core and a little bit of pushout in tolling, I guess it was better than most. 
Gross margins spectacular, hit 55.9%. Our operating margins at 25.7%. Year-to-date if you take the first 9 months and you look at the revenue, you look at the OP, you do that calculation and you'll see that our operating leverage throughout the year is now above 50% of revenue. 
Now we used to talk about 25% to 30% leverage out of EBITDA, and then occasionally, we'd get up to say, well, maybe 305, maybe 35%. My goodness, it's above 50% throughout the entire year at this point.
 
Our free cash flow of $197 million was 26% of revenue. I don't think there's many people that could point to stuff like that. 
Sunquest we said very smooth transition, lots of exciting opportunities. We're already looking at some bolt-on things in that arena and doing some things we think will have big payoffs for 2013. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have ample capacity to continue to invest in transactions. We've got not only a record year that we know will deliver in the 2012 year, but I think we can now say we're positioned for another record year in 2013. 
So with that, we'd like to open it up to questions."

Europe's performed  a little better than we might have expected. The industrial business is the 10% organic growth in the third quarter, which is kind of comforting. We know what our challenges are in 2013, we’ll have some struggling activity unless housing starts picked up in Neptune that we need to overcome. But our toll and traffic businesses are going to be more robust next year than they have been. The medical scenario is going to be better. We have some great clarity around various things we're doing there. The CBORD's going to win a major northeastern university that we can't yet announced. It's a very important large opportunity for us. We have some things that are going on in projects that we know are going to come to fruition.
