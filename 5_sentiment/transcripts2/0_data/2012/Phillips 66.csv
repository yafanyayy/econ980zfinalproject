We're off to a solid start. This in transaction was executed flawlessly. We think it's a real tribute to the dedication and the capability of our Phillips 66 employees who are delivering on the things in operating results we expected when the company was put together. I'm really proud with what our employees have accomplished so far and have absolute confidence they will deliver industry-leading value creation. We have a clear strategy for growth, margin expansion and returns enhancement. We think with the right balance between disciplined reinvestment and shareholder distributions, we expect our return on capital employed to improve over time. Our approach to capital allocation balances our objectives for earnings growth while returning capital to shareholders. We're demonstrating our commitment to shareholder distributions the announcement in June regarding our first dividend, and this morning's announcement of $1 billion share repurchase program. We feel strongly that our strategy around returns, growth and distributions is the right one for our company, and we have advantage assets, organizational capability and the opportunity set and commitment to drive differential value creation. 
As Greg Maxwell reviews our second quarter results, you're going to hear that we operated with excellence. we Ran well at high utilization rates and turned in a solid financial performance for the quarter in what we've described as a positive margin environment. So now I'll turn the call over to Greg, who will take you through our second quarter results."

I'll get started with Slide 3. We successfully completed the separation with ConocoPhillips and began operating as an independent company on May 1. Our second quarter financials include one month of carve out financia",2413,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'll get started with Slide 3. We successfully completed the separation with ConocoPhillips and began operating as an independent company on May 1. Our second quarter financials include one month of carve out financials and 2 months of actual financials. The financials for April were prepared on the same basis as our Form 10 and our first quarter 10-Q.
As stated in our earnings release, we had reported net income of $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. The $236 million difference is attributable to special items including impairments and gains on the asset sales. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter were $2.23 per share. Cash from operations was $1.4 billion and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed was 18%. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a high-level look at our second quarter earnings. Refining and Marketing generated $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings. The $437 million improvement was primarily driven by much stronger Refining margins, particularly in the U.S. Mid-Continent and Europe. Midstream adjusted earnings were $79 million, which excludes the $170 million special item associated with the impairment of our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
On an adjusted basis, Midstream earnings were $32 million lower than the second quarter of last year. The decline in earnings reflects the reduction in equity earnings from DCP, which was primarily driven by lower NGL prices. 
Chemicals adjusted earnings were $242 million, and this excludes a special item of $35 million associated with the early retirement of $600 million of debt. Adjusted earnings improved this quarter by $52 million, primarily due to higher margins and lower utility cost. I'll go through each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation.
Corporate and Other cost this quarter were $89 million after adjusting for repositioning cost of $30 million. Our Corporate and Other segment consists of interest expense, staff costs, technology and other items not specifically identifiable to an operating segment. Details on our Corporate segment can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
Next, let's take a look at cash flow for the second quarter as shown on Slide 5. I'll backup for a moment and remind you that our March 31 restricted cash balance of $6.1 billion includes $5.8 million in senior notes that we issued in March. In April, we closed the financing on a $2 billion 3-year term loan, which brought our debt balance to $8 billion. 
As part of the separation, we made a net distribution of $6.1 billion to ConocoPhillips which is, as shown on the slide, effectively resulted Phillips 66 starting our with $2 billion in cash. During the second quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations with a minor cash impact related to net working capital changes.
We generated proceeds of $234 million from asset sales, primarily from the sale of our Trainer Refinery. And our capital program this quarter was $270 million and was largely focused on the Refining and Marketing segment. This resulted in the $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter.
Let's turn to Slide 6 for a look at that our capital structure and returns. At the end of the second quarter, we had $19 billion in equity and $8 billion in debt, for a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 30%. Our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed of 18% is up from 14% in 2011. This improvement is driven primarily by higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing segment and our Chemicals segment. And we ended the quarter with $27 billion in capital employed, of which R&M represented 76% of this total. 
Next we'll cover each of our segments in more detail, starting with the Refining and Marketing, beginning on Slide 7. The story in Refining and Marketing this quarter was that we ran well doing a strong margin environment. We are ran globally at a 93% utilization rate, which is the highest second quarter rate we have achieved since 2008. We also maintained a high clean product yield at 84% and realized higher margins in our Refining, Marketing and the Lubricant businesses. Our Refining realized margin of $12.56 per barrel is the highest since the second quarter of 2007, and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed has improved to 17%.
Let's turn to Slide 8 and look at the Refining and Marketing adjusted earnings. Adjusted Refining and Marketing earnings of $1.2 billion reflect significant improvements in our Atlantic Basin in Europe and Central Corridor regions as well as U.S. Marketing, Specialties and other. In the Atlantic Basin Europe region, earnings increased due to improved margins and lower controllable cost. Margins improved largely as a result of higher market crack spreads, while controllable costs were lower primarily because of the absence of operating activities at our and Trainer Refineries. Earnings in the Gulf coast were fairly flat as improved clean product margins were offset by a loss of a feedstock advantage, reflecting the narrowing LSS mile differential. The Central Corridor improved significantly this quarter due to higher margins, reflecting our advantaged feedstocks position in this region. The WCS discounted WTI and the increased amount of heavy crude processed at our Wood River Refinery following the completion of the CORE project the feedstock advantage this quarter. 
The Western Pacific region was lower this quarter as positive secondary product impacts were more than offset by less loss of a feedstock advantage, along with inventory impacts. 
Other Refining benefited from gains associated with Canadian crude imports as we were able to utilize our Pipeline Transportation capacity to take advantage of favorable WCS to WTI spreads. Results for this quarter also include foreign exchange gains that are not directly attributable to one of our other regions. From an overall Refining and Marketing perspective, the foreign currency exchange impacts this quarter represented a modest loss. 
U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other improved by $67 million due to higher fuel and Lubricant margins which were partially offset by higher cost. While internationally, earnings in Marketing, Specialties and Other were comparable to the same quarter last year. The next 2 slides highlight our performance in Refining.
As we turn to Slide 9, adjusted earnings increased $353 million this quarter. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and secondary product margins being only offset by less favorable crude differentials. Additionally, lower natural gas prices this quarter resulted in lower utility cost and were a key driver and a lower on overall operating cost. 
Let's take a look at our market capture on Slide 10. Here we look at our global market and the realized crack spreads. Overall, the market crackle was very favorable this quarter. Our realized margin of nearly $13 per barrel indicates that we captured 70% of the market crack this quarter, and we capitalized on these margins and by operating at a 93% utilization rate. The market indicator margin in the second quarter was $17.85 per barrel and assumes a 100% clean product yield. 
As you can see, our actual clean product yield in the second quarter was 84%, which creates the $3.03 adjustment shown on the slide. The $5.32 reduction from secondary products reflects the fact that the non-clean products we produced attracted a sales price, which on average, was less than the cost of our benchmark crudes. 
The feedstock advantage stems from running crudes and other processed inputs that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. Our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to the Canadian heavy and foreign sour crudes that we processed. 
The other category which contributed to our realized crack of $12.56 per barrel for the quarter primarily reflects the impacts from volume expansion. In the appendix, we've also included updated market indicator crack spreads for each of our regions.
So moving to Slide 7, in addition to running at a high utilization rate, this Slide shows our progress in been able to something increase our advantaged crude that's at our refineries well improving our clean product yield over 84%. Advantaged crudes increased from 47% in 2011 to 52% year-to-date in 2012. This is primarily driven by an increase in Canadian heavy crudes as well as domestic WTI price links streams. Including an increase in the amount of shale crudes that we processed. For example, year-to-date, we've averaged throughput of 120,000 barrels per day of shale crudes. Many of our refineries have the capacity to run price advantage Canadian crudes and we have access to multiple pipeline systems to reliably these crudes to our U.S. refineries and this results in a competitive advantage.
Moving to Slide 12. Marketing, Specialties and Other generated adjusted earnings of $234 million, an increase of $84 million from the same quarter last year. The improvement was driven primarily by higher margins across major product lines. On the fuel side, U.S. wholesale margins improved due to steep -- huge decline in spot-based product costs, which fell more rapidly than something product prices. Our Lubricant business also generated improved results as product costs stabilize during the quarter, compared with the rapidly rising cost in the second quarter of last year.
The next slide shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing income from per barrel improved this quarter to $4.37 per barrel while the cash contribution increased to $5.19 per barrel. These results are reflective of our running well this quarter and a very strong margin environment. 
This completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business or our segment. Next, we move to the Midstream segments beginning on Slide 14.
our Midstream segment was impacted this quarter by reduced equity earnings from DCP Midstream, offset by inventory gains in other Midstream businesses. However, year-to-date annualized return on capital employed continues in line with the last year's performance at 30%. We ended the quarter with $1 billion in capital employed in our Midstream segment. As mentioned earlier, we recorded an after-tax noncash impairment of $170 million related to our equity investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
As we move to Slide 15, Midstream's adjusted earnings of $79 million were comprised of $42 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP and $37 million from our other Midstream businesses.
Slide 16 provides additional vers explanations for both our DCP and on our Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of the slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP decreased by $48 million this quarter, mainly due to DCP's exposure to commodity prices. This was particularly partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense of attributable to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets. Volume mix was also very well this quarter as DCP process more liquids-rich volumes and little dry gas. Our other Midstream business improved by $16 million. Inventory related gains primarily contributed to this improvement.
Shifting discussion now to our Chemical segment, beginning on Slide 17.
Earnings for the Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, or CPChem. CPChem had another great quarter, it's best quarter ever, with adjusted earnings of $242 million. Strong performance is driven by improved margins, along with lower utility cost. Year-to-date, annualized after-tax return on capital employed increased to 30%, up from 28% last year, and ended we the quarter with $3.3 billion in capital employed in the Chemicals segment. 
The next 2 slides provide more detail on Chemicals earnings. This quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $52 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in Olefins and Polyolefins, partially offset by increased income taxes accrued by Phillips 66 on the equity earnings from CPChem. And this was primarily driven by the mix of foreign and domestic earnings. 
Slide 19 provides additional details on CPChem's operating segments. Olefins and Polyolefins generated income of $245 million in the second quarter. The $62 million increase was due primarily to increased ethylene and polyethylene margins and lower utility costs as a result of reduced natural gas prices. Specialties aromatic and earnings increased by $5 million compared to the same period last year, and this was due largely to improved benzene margins. This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the the quarter. Next, I will provide you with some out guidance for the remainder of 2012.
In Refining and Marketing, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the mid 90s, and our pre-tax turnaround at the expense of approximately $145 million over the second half of the year. In Midstream, the majority of capital expenditures, depreciation and interest will be incurred by DCP. For 2012, we estimate DCP on 100% basis will funding capital program of approximately $2 billion, with depreciation and amortization of $300 million and net interest expense of $170 million.

In Chemicals, we estimate that CPChem, on a 100% basis, will have capital expenditures and investments of approximately $1 billion in 2012, with depreciation and amortization of roughly $260 million and net interest expense of $10 million to $15 million. 
CPChem expects to complete the repayment of its remaining $400 million of the senior notes during the third quarter this year. 
Corporate and Other is expected to be at cost of about $125 million per quarter for the remainder of the year, including after-tax interest of about $50 million per quarter. 
Guidance for Phillips 66 for 2012 is capital expenditures of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, with depreciation and amortization of $900 million. Our corporate tax rate is a function of mix largely dependent on the amount of U.S. versus international earnings, and we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 35% for all of 2012. 
And finally, Phillips 66 does not have any debt maturities coming due in 2012. We can now turn to Slide 21 and I'll hand the call over to Greg Garland to take you through an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives. Greg?"

As we execute our strategy, we remain focused on our initiatives to enhance return on capital, deliver profitable growth and grow shareholder distributions. We're also committed to operational excellence and creating a great place to work. W",1017,"Thanks, Greg. As we execute our strategy, we remain focused on our initiatives to enhance return on capital, deliver profitable growth and grow shareholder distributions. We're also committed to operational excellence and creating a great place to work. We continue to provide metrics around personal and process safety, and environmental stewardship. 
As we said, we plan to reduce costs by eliminating spin-related disynergies by the end of 2013 and we set a target of $200 million. We're also working hard to create a great place to work for our employees. We value our employees want to have a place of mutual respect and collaboration. 
We completed the sale of the Trainer Refinery and we'll continue to work to optimize our portfolio. We did make the decision not to sell Alliance. We have a positive view on domestic Gulf Coast crudes becoming an advantage feedstock, and we think as this plays out, Alliance will create long term value in the portfolio. 
Earlier, you saw our crudes slate, which demonstrates the progress in getting advantage crudes into our refineries. We continue to work this hard because every dollar we can save on feedstock is significantly with our bottom line results. Crude and energy is greater than 70% of our cost structure. It's the single biggest lever we have to improve value. 
Some of our initiatives in this area, we talked about the railcar acquisition to get 2,000 railcars, but we've also worked agreements to allow us to more efficiently load and unload crudes of both the source sites and the refinery. We're also expanding our own infrastructure. For instance, to bring Mississippi Line crude into our refinery. And we'll work other deals in other areas to get more advantage crudes to the front end of our refineries. 
Besides crude advantage, we're working to improve access to exports. So far this year, we've increased our capacity to export about 14,000 barrels a day, so we have a current capability of 130,000 barrels per day. We're progressing about 4 different projects that are expected to increase our export capacity to over 220,000 barrels a day by the end of next year. 
We have some key growth projects underway in Midstream and Chemicals. In Midstream, DCP is progressing as NGL logistics and gathering and processing projects, 2 big pipes. One is the Sand Hills Pipeline that run from the Permian, in the Eagle Ford to Mont Belvieu, 720-mile, 20-inch line. Initial capacity of 200,000 barrels a day we can expand it up to 350,000 barrels a day. The Eagle Ford section is expected to be operational in the third quarter. This is about a $1 billion project. 
The Southern Hills pipe really runs from the MidCon to Belvieu. This pipe targeted capacity of over 150,000 barrels a day of NGL, at about $1 billion of investments. completion expected in mid 2013. Both these pipelines, once in service, will contribute to fee-based margins to DCP. 
DCP working on the Eagle plant and the Eagle Ford. It's a 200 million cubic feet per day gas processing facility. It's expected to be up in the fourth quarter, also have other gas plants on construction at the D. J. Basin, rawhide plant in the Permian and the National Helium upgrade and the Granite Wash, all scheduled for start up in 2013. In total, we expect DCP will spend between $4 billion and $6 billion in 2012 and 2014.
In Chemicals, CPChem has a 35% ownership interest in Saudi Polymers Company. This project was formed to execute a major petrochemicals project in Saudi Arabia. The facility will produce ethylene, probably, polystyrene and 1-hexene. Start activity progress with commercial production expected in the near future. This facility will have an annual capacity of 1.2 million metric tons of ethylene and 1.1 million metric tons of high density polyethylene. In the current environment, we expect this project will increase Chemicals segment's earnings by 10% to 15%. 
CPChem is also expanding its capacity at Sweeny by 22,000 barrels a day, so total capacity will be at 138,000 barrels a day. Expect completion of this project in the first quarter of 2013. This is roughly $100 million investment. 
CPChem is starting construction a 1-hexene plant at Cedar Bayou facility. this plant will utilize CPChem's proprietary 1-hexene technology. Annual capacity of 250,000 tons, and will be the largest of its kind in the world. We expect start up in the first quarter of 2014. 
CPChem also continues to progress efforts on its U.S. Gulf Coast project. This project 1.5 million metric ton per year ethylene cracker at the Cedar Bayou facility and a 1 million metric ton per year polyethylene plant, which will be built adjacent to CPChem's Sweeny facility. Polyethylene capacity will consist of 2 plants that will both use CPChem's proprietary technology. This final project approvals are expected in 2013, start up 2017. 
As part of our plans to increase distribution to shareholders, our Board of Directors declared a $0.20 dividend to be paid in the third quarter. We expect to have modest dividend increases in the range of about 5% a year. We want to look back in 10 years and say, we increased the dividend every year of this company. 
This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors have approved a repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding common shares. The shares are going to be repurchased from time to time in the open market at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan to hold the shares of stock as treasury shares. So all in, I think we have a solid quarter. We ran well, generally had improved margins going forward and I'm proud of me that employees, there's a immense amount of work done behind the scenes to get the new company up and running. our employees didn't take their eye of the ball. They executed well, they turned in an excellent results from operational excellence to a very management of the business in all aspects of the business. So that, we'll conclude and we'll open the line for questions."

We're running about 205,000 barrels a day of Canadian heavy today. That's 60,000 barrels a day of Canadian medium light. But 225,000 barrels a day of other WTI or TS-related crudes so that's about 600,000 barrels a day. Where I say TI linked crudes. On the heavy, we are running the heavy asset, the Latin American heavy, about 471,000 miles the date. So actually about 50,000 barrels a day reduced in this area. We've also reduced our exposure to Brent-related crudes by about 165,000 barrels a day all in. So as to think about where can we move crudes, we want to move the shale crudes from 120,000 to ultimately 450,000, 460,000 barrels a day. And we're trying to get those crudes to every refinery we can. But clearly, the Ferndale on the West Coast, Bayway on the East Coast, we think Ferndale can run into 250,000 of Bakken crude. Wood River what we run up to 90,000 to 120,000 barrels a day of shale type crudes there. about 60,000 barrels a day. Bayway, 100,000 barrels a day of shale type crudes that we can advantage and we can move into A smaller rodeo, we can get it 30,000 barrels a day, and Sweeny about 40,000 barrels a day and then Alliance we're running today, Eagle Ford crude and include in all lines.

And that's a reason why want to have maybe the on order for another 2,000 cars. So we are negotiating with other third parties to improve access for loading and unloading. Were looking at doing some of our own infrastructure for loading and unloading, so it's kind of fun and yes, we're running in today, 10,000 or 20,000 barrels a day in Bayway today. So the answer is yes, we like that we're trying to get as much in us we can we're looking at all their infrastructure, preferably if we can get third-party go somewhere else if not, we'll build it ourselves."

27306532,212568098,337260,"Phillips 66, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Phillips 66","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'll get started with Slide 3. We successfully completed the separation with ConocoPhillips and began operating as an independent company on May 1. Our second quarter financials include 1 month of carve out financials",2334,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'll get started with Slide 3. We successfully completed the separation with ConocoPhillips and began operating as an independent company on May 1. Our second quarter financials include 1 month of carve out financials and 2 months of actual financials. The financials for April were prepared on the same basis as our Form 10 and our first quarter 10-Q.
As stated in our earnings release, we had reported net income of $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. The $236 million difference is attributable to special items including impairments and gains on the asset sales. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter were $2.23 per share. Cash from operations was $1.4 billion and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed was 18%. 
Now, let's turn to Slide 4 for a high-level look at our second quarter earnings. Refining and Marketing generated $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings. The $437 million improvement was primarily driven by much stronger refining margins, particularly in the U.S. Mid-Continent and Europe. Midstream adjusted earnings were $79 million, which excludes the $170 million special item associated with the impairment of our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
On an adjusted basis, Midstream earnings were $32 million lower than the second quarter of last year. The decline in earnings reflects a reduction in equity earnings from DCP, which was primarily driven by lower NGL prices. 
Chemicals adjusted earnings were $242 million, and this excludes a special item of $35 million associated with the early retirement of $600 million of debt. Adjusted earnings improved this quarter by $52 million, primarily due to higher margins and lower utility cost. I'll go through each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation.
Corporate and Other cost this quarter were $89 million after adjusting for repositioning cost of $30 million. Our Corporate and Other segment consists of interest expense, staff costs, technology and other items not specifically identifiable to an operating segment. Details on our Corporate segment can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
Next, let's take a look at cash flow for the second quarter as shown on Slide 5. I'll back up for a moment and remind you that our March 31 restricted cash balance of $6.1 billion includes $5.8 billion in senior notes that we issued in March. In April, we closed the financing on a $2 billion 3-year term loan, which brought our total debt balance to $8 billion. 
As part of the separation, we made a net distribution of $6.1 billion to ConocoPhillips which is, as shown on the slide, effectively resulted in Phillips 66 starting out with $2 billion in cash. During the second quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations with a minor cash impact related to net working capital changes.
We generated proceeds of $234 million from asset sales, primarily from the sale of our Trainer Refinery. And our capital program this quarter was $270 million and was largely focused on the Refining and Marketing segment. This resulted in  $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter.
Let's turn to Slide 6 for a look at our capital structure and returns. At the end of the second quarter, we had $19 billion in equity and $8 billion of debt, for a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 30%. Our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed of 18% is up from 14% in 2011. This improvement is driven primarily by higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing segment and our Chemicals segment. And we ended the quarter with $27 billion in capital employed, of which R&M represented 76% of this total. 
Next, we'll cover each of our segments in more detail, starting with Refining and Marketing, beginning on Slide 7. The story in Refining and Marketing this quarter was that we ran well during a strong margin environment. We ran globally at a 93% utilization rate, which is the highest second quarter rate we have achieved since 2008. We also maintained a high clean product yield at 84% and realized higher margins in our Refining, Marketing and the Lubricant businesses. Our Refining realized margin of $12.56 per barrel is the highest since the second quarter of 2007, and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed has improved to 17%.
Let's turn to Slide 8 and look at the Refining and Marketing adjusted earnings. Adjusted Refining and Marketing earnings of $1.2 billion reflect significant improvements in our Atlantic Basin Europe and Central Corridor regions, as well as U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other. 
In the Atlantic Basin Europe region, earnings increased due to improved margins and lower controllable cost. Margins improved largely as a result of higher market crack spreads, while controllable costs were lower, primarily, because of the absence of operating activities at our Wilhelmshaven and Trainer Refineries. 
Earnings in the Gulf coast were fairly flat as improved clean product margins were offset by a less of a feedstock advantage, reflecting the narrowing LLS Maya differentials. 
The Central Corridor improved significantly this quarter due to higher margins, reflecting our advantaged feedstock position in this region. The WCS' discount to WTI and the increased amount of heavy crude processed at our Wood River Refinery following the completion of the CORE project drove the feedstock advantage this quarter. 
The Western Pacific region was lower this quarter as positive secondary product impacts were more than offset by less of a feedstock advantage, along with inventory impacts. 
Other Refining benefited from gains associated with Canadian crude imports as we were able to utilize our pipeline transportation capacity to take advantage of favorable WCS to WTI spreads. 
Results for this quarter also include foreign exchange gains that are not directly attributable to one of our other regions. From an overall Refining and Marketing perspective, the foreign currency exchange impacts this quarter represented a modest loss. 
U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other improved by $67 million due to higher fuel and Lubricant margins which were partially offset by a higher cost. While internationally, earnings in Marketing, Specialties and Other were comparable to the same quarter last year. 
The next 2 slides highlight our performance in Refining.
As we turn to Slide 9, adjusted earnings increased $353 million this quarter. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and secondary product margins being the only offset by less favorable crude differentials. Additionally, lower natural gas prices this quarter resulted in lower utility cost and were a key driver in the lower overall operating cost. 
Let's take a look at our market capture on Slide 10. Here, we look at our global market and realized crack spreads. Overall, the market crack was very favorable this quarter. Our realized margin of nearly $13 per barrel indicates that we captured 70% of the market crack this quarter, and we capitalized on these favorable margins by operating at a 93% utilization rate. The market indicator margin in the second quarter was $17.85 per barrel and assumes a 100% clean product yield. 
As you can see, our actual clean product yield in the second quarter was 84%, which creates the $3.03 adjustment shown on the slide. The $5.32 reduction from secondary products reflects the fact that the non-clean products we produced attracted a sales price, which on average, was less than the cost of our benchmark crudes. 
The feedstock advantage stems from running crudes and other processed inputs that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. Our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to the Canadian heavy and foreign sour crudes that we processed. 
The other category which contributed to our realized crack of $12.56 per barrel for the quarter primarily reflects the impacts from volume expansion. In the appendix, we have also included updated market indicator crack spreads for each of our regions.
So move to Slide 7. In addition to running at a high utilization rate, this slide shows our progress in being able to increase our advantaged crude runs at our refineries while improving our clean product yield over 84%. Advantaged crudes increased from 47% in 2011 to 52% year-to-date in 2012. This is primarily driven by an increase in Canadian heavy crudes, as well as domestic WTI price links streams, including an increase in the amount of shale crudes that we processed. For example, year-to-date, we've averaged throughput of 120,000 barrels per day of shale crudes. 
Many of our refineries have the complexity to run price-advantaged Canadian crudes and we have access to multiple pipeline systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our inland U.S. refineries and this results in a competitive advantage.
Moving to Slide 12. Marketing, Specialties and Other generated adjusted earnings of $334 million, an increase of $84 million from the same quarter last year. The improvement was driven primarily by higher margins across major product lines. On the fuel side, U.S. wholesale margins improved due to a steep decline in spot --  a huge decline in spot-based product costs, which fell more rapidly than posted product prices. Our Lubricant business also generated improved results as product costs stabilized during the quarter, compared with the rapidly rising cost in the second quarter of last year.
The next slide shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing's income per barrel improved this quarter to $4.37 per barrel while the cash contribution increased to $5.19 per barrel. These results are reflective of R&M running well this quarter and a very strong margin environment. 
This completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business or segment. Next, we move to the Midstream segments beginning on Slide 14.
Our Midstream segment was impacted this quarter by reduced equity earnings from DCP Midstream, offset by inventory gains in our other Midstream businesses. However, year-to-date annualized return on capital employed continues in line with last year's performance at 30%. We ended the quarter with $1 billion in capital employed in our Midstream segment. As mentioned earlier, we recorded an after-tax noncash impairment of $170 million related to our equity investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
As we move to Slide 15, Midstream's adjusted earnings of $79 million were comprised of $42 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP and $37 million from our other Midstream businesses.
Slide 16 provides additional variance explanations for both our DCP and on our other Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of the slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP decreased by $48 million this quarter, mainly due to DCP's exposure to commodity prices. This was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense attributable to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets. Volume mix was also favorable this quarter as DCP processed more liquids-rich volumes and a low dry gas. Our other Midstream business improved by $16 million, inventory related gains primarily contributed to this improvement.
Shifting discussion now to our Chemicals segment, beginning on Slide 17.
Earnings for the Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, or CPChem. CPChem had another great quarter. It's best quarter ever, with adjusted earnings of $242 million. Strong performance was driven by improved margins along with lower utility cost. Year-to-date, annualized after-tax return on capital employed increased to 30%, up from 28% last year, and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in capital employed in the Chemicals segment. 
The next 2 slides provide more detail on Chemicals' earnings. This quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $52 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in Olefins and Polyolefins, partially offset by increased income taxes accrued by Phillips 66 on the equity earnings from CPChem. And this was primarily driven by the mix of foreign and domestic earnings. 
Slide 19 provides additional details on CPChem's operating segments. Olefins and Polyolefins generated income of $245 million in the second quarter. The $62 million increase was due primarily to increased ethylene and polyethylene margins and lower utility cost as a result of reduced natural gas prices. Specialties, Aromatic and Styrenics earnings increased by $5 million compared to the same period last year, and this was due largely to improved benzene margins. 
This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the quarter. Next, I will provide you with some outlook items for the remainder of 2012.
In Refining and Marketing, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the mid 90s and our pre-tax turnaround expense of approximately $145 million over the second half of the year. 
In Midstream, the majority of capital expenditures, depreciation and interest will be incurred by DCP. For 2012, we estimate DCP, on 100% basis, will fund the capital program of approximately $2 billion, with depreciation and amortization of $300 million and net interest expense of $170 million.
  
In Chemicals, we estimate that CPChem, on a 100% basis, will have capital expenditures and investments of approximately $1 billion in 2012, with depreciation and amortization of roughly $260 million and net interest expense of $10 million to $15 million.  CPChem expects to complete the repayment of its remaining $400 million of senior notes during the third quarter of this year. 
Corporate and Other is expected to be at cost of about $125 million per quarter for the remainder of the year, including after-tax interest of about $50 million per quarter. 
Guidance for Phillips 66 for 2012 is capital expenditures of $1 billion to $1.5 billion with depreciation and amortization of $900 million. Our corporate tax rate is a function of mix largely dependent on the amount of U.S. versus international earnings, and we expect our adjusted, effective tax rate to be around 35% for all of 2012.  And finally, Phillips 66 does not have any debt maturities coming due in 2012. 
We can now turn to Slide 21 and I'll hand the call over to Greg Garland to take you through an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives. Greg?"

Well, as we execute our strategy, we remain focused on our initiatives to enhance return on capital, deliver profitable growth and grow shareholder distributions. We're also committed to operational excellence and creating a great place to work. We continue to improve our metrics around personal and process safety, and environmental stewardship.  As we said, we plan to reduce costs by eliminating spin-related di-synergies by the end of 2013 and we set a target of $200 million. We're also working hard to create a great place to work for our employees. We value our employees, we want to have a place of mutual respect and collaboration. 
We completed the sale of the Trainer Refinery and we'll continue to work to optimize our portfolio. We did make the decision not to sell Alliance. We have a positive view on domestic Gulf Coast crudes to becoming an advantage feedstock, and we think as this plays out, Alliance will create long term value in the portfolio. 
Earlier, you saw our crude slate, which demonstrates the progress we've made on getting advantaged crudes into our refineries. We continue to work this hard because every dollar we can save on feedstock significantly improves our bottom line results. Crude and energy is greater than 70% of our cost structure. It's the single biggest lever we have to improve value. 
Some of our initiatives in this area, we've talked about the railcar acquisition, to get 2,000 railcars, but we've also worked agreements to allow us to more efficiently load and unload crudes to both the source sites and the refinery. We're also expanding our own infrastructure. For instance, to bring Mississippi line crude into our Ponca City refinery. And we'll work other deals in other areas to get more advantaged crudes to the front end of our refineries. 
Besides crude advantage, we're working to improve access to exports. So far this year, we've increased our capacity to export about 14,000 barrels a day, so we have a current capability of 130,000 barrels per day. We're progressing in about 4 different projects that are expected to increase our export capacity to over 220,000 barrels a day by the end of next year. 
We have some key growth projects underway in Midstream and Chemicals. In Midstream, DCP is progressing its NGL logistics and gathering and processing projects. 2 big pipes. One is the Sand Hills Pipeline that run from the Permian, in the Eagle Ford to Mont Belvieu, 720-mile, 20-inch line. Initial capacity of 200,000 barrels a day. We can expand it up to 350,000 barrels a day. The Eagle Ford section is expected to be operational in the third quarter. This is about a $1 billion project. 
The Southern Hills pipe really runs from the MidCon to Belvieu. This pipe's targeted capacity over 150,000 barrels a day of NGL. About $1 billion of investment. Completion expected in mid 2013. Both these pipelines, once in service, will contribute to fee-based margins to DCP. 
DCP is working on the Eagle plant and the Eagle Ford. It's a 200 million cubic feet per day gas processing facility. It's expected to be up in the fourth quarter. Also have other gas plants in construction. The LaSalle plant at DJ Basin, Rawhide plant in the Permian and the National Helium upgrade in the Granite Wash, all scheduled for start up in 2013. In total, we expect DCP will spend between $4 billion and $6 billion in 2012 and 2014.
In Chemicals, CPChem has a 35% ownership interest in Saudi Polymers Company. This project was formed to execute a major petrochemicals project in Saudi Arabia. The facility will produce ethylene, propylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and 1-hexene. Start up activities are in progress with commercial production expected in the near future. This facility will have an annual capacity of 1.2 million metric tons of ethylene and 1.1 million metric tons of high-density polyethylene. In the current environment, we expect this project will increase Chemicals segment's earnings by 10% to 15%. 
CPChem is also expanding its fractionation capacity at Sweeny by 22,000 barrels a day, so total capacity will be 138,000 barrels a day. Expect completion of this project in the first quarter of 2013. This is roughly $100 million investment. 
CPChem is starting construction on a 1-hexene plant at Cedar Bayou facility. This plant will utilize CPChem's proprietary 1-hexene technology. Annual capacity of 250,000 tons. It will be the largest of its kind in the world. We expect start up in the first quarter of 2014. 
CPChem also continues to progress efforts on its U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project. This project includes a 1.5 million metric ton per year ethylene cracker at the Cedar Bayou facility and a 1 million metric ton per year polyethylene plant, which will be built adjacent to CPChem's Sweeny facility. Polyethylene capacity will consist of 2 plants, and would both use CPChem's proprietary technology. This final project's approvals are expected in 2013, start up 2017. 
As part of our plans to increase distribution to shareholders, our Board of Directors declared a $0.20 dividend to be paid in the third quarter. We expect to have modest dividend increases in the range of about 5% a year. We want to look back in 10 years and say, we increased the dividend every year of this company. 
This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding common shares. The shares are going to be repurchased from time to time in the open market at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan to hold the shares of stock as treasury shares. 
So all in, I think we had a solid quarter. We ran well. We generally had improved margins going forward. I'm proud of the employees. There was an immense amount of work done behind the scenes to get the new company up and running. Our employees didn't take their eye of the ball. They executed well. They turned in excellent results, from operational excellence to very disciplined management of the business in all aspects of the business. 
So with that, we'll conclude and we'll open the line for questions."

So, kind of year-to-date, we've increased our exposure to the TI-linked crudes obviously. 120,000 barrels a day of shale crudes. We've also increased Canadian heavy by about 33%.

So that's 600,000 barrels a day where I'd say TI-linked crudes. On the heavy, we are running -- the heavy asset, Latin American heavy, about 471,000 barrels a day. So actually, about 50,000 barrels a day reduced in this area. And we've also reduced our exposure to Brent-related crudes by about 165,000 barrels a day all in. So, as we think about where can we move crudes, we want to move the shale crudes from 120,000 to ultimately 450,000, 460,000 barrels a day. And we're trying to get those crudes to every refinery we can. But clearly, the Ferndale on the West Coast, Bayway on the East Coast. We think Ferndale can probably run 50,000 barrels  a day of Bakken crude. Wood River, we can run up to 90,000 to 120,000 barrels a day of shale-type crudes there. Ponca about 60,000 barrels a day. Bayway, 100,000 barrels a day of shale-type crudes that we can advantage, that we can move into Bayway. Smaller, Rodeo, we can get in 30,000 barrels a day. And Sweeny about 40,000 barrels a day. And then Alliance, we're running today, Eagle Ford crude and some Bakken crude and Alliance. But ultimately, 50,000 to 90,000 barrels a day.

27306532,212568098,337340,"Phillips 66, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Phillips 66","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'll get started with Slide 3. We successfully completed the separation with ConocoPhillips and began operating as an independent company on May 1. Our second quarter financials include 1 month of carve out financials",2332,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'll get started with Slide 3. We successfully completed the separation with ConocoPhillips and began operating as an independent company on May 1. Our second quarter financials include 1 month of carve out financials and 2 months of actual financials. The financials for April were prepared on the same basis as our Form 10 and our first quarter 10-Q.
As stated in our earnings release, we had reported net income of $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. The $236 million difference is attributable to special items including impairments and gains on the asset sales. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter were $2.23 per share. Cash from operations was $1.4 billion and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed was 18%. 
Now, let's turn to Slide 4 for a high-level look at our second quarter earnings. Refining and Marketing generated $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings. The $437 million improvement was primarily driven by much stronger refining margins, particularly in the U.S. Mid-Continent and Europe. Midstream adjusted earnings were $79 million, which excludes the $170 million special item associated with the impairment of our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
On an adjusted basis, Midstream earnings were $32 million lower than the second quarter of last year. The decline in earnings reflects a reduction in equity earnings from DCP, which was primarily driven by lower NGL prices. 
Chemicals adjusted earnings were $242 million, and this excludes a special item of $35 million associated with the early retirement of $600 million of debt. Adjusted earnings improved this quarter by $52 million, primarily due to higher margins and lower utility costs. I'll go through each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation.
Corporate and Other costs this quarter were $89 million after adjusting for repositioning costs of $30 million. Our Corporate and Other segment consists of interest expense, staff costs, technology and other items not specifically identifiable to an operating segment. Details on our Corporate segment can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
Next, let's take a look at cash flow for the second quarter as shown on Slide 5. I'll back up for a moment and remind you that our March 31 restricted cash balance of $6.1 billion includes $5.8 billion in senior notes that we issued in March. In April, we closed the financing on a $2 billion 3-year term loan, which brought our total debt balance to $8 billion. 
As part of the separation, we made a net distribution of $6.1 billion to ConocoPhillips which has, as shown on the slide, effectively resulted in Phillips 66 starting out with $2 billion in cash. During the second quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations with a minor cash impact related to net working capital changes.
We generated proceeds of $234 million from asset sales, primarily from the sale of our Trainer Refinery. And our capital program this quarter was $270 million and was largely focused on the Refining and Marketing segment. This resulted in  $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter.
Let's turn to Slide 6 for a look at our capital structure and returns. At the end of the second quarter, we had $19 billion in equity and $8 billion of debt, for a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 30%. Our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed of 18% is up from 14% in 2011. This improvement is driven primarily by higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing segment and our Chemicals segment. And we ended the quarter with $27 billion in capital employed, of which R&M represented 76% of this total. 
Next, we'll cover each of our segments in more detail, starting with Refining and Marketing, beginning on Slide 7. The story in Refining and Marketing this quarter was that we ran well during a strong margin environment. We ran globally at a 93% utilization rate, which is the highest second quarter rate we have achieved since 2008. We also maintained a high clean product yield at 84% and realized higher margins in our Refining, Marketing and Lubricants businesses. Our Refining realized margin of $12.56 per barrel is the highest since the second quarter of 2007, and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed has improved to 17%.
Let's turn to Slide 8 and look at the Refining and Marketing adjusted earnings. Adjusted Refining and Marketing earnings of $1.2 billion reflect significant improvements in our Atlantic Basin Europe and Central Corridor regions, as well as U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other. 
In the Atlantic Basin Europe region, earnings increased due to improved margins and lower controllable costs. Margins improved largely as a result of higher market crack spreads, while controllable costs were lower, primarily, because of the absence of operating activities at our Wilhelmshaven and Trainer Refineries. 
Earnings in the Gulf coast were fairly flat as improved clean product margins were offset by a less of a feedstock advantage, reflecting the narrowing LLS Maya differentials. 
The Central Corridor improved significantly this quarter due to higher margins, reflecting our advantaged feedstock position in this region. The WCS discount to WTI and the increased amount of heavy crude processed at our Wood River Refinery following the completion of the CORE project drove the feedstock advantage this quarter. 
The Western Pacific region was lower this quarter as positive secondary product impacts were more than offset by less of a feedstock advantage, along with inventory impacts. 
Other Refining benefited from gains associated with Canadian crude imports as we were able to utilize our pipeline transportation capacity to take advantage of favorable WCS to WTI spreads. 
Results for this quarter also include foreign exchange gains that are not directly attributable to one of our other regions. From an overall Refining and Marketing perspective, the foreign currency exchange impacts this quarter represented a modest loss. 
U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other improved by $67 million due to higher fuel and Lubricant margins which were partially offset by higher costs. While internationally, earnings in Marketing, Specialties and Other were comparable to the same quarter last year. 
The next 2 slides highlight our performance in Refining.
As we turn to Slide 9, adjusted earnings increased $353 million this quarter. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and secondary product margins being the only offset by less favorable crude differentials. Additionally, lower natural gas prices this quarter resulted in lower utility costs and were a key driver in the lower overall operating costs. 
Let's take a look at our market capture on Slide 10. Here, we look at our global market and realized crack spreads. Overall, the market crack was very favorable this quarter. Our realized margin of nearly $13 per barrel indicates that we captured 70% of the market crack this quarter, and we capitalized on these favorable margins by operating at a 93% utilization rate. The market indicator margin in the second quarter was $17.85 per barrel and assumes a 100% clean product yield. 
As you can see, our actual clean product yield in the second quarter was 84%, which creates the $3.03 adjustment shown on the slide. The $5.32 reduction from secondary products reflects the fact that the non-clean products we produced attracted a sales price, which on average, was less than the cost of our benchmark crudes. 
The feedstock advantage stems from running crudes and other processed inputs that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. Our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to the Canadian heavy and foreign sour crudes that we processed. 
The other category which contributed to our realized crack of $12.56 per barrel for the quarter primarily reflects the impacts from volume expansion. In the appendix, we have also included updated market indicator crack spreads for each of our regions.
So move to Slide 11. In addition to running at a high utilization rate, this slide shows our progress in being able to increase our advantaged crude runs at our refineries while improving our clean product yield to over 84%. Advantaged crudes increased from 47% in 2011 to 52% year-to-date in 2012. This is primarily driven by an increase in Canadian heavy crudes, as well as domestic WTI price links streams, including an increase in the amount of shale crudes that we processed. For example, year-to-date, we've averaged throughput of 120,000 barrels per day of shale crudes. 
Many of our refineries have the complexity to run price-advantaged Canadian crudes and we have access to multiple pipeline systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our inland U.S. refineries and this results in a competitive advantage.
Moving to Slide 12. Marketing, Specialties and Other generated adjusted earnings of $334 million, an increase of $84 million from the same quarter last year. The improvement was driven primarily by higher margins across major product lines. On the fuel side, U.S. wholesale margins improved due to a steep decline in spot --  a huge decline in spot-based product costs, which fell more rapidly than posted product prices. Our Lubricants business also generated improved results as product costs stabilized during the quarter, compared with the rapidly rising costs in the second quarter of last year.
The next slide shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing's income per barrel improved this quarter to $4.37 per barrel while the cash contribution increased to $5.19 per barrel. These results are reflective of R&M running well this quarter and a very strong margin environment. 
This completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business or segment. Next, we move to the Midstream segment beginning on Slide 14.
Our Midstream segment was impacted this quarter by reduced equity earnings from DCP Midstream, offset by inventory gains in our other Midstream businesses. However, year-to-date annualized return on capital employed continues in line with last year's performance at 30%. We ended the quarter with $1 billion in capital employed in our Midstream segment. As mentioned earlier, we recorded an after-tax noncash impairment of $170 million related to our equity investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
As we move to Slide 15, Midstream's adjusted earnings of $79 million were comprised of $42 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP and $37 million from our other Midstream businesses.
Slide 16 provides additional variance explanations for both our DCP and our other Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of the slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP decreased by $48 million this quarter, mainly due to DCP's exposure to commodity prices. This was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense attributable to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets. Volume mix was also favorable this quarter as DCP processed more liquids-rich volumes and a low dry gas. Our other Midstream business improved by $16 million. Inventory related gains primarily contributed to this improvement.
Shifting discussion now to our Chemicals segment, beginning on Slide 17.
Earnings for the Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, or CPChem. CPChem had another great quarter. It's best quarter ever, with adjusted earnings of $242 million. Strong performance was driven by improved margins along with lower utility costs. Year-to-date, annualized after-tax return on capital employed increased to 30%, up from 28% last year, and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in capital employed in the Chemicals segment. 
The next 2 slides provide more detail on Chemicals' earnings. This quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $52 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in Olefins and Polyolefins, partially offset by increased income taxes accrued by Phillips 66 on the equity earnings from CPChem. And this was primarily driven by the mix of foreign and domestic earnings. 
Slide 19 provides additional details on CPChem's operating segments. Olefins and Polyolefins generated income of $245 million in the second quarter. The $62 million increase was due primarily to increased ethylene and polyethylene margins and lower utility costs as a result of reduced natural gas prices. Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics earnings increased by $5 million compared to the same period last year, and this was due largely to improved benzene margins. 
This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the quarter. Next, I will provide you with some outlook items for the remainder of 2012.
In Refining and Marketing, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the mid 90s and our pre-tax turnaround expense of approximately $145 million over the second half of the year. 
In Midstream, the majority of capital expenditures, depreciation and interest will be incurred by DCP. For 2012, we estimate DCP, on 100% basis, will fund the capital program of approximately $2 billion, with depreciation and amortization of $300 million and net interest expense of $170 million.
  
In Chemicals, we estimate that CPChem, on a 100% basis, will have capital expenditures and investments of approximately $1 billion in 2012, with depreciation and amortization of roughly $260 million and net interest expense of $10 million to $15 million.  CPChem expects to complete the repayment of its remaining $400 million of senior notes during the third quarter of this year. 
Corporate and Other is expected to be at costs of about $125 million per quarter for the remainder of the year, including after-tax interest of about $50 million per quarter. 
Guidance for Phillips 66 for 2012 is capital expenditures of $1 billion to $1.5 billion with depreciation and amortization of $900 million. Our corporate tax rate is a function of mix, largely dependent on the amount of U.S. versus international earnings, and we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 35% for all of 2012.  And finally, Phillips 66 does not have any debt maturities coming due in 2012. 
We can now turn to Slide 21 and I'll hand the call over to Greg Garland to take you through an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives. Greg?"

Well, as we execute our strategy, we remain focused on our initiatives to enhance return on capital, deliver profitable growth and grow shareholder distributions. We're also committed to operational excellence and creating a great place to work. We continue to improve our metrics around personal and process safety, and environmental stewardship.  As we said, we plan to reduce costs by eliminating spin-related di-synergies by the end of 2013 and we set a target of $200 million. We're also working hard to create a great place to work for our employees. We value our employees, we want to have a place of mutual respect and collaboration. 
We completed the sale of the Trainer Refinery and we'll continue to work to optimize our portfolio. We did make the decision not to sell Alliance. We have a positive view on domestic Gulf Coast crudes to becoming an advantage feedstock, and we think as this plays out, Alliance will create long term value in the portfolio. 
Earlier, you saw our crude slate, which demonstrates the progress we've made on getting advantaged crudes into our refineries. We continue to work this hard because every dollar we can save on feedstocks significantly improves our bottom line results. Crude and energy is greater than 70% of our cost structure. It's the single biggest lever we have to improve value. 
Some of our initiatives in this area, we've talked about the railcar acquisition, to get 2,000 railcars, but we've also worked agreements to allow us to more efficiently load and unload crudes at both the source sites and the refinery. We're also expanding our own infrastructure. For instance, to bring Mississippi line crude into our Ponca City refinery. And we'll work other deals in other areas to get more advantaged crudes to the front end of our refineries. 
Besides crude advantage, we're working to improve access to exports. So far this year, we've increased our capacity to export about 14,000 barrels a day, so we have a current capability of 130,000 barrels per day. We're progressing in about 4 different projects that are expected to increase our export capacity to over 220,000 barrels a day by the end of next year. 
We have some key growth projects underway in Midstream and Chemicals. In Midstream, DCP is progressing its NGL logistics and gathering and processing projects. 2 big pipes. One is the Sand Hills Pipeline that run from the Permian, in the Eagle Ford to Mont Belvieu, 720-mile, 20-inch line. Initial capacity of 200,000 barrels a day. We can expand it up to 350,000 barrels a day. The Eagle Ford section is expected to be operational in the third quarter. This is about a $1 billion project. 
The Southern Hills pipe really runs from the MidCon to Belvieu. This pipe's targeted capacity over 150,000 barrels a day of NGLs. About $1 billion of investment. Completion expected in mid 2013. Both these pipelines, once in service, will contribute to fee-based margins to DCP. 
DCP is working on the Eagle plant in the Eagle Ford. It's a 200 million cubic feet per day gas processing facility. It's expected to be up in the fourth quarter. Also have other gas plants in construction. The LaSalle plant at the DJ Basin, Rawhide plant in the Permian and the National Helium upgrade in the Granite Wash, all scheduled for start up in 2013. In total, we expect DCP will spend between $4 billion and $6 billion in 2012 and 2014.
In Chemicals, CPChem has a 35% ownership interest in Saudi Polymers Company. This project was formed to execute a major petrochemicals project in Saudi Arabia. The facility will produce ethylene, propylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and 1-hexene. Start up activities are in progress with commercial production expected in the near future. This facility will have an annual capacity of 1.2 million metric tons of ethylene and 1.1 million metric tons of high-density polyethylene. In the current environment, we expect this project will increase Chemicals segment's earnings by 10% to 15%. 
CPChem is also expanding its fractionation capacity at Sweeny by 22,000 barrels a day, so total capacity will be 138,000 barrels a day. Expect completion of this project in the first quarter of 2013. This is roughly a $100 million investment. 
CPChem is starting construction on a 1-hexene plant at Cedar Bayou facility. This plant will utilize CPChem's proprietary 1-hexene technology. Annual capacity of 250,000 tons. It will be the largest of its kind in the world. We expect start up in the first quarter of 2014. 
CPChem also continues to progress efforts on its U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project. This project includes a 1.5 million metric ton per year ethylene cracker at the Cedar Bayou facility and a 1 million metric ton per year polyethylene plant, which will be built adjacent to CPChem's Sweeny facility. Polyethylene capacity will consist of 2 plants that would both use CPChem's proprietary technology. This final project's approvals are expected in 2013, start up 2017. 
As part of our plans to increase distribution to shareholders, our Board of Directors declared a $0.20 dividend to be paid in the third quarter. We expect to have modest dividend increases in the range of about 5% a year. We want to look back in 10 years and say, we increased the dividend every year at this company. 
This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding common shares. The shares are going to be repurchased from time to time in the open market at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan to hold the shares of stock as treasury shares. 
So all in, I think we had a solid quarter. We ran well. We generally had improved margins going for us. I'm proud of the employees. There was an immense amount of work done behind the scenes to get the new company up and running. Our employees didn't take their eye of the ball. They executed well. They turned in excellent results, from operational excellence to very disciplined management of the business in all aspects of the business. 
So with that, we'll conclude and we'll open the line for questions."

So, kind of year-to-date, we've increased our exposure to the TI-linked crudes obviously. 120,000 barrels a day of shale crudes. We've also increased Canadian heavy by about 33%. We're running about 205,000 barrels a day of Canadian heavy today. Abou",280,"Yes.

We're running about 205,000 barrels a day of Canadian heavy today. About 60,000 barrels a day of Canadian medium light. And then -- about 225,000 barrels a day of other WTI or TS-related crudes. So that's 600,000 barrels a day where I'd say TI-linked crudes. On the heavy, we are running -- the heavy asset, Latin American heavy, about 471,000 barrels a day. So actually, about 50,000 barrels a day reduced in this area. And we've also reduced our exposure to Brent-related crudes by about 165,000 barrels a day all in. So, as we think about where can we move crudes, we want to move the shale crude from 120,000 to ultimately 450,000, 460,000 barrels a day. And we're trying to get those crudes to every refinery we can. But clearly, to Ferndale on the West Coast, Bayway on the East Coast. We think Ferndale can probably run 50,000 barrels a day of Bakken crude. Wood River, we can run up to 90,000 to 120,000 barrels a day of shale-type crudes there. Ponca about 60,000 barrels a day. Bayway, 100,000 barrels a day of shale-type crudes that we can advantage, that we can move into Bayway. Smaller, Rodeo, we can get in 30,000 barrels a day. And Sweeny about 40,000 barrels a day. And then Alliance, we're running today, Eagle Ford crude and some Bakken crude in Alliance. But ultimately, 50,000 to 90,000 barrels a day. So we have a plan to get advantaged crude into most of our refineries, Ed."

For instance, in gathering systems and/or trucking in the Mississippi Line to get advantaged crude into Ponca, we're looking at connecting to other pieces of pipe that are coming north, south, to get more Canadian heavy into some of our assets. And then around the Eagle Ford, we're looking at pipe solutions around Eagle Ford.

27306532,212568098,338996,"Phillips 66, Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2012",2012-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Phillips 66","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'll get started with Slide 3. We successfully completed the separation with ConocoPhillips and began operating as an independent company on May 1. Our second quarter financials include 1 month of carve out financials",2332,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'll get started with Slide 3. We successfully completed the separation with ConocoPhillips and began operating as an independent company on May 1. Our second quarter financials include 1 month of carve out financials and 2 months of actual financials. The financials for April were prepared on the same basis as our Form 10 and our first quarter 10-Q.
As stated in our earnings release, we had reported net income of $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. The $236 million difference is attributable to special items including impairments and gains on the asset sales. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter were $2.23 per share. Cash from operations was $1.4 billion and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed was 18%. 
Now, let's turn to Slide 4 for a high-level look at our second quarter earnings. Refining and Marketing generated $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings. The $437 million improvement was primarily driven by much stronger refining margins, particularly in the U.S. Mid-Continent and Europe. Midstream adjusted earnings were $79 million, which excludes the $170 million special item associated with the impairment of our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
On an adjusted basis, Midstream earnings were $32 million lower than the second quarter of last year. The decline in earnings reflects a reduction in equity earnings from DCP, which was primarily driven by lower NGL prices. 
Chemicals adjusted earnings were $242 million, and this excludes a special item of $35 million associated with the early retirement of $600 million of debt. Adjusted earnings improved this quarter by $52 million, primarily due to higher margins and lower utility costs. I'll go through each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation.
Corporate and Other costs this quarter were $89 million after adjusting for repositioning costs of $30 million. Our Corporate and Other segment consists of interest expense, staff costs, technology and other items not specifically identifiable to an operating segment. Details on our Corporate segment can be found in the appendix of this presentation. 
Next, let's take a look at cash flow for the second quarter as shown on Slide 5. I'll back up for a moment and remind you that our March 31 restricted cash balance of $6.1 billion includes $5.8 billion in senior notes that we issued in March. In April, we closed the financing on a $2 billion 3-year term loan, which brought our total debt balance to $8 billion. 
As part of the separation, we made a net distribution of $6.1 billion to ConocoPhillips which has, as shown on the slide, effectively resulted in Phillips 66 starting out with $2 billion in cash. During the second quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations with a minor cash impact related to net working capital changes.
We generated proceeds of $234 million from asset sales, primarily from the sale of our Trainer Refinery. And our capital program this quarter was $270 million and was largely focused on the Refining and Marketing segment. This resulted in  $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter.
Let's turn to Slide 6 for a look at our capital structure and returns. At the end of the second quarter, we had $19 billion in equity and $8 billion of debt, for a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 30%. Our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed of 18% is up from 14% in 2011. This improvement is driven primarily by higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing segment and our Chemicals segment. And we ended the quarter with $27 billion in capital employed, of which R&M represented 76% of this total. 
Next, we'll cover each of our segments in more detail, starting with Refining and Marketing, beginning on Slide 7. The story in Refining and Marketing this quarter was that we ran well during a strong margin environment. We ran globally at a 93% utilization rate, which is the highest second quarter rate we have achieved since 2008. We also maintained a high clean product yield at 84% and realized higher margins in our Refining, Marketing and Lubricants businesses. Our Refining realized margin of $12.56 per barrel is the highest since the second quarter of 2007, and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed has improved to 17%.
Let's turn to Slide 8 and look at the Refining and Marketing adjusted earnings. Adjusted Refining and Marketing earnings of $1.2 billion reflect significant improvements in our Atlantic Basin Europe and Central Corridor regions, as well as U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other. 
In the Atlantic Basin Europe region, earnings increased due to improved margins and lower controllable costs. Margins improved largely as a result of higher market crack spreads, while controllable costs were lower, primarily, because of the absence of operating activities at our Wilhelmshaven and Trainer Refineries. 
Earnings in the Gulf coast were fairly flat as improved clean product margins were offset by a less of a feedstock advantage, reflecting the narrowing LLS Maya differentials. 
The Central Corridor improved significantly this quarter due to higher margins, reflecting our advantaged feedstock position in this region. The WCS discount to WTI and the increased amount of heavy crude processed at our Wood River Refinery following the completion of the CORE project drove the feedstock advantage this quarter. 
The Western Pacific region was lower this quarter as positive secondary product impacts were more than offset by less of a feedstock advantage, along with inventory impacts. 
Other Refining benefited from gains associated with Canadian crude imports as we were able to utilize our pipeline transportation capacity to take advantage of favorable WCS to WTI spreads. 
Results for this quarter also include foreign exchange gains that are not directly attributable to one of our other regions. From an overall Refining and Marketing perspective, the foreign currency exchange impacts this quarter represented a modest loss. 
U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other improved by $67 million due to higher fuel and Lubricant margins which were partially offset by higher costs. While internationally, earnings in Marketing, Specialties and Other were comparable to the same quarter last year. 
The next 2 slides highlight our performance in Refining.
As we turn to Slide 9, adjusted earnings increased $353 million this quarter. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and secondary product margins being the only offset by less favorable crude differentials. Additionally, lower natural gas prices this quarter resulted in lower utility costs and were a key driver in the lower overall operating costs. 
Let's take a look at our market capture on Slide 10. Here, we look at our global market and realized crack spreads. Overall, the market crack was very favorable this quarter. Our realized margin of nearly $13 per barrel indicates that we captured 70% of the market crack this quarter, and we capitalized on these favorable margins by operating at a 93% utilization rate. The market indicator margin in the second quarter was $17.85 per barrel and assumes a 100% clean product yield. 
As you can see, our actual clean product yield in the second quarter was 84%, which creates the $3.03 adjustment shown on the slide. The $5.32 reduction from secondary products reflects the fact that the non-clean products we produced attracted a sales price, which on average, was less than the cost of our benchmark crudes. 
The feedstock advantage stems from running crudes and other processed inputs that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. Our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to the Canadian heavy and foreign sour crudes that we processed. 
The other category which contributed to our realized crack of $12.56 per barrel for the quarter primarily reflects the impacts from volume expansion. In the appendix, we have also included updated market indicator crack spreads for each of our regions.
So move to Slide 11. In addition to running at a high utilization rate, this slide shows our progress in being able to increase our advantaged crude runs at our refineries while improving our clean product yield to over 84%. Advantaged crudes increased from 47% in 2011 to 52% year-to-date in 2012. This is primarily driven by an increase in Canadian heavy crudes, as well as domestic WTI price links streams, including an increase in the amount of shale crudes that we processed. For example, year-to-date, we've averaged throughput of 120,000 barrels per day of shale crudes. 
Many of our refineries have the complexity to run price-advantaged Canadian crudes and we have access to multiple pipeline systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our inland U.S. refineries and this results in a competitive advantage.
Moving to Slide 12. Marketing, Specialties and Other generated adjusted earnings of $334 million, an increase of $84 million from the same quarter last year. The improvement was driven primarily by higher margins across major product lines. On the fuel side, U.S. wholesale margins improved due to a steep decline in spot --  a huge decline in spot-based product costs, which fell more rapidly than posted product prices. Our Lubricants business also generated improved results as product costs stabilized during the quarter, compared with the rapidly rising costs in the second quarter of last year.
The next slide shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing's income per barrel improved this quarter to $4.37 per barrel while the cash contribution increased to $5.19 per barrel. These results are reflective of R&M running well this quarter and a very strong margin environment. 
This completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business or segment. Next, we move to the Midstream segment beginning on Slide 14.
Our Midstream segment was impacted this quarter by reduced equity earnings from DCP Midstream, offset by inventory gains in our other Midstream businesses. However, year-to-date annualized return on capital employed continues in line with last year's performance at 30%. We ended the quarter with $1 billion in capital employed in our Midstream segment. As mentioned earlier, we recorded an after-tax noncash impairment of $170 million related to our equity investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
As we move to Slide 15, Midstream's adjusted earnings of $79 million were comprised of $42 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP and $37 million from our other Midstream businesses.
Slide 16 provides additional variance explanations for both our DCP and our other Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of the slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP decreased by $48 million this quarter, mainly due to DCP's exposure to commodity prices. This was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense attributable to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets. Volume mix was also favorable this quarter as DCP processed more liquids-rich volumes and a low dry gas. Our other Midstream business improved by $16 million. Inventory related gains primarily contributed to this improvement.
Shifting discussion now to our Chemicals segment, beginning on Slide 17.
Earnings for the Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, or CPChem. CPChem had another great quarter. It's best quarter ever, with adjusted earnings of $242 million. Strong performance was driven by improved margins along with lower utility costs. Year-to-date, annualized after-tax return on capital employed increased to 30%, up from 28% last year, and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in capital employed in the Chemicals segment. 
The next 2 slides provide more detail on Chemicals' earnings. This quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $52 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in Olefins and Polyolefins, partially offset by increased income taxes accrued by Phillips 66 on the equity earnings from CPChem. And this was primarily driven by the mix of foreign and domestic earnings. 
Slide 19 provides additional details on CPChem's operating segments. Olefins and Polyolefins generated income of $245 million in the second quarter. The $62 million increase was due primarily to increased ethylene and polyethylene margins and lower utility costs as a result of reduced natural gas prices. Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics earnings increased by $5 million compared to the same period last year, and this was due largely to improved benzene margins. 
This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the quarter. Next, I will provide you with some outlook items for the remainder of 2012.
In Refining and Marketing, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the mid 90s and our pre-tax turnaround expense of approximately $145 million over the second half of the year. 
In Midstream, the majority of capital expenditures, depreciation and interest will be incurred by DCP. For 2012, we estimate DCP, on 100% basis, will fund the capital program of approximately $2 billion, with depreciation and amortization of $300 million and net interest expense of $170 million.
  
In Chemicals, we estimate that CPChem, on a 100% basis, will have capital expenditures and investments of approximately $1 billion in 2012, with depreciation and amortization of roughly $260 million and net interest expense of $10 million to $15 million.  CPChem expects to complete the repayment of its remaining $400 million of senior notes during the third quarter of this year. 
Corporate and Other is expected to be at costs of about $125 million per quarter for the remainder of the year, including after-tax interest of about $50 million per quarter. 
Guidance for Phillips 66 for 2012 is capital expenditures of $1 billion to $1.5 billion with depreciation and amortization of $900 million. Our corporate tax rate is a function of mix, largely dependent on the amount of U.S. versus international earnings, and we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 35% for all of 2012.  And finally, Phillips 66 does not have any debt maturities coming due in 2012. 
We can now turn to Slide 21 and I'll hand the call over to Greg Garland to take you through an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives. Greg?"

Well, as we execute our strategy, we remain focused on our initiatives to enhance return on capital, deliver profitable growth and grow shareholder distributions. We're also committed to operational excellence and creating a great place to work. We continue to improve our metrics around personal and process safety, and environmental stewardship.  As we said, we plan to reduce costs by eliminating spin-related di-synergies by the end of 2013 and we set a target of $200 million. We're also working hard to create a great place to work for our employees. We value our employees, we want to have a place of mutual respect and collaboration. 
We completed the sale of the Trainer Refinery and we'll continue to work to optimize our portfolio. We did make the decision not to sell Alliance. We have a positive view on domestic Gulf Coast crudes to becoming an advantage feedstock, and we think as this plays out, Alliance will create long term value in the portfolio. 
Earlier, you saw our crude slate, which demonstrates the progress we've made on getting advantaged crudes into our refineries. We continue to work this hard because every dollar we can save on feedstocks significantly improves our bottom line results. Crude and energy is greater than 70% of our cost structure. It's the single biggest lever we have to improve value. 
Some of our initiatives in this area, we've talked about the railcar acquisition, to get 2,000 railcars, but we've also worked agreements to allow us to more efficiently load and unload crudes at both the source sites and the refinery. We're also expanding our own infrastructure. For instance, to bring Mississippi line crude into our Ponca City refinery. And we'll work other deals in other areas to get more advantaged crudes to the front end of our refineries. 
Besides crude advantage, we're working to improve access to exports. So far this year, we've increased our capacity to export about 14,000 barrels a day, so we have a current capability of 130,000 barrels per day. We're progressing in about 4 different projects that are expected to increase our export capacity to over 220,000 barrels a day by the end of next year. 
We have some key growth projects underway in Midstream and Chemicals. In Midstream, DCP is progressing its NGL logistics and gathering and processing projects. 2 big pipes. One is the Sand Hills Pipeline that run from the Permian, in the Eagle Ford to Mont Belvieu, 720-mile, 20-inch line. Initial capacity of 200,000 barrels a day. We can expand it up to 350,000 barrels a day. The Eagle Ford section is expected to be operational in the third quarter. This is about a $1 billion project. 
The Southern Hills pipe really runs from the MidCon to Belvieu. This pipe's targeted capacity over 150,000 barrels a day of NGLs. About $1 billion of investment. Completion expected in mid 2013. Both these pipelines, once in service, will contribute to fee-based margins to DCP. 
DCP is working on the Eagle plant in the Eagle Ford. It's a 200 million cubic feet per day gas processing facility. It's expected to be up in the fourth quarter. Also have other gas plants in construction. The LaSalle plant at the DJ Basin, Rawhide plant in the Permian and the National Helium upgrade in the Granite Wash, all scheduled for start up in 2013. In total, we expect DCP will spend between $4 billion and $6 billion in 2012 and 2014.
In Chemicals, CPChem has a 35% ownership interest in Saudi Polymers Company. This project was formed to execute a major petrochemicals project in Saudi Arabia. The facility will produce ethylene, propylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and 1-hexene. Start up activities are in progress with commercial production expected in the near future. This facility will have an annual capacity of 1.2 million metric tons of ethylene and 1.1 million metric tons of high-density polyethylene. In the current environment, we expect this project will increase Chemicals segment's earnings by 10% to 15%. 
CPChem is also expanding its fractionation capacity at Sweeny by 22,000 barrels a day, so total capacity will be 138,000 barrels a day. Expect completion of this project in the first quarter of 2013. This is roughly a $100 million investment. 
CPChem is starting construction on a 1-hexene plant at Cedar Bayou facility. This plant will utilize CPChem's proprietary 1-hexene technology. Annual capacity of 250,000 tons. It will be the largest of its kind in the world. We expect start up in the first quarter of 2014. 
CPChem also continues to progress efforts on its U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project. This project includes a 1.5 million metric ton per year ethylene cracker at the Cedar Bayou facility and a 1 million metric ton per year polyethylene plant, which will be built adjacent to CPChem's Sweeny facility. Polyethylene capacity will consist of 2 plants that would both use CPChem's proprietary technology. This final project's approvals are expected in 2013, start up 2017. 
As part of our plans to increase distribution to shareholders, our Board of Directors declared a $0.20 dividend to be paid in the third quarter. We expect to have modest dividend increases in the range of about 5% a year. We want to look back in 10 years and say, we increased the dividend every year at this company. 
This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding common shares. The shares are going to be repurchased from time to time in the open market at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan to hold the shares of stock as treasury shares. 
So all in, I think we had a solid quarter. We ran well. We generally had improved margins going for us. I'm proud of the employees. There was an immense amount of work done behind the scenes to get the new company up and running. Our employees didn't take their eye of the ball. They executed well. They turned in excellent results, from operational excellence to very disciplined management of the business in all aspects of the business. 
So with that, we'll conclude and we'll open the line for questions."

So that's 600,000 barrels a day where I'd say TI-linked crudes. On the heavy, we are running -- the heavy asset, Latin American heavy, about 471,000 barrels a day. So actually, about 50,000 barrels a day reduced in this area. And we've also reduced our exposure to Brent-related crudes by about 165,000 barrels a day all in. So, as we think about where can we move crudes, we want to move the shale crude from 120,000 to ultimately 450,000, 460,000 barrels a day. And we're trying to get those crudes to every refinery we can. But clearly, to Ferndale on the West Coast, Bayway on the East Coast. We think Ferndale can probably run 50,000 barrels a day of Bakken crude. Wood River, we can run up to 90,000 to 120,000 barrels a day of shale-type crudes there. Ponca about 60,000 barrels a day. Bayway, 100,000 barrels a day of shale-type crudes that we can advantage, that we can move into Bayway. Smaller, Rodeo, we can get in 30,000 barrels a day. And Sweeny about 40,000 barrels a day. And then Alliance, we're running today, Eagle Ford crude and some Bakken crude in Alliance. But ultimately, 50,000 to 90,000 barrels a day.

I'll start on Slide 3 with some highlights for the third quarter. Our reported earnings were $1.billion  or $2.51 per share.

I'll start on Slide 3 with some highlights for the third quarter. Our reported earnings were $1.billion  or $2.51 per share. Excluding approximately $300 million in special items, largely related to impairments, our adjusted earnings were $1.9 billion or $2.97 a share. Excluding special items, our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed is 21%, which is up from 18% in the second quarter with cash from operations coming in at $1.9 billion. Consistent with our stated intent to return capital to our shareholders, we commenced our share repurchase plan in August, purchasing over $100 million of common stock during the quarter and we also paid $125 million in dividends. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a high-level look at our third quarter adjusted earnings. Compared to the third quarter of 2011, our adjusted earnings increased by $369 million. Starting from the left side of the slide, Refining and Marketing generated $1.7 billion in earnings with the majority of the $400 million improvement driven by much stronger Refining margins due largely by improved crack spreads. Midstream earnings were $56 million, which excludes the $133 million special item related to the impairment of our 25% ownership interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. On an adjusted basis, Midstream earnings were approximately $60 million lower than last year, and this decline in earnings reflects a reduction in equity earnings from DCP Midstream, driven primarily by lower NGL prices. 
Chemicals earnings of $275 million, which excludes $122 million of special items primarily associated with CPChem's early retirement of $400 million of debt, along with some asset impairments. Adjusted earnings were approximately $80 million higher than the corresponding quarter of 2011, and this is mainly due to higher margins and lower utility costs. I will cover each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation. 
Excluding $13 million of repositioning costs, Corporate and Other costs this quarter were $112 million. The negative $65 million variance is largely due to higher interest expense on debt that was not in place last year prior to the spend. 
Now let's take a look at cash flow for the third quarter as shown on Slide 5. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations including $200 million of positive impacts from net working capital changes. As noted on the slide, we funded $300 million for our capital program, primarily Refining and Marketing related, and return more than $200 million to the shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Our cash balance increased by $1.3 billion resulting in $4.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a look at our capital structure and our returns. We ended the third quarter with $21 billion in equity and $8 billion of debt resulting in a debt-to-capital ratio of 29%, which is 2% lower than last quarter. Taking into account our $4.4 billion ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 15%. On an adjusted basis, our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed was 21%. This is up from 14% in 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by higher refinings -- higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing and Chemicals segments. We ended the quarter with $29 billion in capital employed, up $2 billion compared to the second quarter. 74% of our capital employed was R&M related, down from 76% in the second quarter. 
Next, we'll cover each of our operating segments in more detail starting with Refining and Marketing on Slide 7. In R&M, we ran very well in a strong margin environment. Globally, we ran at a 96% utilization rate despite our Alliance Refinery being down for approximately 3 weeks related to the impact of Hurricane Isaac, and our clean product yield was 83%. As part of our ongoing strategy to enhance returns, we are taking steps to process more North American advantaged crudes. During the third quarter, 63% of our U.S. crudes slate was advantage and this is up from an average of 61% for the first 3 quarters of the year. Marketing margins were lower this quarter, and we'll cover this in more detail later on the webcast. Our Refining realized margin was $17.05 per barrel and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed improved to 22%. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 where we'll cover adjusted earnings for Refining and Marketing. Earnings for R&M were $1.7 billion this quarter. This is up from $1.3 billion a year ago reflecting significant improvements in our Atlantic Basin Europe and Central Corridor regions, partially offset by lower earnings from Marketing, Specialties and Other, or as we referred to as MSO. In the Atlantic Basin region, earnings increased due to improved Refining margins and lower controllable costs. Margins improved largely as a result of higher crack spreads while controllable costs were lower primarily due to the Trainer and refineries no longer being in our portfolio. 
Gulf Coast earnings were up slightly due to higher Refining margins as market cracks were partially offset by lower product differentials and lower secondary product realizations. The Central Corridor improved significantly during this quarter due to higher refining margins, reflecting our advantaged feedstock position in the region as the WTI WCS differential widened. And we increased the amount of sour crude processed at Wood River and Ponca City refineries. 
The Western Pacific regions' earnings were higher this quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to higher refining margins. U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other was down by $95 million. This primarily due to lower margins and the negative impact associated with Hurricane Isaac. And internationally, MSO was down $60 million, mainly as a result of lower margins. 
The next few slides highlight our performance in Refining and provide more detail on MSO. So now turning to Slide 9. Refining's adjusted earnings increased over $500 million compared to a year ago. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and higher feedstock advantages being partially offset by less favorable product differentials and secondary products. Earnings were up $55 million as the result of higher volumes, mainly in the Central Corridor, where we were able to take advantage of lower cost crudes. And we also have lower operating costs largely due to no longer having the Trainer in refineries in our portfolio. 
Let's now take a look at our market capture shown on Slide 10. Here, we look at our global market and realized crack spreads. The market crack was very strong this quarter and we captured nearly 80% of the market crack, up nearly 10% from the second quarter. Our realized margin for the quarter was over $17 per barrel and we capitalized on this favorable margins by operating well with a 96% utilization rate. As I mentioned earlier, our actual clean product yield for the quarter was 83%, which results in the $3.42 adjustment shown on the slide. The $5.39 per barrel reduction related to secondary products reflects the fact that the non-clean products we produced attracted a sales price which, on average, was lower than the cost of our benchmark crudes. 
The positive $4.82 per barrel for feedstocks stems from running crudes and other feedstocks that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. Our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to the Canadian heavy and foreign sour crudes that we processed, as well as increased shale- and WTI-based crudes on the Gulf Coast. 
Finally, the other category primarily reflects the impact of product differentials. You'll see in the appendix that we've also included updated market indicator crack spreads for each of our regions. 
So moving onto Slide 11. This slide shows that during the year, we've increased advantaged crude runs at our refineries while also improving our clean product yield. Many of our refineries have the complexity to run advantaged Canadian crudes, and we have access to multiple transportation systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our U.S. refineries resulting in an overall competitive advantage. 
U.S. advantaged crudes increased from 52% last year to 61% year-to-date in 2012. This is primarily driven by an increase in Canadian heavy crudes, as well as domestic WTI price link streams, including an increase in the amount of shale crudes that we processed. Please note that the bar graph on the left has been updated from what we share with you last quarter as we are now providing additional detail on the different types of U.S. crude slates that we run. 
Now moving onto Slide 12. Marketing, Specialties and Other generated earnings of $95 million. That's $154 million lower than the same quarter last year. As shown on the slide, lower margins were the main driver for the decrease accounting for approximately $130 million of the variance. We saw large swings quarter-versus-quarter as we had gains last year related to inventory management compared with losses this year. Also impacted margins were product prices rising more sharply this year compared to last year, tied mainly to the impact -- or the impacts from hurricane hijack and lower gasoline in exports. Volumes decreased over $30 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to reduced volumes resulting from a weaker power market; plant maintenance, internationally; and from hurricane, domestically. Other includes favorable foreign exchange impacts. 
Year-to-date, MSO has generated earnings of over $500 million, which is in line with year-to-date earnings that we showed for 2011. 
Slide 13 shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing, its income per barrel improved this quarter to $6.37 per barrel with cash contributions of $7.21 per barrel. This now completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business segments. 
Next, we move to the Midstream segment beginning on Slide 14. Our Midstream segment was impacted this quarter by reduced equity earnings from DCP Midstream, largely driven by depressed NGL prices as quarter-over-quarter, prices were down 42%. Year-to-date, our annualized return on capital employed was 28%, down slightly from a high of 30% in 2011. We ended the quarter with $800 million in capital employed in our Midstream segment. As mentioned earlier, during the quarter, reported earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $133 million associated with the after-tax noncash impairment of our equity investment in Rockies Express Pipeline. 
As we move to Slide 15, Midstream's adjusted earnings of $56 million were comprised of $30 million -- $39 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream and $17 million from our other Midstream businesses. 
The next slide provides additional branch explanation for both DCP Midstream and other Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of this slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream decreased by $48 million this quarter, mainly due to DCPs exposure to NGL prices. This was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense that is attributable to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets that was implemented last quarter. Our other Midstream businesses were down $14 million driven in part due to inventory impacts. 
Shifting now to discussion of our Chemicals segment, please turn to Slide 17. Our Chemicals segment consist of our 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, or CPChem. CPChem had another great quarter providing equity earnings of $275 million. CPChem achieved a 97% capacity utilization rate in its olefins and segment, allowing it to capture the cost advantages and the North American and Middle Eastern ethylene and derivatives markets. Year-to-date, annualized after-tax return on capital employed for our Chemicals segment increased from 31%, and this is up from a 28% last year and we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in capital employed. 
Special items for the quarter included $120 million -- $122 million for losses associated with CPChem's early debt retirement and impairment of fixed assets, along with an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to the Phillips 66 spend from ConocoPhillips. 
The next couple of slides provide more detail on the Chemicals segment earnings. Turning to Slide 18, this quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $82 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in Olefins and Polyolefins due to stronger chain margins. These were primarily attributed to reduced feedstock costs due to higher industry ethane inventories, as well as continued strong demand for derivatives.  Additionally, CPChem's operations continue to benefit from lower utility costs stemming from low natural gas prices. 
Slide 19 provides additional details on CPChem's operating segments. On the top part of the chart, Olefins and Polyolefins generated equity earnings of $225 million in the third quarter. As previously mentioned, the $63 million increase was due primarily from higher olefins, polyolefins chain margins and lower utility costs as a result of reduced natural gas prices. Equity earnings from Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics increased by $4 million compared to the same period last year. This was many due to higher equity earnings from Saudi Chevron Phillips, driven primarily by higher sales volumes and margins. 
This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the quarter. Next, I will provide you with some outlook items for the fourth quarter. 
As shown on Slide 20, I want to start by providing an update on the Northeast operations where we have the Bayway refinery located in New Jersey and 3 storage terminals in the New York, New Jersey area. As you know, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the Northeast on Monday evening. Prior to the storm, we safety idled the refinery and shutdown the terminals as a precautionary measure. There was some flooding in low-lying areas of the refinery but floodwaters essentially receded. And as of this morning, power has been restored at Bayway. 
We are currently assessing the condition of the assets and the decision on resuming operations will be made once the this assessment is complete. So from an outlook perspective for the fourth quarter, in Refining and Marketing, assuming Bayway is running, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the low-90s and our pretax turnaround expense is to be approximately $100 million. Scheduled maintenance -- the scheduled maintenance turnarounds at the Wood River border in LA refineries are currently underway and proceeding as planned with return to normal operations expected in November. 
In Midstream, as we noted in our earnings release, we expect to acquire an interest in 2 NGL pipelines currently being constructed by DCP Midstream. And Tim will talk about this more later in his remarks. This investment will increase our total capital investments by an estimated $700 million to $800 million over the 2012 and 2013 time periods. Excluding the pipeline expenditures, total capital expense for the year is estimated at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. In Chemicals, distributions resume in the fourth quarter after the completion of CPChem's debt repayment program. Corporate and Other is expected to be a cost of about $40 million per month or approximately $120 million for the quarter. And this includes after-tax net interest expense of about $50 million. 
In October, our Board of Directors declared a $0.25 per share dividend payable in the fourth quarter. This 25% dividend increase, along with our $1 billion share repurchase plan, is part of our strategy to return capital to our shareholders. We expect to complete the share repurchase program by the end of 2013. 
We can now turn to Slide 21, and I'll hand the call over to Tim Taylor to take you through an update on how we're advancing our strategic initiatives. Tim?"

We continued to execute our strategy of enhancing returns, delivering growth and increasing shareholder distributions. In Refining and Marketing, we're improving margins, enhancing returns by increasing runs advantage advantaged feedstocks and increasing refined product export capability. In order to supply higher-quality lower-cost crude to our refineries, we're improving our logistics infrastructure and developing new sources of crude supply. 
For example, we're delivering 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day at advantaged crude to our Bayway refinery by rail. We're also ramping up deliveries of locally-produced Mississippian line crude into our Ponca City refinery via pipeline and truck. We expect to receive up to an additional 50,000 barrels per day of this high-quality crude in the Ponca City by the end of 2013. 
We've also reached agreement with Kinder Morgan to deliver up to 30,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford crude via a new pipeline connection to our Sweeny refinery in early 2014. All in all, by mid-2014, these actions, along with others that we're taking, are expected to increase our access to advantaged crudes by about 165,000 barrels per day across our domestic Refining system. This represents about 9% of our U.S. Refining capacity. We also continued to increase clean product export capability through low-cost capital investments in order to meet growing international demand. 
As part of our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, we've been evaluating the potential disposition of the 1.2 gigawatt Emingham combined fleet and power plant in North, Lincolnshire, England, which is addition to our refinery. the market improved could last several months and we'll continue to operate the asset as usual during this period. 
We remain committed to expanding the Midstream business as part of our strategy to deliver long-term profitable and viable growth. We've reached agreement in principle to acquire a 1/3 ownership interest in DCP's Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines, representing a total estimated investment of approximately $700 million to $800 million. This investment will enable DCP to maintain its growth plan throughout the -- or through the 2015 time period. And this pipeline strategically complement our Midstream and Chemicals businesses. 
The Sand Hills Pipeline is expected to commence deliveries of NGL from the Eagle Ford shale into Mont Belvieu by year end. DCP recently started the South Texas segment of its Sandhills' NGL pipeline, initially delivering 10,000 barrels per day of liquids from the Eagle Ford to the DCP partners Wilburys pipeline. The second phase with service from the Permian basin is targeted to be in operation by the second quarter of 2013. 
The Southern Hills pipeline project, which will extend from the mid-continent region to Mont Belvieu, Texas, remains on schedule for completion in mid-2013. 
In Chemicals, CPChem announced in October that the Saudi Polymers Company worldscale petrochemicals facility in Saudi Arabia began commercial production. CPChem's projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast are progressing as planned, including the proposed ethane cracker and related polyethylene facilities, as well as their 1-hexene plant.

We look around the world, I would say a great place to be today is in the United States. The demand has been relatively stable. It's still not what I'd call robust but clearly with the operating rates you have seen, great place to be. And I think it speaks to the advantage feedstock that we have here, as well as probably a decent group demand from the industrial or manufacturing sector. Europe is weak when we look across the globe. Asia is has -- backed off substantially from what you would have thought a year ago. And frankly, part of that stems from the weakness in Europe because they're so heavily dependent on trade for their manufacturing. So I don't think there's anything surprising there except that perhaps we look at the base you ask and say it's a pretty good market. Latin America is still relatively small but that's okay as well. And then when we think about the export piece, that does provide some underpinning, if you will, for the petrochemical business in the U.S. And so I think as an industry, I still think about it in the 20%, 25% range of petrochemicals being able to be exported or you can do that. So a lot of optionality there that develops when you've got that kind of cost position. The other thing I'd would say on CPChem's is it's important to realize that if you think about their production base, the Middle East and their production base in the United States positioned well in the low -- or 2 lowest coast areas in the world, in petrochemicals. And I think that shows up in the strength of their earnings."

I'll start on Slide 3 with some highlights for the third quarter. Our reported earnings were $1.6 billion  or $2.51 per share. Excluding approximately $300 million in special items, largely related to impairments,",2589,"Thanks, Clayton. Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 with some highlights for the third quarter. Our reported earnings were $1.6 billion  or $2.51 per share. Excluding approximately $300 million in special items, largely related to impairments, our adjusted earnings were $1.9 billion or $2.97 a share. Excluding special items, our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed is 21%, which is up from 18% in the second quarter with cash from operations coming in at $1.9 billion. Consistent with our stated intent to return capital to our shareholders, we commenced our share repurchase plan in August, purchasing over $100 million of common stock during the quarter and we also paid $125 million in dividends. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a high-level look at our third quarter adjusted earnings. Compared to the third quarter of 2011, our adjusted earnings increased by $369 million. Starting from the left side of the slide, Refining and Marketing generated $1.7 billion in earnings with the majority of the $400 million improvement driven by much stronger Refining margins due largely by improved crack spreads. Midstream earnings were $56 million, which excludes the $133 million special item related to the impairment of our 25% ownership interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. On an adjusted basis, Midstream earnings were approximately $60 million lower than last year, and this decline in earnings reflects a reduction in equity earnings from DCP Midstream, driven primarily by lower NGL prices. 
Chemicals earnings of $275 million, which excludes $122 million of special items primarily associated with CPChem's early retirement of $400 million of debt, along with some asset impairments. Adjusted earnings were approximately $80 million higher than the corresponding quarter of 2011, and this is mainly due to higher margins and lower utility costs. I will cover each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation. 
Excluding $13 million of repositioning costs, Corporate and Other costs this quarter were $112 million. The negative $65 million variance is largely due to higher interest expense on debt that was not in place last year prior to the spend. 
Now let's take a look at cash flow for the third quarter as shown on Slide 5. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations including $200 million of positive impacts from net working capital changes. As noted on the slide, we funded $300 million for our capital program, primarily Refining and Marketing-related, and returned more than $200 million to the shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Our cash balance increased by $1.3 billion resulting in $4.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a look at our capital structure and our returns. We ended the third quarter with $21 billion in equity and $8 billion of debt resulting in a debt-to-capital ratio of 28%, which is 2% lower than last quarter. Taking into account our $4.4 billion ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 15%. On an adjusted basis, our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed was 21%. This is up from 14% in 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by higher refinings -- higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing and Chemicals segments. We ended the quarter with $29 billion in capital employed, up $2 billion compared to the second quarter. 74% of our capital employed was R&M related, down from 76% in the second quarter. 
Next, we'll cover each of our operating segments in more detail starting with Refining and Marketing on Slide 7. In R&M, we ran very well in a strong margin environment. Globally, we ran at a 96% utilization rate despite our Alliance Refinery being down for approximately 3 weeks related to the impact of Hurricane Isaac, and our clean product yield was 83%. As part of our ongoing strategy to enhance returns, we are taking steps to process more North American advantaged crudes. During the third quarter, 63% of our U.S. crude slate was advantaged and this is up from an average of 61% for the first 3 quarters of the year. Marketing margins were lower this quarter, and we'll cover this in more detail later on the webcast. Our Refining realized margin was $17.05 per barrel and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed improved to 22%. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 where we'll cover adjusted earnings for Refining and Marketing. Earnings for R&M were $1.7 billion this quarter. This is up from $1.3 billion a year ago reflecting significant improvements in our Atlantic Basin Europe and Central Corridor regions, partially offset by lower earnings from Marketing, Specialties and Other, or as we referred to as MSO. In the Atlantic Basin region, earnings increased due to improved Refining margins and lower controllable costs. Margins improved largely as a result of higher crack spreads while controllable costs were lower primarily due to the Trainer and Wilhelmshaven refineries no longer being in our portfolio. 
Gulf Coast earnings were up slightly due to higher Refining margins as market cracks were partially offset by lower product differentials and lower secondary product realizations. The Central Corridor improved significantly during this quarter due to higher refining margins, reflecting our advantaged feedstock position in the region as the WTI WCS differential widened. And we increased the amount of sour crude processed at Wood River and Ponca City refineries. 
The Western Pacific regions' earnings were higher this quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to higher refining margins. U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other was down by $95 million. This is primarily due to lower margins and the negative impact associated with Hurricane Isaac. And internationally, MSO was down $60 million, mainly as a result of lower margins. 
The next few slides highlight our performance in Refining and provide more detail on MSO. So now turning to Slide 9. Refining's adjusted earnings increased over $500 million compared to a year ago. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and higher feedstock advantages being partially offset by less favorable product differentials and secondary products. Earnings were up $55 million as the result of higher volumes, mainly in the Central Corridor, where we were able to take advantage of lower cost crudes. And we also had lower operating costs largely due to no longer having the Trainer and Wilhelmshaven refineries in our portfolio. 
Let's now take a look at our market capture shown on Slide 10. Here, we look at our global market and realized crack spreads. The market crack was very strong this quarter and we captured nearly 80% of the market crack, up nearly 10% from the second quarter. Our realized margin for the quarter was over $17 per barrel and we capitalized on this favorable margins by operating well with a 96% utilization rate. As I mentioned earlier, our actual clean product yield for the quarter was 83%, which results in the $3.42 adjustment shown on the slide. The $5.39 per barrel reduction related to secondary products reflects the fact that the non-clean products we produced attracted a sales price which, on average, was lower than the cost of our benchmark crudes. 
The positive $4.82 per barrel for feedstocks stems from running crudes and other feedstocks that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. Our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to the Canadian heavy and foreign sour crudes that we processed, as well as increased shale and WTI-based crudes on the Gulf Coast. 
Finally, the other category primarily reflects the impacts of product differentials. You'll see in the appendix that we've also included updated market indicator crack spreads for each of our regions. 
So moving onto Slide 11. This slide shows that during the year, we've increased advantaged crude runs at our refineries while also improving our clean product yield. Many of our refineries have the complexity to run advantaged Canadian crudes, and we have access to multiple transportation systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our U.S. refineries resulting in an overall competitive advantage. 
U.S. advantaged crudes increased from 52% last year to 61% year-to-date in 2012. This is primarily driven by an increase in Canadian heavy crudes, as well as domestic WTI price link streams, including an increase in the amount of shale crudes that we processed. Please note that the bar graph on the left has been updated from what we share with you last quarter as we are now providing additional detail on the different types of U.S. crude slates that we run. 
Now moving onto Slide 12. Marketing, Specialties and Other generated earnings of $95 million. That's $154 million lower than the same quarter last year. As shown on the slide, lower margins were the main driver for the decrease accounting for approximately $130 million of the variance. We saw large swings quarter-versus-quarter as we had gains last year related to inventory management compared with losses this year. Also impacting margins were product prices rising more sharply this year compared to last year, tied mainly to the impact -- or the impacts from Hurricane Isaac and lower gasoline exports. Volumes decreased over $30 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to reduced volumes resulting from a weaker power market, plant maintenance, internationally; and from Hurricane Isaac, domestically. Other includes favorable foreign exchange impacts. 
Year-to-date, MSO has generated earnings of over $500 million, which is in line with year-to-date earnings that we showed for 2011. 
Slide 13 shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing, its income per barrel improved this quarter to $6.37 per barrel with cash contributions of $7.21 per barrel. This now completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business segment. 
Next, we move to the Midstream segment beginning on Slide 14. Our Midstream segment was impacted this quarter by reduced equity earnings from DCP Midstream, largely driven by depressed NGL prices as quarter-over-quarter, prices were down 42%. Year-to-date, our annualized return on capital employed was 28%, down slightly from a high of 30% in 2011. We ended the quarter with $800 million in capital employed in our Midstream segment. As mentioned earlier, during the quarter, reported earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $133 million associated with the after-tax noncash impairment of our equity investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
As we move to Slide 15, Midstream's adjusted earnings of $56 million were comprised of $30 million -- $39 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream and $17 million from our other Midstream businesses. 
The next slide provides additional variance explanations for both DCP Midstream and other Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of this slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream decreased by $48 million this quarter, mainly due to DCP's exposure to NGL prices. This was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense that is attributable to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets that was implemented last quarter. Our other Midstream businesses were down $14 million driven in part due to inventory impacts. 
Shifting now to a discussion of our Chemicals segment, please turn to Slide 17. Our Chemicals segment consist of our 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company or CPChem. CPChem had another great quarter providing equity earnings of $275 million. CPChem achieved a 97% capacity utilization rate in its Olefins and Polyolefins segment, allowing it to capture the cost advantages in the North American and Middle Eastern ethylene and derivatives markets. Year-to-date, annualized after-tax return on capital employed for our Chemicals segment increased from 31%, and this is up from a 28% last year and we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in capital employed. 
Special items for the quarter included $120 million -- $122 million for losses associated with CPChem's early debt retirement and impairment of fixed assets, along with an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to the Phillips 66 spend from ConocoPhillips. 
The next couple of slides provide more detail on the Chemicals segment earnings. Turning to Slide 18, this quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $82 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in Olefins and Polyolefins due to stronger chain margins. This was primarily attributed to reduced feedstock costs due to higher industry ethane inventories, as well as continued strong demand for derivatives. Additionally, CPChem's operations continue to benefit from lower utility costs stemming from low natural gas prices. 
Slide 19 provides additional details on CPChem's operating segments. On the top part of the chart, Olefins and Polyolefins generated equity earnings of $225 million in the third quarter. As previously mentioned, the $63 million increase was due primarily from higher olefins, polyolefins chain margins and lower utility costs as a result of reduced natural gas prices. Equity earnings from Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics increased by $4 million compared to the same period last year. This was mainly due to higher equity earnings from Saudi Chevron Phillips, driven primarily by higher sales volumes and margins. 
This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the quarter. Next, I will provide you with some outlook items for the fourth quarter. 
As shown on Slide 20, I want to start by providing an update on our Northeast operations where we have the Bayway refinery located in Linden, New Jersey and 3-storage terminals in the New York, New Jersey area. As you know, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the Northeast on Monday evening. Prior to the storm, we safely idled the refinery and shut down the terminals as a precautionary measure. There was some flooding in low-lying areas of the refinery but floodwaters have since receded. And as of this morning, power has been restored at Bayway. We are currently assessing the condition of the assets and the decision on resuming operations will be made once this assessment is complete. 
So from an outlook perspective for the fourth quarter, in Refining and Marketing, assuming Bayway is running, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the low-90s and our pretax turnaround expenses to be approximately $100 million. Scheduled maintenance -- the scheduled maintenance turnarounds at the Wood River border in LA refineries are currently underway and are proceeding as planned with a return to normal operations expected in November. 
In Midstream, as we noted in our earnings release, we expect to acquire an interest in 2 NGL pipelines currently being constructed by DCP Midstream. And Tim will talk about this more later in his remarks. This investment will increase our total capital investments by an estimated $700 million to $800 million over the 2012 and 2013 time periods. Excluding the pipeline expenditures, total capital expense for the year is estimated at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. In Chemicals, distributions resumed in the fourth quarter after the completion of CPChem's debt repayment program. Corporate and Other is expected to be a cost of about $40 million per month or approximately $120 million for the quarter. And this includes after-tax net interest expense of about $50 million. 
In October, our Board of Directors declared a $0.25 per share dividend payable in the fourth quarter. This 25% dividend increase, along with our $1 billion share repurchase plan, is part of our strategy to return capital to our shareholders. We expect to complete the share repurchase program by the end of 2013. 
We can now turn to Slide 21, and I'll hand the call over to Tim Taylor to take you through an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives. Tim?"

We continued to execute our strategy of enhancing returns, delivering growth and increasing shareholder distributions. In Refining and Marketing, we're improving margins, enhancing returns by increasing runs, advantaged feedstocks and increasing refined product export capability. In order to supply higher-quality lower-cost crude to our refineries, we're improving our logistics infrastructure and developing new sources of crude supply. 
For example, we're delivering 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day of advantaged crude to our Bayway refinery by rail. We're also ramping up deliveries of locally-produced Mississippian line crude into our Ponca City refinery via pipeline and truck. We expect to receive up to an additional 50,000 barrels per day of this high-quality crude in the Ponca City by the end of 2013. 
We've also reached agreement with Kinder Morgan to deliver up to 30,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford crude via a new pipeline connection to our Sweeny refinery in early 2014. All in all, by mid-2014, these actions, along with others that we're taking, are expected to increase our access to advantaged crudes by about 165,000 barrels per day across our domestic Refining system. This represents about 9% of our U.S. refining capacity. We also continued to increase clean product export capability through low-cost capital investments in order to meet growing international demand. 
As part of our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, we've been evaluating the potential disposition of the 1.2 gigawatt Immingham Combined Heat and Power plant in North, Lincolnshire, England, which is adjacent to our Humber refinery. The marketing period could last several months and we'll continue to operate the asset as usual during this period. 
We remain committed to expanding the Midstream business as part of our strategy to deliver long-term profitable and valuable growth. We've reached agreement in principle to acquire a 1/3 ownership interest in DCP's Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines, representing a total estimated investment of approximately $700 million to $800 million. This investment will enable DCP to maintain its growth plan throughout the -- or through the 2015 time period. And this pipeline strategically complement our Midstream and Chemicals businesses. 
 
The Sand Hills pipeline is expected to commence deliveries of NGL from the Eagle Ford shale into Mont Belvieu by year end. DCP recently started the South Texas segment of its Sand Hills NGL pipeline, initially delivering 10,000 barrels per day of liquids from the Eagle Ford to the DCP Partners Wilburys pipeline. The second phase was service from the Permian basin is targeted to be in operation by the second quarter of 2013. 
The Southern Hills pipeline project, which will extend from the mid-Continent region to Mont Belvieu, Texas, remains on schedule for completion in mid-2013. 
In Chemicals, CPChem announced in October that the Saudi Polymers Company world-scale petrochemicals facility in Saudi Arabia began commercial production. CPChem's projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast are progressing as planned, including the proposed ethane cracker and related polyethylene facilities, as well as their 1-hexene plant.

So we're working hard on that to try and change that, Doug. The comment I'd make in Washington is that, that's got a natural access to the Bakken in North Dakota and Canadian crudes, and so we kind of separate, I think the Washington piece from the California piece that way.

Having said that though, we also recognize that we're in a highly cyclical business and as such, one of ways we try complementing returning value back to our shareholders is through our share repurchase program. That gives us an opportunity to basically create a swing, a variable swing, that in the event that we hit the low point of the cycle, then we're able to maybe pull back a bit on that if we -- our cash requirements require.

I know it's been, look, MLPs have been a real defining element of the cycle, inclusion of more and more cyclical assets have gone on popularity as well as IRS permissibility and valuation of the market, I mean, can you discuss maybe how your consideration has changed or how you think about the suitability that structure for either refining assets or ethane cracking assets where I know you have a partner that would have equal say with that. How do you think about the suitability of the structure for those assets?"

It's got some other challenges, so to speak, when you do the MLP structure in terms of dilutive to ROCE, dilutive to earnings and so that's kind of the counter piece and can be -- depending on how you view it, relatively expensive from a financial structure. So that's part of our deliberation and really where we're focused is on that transportation logistics piece with PSX. The MLP is pretty early. We'll wait and see. It's a great time right now to have those with distributions but clearly they are variable. And I think that it will be interesting to see how that works out with the test of time. And I can say that on the petrochemical side, we really don't have any plans to look at that from a cracking standpoint."

We look around the world, I would say, a great place to be today is in the United States. The demand has been relatively stable. It's still not what I'd call robust but clearly with the operating rates you've seen, a great place to be. And I think it speaks to the advantage feedstock that we have here, as well as probably a decent demand from the industrial or manufacturing sector. Europe is weak when we look across the globe. Asia is has -- backed off substantially from what you would have thought a year ago. And frankly, part of that stems from the weakness in Europe because they're so heavily dependent on trade for their manufacturing. So I don't think there's anything surprising there except that perhaps we look at the base U.S. and say it's a pretty good market. Latin America is still relatively small but does okay as well. And then when we think about the export piece, that does provide some underpinning, if you will, for the petrochemical business in the U.S. And so I think as an industry, I still think about it in the 20%, 25% range of petrochemicals being able to be exported or you can do that. So a lot of optionality there that develops when you've got that kind of cost position. The other thing I'd would say on CPChem is it's important to realize that if you think about their production base, the Middle East and their production base in the United States positioned well in the low -- 2 lowest cost areas in the world, in petrochemicals. And I think that shows up in the strength of their earnings."

I'll start on Slide 3 with some highlights for the third quarter. Our reported earnings were $1.6 billion  or $2.51 per share. Excluding approximately $300 million in special items, largely related to impairments,",2589,"Thanks, Clayton. Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 with some highlights for the third quarter. Our reported earnings were $1.6 billion  or $2.51 per share. Excluding approximately $300 million in special items, largely related to impairments, our adjusted earnings were $1.9 billion or $2.97 a share. Excluding special items, our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed is 21%, which is up from 18% in the second quarter with cash from operations coming in at $1.9 billion. Consistent with our stated intent to return capital to our shareholders, we commenced our share repurchase plan in August, purchasing over $100 million of common stock during the quarter and we also paid $125 million in dividends. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a high-level look at our third quarter adjusted earnings. Compared to the third quarter of 2011, our adjusted earnings increased by $369 million. Starting from the left side of the slide, Refining and Marketing generated $1.7 billion in earnings with the majority of the $400 million improvement driven by much stronger Refining margins due largely by improved crack spreads. Midstream earnings were $56 million, which excludes the $133 million special item related to the impairment of our 25% ownership interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. On an adjusted basis, Midstream earnings were approximately $60 million lower than last year, and this decline in earnings reflects a reduction in equity earnings from DCP Midstream, driven primarily by lower NGL prices. 
Chemicals earnings of $275 million, which excludes $122 million of special items primarily associated with CPChem's early retirement of $400 million of debt, along with some asset impairments. Adjusted earnings were approximately $80 million higher than the corresponding quarter of 2011, and this is mainly due to higher margins and lower utility costs. I will cover each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation. 
Excluding $13 million of repositioning costs, Corporate and Other costs this quarter were $112 million. The negative $65 million variance is largely due to higher interest expense on debt that was not in place last year prior to the spend. 
Now let's take a look at cash flow for the third quarter as shown on Slide 5. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations including $200 million of positive impacts from net working capital changes. As noted on the slide, we funded $300 million for our capital program, primarily Refining and Marketing-related, and returned more than $200 million to the shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Our cash balance increased by $1.3 billion resulting in $4.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a look at our capital structure and our returns. We ended the third quarter with $21 billion in equity and $8 billion of debt resulting in a debt-to-capital ratio of 28%, which is 2% lower than last quarter. Taking into account our $4.4 billion ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 15%. On an adjusted basis, our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed was 21%. This is up from 14% in 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by higher refinings -- higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing and Chemicals segments. We ended the quarter with $29 billion in capital employed, up $2 billion compared to the second quarter. 74% of our capital employed was R&M related, down from 76% in the second quarter. 
Next, we'll cover each of our operating segments in more detail starting with Refining and Marketing on Slide 7. In R&M, we ran very well in a strong margin environment. Globally, we ran at a 96% utilization rate despite our Alliance Refinery being down for approximately 3 weeks related to the impact of Hurricane Isaac, and our clean product yield was 83%. As part of our ongoing strategy to enhance returns, we are taking steps to process more North American advantaged crudes. During the third quarter, 63% of our U.S. crude slate was advantaged and this is up from an average of 61% for the first 3 quarters of the year. Marketing margins were lower this quarter, and we'll cover this in more detail later on the webcast. Our Refining realized margin was $17.05 per barrel and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed improved to 22%. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 where we'll cover adjusted earnings for Refining and Marketing. Earnings for R&M were $1.7 billion this quarter. This is up from $1.3 billion a year ago reflecting significant improvements in our Atlantic Basin Europe and Central Corridor regions, partially offset by lower earnings from Marketing, Specialties and Other, or as we referred to as MSO. In the Atlantic Basin region, earnings increased due to improved Refining margins and lower controllable costs. Margins improved largely as a result of higher crack spreads while controllable costs were lower primarily due to the Trainer and Wilhelmshaven refineries no longer being in our portfolio. 
Gulf Coast earnings were up slightly due to higher Refining margins as market cracks were partially offset by lower product differentials and lower secondary product realizations. The Central Corridor improved significantly during this quarter due to higher refining margins, reflecting our advantaged feedstock position in the region as the WTI WCS differential widened. And we increased the amount of sour crude processed at Wood River and Ponca City refineries. 
The Western Pacific regions' earnings were higher this quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to higher refining margins. U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other was down by $95 million. This is primarily due to lower margins and the negative impact associated with Hurricane Isaac. And internationally, MSO was down $60 million, mainly as a result of lower margins. 
The next few slides highlight our performance in Refining and provide more detail on MSO. So now turning to Slide 9. Refining's adjusted earnings increased over $500 million compared to a year ago. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and higher feedstock advantages being partially offset by less favorable product differentials and secondary products. Earnings were up $55 million as the result of higher volumes, mainly in the Central Corridor, where we were able to take advantage of lower cost crudes. And we also had lower operating costs largely due to no longer having the Trainer and Wilhelmshaven refineries in our portfolio. 
Let's now take a look at our market capture shown on Slide 10. Here, we look at our global market and realized crack spreads. The market crack was very strong this quarter and we captured nearly 80% of the market crack, up nearly 10% from the second quarter. Our realized margin for the quarter was over $17 per barrel and we capitalized on this favorable margins by operating well with a 96% utilization rate. As I mentioned earlier, our actual clean product yield for the quarter was 83%, which results in the $3.42 adjustment shown on the slide. The $5.39 per barrel reduction related to secondary products reflects the fact that the non-clean products we produced attracted a sales price which, on average, was lower than the cost of our benchmark crudes. 
The positive $4.82 per barrel for feedstocks stems from running crudes and other feedstocks that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. Our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to the Canadian heavy and foreign sour crudes that we processed, as well as increased shale and WTI-based crudes on the Gulf Coast. 
Finally, the other category primarily reflects the impacts of product differentials. You'll see in the appendix that we've also included updated market indicator crack spreads for each of our regions. 
So moving onto Slide 11. This slide shows that during the year, we've increased advantaged crude runs at our refineries while also improving our clean product yield. Many of our refineries have the complexity to run advantaged Canadian crudes, and we have access to multiple transportation systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our U.S. refineries resulting in an overall competitive advantage. 
U.S. advantaged crudes increased from 52% last year to 61% year-to-date in 2012. This is primarily driven by an increase in Canadian heavy crudes, as well as domestic WTI price link streams, including an increase in the amount of shale crudes that we processed. Please note that the bar graph on the left has been updated from what we share with you last quarter as we are now providing additional detail on the different types of U.S. crude slates that we run. 
Now moving onto Slide 12. Marketing, Specialties and Other generated earnings of $95 million. That's $154 million lower than the same quarter last year. As shown on the slide, lower margins were the main driver for the decrease accounting for approximately $130 million of the variance. We saw large swings quarter-versus-quarter as we had gains last year related to inventory management compared with losses this year. Also impacting margins were product prices rising more sharply this year compared to last year, tied mainly to the impact -- or the impacts from Hurricane Isaac and lower gasoline exports. Volumes decreased over $30 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to reduced volumes resulting from a weaker power market, plant maintenance, internationally; and from Hurricane Isaac, domestically. Other includes favorable foreign exchange impacts. 
Year-to-date, MSO has generated earnings of over $500 million, which is in line with year-to-date earnings that we showed for 2011. 
Slide 13 shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing, its income per barrel improved this quarter to $6.37 per barrel with cash contributions of $7.21 per barrel. This now completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business segment. 
Next, we move to the Midstream segment beginning on Slide 14. Our Midstream segment was impacted this quarter by reduced equity earnings from DCP Midstream, largely driven by depressed NGL prices as quarter-over-quarter, prices were down 42%. Year-to-date, our annualized return on capital employed was 28%, down slightly from a high of 30% in 2011. We ended the quarter with $800 million in capital employed in our Midstream segment. As mentioned earlier, during the quarter, reported earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $133 million associated with the after-tax noncash impairment of our equity investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
As we move to Slide 15, Midstream's adjusted earnings of $56 million were comprised of $30 million -- $39 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream and $17 million from our other Midstream businesses. 
The next slide provides additional variance explanations for both DCP Midstream and other Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of this slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream decreased by $48 million this quarter, mainly due to DCP's exposure to NGL prices. This was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense that is attributable to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets that was implemented last quarter. Our other Midstream businesses were down $14 million driven in part due to inventory impacts. 
Shifting now to a discussion of our Chemicals segment, please turn to Slide 17. Our Chemicals segment consist of our 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company or CPChem. CPChem had another great quarter providing equity earnings of $275 million. CPChem achieved a 97% capacity utilization rate in its Olefins and Polyolefins segment, allowing it to capture the cost advantages in the North American and Middle Eastern ethylene and derivatives markets. Year-to-date, annualized after-tax return on capital employed for our Chemicals segment increased from 31%, and this is up from a 28% last year and we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in capital employed. 
Special items for the quarter included $120 million -- $122 million for losses associated with CPChem's early debt retirement and impairment of fixed assets, along with an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to the Phillips 66 spend from ConocoPhillips. 
The next couple of slides provide more detail on the Chemicals segment earnings. Turning to Slide 18, this quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $82 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in Olefins and Polyolefins due to stronger chain margins. This was primarily attributed to reduced feedstock costs due to higher industry ethane inventories, as well as continued strong demand for derivatives. Additionally, CPChem's operations continue to benefit from lower utility costs stemming from low natural gas prices. 
Slide 19 provides additional details on CPChem's operating segments. On the top part of the chart, Olefins and Polyolefins generated equity earnings of $225 million in the third quarter. As previously mentioned, the $63 million increase was due primarily from higher olefins, polyolefins chain margins and lower utility costs as a result of reduced natural gas prices. Equity earnings from Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics increased by $4 million compared to the same period last year. This was mainly due to higher equity earnings from Saudi Chevron Phillips, driven primarily by higher sales volumes and margins. 
This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the quarter. Next, I will provide you with some outlook items for the fourth quarter. 
As shown on Slide 20, I want to start by providing an update on our Northeast operations where we have the Bayway refinery located in Linden, New Jersey and 3-storage terminals in the New York, New Jersey area. As you know, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the Northeast on Monday evening. Prior to the storm, we safely idled the refinery and shut down the terminals as a precautionary measure. There was some flooding in low-lying areas of the refinery but floodwaters have since receded. And as of this morning, power has been restored at Bayway. We are currently assessing the condition of the assets and the decision on resuming operations will be made once this assessment is complete. 
So from an outlook perspective for the fourth quarter, in Refining and Marketing, assuming Bayway is running, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the low-90s and our pretax turnaround expenses to be approximately $100 million. Scheduled maintenance -- the scheduled maintenance turnarounds at the Wood River border in LA refineries are currently underway and are proceeding as planned with a return to normal operations expected in November. 
In Midstream, as we noted in our earnings release, we expect to acquire an interest in 2 NGL pipelines currently being constructed by DCP Midstream. And Tim will talk about this more later in his remarks. This investment will increase our total capital investments by an estimated $700 million to $800 million over the 2012 and 2013 time periods. Excluding the pipeline expenditures, total capital expense for the year is estimated at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. In Chemicals, distributions resumed in the fourth quarter after the completion of CPChem's debt repayment program. Corporate and Other is expected to be a cost of about $40 million per month or approximately $120 million for the quarter. And this includes after-tax net interest expense of about $50 million. 
In October, our Board of Directors declared a $0.25 per share dividend payable in the fourth quarter. This 25% dividend increase, along with our $1 billion share repurchase plan, is part of our strategy to return capital to our shareholders. We expect to complete the share repurchase program by the end of 2013. 
We can now turn to Slide 21, and I'll hand the call over to Tim Taylor to take you through an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives. Tim?"

We continued to execute our strategy of enhancing returns, delivering growth and increasing shareholder distributions. In Refining and Marketing, we're improving margins, enhancing returns by increasing runs, advantaged feedstocks and increasing refined product export capability. In order to supply higher-quality lower-cost crude to our refineries, we're improving our logistics infrastructure and developing new sources of crude supply. 
For example, we're delivering 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day of advantaged crude to our Bayway refinery by rail. We're also ramping up deliveries of locally-produced Mississippian line crude into our Ponca City refinery via pipeline and truck. We expect to receive up to an additional 50,000 barrels per day of this high-quality crude in the Ponca City by the end of 2013. 
We've also reached agreement with Kinder Morgan to deliver up to 30,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford crude via a new pipeline connection to our Sweeny refinery in early 2014. All in all, by mid-2014, these actions, along with others that we're taking, are expected to increase our access to advantaged crudes by about 165,000 barrels per day across our domestic Refining system. This represents about 9% of our U.S. refining capacity. We also continued to increase clean product export capability through low-cost capital investments in order to meet growing international demand. 
As part of our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, we've been evaluating the potential disposition of the 1.2 gigawatt Immingham Combined Heat and Power plant in North, Lincolnshire, England, which is adjacent to our Humber refinery. The marketing period could last several months and we'll continue to operate the asset as usual during this period. 
We remain committed to expanding the Midstream business as part of our strategy to deliver long-term profitable and valuable growth. We've reached agreement in principle to acquire a 1/3 ownership interest in DCP's Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines, representing a total estimated investment of approximately $700 million to $800 million. This investment will enable DCP to maintain its growth plan throughout the -- or through the 2015 time period. And this pipeline strategically complement our Midstream and Chemicals businesses. 
 
The Sand Hills pipeline is expected to commence deliveries of NGL from the Eagle Ford shale into Mont Belvieu by year end. DCP recently started the South Texas segment of its Sand Hills NGL pipeline, initially delivering 10,000 barrels per day of liquids from the Eagle Ford to the DCP Partners Wilburys pipeline. The second phase was service from the Permian basin is targeted to be in operation by the second quarter of 2013. 
The Southern Hills pipeline project, which will extend from the mid-Continent region to Mont Belvieu, Texas, remains on schedule for completion in mid-2013. 
In Chemicals, CPChem announced in October that the Saudi Polymers Company world-scale petrochemicals facility in Saudi Arabia began commercial production. CPChem's projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast are progressing as planned, including the proposed ethane cracker and related polyethylene facilities, as well as their 1-hexene plant.

Having said that though, we also recognize that we're in a highly cyclical business and as such, one of ways we try complementing returning value back to our shareholders is through our share repurchase program. That gives us an opportunity to basically create a swing, a variable swing, that in the event that we hit the low point of the cycle, then we're able to maybe pull back a bit on that if we -- our cash requirements require.

It's got some other challenges, so to speak, when you do the MLP structure in terms of dilutive to ROCE, dilutive to earnings and so that's kind of the counter piece and can be -- depending on how you view it, relatively expensive from a financial structure. So that's part of our deliberation and really where we're focused is on that transportation logistics piece with PSX. The MLP is pretty early. We'll wait and see. It's a great time right now to have those with distributions but clearly they are variable. And I think that it will be interesting to see how that works out with the test of time.

We look around the world, I would say, a great place to be today is in the United States. The demand has been relatively stable. It's still not what I'd call robust but clearly with the operating rates you've seen, a great place to be. And I think it speaks to the advantage feedstock that we have here, as well as probably a decent demand from the industrial or manufacturing sector. Europe is weak when we look across the globe. Asia is has -- backed off substantially from what you would have thought a year ago. And frankly, part of that stems from the weakness in Europe because they're so heavily dependent on trade for their manufacturing. So I don't think there's anything surprising there except that perhaps we look at the base U.S. and say it's a pretty good market. Latin America is still relatively small but does okay as well. And then when we think about the export piece, that does provide some underpinning, if you will, for the petrochemical business in the U.S. And so I think as an industry, I still think about it in the 20%, 25% range of petrochemicals being able to be exported or you can do that. So a lot of optionality there that develops when you've got that kind of cost position. The other thing I'd would say on CPChem is it's important to realize that if you think about their production base, the Middle East and their production base in the United States positioned well in the low -- 2 lowest cost areas in the world, in petrochemicals. And I think that shows up in the strength of their earnings."

I'll start on Slide 3 with some highlights for the third quarter. Our reported earnings were $1.6 billion  or $2.51 per share. Excluding approximately $300 million in special items, largely related to impairments,",2589,"Thanks, Clayton. Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 with some highlights for the third quarter. Our reported earnings were $1.6 billion  or $2.51 per share. Excluding approximately $300 million in special items, largely related to impairments, our adjusted earnings were $1.9 billion or $2.97 a share. Excluding special items, our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed is 21%, which is up from 18% in the second quarter with cash from operations coming in at $1.9 billion. Consistent with our stated intent to return capital to our shareholders, we commenced our share repurchase plan in August, purchasing over $100 million of common stock during the quarter and we also paid $125 million in dividends. 
Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a high-level look at our third quarter adjusted earnings. Compared to the third quarter of 2011, our adjusted earnings increased by $369 million. Starting from the left side of the slide, Refining and Marketing generated $1.7 billion in earnings with the majority of the $400 million improvement driven by much stronger Refining margins due largely by improved crack spreads. Midstream earnings were $56 million, which excludes the $133 million special item related to the impairment of our 25% ownership interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. On an adjusted basis, Midstream earnings were approximately $60 million lower than last year, and this decline in earnings reflects a reduction in equity earnings from DCP Midstream, driven primarily by lower NGL prices. 
Chemicals earnings of $275 million, which excludes $122 million of special items primarily associated with CPChem's early retirement of $400 million of debt, along with some asset impairments. Adjusted earnings were approximately $80 million higher than the corresponding quarter of 2011, and this is mainly due to higher margins and lower utility costs. I will cover each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation. 
Excluding $13 million of repositioning costs, Corporate and Other costs this quarter were $112 million. The negative $65 million variance is largely due to higher interest expense on debt that was not in place last year prior to the spend. 
Now let's take a look at cash flow for the third quarter as shown on Slide 5. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations including $200 million of positive impacts from net working capital changes. As noted on the slide, we funded $300 million for our capital program, primarily Refining and Marketing-related, and returned more than $200 million to the shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Our cash balance increased by $1.3 billion resulting in $4.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a look at our capital structure and our returns. We ended the third quarter with $21 billion in equity and $8 billion of debt resulting in a debt-to-capital ratio of 28%, which is 2% lower than last quarter. Taking into account our $4.4 billion ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 15%. On an adjusted basis, our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed was 21%. This is up from 14% in 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by higher refinings -- higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing and Chemicals segments. We ended the quarter with $29 billion in capital employed, up $2 billion compared to the second quarter. 74% of our capital employed was R&M related, down from 76% in the second quarter. 
Next, we'll cover each of our operating segments in more detail starting with Refining and Marketing on Slide 7. In R&M, we ran very well in a strong margin environment. Globally, we ran at a 96% utilization rate despite our Alliance Refinery being down for approximately 3 weeks related to the impact of Hurricane Isaac, and our clean product yield was 83%. As part of our ongoing strategy to enhance returns, we are taking steps to process more North American advantaged crudes. During the third quarter, 63% of our U.S. crude slate was advantaged and this is up from an average of 61% for the first 3 quarters of the year. Marketing margins were lower this quarter, and we'll cover this in more detail later on the webcast. Our Refining realized margin was $17.05 per barrel and our year-to-date annualized return on capital employed improved to 22%. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 where we'll cover adjusted earnings for Refining and Marketing. Earnings for R&M were $1.7 billion this quarter. This is up from $1.3 billion a year ago reflecting significant improvements in our Atlantic Basin Europe and Central Corridor regions, partially offset by lower earnings from Marketing, Specialties and Other, or as we referred to as MSO. In the Atlantic Basin region, earnings increased due to improved Refining margins and lower controllable costs. Margins improved largely as a result of higher crack spreads while controllable costs were lower primarily due to the Trainer and Wilhelmshaven refineries no longer being in our portfolio. 
Gulf Coast earnings were up slightly due to higher Refining margins as market cracks were partially offset by lower product differentials and lower secondary product realizations. The Central Corridor improved significantly during this quarter due to higher refining margins, reflecting our advantaged feedstock position in the region as the WTI WCS differential widened. And we increased the amount of sour crude processed at Wood River and Ponca City refineries. 
The Western Pacific regions' earnings were higher this quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to higher refining margins. U.S. Marketing, Specialties and Other was down by $95 million. This is primarily due to lower margins and the negative impact associated with Hurricane Isaac. And internationally, MSO was down $60 million, mainly as a result of lower margins. 
The next few slides highlight our performance in Refining and provide more detail on MSO. So now turning to Slide 9. Refining's adjusted earnings increased over $500 million compared to a year ago. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and higher feedstock advantages being partially offset by less favorable product differentials and secondary products. Earnings were up $55 million as the result of higher volumes, mainly in the Central Corridor, where we were able to take advantage of lower cost crudes. And we also had lower operating costs largely due to no longer having the Trainer and Wilhelmshaven refineries in our portfolio. 
Let's now take a look at our market capture shown on Slide 10. Here, we look at our global market and realized crack spreads. The market crack was very strong this quarter and we captured nearly 80% of the market crack, up nearly 10% from the second quarter. Our realized margin for the quarter was over $17 per barrel and we capitalized on this favorable margins by operating well with a 96% utilization rate. As I mentioned earlier, our actual clean product yield for the quarter was 83%, which results in the $3.42 adjustment shown on the slide. The $5.39 per barrel reduction related to secondary products reflects the fact that the non-clean products we produced attracted a sales price which, on average, was lower than the cost of our benchmark crudes. 
The positive $4.82 per barrel for feedstocks stems from running crudes and other feedstocks that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. Our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to the Canadian heavy and foreign sour crudes that we processed, as well as increased shale and WTI-based crudes on the Gulf Coast. 
Finally, the other category primarily reflects the impacts of product differentials. You'll see in the appendix that we've also included updated market indicator crack spreads for each of our regions. 
So moving onto Slide 11. This slide shows that during the year, we've increased advantaged crude runs at our refineries while also improving our clean product yield. Many of our refineries have the complexity to run advantaged Canadian crudes, and we have access to multiple transportation systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our U.S. refineries resulting in an overall competitive advantage. 
U.S. advantaged crudes increased from 52% last year to 61% year-to-date in 2012. This is primarily driven by an increase in Canadian heavy crudes, as well as domestic WTI price link streams, including an increase in the amount of shale crudes that we processed. Please note that the bar graph on the left has been updated from what we share with you last quarter as we are now providing additional detail on the different types of U.S. crude slates that we run. 
Now moving onto Slide 12. Marketing, Specialties and Other generated earnings of $95 million. That's $154 million lower than the same quarter last year. As shown on the slide, lower margins were the main driver for the decrease accounting for approximately $130 million of the variance. We saw large swings quarter-versus-quarter as we had gains last year related to inventory management compared with losses this year. Also impacting margins were product prices rising more sharply this year compared to last year, tied mainly to the impact -- or the impacts from Hurricane Isaac and lower gasoline exports. Volumes decreased over $30 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to reduced volumes resulting from a weaker power market, plant maintenance, internationally; and from Hurricane Isaac, domestically. Other includes favorable foreign exchange impacts. 
Year-to-date, MSO has generated earnings of over $500 million, which is in line with year-to-date earnings that we showed for 2011. 
Slide 13 shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing, its income per barrel improved this quarter to $6.37 per barrel with cash contributions of $7.21 per barrel. This now completes our review of the Refining and Marketing business segment. 
Next, we move to the Midstream segment beginning on Slide 14. Our Midstream segment was impacted this quarter by reduced equity earnings from DCP Midstream, largely driven by depressed NGL prices as quarter-over-quarter, prices were down 42%. Year-to-date, our annualized return on capital employed was 28%, down slightly from a high of 30% in 2011. We ended the quarter with $800 million in capital employed in our Midstream segment. As mentioned earlier, during the quarter, reported earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $133 million associated with the after-tax noncash impairment of our equity investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. 
As we move to Slide 15, Midstream's adjusted earnings of $56 million were comprised of $30 million -- $39 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream and $17 million from our other Midstream businesses. 
The next slide provides additional variance explanations for both DCP Midstream and other Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of this slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream decreased by $48 million this quarter, mainly due to DCP's exposure to NGL prices. This was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense that is attributable to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets that was implemented last quarter. Our other Midstream businesses were down $14 million driven in part due to inventory impacts. 
Shifting now to a discussion of our Chemicals segment, please turn to Slide 17. Our Chemicals segment consist of our 50% equity interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company or CPChem. CPChem had another great quarter providing equity earnings of $275 million. CPChem achieved a 97% capacity utilization rate in its Olefins and Polyolefins segment, allowing it to capture the cost advantages in the North American and Middle Eastern ethylene and derivatives markets. Year-to-date, annualized after-tax return on capital employed for our Chemicals segment increased from 31%, and this is up from a 28% last year and we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in capital employed. 
Special items for the quarter included $120 million -- $122 million for losses associated with CPChem's early debt retirement and impairment of fixed assets, along with an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to the Phillips 66 spend from ConocoPhillips. 
The next couple of slides provide more detail on the Chemicals segment earnings. Turning to Slide 18, this quarter, adjusted earnings increased by $82 million compared to the same period last year. The increase in earnings was primarily in Olefins and Polyolefins due to stronger chain margins. This was primarily attributed to reduced feedstock costs due to higher industry ethane inventories, as well as continued strong demand for derivatives. Additionally, CPChem's operations continue to benefit from lower utility costs stemming from low natural gas prices. 
Slide 19 provides additional details on CPChem's operating segments. On the top part of the chart, Olefins and Polyolefins generated equity earnings of $225 million in the third quarter. As previously mentioned, the $63 million increase was due primarily from higher olefins, polyolefins chain margins and lower utility costs as a result of reduced natural gas prices. Equity earnings from Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics increased by $4 million compared to the same period last year. This was mainly due to higher equity earnings from Saudi Chevron Phillips, driven primarily by higher sales volumes and margins. 
This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the quarter. Next, I will provide you with some outlook items for the fourth quarter. 
As shown on Slide 20, I want to start by providing an update on our Northeast operations where we have the Bayway refinery located in Linden, New Jersey and 3-storage terminals in the New York, New Jersey area. As you know, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the Northeast on Monday evening. Prior to the storm, we safely idled the refinery and shut down the terminals as a precautionary measure. There was some flooding in low-lying areas of the refinery but floodwaters have since receded. And as of this morning, power has been restored at Bayway. We are currently assessing the condition of the assets and the decision on resuming operations will be made once this assessment is complete. 
So from an outlook perspective for the fourth quarter, in Refining and Marketing, assuming Bayway is running, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the low-90s and our pretax turnaround expenses to be approximately $100 million. Scheduled maintenance -- the scheduled maintenance turnarounds at the Wood River border in LA refineries are currently underway and are proceeding as planned with a return to normal operations expected in November. 
In Midstream, as we noted in our earnings release, we expect to acquire an interest in 2 NGL pipelines currently being constructed by DCP Midstream. And Tim will talk about this more later in his remarks. This investment will increase our total capital investments by an estimated $700 million to $800 million over the 2012 and 2013 time periods. Excluding the pipeline expenditures, total capital expense for the year is estimated at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. In Chemicals, distributions resumed in the fourth quarter after the completion of CPChem's debt repayment program. Corporate and Other is expected to be a cost of about $40 million per month or approximately $120 million for the quarter. And this includes after-tax net interest expense of about $50 million. 
In October, our Board of Directors declared a $0.25 per share dividend payable in the fourth quarter. This 25% dividend increase, along with our $1 billion share repurchase plan, is part of our strategy to return capital to our shareholders. We expect to complete the share repurchase program by the end of 2013. 
We can now turn to Slide 21, and I'll hand the call over to Tim Taylor to take you through an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives. Tim?"

We continued to execute our strategy of enhancing returns, delivering growth and increasing shareholder distributions. In Refining and Marketing, we're improving margins, enhancing returns by increasing runs, advantaged feedstocks and increasing refined product export capability. In order to supply higher-quality lower-cost crude to our refineries, we're improving our logistics infrastructure and developing new sources of crude supply. 
For example, we're delivering 30,000 to 40,000 barrels per day of advantaged crude to our Bayway refinery by rail. We're also ramping up deliveries of locally-produced Mississippian line crude into our Ponca City refinery via pipeline and truck. We expect to receive up to an additional 50,000 barrels per day of this high-quality crude in the Ponca City by the end of 2013. 
We've also reached agreement with Kinder Morgan to deliver up to 30,000 barrels per day of Eagle Ford crude via a new pipeline connection to our Sweeny refinery in early 2014. All in all, by mid-2014, these actions, along with others that we're taking, are expected to increase our access to advantaged crudes by about 165,000 barrels per day across our domestic Refining system. This represents about 9% of our U.S. refining capacity. We also continued to increase clean product export capability through low-cost capital investments in order to meet growing international demand. 
As part of our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, we've been evaluating the potential disposition of the 1.2 gigawatt Immingham Combined Heat and Power plant in North, Lincolnshire, England, which is adjacent to our Humber refinery. The marketing period could last several months and we'll continue to operate the asset as usual during this period. 
We remain committed to expanding the Midstream business as part of our strategy to deliver long-term profitable and valuable growth. We've reached agreement in principle to acquire a 1/3 ownership interest in DCP's Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines, representing a total estimated investment of approximately $700 million to $800 million. This investment will enable DCP to maintain its growth plan throughout the -- or through the 2015 time period. And this pipeline strategically complement our Midstream and Chemicals businesses. 
 
The Sand Hills pipeline is expected to commence deliveries of NGL from the Eagle Ford shale into Mont Belvieu by year end. DCP recently started the South Texas segment of its Sand Hills NGL pipeline, initially delivering 10,000 barrels per day of liquids from the Eagle Ford to the DCP Partners Wilburys pipeline. The second phase was service from the Permian basin is targeted to be in operation by the second quarter of 2013. 
The Southern Hills pipeline project, which will extend from the mid-Continent region to Mont Belvieu, Texas, remains on schedule for completion in mid-2013. 
In Chemicals, CPChem announced in October that the Saudi Polymers Company world-scale petrochemicals facility in Saudi Arabia began commercial production. CPChem's projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast are progressing as planned, including the proposed ethane cracker and related polyethylene facilities, as well as their 1-hexene plant.

As you look at the Gulf Coast, you talked to, in your remarks, about how you started to see Louisiana light, I guess, see some benefit relative to imported lights in crude, like Brent, for example. We obviously have been noticing that as well. I'm curious as to whether you could give us your prognosis as to how this is likely to play out, how you react to it in terms of your ability to ramp up your light sweet crude barrels and maybe substitute your light sweet crude barrels? I'll start with that one and I'll go through a couple of housekeeping ones, please."

We're very active in this area so the increasing supply of these lights -- light crudes out of the U.S, ultimately, we believe that will displace that waterborne barrel into particularly the Gulf Coast.

Having said that though, we also recognize that we're in a highly cyclical business and as such, one of ways we try complementing returning value back to our shareholders is through our share repurchase program. That gives us an opportunity to basically create a swing, a variable swing, that in the event that we hit the low point of the cycle, then we're able to maybe pull back a bit on that if we -- our cash requirements require.

I think it does speak to consistency to crude slate in some of the mid-Continent operations and the continuing improvements in our joint venture refinery at Wood River. So we've seen out there -- Bayway has run very well with process inputs. So it's not only just crude runs but additional input as well on in terms of rolling up the units. So they're probably -- I look at the Central Corridor and say, we pretty much ran it about as much as we could. We'd like get more because it's got a great, great margin today. The California refinery West Coast were, again, close to their capacity as well. I would say that's pretty much it for them. And in the Gulf Coast, with Alliance, it's probably our biggest opportunity after the hurricane and the impacts of that to come back up to full rates. So we look around our system, the Atlantic Basin Europe, we're right there, the Central Corridor, so that's the only place where we didn't ran pretty close to capacity would be the Gulf Coast, and I think that's just a matter of getting Alliance line back up."

Our transportation logistic assets, we look at that and we say, ""Okay, we see the value creations."" It's got some other challenges, so to speak, when you do the MLP structure in terms of dilutive to ROCE, dilutive to earnings and so that's kind of the counter piece and can be -- depending on how you view it, relatively expensive from a financial structure. So that's part of our deliberation and really where we're focused is on that transportation logistics piece with PSX. The MLP is pretty early. We'll wait and see. It's a great time right now to have those with distributions but clearly they are variable. And I think that it will be interesting to see how that works out with the test of time. And I can say that on the petrochemical side, we really don't have any plans to look at that from a cracking standpoint."

We look around the world, I would say, a great place to be today is in the United States. The demand has been relatively stable. It's still not what I'd call robust but clearly with the operating rates you've seen, a great place to be. And I think it speaks to the advantage feedstock that we have here, as well as probably a decent demand from the industrial or manufacturing sector. Europe is weak when we look across the globe. Asia is has -- backed off substantially from what you would have thought a year ago. And frankly, part of that stems from the weakness in Europe because they're so heavily dependent on trade for their manufacturing. So I don't think there's anything surprising there except that perhaps we look at the base U.S. and say it's a pretty good market. Latin America is still relatively small but does okay as well. And then when we think about the export piece, that does provide some underpinning, if you will, for the petrochemical business in the U.S. And so I think as an industry, I still think about it in the 20%, 25% range of petrochemicals being able to be exported or you can do that. So a lot of optionality there that develops when you've got that kind of cost position. The other thing I'd would say on CPChem is it's important to realize that if you think about their production base, the Middle East and their production base in the United States positioned well in the low -- 2 lowest cost areas in the world, in petrochemicals. And I think that shows up in the strength of their earnings."
