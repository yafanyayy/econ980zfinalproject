Thank you, Travis, and good morning, everyone. A lot of great information to go through here this morning and glad we've got the context that clearer now . Some of the things I'll be hitting on this morning here, first of all, talking about our 201",4202,"Great. Thank you, Travis, and good morning, everyone. A lot of great information to go through here this morning and glad we've got the context that clearer now . Some of the things I'll be hitting on this morning here, first of all, talking about our 2011 performance, and then I'll work through some of the rapidly expanding growth capital that we've got out there and a lot of the projects that are behind that capital expansion. And then I will move to the guidance for 2012 and '13, along with an updated commodity price deck that reflects our latest thinking about the commodities environment that we look forward to in '12 and '13.
First of all though, before we get into that, I want to remind you, certainly, we could not be more excited about Williams going forward and the way we're positioned in what we think are definitely the right assets, great markets and we certainly are excited about the strategy and how that is performing for us. Also, our MLP structure continues to fuel our dividend growth at WMB and allows us to continue to raise capital in a very cost-efficient manner for Williams shareholders and our high-dividend payout expected to increase every quarter now as we go forward rather than either annual or semiannually. We now have laid out our policy to increase that and are going to be increasing that at a rate of about 7/8 of $0.01. And that equates to a December '11 number versus a December '12 will give us a 14% increase in our annual dividend growth from '11 versus '12.
So we continue to be very excited about our ability to grow the dividend. We think it's extremely transparent where that growth is coming from. And as we continue to add more and more capital projects to this, we expect to even be able to expand that further. We continue to be very committed to our investment grade credit as well.
Okay, moving on here to Slide 5. Great financial performance for 2011, a 37% growth in our adjusted net income. That was $734 million versus $537 million from our continuing ops. Very strong business performance, growing at a clip of about 27% of our adjusted segment profit. And that was driven by a 24% increase in Williams Partners and a 67% increase in our Midstream Canada and olefins. 
Some of the drivers there, certainly, in the fee-based business, we grew our fee-based revenues by 12% in Williams Partners and a lot of that volume growth is coming from our Marcellus business, as well as our Deepwater business. The higher NGL frac spreads also were a driver for 2011, and our NGL production volumes were up. But as some of our contracts continue to roll into a fee-based business, our NGL equity volumes were flat. So our business is growing but more and more of our revenues are coming from fee-based business.
We certainly, on the Deepwater Gulf business, as I mentioned, not only did we see growth in revenues for 2011, but we also signed up 2 very significant growth projects that will come on in 2014 and beyond, and that is the Keathley Canyon project and as well, the GulfStar FPS. And I'll speak a little bit more about that later. 
Our Gas Pipelines continued to grow as well. And really, the big projects for the gas pipelines, there was actually 4 new major expansions that came on in just during 2011. And most of these projects started up in the end of -- latter part of the year, and about $67 million in increased revenues from those projects.
And then again in the Midstream Canada and olefins, higher sales prices really drove a lot of that, as well as increased volumes. But I think probably most important to note is that it wasn't just priced just that the market offered us, but our butane/butylene splitter that we installed in -- towards the last half of 2010 really provided tremendous margin upgrade for us in the 2011 timeframe. So a very high-return project as we continued to optimize the mix that's coming off the oil sands of gas stream. So we continue to be very excited about that. And as well, we had better margins in our Geismar ethylene business and somewhat impacted by some downtime we had in the fourth quarter for Geismar.
So here on Slide 6, we show the visibility to growth across all of our operating areas. And really important changes going on here. So I'll draw your attention to this. First of all, 2011 has been dropped from this prior. You would have seen 2011 included here, so you really have to look at things on an annualized basis to get to a more comparative viewpoint. So for instance, in guidance, we went from 3 years now to 2 years and on an annual average basis, you see that increase being up 47% on an annual average basis, moving from $1.7 billion to $2.5 billion here in the fourth quarter. And so some of the drivers, of course, for this, and a lot of this is weighted towards 2012, but some of the drivers here, primarily, the Laser acquisition and then some of the expansion cap around the Laser acquisition, as well as a small portion for Constitution. Both of those additions are included in that blue Marcellus slice.
Moving to the middle slice then, you can see now we're going from what was 6 years, 2011 through 2016, is now 5 years. And the midpoint on that -- or sorry, the annual average at midpoint on that was about a little over $1.5 billion. And before now, that is $2.5 billion and a 56% increase on the average annual growth capital spending for that period. The drivers on this, a lot of which is on the Eastern Seaboard, which is a number of small projects that are in-guidance quality projects, but the capital push is into 2014. So it's out of that guidance period that's shown on the left. As well as a pretty significant increase on Constitution, again, that's shown in the Marcellus slide. And then additionally, we've got some increases in the deepwater and some increases in the area of our Midstream Canada and olefins, particularly some projects that we have serve, some pet chem infrastructure needs for third parties. We haven't disclosed those projects yet but are looking forward to doing that yet in the very near future.
Moving over to the larger pie. Here, you can see this moves from $2.6 billion up to $4.2 billion on an annual average basis or a 62% increase. A number of large drivers here, but I'll tell you, probably the biggest single theme to this is the fact that we're seeing so much increase for demand on Transco along the Eastern Seaboard and the markets there. So our largest increase here is in the Eastern Seaboard pie that you can see there, and you can see Marcellus keeping pace throughout this as well. So a lot of great growth going on. And we just continue to see the demand for our infrastructure continue to drive our forecast for growth opportunities out in front of us. And frankly, we're going to be in a nice position to be able to prioritize to the very best capital opportunities that we have available for us looking forward.
Moving on to Slide 7, as we mentioned in our capital explanation and the opportunities ahead of us, the Marcellus area continues to be an area we're extremely excited about and continue to grow a very strong presence in the Marcellus. And particularly, in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, we are making progress in growing out the infrastructure there, really leveraging off of a resource base there in the Susquehanna County area and our key customers there, Cabot, WPX Energy and Carrizo. And we are really excited about how that's coming together. We've got 2 new things to announce. So we closed the Laser pipeline that we had mentioned earlier. But as of yesterday, we also disclosed the Constitution Pipeline project which will provide even greater access for our customers in this area into new expanding markets as we connect into both the Iroquois pipeline and a favorable location on Tennessee Gas Pipeline in New York. And Cabot is the anchor customer for that project, and we will be moving ahead with that project. The size and total capital on that project will be somewhat dependent on the amount of interest we have from other parties, but we are prepared to move ahead with the commitment that we have from Cabot for that project. So very excited about this. And really, this area, we believed by 2015, will have about 3 Bcf per day. Gathering capacity matched up with 3 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity from the area as well. And so this is exactly right onto our strategy of providing large-scale infrastructure solutions to producers in the right locations. And certainly, we think Susquehanna County in the Marcellus is the right location.
Moving on to Slide 8. Here, you can see another exciting project that's leveraging off the growth in the Marcellus Shale as well. And this project is really aimed at serving both producers in Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia, and as well, potentially Utica Shale shippers as well. And so -- but the really unique thing about this project is it not only provides producers with access into these markets, it also provides these great, growing markets on Transco in zone 6, 5, 4 and even 3, it provides these folks with access to these growing reserve base as well with actual firm, backhaul capacity on Transco. And so Transco, as you know, continues to -- has been continuing to expand with moving supplies from the South to the North, but those expansions have been coming in such a rapid manner that we really -- or welcome a new supply source from the north to be able to expand our capabilities to serve these markets even faster. So this is not just a supply-based project. It also is providing a great opportunity for our markets along the Transco system as well. And you can see, we would expect this to be in service as early as December of 2014, and we do have an open season out there right now and look to conclude that on April 2. And we'll know a little more about the details of this project when that's concluded.
Now moving onto Slide 9, in the Keathley Canyon Connector, and we've talked about this project. Fortunately, I won't spend a lot of time here. But this is a 215-mile project with a gathering capacity of 400 million a day. And these contracts were executed in late 2011, another great accomplishment that we had in 2011. This project will be expect to be in service in mid-year 2014. And I point that out because despite the great growth that we continue to have throughout our guidance period, a lot of these projects that I'm talking about will -- do not come into service in that timeframe and will continue to fuel our growth beyond the guidance period.
Moving on to Slide 10, our GulfStar FPS, another project that we contracted during 2011, and you can see a lot of details offered for you here on the slide. This project is going extremely well to date and a lot of the major contracts for the fabrication and installation of both the spar and the pipelines that are tied into our existing pipeline system have been executed, and are at or below where we expected the estimates to come on for this project. So getting off to a great start on this project and really excited about the degree of interest that we're getting from other producers in the deepwater as well as they're starting to see the reality of this project come together and the speed at which this product can be deployed.
Moving on to Slide 11, moving out West now. The West continues to provide opportunity to us and the Parachute Plant is a great example. It's a 350 million a day cryogenic train, almost completely fee-based project, and it will be in service in 2014. Major customer on this is WPX Energy, and this will really help them lift their cash returns on their drilling operations out there as right now, we continue to be a little bit short on processing capacity in that area. So very excited about what's going on out there. And another thing that's not mentioned here is the Overland Pass Pipeline, and that pipeline has the NGL pipeline that comes out of the Rockies and into the Mid-continent area. And that capacity is going to be increased up to 255,000 barrels per day to accommodate One Oak's new volumes coming out of the Bakken Shale, as well as Parachute TXP1 plant as well.
Moving on to Slide 12. And you can see here great visibility along our gas pipeline system here and a number of projects that are mentioned. And I tell you that the drivers for expansion on Transco in particularly is largely driven by power generation load. And right now, we are pursuing projects. These aren't speculative matters. These are actual projects we are pursuing right now that are requiring an excess of 3 Bcf a day of pipeline capacity. And that's about $2.5 billion of pipeline investment to accomplish that. So that's outside of some of the things that we most recently announced. And as well, I will tell you, in a broader study that we looked at, about 30 gigawatts of new power generation load we expect within about 50-mile radius of the Transco pipeline. So you've been hearing a lot about this for the last couple of years from the industry pundits, but we are actually seeing it come to -- into very tangible projects for Transco, and we expect to be able to grow both our capital investments and our revenues from our Transco business here pretty rapidly over the next 4 or 5 years.
Okay, now moving onto Slide 13 into Canada in our Midstream Canada and olefins area. Our Boreal pipeline is a great example of how well our project teams are executing up there. And this is a project that's being funded out of our international cash reserves, so it's not drawing down on any of our ability to provide dividend. And as we've mentioned before, a lot -- all of this Canadian business today is really being held in reserve from a dividend standpoint. We're not using any of these cash flows. But the point, really, of this slide is to show we continue to be able to execute our project up here very well. In August of 2010, we brought on the BB splitter, and we brought that in below budget and on time. And also now, in Boreal pipeline, expect to be able to say that as well, and we're expecting that to come on in May or June of this year, and that will be slightly ahead of our schedule for that project. And as well, we now are forecasting that project to come in under the original budgeted amount. So great execution by our teams up here, and that's a good thing because we have a lot of remaining expansion projects to build with the next one that will come online will be the expansion for NOVA of our ability to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the gas streams up here as well. And that will come on in the first part of 2013.
And as you can see here on Slide 14, we have a little more detail on that particular project. This is the NOVA Chemicals project, and we basically have contracted with nova to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the existing gas streams up there for them. And particularly, the first amount of work that's the on is at the Suncor facility. And this involves both some upgrades on the extraction facility, as well as some upgrades on the fractionator down at our Redwater facility. And as you can see here, that project is -- you can see that range and that budget moving down as well. So making great progress on all of our projects up here.
The next project here on Slide 15 is our Geismar plant expansion, very excited about what this offers to us from a strategic standpoint. And that we've got a very low cost expansion, and we think we're going to be well ahead of the market on most of the other expansions that are coming on in the ethylene cracking space. And we think this is going to be a good thing for Williams relative to the choppiness that we expect to see in terms of ethane volumes coming up in 2013. And we think those projects  are extremely well-timed in terms of being able to capture the spread between gas and ethylene. And so from a Williams standpoint, we are going to be rather insensitive to the spread between gas to ethane or ethane to ethylene because we'll perfectly balanced here between our ethane supplies coming out of WPZ and our ethylene consumption in Midstream Canada and olefins. And so things are going well on this project as well, and we've got a really talented staff and a great operating team there at Geismar, gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to bring this project in on-time and on budget as well.
Now we're going to move to Slide 16 here and talk about our perspective on the industry fundamentals that are driving our NGL margins and our olefins margins as well. So first of all, I'm going to kind of go through the general perspective that we have, and then I'll come back and talk about the specific changes that we've made to our pricing guidance. First of all, the crude-to-gas ratio continues to be at record high levels, and we certainly expect to see that in both '12, and to a slightly lesser degree, in '13, as we expect gas prices to rebound a little bit from '12 even though we don't expect dramatic movement. 
The NGL-to-crude ratio however, is really continuing to soften. We're certainly seeing that here in February and in March, and we expect to see that continue ratio through the second quarter of '12. We may see some rebound, and hope to see some rebound in the second half of '12, as a lot of the ethylene cracking capacity that is out-of-service right now, some of that down time is related to expansion on some of those ethylene crackers. And so we expect to see ethane demand towards the second half of '12 rebound. And then as we move into '13, though, we expect to see some of the new processing and NGL transport and fractionation infrastructure start to come into service in '13. And we -- so we expect to see supplies getting a bit longer in '13 and expect to see some dampening of the NGL-to-crude ratio further into 2013. 
The natural gas-to-ethylene spread, really, is the thing you need to stay tuned about relative to Williams because we really have that the entire space covered with our ethylene cracker at Geismar. And so we really aren't all that sensitive at the WMB level between gas-to-ethane or ethane-to-ethylene spread. In fact, in 2013 and mid-2013, when our ethylene cracker comes into service, our expansion there comes into service, we'll be almost perfectly balanced between our ethane production at Geismar -- or sorry, our ethane production and our processing business and our ethane consumption at Geismar. A very positive thing that we're seeing out of this commodity price environment that we're in is a tremendous demand for infrastructure on the market side on natural gas, particularly on Transco pipeline, and it's driving a lot of demand for power generation loads. But as well, this big spread that we continue to see between gas and crude oil-based products is continuing to demand infrastructure that helps us arbitrage that tremendous spread between domestic natural gas and world crude oil prices. And so it takes a lot of infrastructure to close that arbitrage, and we certainly have seen a lot of demand to get at that. 
So what this boils down to in terms of specifics for us, first of all, in 2012, we previously had $82.50 oil, WTI Oil, in our pricing environment. We're seeing that go to $100 here in 2012, and we're taking gas down from what was $4.25 in Henry Hub down to $3 in the period. That equates to a tremendous crude-to-gas ratio of 33.7. So -- that's up from about 23 in 2011. However, the NGL-to-crude relationship, we really are expecting to diminish significantly, and we certainly have seen that, as I mentioned here in the first quarter. And in 2011, we saw that the 56%, previously in our guidance, we had a 58% NGL-to-crude relationship. We're taking that all the way down to 45%. So very conservative on our part, but reflective of a very warm winter for propane demand, and as well, this lack of demand we're seeing right now for ethane due to these ethylene crackers being out of service in the near term. So at the end of the day, we're taking our NGL margin down from $0.83 in 2011 down to $0.78 at the midpoint of our guidance. And on the frac spread side, that goes from $0.91 down to $0.83. So about 9% on the frac spread for 2012.
Looking at 2013 then, pretty similar viewpoint, moving a $100 crude oil, and we also are seeing gas go from what was $4.75 down to $3.75. And that gets us to a crude-to-gas ratio of about 27 in 2013. And we're expecting the NGL-to-crude relationship to be 45% during this period. Additionally, our NGL margin is dropping again relative to 2011, $0.83. We're seeing it go down to $0.70 for that margin. So certainly, very conservative outlook here on NGL margins. But as you'll see, despite that conservative outlook, we continue to be able to grow the cash flows of this business and drive our dividend very substantially. And I really think that's the takeaway. We certainly hope that folks are cautious as they look at our growth against some of our peers' growth because we probably have one of the more conservative perspectives out here on this pricing level. And so-despite, though, this conservative picture, a lot of growth continuing in our business as you'll see on our guidance of the next page.
Moving on to Slide 17. This really just lays out for you all of the adjusted segment profit, the changes that we expect the capital expenditure, the dividends and the EPS. And as you can see, a very nice pattern, with up into the right here in terms of adjusted segment profit. Our dividend, certainly strong increases there, and our EPS adjusted earnings. So the capital expenditure, as you can see, is very volatile over this period. Really, this is driven by, first, the Laser acquisition in 2012, and as well some dollars that we pushed from '11 into '12 in our capital -- in growth capital buckets. So 2013, you can see that going down. I would tell you, given the amount of demand that we got for project and so forth, I would be surprised if we continue to see 2013 held so low as we get a little closer to that time and some of the projects we're working on become more of a reality. So, great picture here in terms of continued growth in our business. And I'll remind you -- and I think this is extremely important, that when you're comparing our growth in these businesses, you recognize how conservative our pricing forecast is relative to what we've seen out there in the market from others. And despite that very conservative picture, we continue growth that looks like this. If we were to see this normalize with our -- from our 2011 margins, as a lot of folks are showing, you'd see a much higher growth rate in here. But we are very comfortable with the picture that we have here and our ability to continue to increase the dividend even over a more conservative pricing environment.
So moving to our last slide here on Slide 18. As we mentioned before, we certainly have transformed Williams. We're very excited about the growth prospects that we have in the business and the demand for our infrastructure services as they continue. And we certainly very much appreciate the model that we have between Williams and WPZ and the ability to increase our dividends that comes from that. 
And so with that, thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to be able to talk you further about our growth."

Good morning, and thank you, Travis. First of all, we certainly had very noisy result from the EPS as we spun off WPX. But really boiling it down and looking at the continuing operations, you'll see that our adjusted segment profit versus our third",669,"Great. Good morning, and thank you, Travis. First of all, we certainly had very noisy result from the EPS as we spun off WPX. But really boiling it down and looking at the continuing operations, you'll see that our adjusted segment profit versus our third quarter guidance came in right in between our midpoint and high that we've given you for a guidance there, so our continuing operation is performing very well in the fourth quarter and throughout 2011. As we look forward, a tremendous amount of new growth and you'll see that built in to both our guidance and capital, as well as our opportunity pipeline that we continue to project. And one of the -- probably the biggest area of change that we had in that opportunity pipeline was the large number of increases coming from our gas pipe segment as major expansions, particularly on Transco, and a little -- to a lesser degree, on Gulfstream, really start to present themselves as the industry and power generation industry look to take advantage of continued low natural gas prices. So very excited about the way we're positioned in that space, and our opportunity pipeline certainly demonstrates that.
On guidance, you'll note a raise in guidance for both '12 and '13, and this is an improvement in our adjusted segment profit plus DD&A of about $40 million and 12 at midpoint and $120 million in 2013. In '12, the drivers there are slightly higher NGL margins, the addition of Laser to our guidance, as well as some offsetting impact of lower volumes in some our areas due to lower gas prices and our expectation of slow drilling in some of those areas. So overall, an improvement in '12, though. In '13, you'll see even lower NGL margins than we had previously in our guidance there, and I'll speak to that in just a moment. But those were -- are offset in '13 by higher ethylene margins in our MC&O areas, so a nice raise there for '13. And I think it really shows the strength of our portfolio, and a big part of that strength is the growth in fee-based revenues that we continue to see in '11, we're going to see in '12, and we certainly are going to start to see present itself in '13.
Speaking of commodity prices and our changes there, what you'll note there is very high crude-to-gas ratios reflecting kind of what we're seeing in the current market out there. We've got gas now $3 for '12 and $3.75 for '13, and we've got crude holding steady at $100. However, despite that very high crude-to-gas ratio, much as we usually see when we see that ratio blow way out, we do not see the NGL components keeping pace with that big separation. And so you'll see a very low NGL-to-crude ratio in our forecast of about 45%. And that has us have our NGL margin declining from '11 through '13 of just a little over 15%. But as I said earlier, we are projecting our ethylene business, particularly in '13, starting to take advantage of those lower ethylene prices. So -- but despite what I would say as a very conservative outlook in the NGL margin space, we continue to show very strong cash flow growth and very bullish about the way our continued cash flows from both WPZ and our Midstream Canada and olefin segment is going. And I would just remind you, as you're looking out there amongst our peers, making sure you're look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, we feel like we've got a pretty good insight into the commodity prices. But I think what's impressive is we've got continued nice strength in our growing cash flow despite a 15% decline in our NGL margin, and I think a lot of our peers would be hard-pressed to show that kind of resilience and strength in a lower price environment.

So as we think about that, and you guys have your wedged pie charts over the next 5 years, do you see that sort of developing as far as perhaps leading to announced projects, something that might be near term at the first half of that 5-year outlook, or is it more in the back half? Is there any sense of color on that?"

Slide 57 in the data book, we've just touted some future potential expansions on Transco largely -- either along the Leidy Line or in the Southeastern U.S. and in Gulfstream as well. All those is because of our view of potential power gen growth. And there's something -- and some of it would be actual growth, and some of it is driven by coal plant conversions. There's over 30 gigawatts within -- of potential either conversion or new power build within 50 miles of Transco. And we could see -- we are pursuing about the equivalent of 3 Bcf a day or about $2.5 billion of investment associated with -- or close to Transco right now. Now I'm not saying we're going to get all that. We're in competition for that, but it's a pretty positive outlook for Transco."

And I would tell you there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to not only capture that existing business but to grow that business further and be able to optimize the value of those streams even better. Our BB splitter that we did in August '10 is a great example of that where we're further optimizing the value of those streams. I would tell you that from our vantage point, that a lot of the oil sands operations are fairly immature in terms of optimizing the value of those resources. And so things like hydrogen that is in big demand out there, will continue to be in big demand. Dilium [ph] transfer, we think there's a lot of services up there that we have a lot of room to grow that business in. And so I would tell you, we're going to seek out those areas where we have the largest competitive advantages and provide us the highest return.

Having said that, we certainly keep our eyes open if we think that some of those projects could demand a return that's competing with our other opportunities that we have both in the U.S. and in Canada."

But I'll also tell you that if you just look historically, if you look at the gas-to-crude ratio or crude-to-gas ratio, and you realize how high that is relative to historical, there is an inverse relationship, generally, that occurs between high crude-to-gas ratio and the NGL-to-crude number. And so even though it seems unprecedented low number on that NGL to crude, we also are unprecedented crude-to-gas ratios as well. And so if you look at the overall margin, I'm not sure that it's far out of line. And so -- but certainly, the current environment, the very warm winter that we're having, certainly is impacting propane storage. And propane is just as exposed to that as natural gas is. And so that could be a hangover certainly in '12. I think, '13 it's a little early to call, frankly, and we may be a little bit conservative at '13. But I think as we look for both ethane for the balance of this first half of '12 and propane for the balance of the year, that we could see some pressure there just because what we're seeing in storage volumes on propane right now."

It gets a little confusing, too. But I think that the thing that we have given some guidance on is kind of where our total capacity is going with Springville. Right now, we're in the 300 range. We'll be going up to 625, 650 over the course of the year on Springville. Laser is going to be up around 1.3 billion a day of capacity. And then Randy talked about the $500 million in a Constitution project. And we also have about $500 million a day of inter-connectivity with Tennessee Gas Pipeline in that field. So that kind of adds up to that 3 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity. And maybe what you ought to keep in mind is that, that is one of the limitations out there. So producers are out scrambling to get takeaway capacity and then drilling to fill that, evidenced by Cabot's willingness to take the full 500 on the Constitution project. So it does take time to build. I think we exited the year, just say on our Springville assets, for instance, and '11 at around $600 million a day. That will be going up by well over 50% by the end of '13. And the Laser -- the whole Laser story is one that's unfolding. It obviously just started up. So volumes are building there. The earning potentials in '12 and '13 are just a shadow of what they're going to be. So we've got a real strong producer group right now behind those assets, and they're going to be ramping up quickly. Cabot, I think, has been pretty transparent about their plans. This is one of WPX's key areas, and they've been having good results out there. And decrease of volumes are backed by a drilling carry from reliance. So we're very excited about the opportunities out there, and I think you'll see these producers working hard to take advantage of that takeaway capacity."

A lot of great information to go through here this morning and glad we've got the context that cleared now. Some of the things I'll be hitting on this morning here. First of all, talk about our 2011 performance and then I'll walk through some of the rapidly expanding growth capital that we've got out there and a lot of the projects that are behind that capital expansion. And then I will move to the guidance for 2012 and '13 along with an updated commodity price deck that reflects our latest thinking about the commodities environment that we look forward to in '12 and '13.
First of all, before we get into that, I want to remind you, certainly, we could not be more excited about Williams going forward and the way we're positioned in what we think are definitely the right assets, great markets and we certainly are excited about the strategy and how that is performing for us. Also, our MLP structure continues to fuel our dividend growth forWMB and allows us to continue to raise capital in a very cost efficient manner for Williams shareholders and our high-dividend payout expected to increase every quarter. Now as we go forward rather then either annual or semiannually, we now have laid out a policy to increase that are going to be increasing that at a rate of about 7/8 of $0.01. And that equates to a December '11 number versus December '12, will give us a 14% increase in our annual dividend growth from '11 versus '12.
So we continue to be very excited about our ability to grow the dividend. We think it's extremely transparent where that growth is coming from and as we continue to add more and more capital projects to this, we expect to even be able top expand that further. We continue to be very committed to our investment grade credit as well.
Okay, moving on here to Slide 5. Great financial performance for 2011, a 37% within our adjusted net income. That was $734 million versus $537 million from our continuing ops. Very strong business performance, growing at a cliff of about 27% of our adjusted segment profit. And that was driven by a 24% increase in Williams Partners and a 67% increase in our Midstream Canada and olefins. Some of the drivers there, certainly, in the fee-based business, we grew our fee-based revenues by 12% in Williams Partners and a lot of that volume growth is coming from our Marcellus business as well as our Deepwater business. The higher-NGL frac spreads also were a driver for 2011. And our NGL production volumes were up, but as some of our contracts continue to roll into fee-based business, our NGL equity volumes were flat. So our business is growing but more and more of our revenues are coming from fee-based business.
We certainly, on the Deepwater Gulf business, as I mentioned, not only did we see growth in revenues for 2011, but we also signed up 2 very significant growth projects that will come on in 2014 and beyond, and that is the Keathley Canyon project and as well, the GulfStar FPS. And I'll speak a little bit more about that later. Our Gas Pipelines continued to grow as well. And really, the big projects for gas pipelines, it was actually 4 new major expansions that came on in just during 2011, most of these projects started up in the end of -- latter part of the year, and about $67 million in increased revenues from those projects.
And then again in the Midstream Canada and olefins, higher sales prices really drove a lot of that, as well as increased volumes. But I think probably most important to note is that it wasn't just price just that the market offered us but our butane butylene splitter that we installed towards the last half of 2010 really provided tremendous margin upgrade for us in the 2011 timeframe. So very high return project as we continued to optimize the mix that's coming off of the oilsands off gas range. So continue to be very excited about that. And so we had better margins in our Geismar ethylene business and somewhat impacted by some downtime we had in the fourth quarter for Geismar.
So here on Slide 6, we show the visibility to growth across all of our operating areas. And really important changes going on here. So I'll draw your attention to this. First of all, 2011 has been dropped from this prior. You would've seen 2011 included here, so you really have to look at things on an annualized basis to get to a more comparative viewpoint. So for instance, in guidance, we went from 3 years now to 2 years and on an annual average basis, you see that increase being up 47% on an annual average basis, moving from $1.7 billion to $2.5 billion here in the fourth quarter. And so some of the drivers, of course for this, and a lot of this is weighted towards 2012. But some of the drivers year, primarily, is the Laser acquisition and then some of the expansion cap around the Laser acquisition, as well as a small portion for Constitution. Both of those additions are included in that blue Marcellus slice.
Moving to the middle slice then, you can see now we're going from what was 6 years, 2011 through 2016, is now 5 years. And the midpoint on that -- I'm sorry, the annual average at midpoint on that was about a little over $1.5 billion. And before now, that was $2.5 billion and a 56% increase on the average annual growth capital spending for that period. The drivers on this, a lot of which is on the Eastern Seaboard, which is a number of projects that are in guidance quality projects but the capital push is into 2014. So it's out of this guidance period that's shown on the left. As well as a pretty significant increase on Constitution. Again, that's shown in the Marcellus slide. And then additionally, we've got some increases in the deepwater and some increases in the area of our Midstream Canada and olefins, particularly some projects that we have served, some petchem infrastructure needs for third parties. We haven't disclosed those projects yet but are looking forward to doing that yet in the very near future.
Moving over to the larger pie. Here, you can see this moves from $2.6 billion up to $4.2 billion on an annual average basis or a 62% increase. A number of large drivers here but I'll tell you probably the biggest single theme to this is the fact that we're seeing so much increase for demand on Transco along the Eastern Seaboard and the markets there. So our largest increase here is in the Eastern Seaboard pie that you can see there and you can see Marcellus keeping pace throughout this as well. So a lot of great growth going on. And we just continue to see the demand for infrastructure continue to drive our forecast for growth opportunities out in front of us. And frankly, we're going to be in a nice position to be able to prioritize the very best capital opportunities that we have available for us looking forward.
Moving on to Slide 7, as we mentioned in our capital explanation and the opportunities ahead of us, the Marcellus area continues to be an area we're extremely excited about and continue to grow very strong presence in the Marcellus. And particularly, in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, we are making progress in growing out the infrastructure there, really leveraging off of a resource base there in the Susquehanna County area and our key customers there, Cabot, WPX Energy and Corizo. And we are really excited about how that's coming together. We've got 2 do things to announce, certainly closed the Laser pipeline that we had mentioned earlier. But as of yesterday, we also disclosed the Constitution Pipeline project which will provide even greater access for our customers in this area into new expanding markets as we connect into both the Iroquois pipeline and a favorable location on Tennessee Gas Pipeline in New York. And Cabot is the anchor customer for that project and we will be moving ahead with that project. The size and total capital on that project will be somewhat dependent on the amount of interest we have from other parties but we are prepared to move ahead with the commitment that we have from Cabot for that project. So very excited about this. And really, this area, we believed by 2015, we'll have about 3 BCF per day. Gathering capacity matched up with 3 BCF a day of takeaway capacity from the area as well. And so this is exactly right onto our strategy of providing large-scale infrastructure solutions to producers in the right locations. And certainly, we think Susquehanna County in the Marcellus is the right location.
Moving on to Slide 8. But you can see another exciting project that's leveraging off the growth in the Marcellus Shale as well. And this project is really aimed at serving both producers in Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia, and as well, potentially Utica Shale shippers as well. And so -- but the really unique thing about this project is it not only provides producers with access into these markets, it also provides these great, growing markets on Transco in zone 6, 5, 4 and even 3, it provides these folks with access to these growing reserve base as well with actual firm, backhaul capacity on Transco. And so Transco, as you know, continues -- has been continuing to expand with moving supplies from the South to the North but those expansions have been coming in such a rapid manner that we really are welcome a new supply source from the north to be able to expand our capabilities and serve these markets even faster. So this is not just a supply-based project. It also is providing a great opportunity for our markets along the Transco system as well. And you can see, we would expect this to be in service as early as December of 2014. And we do have an open season out there right now and look to conclude that on April 2. And we'll know a little more about the details of this project when that's concluded.
Now moving onto Slide 9, in the Keathley Canyon Connector, and we've talked about this project. Of course, I won't spend a lot of time here. But this is a 215-mile project with a gathering capacity of 400 million a day and these contracts were executed in late 2011, another great accomplishment that we had in 2011. This project will be expect to be in service in midyear 2014. And I point that out because despite the great gathering growth that we continue to have throughout our guidance period, a lot of these projects that I'm talking about will -- do not come into service in that timeframe and will continue to fuel our growth beyond the guidance period.
Moving on to Slide 10, our GulfStar FPS, another project that we contracted during 2011, and you can see a lot of details offered for you here on the slide. This project is going extremely well to date and a lot of the major contracts for the fabrication and installation of both the spar and the pipelines that are tied into our existing pipeline system have been executed, and are at or below where we expected the estimates to come on for this project. So getting off to a great start on this project and really excited about the degree of interest that we're getting from other producers in the deepwater as well as they're starting to see the reality of this project come together and the speed at which this product can be deployed.
Moving on to Slide 11, moving out west now. The West continues to provide opportunity to us and the Parachute plant is a great example. It's a 350 million a day cryogenic train, almost completely fee-based project and will be in service in 2014. Major customer on this is WPX Energy and this will really help them lift their cash returns on their drilling operations out there as right now, we continue to be a little bit short on processing capacity in that area. So very excited about what's going on out there. Another thing that's not mentioned here is the Overland Pass Pipeline and that pipeline has the NGL pipeline that comes out of the Rockies and into the Midcontinent area, and that capacity is going to be increased up to 255,000 barrels per day to accommodate volumes coming out of the Bakken Shale as well as Parachute TXP1 plant as well.
Moving on to Slide 12. And you can see here, great visibility along our Gas Pipeline system here and a number of projects that are mentioned. And I tell you that the drivers for expansion on Transco and particularly out of is largely driven by power generation load. And right now, we are pursuing projects. These aren't speculative matters. These are actual projects we are pursuing right now that are requiring an excess of 3 Bcf a day of pipeline capacity. And that's about $2.5 billion of pipeline investment to accomplish that. So that's outside of Bcf some of the things we most recently announced. And as well, I will tell you, in a broader study that we looked at, about 30 gigawatts of new power generation load we expect within about 50-mile radius of the Transco pipeline. So you've been hearing a lot about this for the last couple of years from the industry pundits but we are actually seeing it come into very tangible projects for Transco, and we expect to be able to grow both our capital investments and our revenues from our Transco business here pretty rapidly over the next 4, 5 years.
Okay, now moving onto Slide 13 into Canada in our Midstream Canada and olefins area.
Our Boreal pipeline is a great example of how well our project teams are executing out there and this is a project that's been funded out of our international cash reserves so it's not drawing down on our ability to provide dividend. And as we've mentioned before, a lot -- all of this Canadian business today is really being held in reserve from a dividend standpoint. We're not using any of these cash flows. But the point, really, of this slide is to show we continue to be able to execute our project up here very well. In August of 2010, we brought on the BB splitter and we brought that in the low budget and on-time. And also now, in Boreal pipeline, expect to be able to say that as well and we're expecting that to come on in May or June of this year and that will be slightly ahead of our schedule for that project. And as well, we now are forecasting that project to come in under the original budgeted amount. So great execution by our teams out here. And that's a good thing because we have a lot of remaining expansion projects to build with the next one that will come online will be the expansion for NOVA of our ability extract the ethane and ethylene out of the gas streams up here as well. And that will come on in the first half of 2013.
And as you can see here on Slide 14, we have a little more detail on that particular project. This is the NOVA Chemicals project, and we basically have contracted with nova to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the existing gas streams out there for them. And particularly, the first amount of work that's the ones that the Suncor facility, and this involves both some upgrades on the extraction facility, as well as some upgrades on the fractionator down at our Redwater facility. And as you can see here, that project is -- you can see that range and that budget moving down as well. So making great progress on all of our projects up here.
The next project here on Slide 15 is our Geismar plant expansion, very excited about what this offers to us from a strategic standpoint. And we've got a very low cost expansion and we think we're going to be well ahead of the market on most of the other expansions that are coming on in the ethylene cracking space. And we think this is going to be a good thing for Williams relative to the choppiness that we expect to see in terms of ethane volumes coming up in 2013. And we think those project is extremely well-timed in terms of being able to capture the spread between gas and ethylene. And so from a Williams standpoint, we are going to be rather insensitive to the spread between gas to ethane or ethane to ethylene because we'll perfectly balanced here between our ethane supplies coming out of WPZ and our ethylene consumption in Midstream Canada and olefins. And so things are going well on this project as well and we've got a really talented staff and a great operating team there at Geismar, gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to bring this project in on-time and on budget as well.
Now we're going to move to Slide 16 here and talk about our perspective on the industry fundamentals that are driving our NGL margins and our olefins margins as well. So first of all, I'm kind of going to go through the general perspective that we have and I'll come back and talk about the specific changes that we've made to our pricing guidance. First of all, the crude-to-gas ratio continues to be at record high levels, and we certainly expect to see that in both '12, and to a slightly lesser degree, in '13, as we expect gas prices to rebound a little bit from '12 although we don't expect a dramatic movement. The NGL-to-crude ratio however, is really continuing to soften. We're certainly seeing that here in February and in March and we expect to see that continue ratio through the second quarter of '12. We may see some rebound, and hope to see some rebound, in the second half of '12, as a lot of the ethylene-cracking capacity that is out-of-service right now, some of that downtime is related to expansion on some of those ethylene crackers. And so we expect to see ethane demand towards the second half of '12 rebound. And then as we move into '13, though, we expect to see some of the new processing and NGL transport and fractionation infrastructure start to come into service in '13 so we expect to see supplies getting a bit longer in '13 and expect to see some dampening of the NGL-to-crude ratio further into 2013. The natural gas to ethylene spread, really, is the thing you need to stay tuned about ratio about relative to Williams because we really have that the entire space covered with our ethylene cracker at Geismar. And so we really aren't all that sensitive at the WMB level between gas to ethane or ethane to ethylene spread. In fact, in 2013 and mid-2013, when our ethylene cracker comes into service, our expansion there comes into service, will be almost perfectly balanced between our ethane production at Geismar -- or sorry, our ethane production in our processing business and our ethane consumption at Geismar. The very positive thing that we're seeing out of this commodity price environment that we're in is a tremendous demand for infrastructure on the market side on natural gas, particularly on Transco pipeline and it's driving a lot of demand for power generation loads. But as well, this big spread that we continue to see between gas and crude oil-based products is continuing to demand infrastructure that helps us arbitrage that tremendous spread between domestic natural gas and world crude oil prices. And so it takes a lot of infrastructure to close that arbitrage and we're certainly seeing a lot of demand to get at that. So what this just boils down to, in terms of specifics for us, first of all, in 2012, we previously had 82 50 oil, WTI Oil, in our pricing environment. We're seeing that go to $100 here in 2012 and we're taking gas down from what was $4.25 in Henry Hub down to $3 in the period. That equates to a tremendous crude-to-gas ratio of 53.7. So that's up from about 23 in 2011. However, the NGL-to-crude relationship, we really are expecting to diminish significantly. And we certainly have seen that, as I mentioned here in the first quarter. And in 2011, we saw that the 56%, previously in our guidance, we had a 58% NGL-to-crude relationship. We're taking that all the way down to 45%. So very conservative on our part but reflective of a very warm winter for propane demand, and as well, this lack of demand we're seeing right now for ethane due to these ethylene crackers being out of service in the near term. So at the end of the day, we're taking our NGL margin down from $0.83 in 2011 down to $0.78 at the midpoint of our guidance. And on the frac spread side, that goes from $0.91 down to $0.83. So about 9% on the frac spread for 2012.
Looking at 2013, then, pretty similar viewpoint moving a $100 crude oil, and we also are seeing gas go from what was $4.75 down to $3.75, and that gets us to a crude-to-gas ratio of about 27 in 2013, and we're expecting the NGL-to-crude relationship to be about 45% during this period. Additionally, our NGL margin is dropping again relative to 2011, $0.83. We're seeing it go down to $0.70 for that margin. So certainly, very conservative outlook here on NGL margins. But as you'll see, despite that conservative outlook, we continue to build or grow the cash flows and this business driver dividend very substantially and I really think that's the takeaway. We certainly hope that folks are cautious as they look at our growth against some of our peers' growth because we probably have one of the more conservative perspectives out here on this pricing level. And so despite, though, this conservative picture, a lot of growth continuing in our business as you'll see on our guidance of the next page.
Moving on to Slide 17. This really just plays out for you all of the adjusted segment profit, the changes that we expect, the capital expenditure, the dividends and the EPS. And as you can see, a very nice pattern, with up into the right here in terms of adjusted segment profit, our dividend, certainly strong increases there and our EPS adjusted earnings. So the capital expenditures, as you can see, is very volatile over this period. Really, this is driven by, first, the Laser acquisition in 2012, and as well some dollars that we pushed from '11 into '12 in our growth capital buckets. So 2013, you can see that going down. I would tell you, given the amount of demand that we got from project and so forth, I would be surprised if we continue to see 2013 held so low as we get a little closer to that time and some of the projects we're working on become more of a reality. So great picture here in terms of continued growth in our business. And I'll remind you, and I think this is extremely important, that when you're comparing our growth in these businesses, you recognize how conservative our pricing forecast is relative to what we've seen out there in the market from others. And despite that very conservative picture, we continue growth that looks like this. If we were to see this normalize with -- from our 2011 margins, a lot of folks are showing, you'd see a much higher growth rate in here. But we are very comfortable with the picture that we have here and our ability to continue to increase the dividend even over a more conservative pricing environment.
So moving to our last slide here on Slide 18. As we mentioned before, we certainly have transformed Williams. We're very excited about the growth prospects that we have in the business and the demand for our infrastructure services as they continue. And we certainly very much appreciate the model that we have between Williams and WPZ and the ability to increase our dividends that comes from that. And so with that, thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to be able to talk you further about our growth."

First of all, we certainly had very noisy results in the EPS as we spun off WPX. But really, boiling it down and looking at continuing operations, you'll see that our adjusted segment profit versus our third quarter guidance came in right in between our midpoint in high that we've given you with guidance there. Sour continuing operations performing very well in the fourth quarter and throughout 2011.
As we look forward, a tremendous amount of new growth and you'll see that built in with our guidance and capital as well as our opportunity pipeline that we continue to project. And one of the -- probably the biggest area of change that we've had in that opportunity pipeline was a large number of increases coming from our gas pipe segment as major expansions, particularly on Transco, and a little, to a lesser degree, on Gulfstream, really start percent themselves as the industry and power generation industry look to take advantage of continued low natural gas prices. So very excited about the way we're positioned in that space and our opportunity pipeline certainly demonstrates that.
On guidance, you'll note a raise in guidance for both '12 and '13, and this is an improvement in our adjusted segment profit it and plus DD&A of about $40 million and 12 midpoint and $120 million in 2013. In '12, the drivers there are slightly higher NGL margins, the addition of Laser to our guidance, as well as offsetting impact of lower volumes in some due to lower gas prices in our expectation of slow drilling in some of those areas.
So overall, an improvement in '12, though. In '13, you'll see even lower NGL margins that we have previously in our guidance there and I'll speak to that in just a moment. But those are offset in '13 by higher as at the lien margins in our MC&O areas. So a nice raise their for '13 and I think it really shows the strength of our portfolio and a big part of that strength is a growth in fee-based revenues lien that we continue to see in '11, we're going to see in '12 and we're certainly going to start to see present itself in '13.
Speaking of commodity prices and our changes there, what you'll note there is very high crude-to-gas ratios, reflecting kind of what we're seeing in the current market out there. We've got gas now $3 for '12 and $3.75 for '13, and we've got crude holding steady at $100. However, despite that very high crude-to-gas ratio, much as we usually see when we see that ratio blow way out, we do not see the NGL components keeping pace with that big separation. And so you'll see a very low NGL-to-crude ratio in our forecast of about 45% and that has our NGL margin declining from '11 through '13 of just a little over 15%. But as I said earlier, we are projecting our ethylene business, particularly in '13, starting to take advantage of those ethylene prices. So -- but despite what I would say as a very conservative outlook in the NGL margins space, we continue to show very strong cash flow growth and very bullish about the way our continued cash flows from both WPZ and our Midstream Canada and olefin segment is going. And I would just remind you, as you're looking out there amongst our peers, making sure you look at it on an apples-to-apples basis we got a pretty good insight into the commodity prices, but I think what's impressive is we've got continued nice strength in our growing cash flows despite a 15% decline in our NGL margin and I think a lot of our peers will be hard-pressed to show that kind of resilience and strength in a lower price environment. So with that, we will turn it over to questions."

Our BB splitter that we did in August '10 is a great example where we further optimizing the value of those streams. I would tell you that from our vantage point, that a lot of the oils operations are fairly immature in terms of optimizing the value of those resources.

But I'll also tell you that you that if we just look historically, if you look at the gas-to-crude ratio or crude-to-gas ratio and you realize how high that is relative to historical. There is an inverse relationship, generally, that occurs between high crude-to-gas ratio and the NGL-to-crude number. And so even though it seems unprecedented low number on that NGL to crude, we also have unprecedented crude-to-gas ratios as well. So if you look at the overall margin, I'm not sure that that's far out of line. But certainly, the current internment, the very warm winter that we're having, certainly, is impacting propane storage and propane is just as exposed to that as natural gas is. And so that could be a hangover certainly in '12. I think, '13 it's a little early to call, frankly, and we might be a little bit conservative in '13.

But I think that's the thing that we have given some guidance on is kind of where our total capacity is going with Springville. Right now, we're in the 300 range. We'll be going up to the 625, 650 over the course of the year on Springville. Laser is going to be up around 1.3 billion a day of capacity. And then Randy talked about the $500 million, the Constitution project. And we also have about $500 million a day of interconnectivity with Tennessee Gas Pipeline in that field. So that kind of adds up to that 3 BCF a day takeaway capacity. And maybe what you ought to keep in mind is that is one of the limitations out there. So producers are out scrambling to get takeaway capacity and then drilling to fill that, evidenced by Cabot's willingness to take the full 500 on the Constitution project. So it does take time to build. I think we exited the year, just say on our Springville assets, for instance, and '11 at around $600 million a day. That will be going up by well over 50% by the end of '13. And the Laser, the whole Laser story is one that's unfolding. It obviously just started up. So volumes are building there. The earning potentials in '12 and '13 are just a shadow of what they're going to be. So we've got a really strong producer group right now behind those assets and they're going to be ramping up quickly. Cabot, I think, has been pretty transparent about their plans. This is one of WPX's key areas and they've been having good results out there and the volumes are backed by drilling carry alliance. So we're very excited about the opportunities out there.

Thank you, Travis, and good morning, everyone. A lot of great information to go through here this morning and glad we've got the context set clear here now . Some of the things I'll be hitting on this morning here, first of all, talking about our 2",4207,"Great. Thank you, Travis, and good morning, everyone. A lot of great information to go through here this morning and glad we've got the context set clear here now . Some of the things I'll be hitting on this morning here, first of all, talking about our 2011 performance, and then I'll work through some of the rapidly expanding growth capital that we've got out there and a lot of the projects that are behind that capital expansion. And then I will move to the guidance for 2012 and '13, along with an updated commodity price deck that reflects our latest thinking about the commodities environment that we look forward to in '12 and '13.
First of all though, before we get into that, I want to remind you, certainly, we could not be more excited about Williams going forward and the way we're positioned in what we think are definitely the right assets, great markets and we certainly are excited about the strategy and how that is performing for us. Also, our MLP structure continues to fuel our dividend growth at WMB and allows us to continue to raise capital in a very cost-efficient manner for Williams shareholders and our high-dividend payout expect an increase every quarter now as we go forward rather than either annual or semiannually. We now have laid out our policy to increase that and are going to be increasing that at a rate of about 7/8 of $0.01. And that equates to a December '11 number versus a December '12, will give us a 14% increase in our annual dividend growth from '11 versus '12.
So we continue to be very excited about our ability to grow the dividend. We think it's extremely transparent where that growth is coming from. And as we continue to add more and more capital projects to this, we expect to even be able to expand that further. We continue to be very committed to our investment grade credit as well.
Okay, moving on here to Slide 5. Great financial performance for 2011, a 37% growth in our adjusted net income. That was $734 million versus $537 million from our continuing ops. Very strong business performance, growing at a clip of about 27% on our adjusted segment profit. And that was driven by a 24% increase in Williams Partners and a 67% increase in our Midstream Canada and olefins. 
Some of the drivers there, certainly, in the fee-based business, we grew our fee-based revenues by 12% in Williams Partners and a lot of that volume growth is coming from our Marcellus business, as well as our Deepwater business. The higher NGL frac spreads also were a driver for 2011, and our NGL production volumes were up. But as some of our contracts continue to roll into a fee-based business, our NGL equity volumes were flat. So our business is growing but more and more of our revenues are coming from fee-based business.
We certainly, on the Deepwater Gulf business, as I mentioned, not only did we see growth in revenues for 2011, but we also signed up 2 very significant growth projects that will come on in 2014 and beyond, and that is the Keathley Canyon project and as well, the GulfStar FPS. And I'll speak a little bit more about that later. 
Our Gas Pipelines continued to grow as well. And really, the big projects for the gas pipelines, there was actually 4 new major expansions that came on in just during 2011. And most of these projects started up in the end of -- latter part of the year, and about $67 million in increased revenues from those projects.
And then again in the Midstream Canada and olefins, higher sales prices really drove a lot of that, as well as increased volumes. But I think probably most important to note is that it wasn't just priced just that the market offered us, but our butane/butylene splitter that we installed in -- towards the last half of 2010 really provided tremendous margin upgrade for us in the 2011 timeframe. So a very high-return project as we continue to optimize the mix that's coming off the oil sands off gas stream. So we continue to be very excited about that. And as well, we had better margins in our Geismar ethylene business and somewhat impacted by some downtime that we had in the fourth quarter for Geismar.
So here on Slide 6, we show the visibility to growth across all of our operating areas. And really important changes going on here. So I'll draw your attention to this. First of all, 2011 has been dropped from this. Prior, you would have seen 2011 included here, so you really have to look at things on an annualized basis to get to a more comparative viewpoint. So for instance, in guidance, we went from 3 years now to 2 years and on an annual average basis, you see that increase being up 47% on an annual average basis, moving from $1.7 billion to $2.5 billion here in the fourth quarter. And so some of the drivers, of course, for this, and a lot of this is weighted towards 2012, but some of the drivers here, primarily, the Laser acquisition and then some of the expansion cap around the Laser acquisition, as well as a small portion for Constitution. Both of those additions are included in that new Marcellus slice.
Moving to the middle slice then, you can see now we're going from what was 6 years, 2011 through 2016, is now 5 years. And the midpoint on that -- or sorry, the annual average at midpoint on that was about -- a little over $1.5 billion. And before now, that is $2.5 billion and a 56% increase on the average annual growth capital spending for that period. The drivers on this, a lot of which is on the Eastern Seaboard, which is a number of small projects that are in-guidance quality projects, but the capital push is into 2014. So it's out of that guidance period that's shown to the left. As well as a pretty significant increase on Constitution, again, that's shown in the Marcellus slide. And then additionally, we've got some increases in the Deepwater and some increases in the area of our Midstream Canada and olefins, particularly some projects that we have serve, some pet chem infrastructure needs for third parties. We haven't disclosed those projects yet but are looking forward to doing that yet in the very near future.
Moving over to the larger pie. Here, you can see this moves from $2.6 billion up to $4.2 billion on an annual average basis or a 62% increase. A number of large drivers here, but I'll tell you, probably the biggest single theme to this is the fact that we're seeing so much increase for demand on Transco along the Eastern Seaboard and the markets there. So our largest increase here is in the Eastern Seaboard pie that you can see there, and you can see Marcellus keeping pace throughout this as well. So a lot of great growth going on. And we just continue to see the demand for our infrastructure continue to drive our forecast for growth opportunities out in front of us. And frankly, we're going to be in a nice position to be able to prioritize to the very best capital opportunities that we have available for us looking forward.
Moving on to Slide 7, as we mentioned in our capital explanation and the opportunities ahead of us, the Marcellus area continues to be an area we're extremely excited about and continue to grow a very strong presence in the Marcellus, and particularly, in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, we are making progress in growing out the infrastructure there, really leveraging off of a resource base there in the Susquehanna County area and our key customers there, Cabot, WPX Energy and Carrizo. And we are really excited about how that's coming together. We've got 2 new things to announce. Certainly we closed the Laser pipeline that we had mentioned earlier. But as of yesterday, we also disclosed the Constitution Pipeline project which will provide even greater access for our customers in this area into new expanding markets as we connect into both the Iroquois pipeline and a favorable location on Tennessee Gas Pipeline in New York. And Cabot is the anchor customer for that project, and we will be moving ahead with that project. The size and total capital on that project will be somewhat dependent on the amount of interest we have from other parties, but we are prepared to move ahead with the commitment that we have from Cabot for that project. So very excited about this. And really, this area, we believe by 2015, will have about 3 Bcf per day. Gathering capacity matched up with 3 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity from the area as well. And so this is exactly right onto our strategy of providing large-scale infrastructure solutions to producers in the right locations. And certainly, we think Susquehanna County in the Marcellus is the right location.
Moving on to Slide 8. Here, you can see another exciting project that's leveraging off the growth in the Marcellus Shale as well. And this project is really aimed at serving both producers in Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia, and as well, potentially Utica Shale shippers as well. And so -- but the really unique thing about this project is it not only provides producers with access into these markets, it also provides these great, growing markets on Transco in zone 6, 5, 4 and even 3, it provides these folks with access to these growing reserve base as well with actual firm, backhaul capacity on Transco. And so Transco, as you know, continues to -- has been continuing to expand with moving supplies from the South to the North, but those expansions have been coming in such a rapid manner that we really -- or welcome a new supply source from the north to be able to expand our capabilities to serve these markets even faster. So this is not just a supply-based project. It also is providing a great opportunity for our markets along the Transco system as well. And you can see, we would expect this to be in service as early as December of 2014, and we do have an open season out there right now and look to conclude that on April 2. And we'll know a little more about the details of this project when that's concluded.
Now moving onto Slide 9, in the Keathley Canyon Connector, and we've talked about this project. Fortunately, I won't spend a lot of time here. But this is a 215-mile project with a gathering capacity of 400 million a day. And these contracts were executed in late 2011, another great accomplishment that we had in 2011. This project will be expected to be in service in mid-year 2014. And I point that out because despite the great growth that we continue to have throughout our guidance period, a lot of these projects that I'm talking about will -- do not come into service in that timeframe and will continue to fuel our growth beyond the guidance period.
Moving on to Slide 10, our GulfStar FPS, another project that we contracted during 2011, and you can see a lot of details offered for you here on the slide. This project is going extremely well to date and a lot of the major contracts for the fabrication and installation of both the spar and the pipelines that will tie it into our existing pipeline system have been executed, and are at or below where we expected the estimates to come in for this project. So getting off to a great start on this project and really excited about the degree of interest that we're getting from other producers in the Deepwater as well as they're starting to see the reality of this project come together and the speed at which this product can be deployed.
Moving on to Slide 11, moving out West now. The West continues to provide opportunity to us and the Parachute Plant is a great example. It's a 350 million a day cryogenic train, almost completely fee-based project, and it will be in service in 2014. Major customer on this is WPX Energy, and this will really help them lift their cash returns on their drilling operations out there as right now, we continue to be a little bit short on processing capacity in that area. So very excited about what's going on out there. Another thing that's not mentioned here is the Overland Pass Pipeline, and that pipeline, that's the NGL pipeline that comes out of the Rockies and into the Mid-continent area. And that capacity is going to be increased up to 255,000 barrels per day to accommodate One Oak's new volumes coming out of the Bakken Shale, as well as Parachute TXP1 plant as well.
Moving on to Slide 12. And you can see here great visibility along our gas pipeline system here and a number of projects that are mentioned. And I'll tell you that the drivers for expansion on Transco in particularly is largely driven by power generation load. And right now, we are pursuing projects. These aren't speculative matters. These are actual projects we are pursuing right now that are requiring an excess of 3 Bcf a day of pipeline capacity. And that's about $2.5 billion of pipeline investment to accomplish that. So that's outside of some of the things that we most recently announced. And as well, I will tell you, in a broader study that we looked at, about 30 gigawatts of new power generation load we expect within about 50-mile radius of the Transco pipeline. So you've been hearing a lot about this for the last couple of years from the industry pundits, but we are actually seeing it come to -- into very tangible projects for Transco, and we expect to be able to grow both our capital investments and our revenues from our Transco business here pretty rapidly over the next 4 or 5 years.
Okay, now moving onto Slide 13 into Canada in our Midstream Canada and olefins area. Our Boreal pipeline is a great example of how well our project teams are executing up there. And this is a project that's being funded out of our international cash reserves, so it's not drawing down on any of our ability to provide dividend. And as we've mentioned before, a lot -- all of this Canadian business today is really being held in reserve from a dividend standpoint. We're not using any of these cash flows. But the point, really, of this slide is to show we continue to be able to execute our projects up here very well. In August of 2010, we brought on the BB splitter, and we brought that in below budget and on time. And also now, in Boreal pipeline, expect to be able to say that as well, and we're expecting that to come on in May or June of this year, and that will be slightly ahead of our schedule for that project. And as well, we now are forecasting that project to come in under the original budgeted amount. So great execution by our teams up here, and that's a good thing because we have a lot of remaining expansion projects to build with the next one that will come online will be the expansion for NOVA of our ability to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the gas streams up here as well. And that will come on in the first part of 2013.
And as you can see here on Slide 14, we have a little more detail on that particular project. This is the NOVA Chemicals project, and we basically have contracted with NOVA to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the existing gas streams up there for them. And particularly, the first amount of work that's the on is at the Suncor facility. And this involves both some upgrades on the extraction facility, as well as some upgrades on the fractionator down at our Redwater facility. And as you can see here, that project is -- you can see that range of that budget moving down as well. So making great progress on all of our projects up here.
The next project here on Slide 15 is our Geismar plant expansion, very excited about what this offers to us from a strategic standpoint. And we've got a very low cost expansion, and we think we're going to be well ahead of the market on most of the other expansions that are coming on in the ethylene cracking space. And we think this is going to be a good thing for Williams relative to the choppiness that we expect to see in terms of ethane volumes coming up in 2013. And we think this project is extremely well-timed in terms of being able to capture the spread between gas and ethylene. And so from a Williams standpoint, we are going to be rather insensitive to the spread between gas to ethane or ethane to ethylene because we'll perfectly balanced here between our ethane supplies coming out of WPZ and our ethane consumption in Midstream Canada and olefins. And so things are going well on this project as well, and we've got a really talented staff and a great operating team there at Geismar, gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to bring this project in on-time and on budget as well.
Now we're going to move to Slide 16 here and talk about our perspective on the industry fundamentals that are driving our NGL margins and our olefins margins as well. So first of all, I'm going to kind of go through the general perspective that we have, and then I'll come back and talk about the specific changes that we've made to our pricing guidance. First of all, the crude-to-gas ratio continues to be at record high levels, and we certainly expect to see that in both '12, and to a slightly lesser degree, in '13, as we expect gas prices to rebound a little bit from '12 even though we don't expect dramatic movement. 
The NGL-to-crude ratio however, is really continuing to soften. We're certainly seeing that here in February and in March, and we expect to see that continue through the second quarter of '12. We may see some rebound, and hope to see some rebound in the second half of '12, as a lot of the ethylene cracking capacity that is out-of-service right now, some of that down time is related to expansion on some of those ethylene crackers. And so we expect to see ethane demand towards the second half of '12 rebound. And then as we move into '13, though, we expect to see some of the new processing and NGL transport and fractionation infrastructure start to come into service in '13. And we -- so we expect to see supplies getting a bit longer in '13 and expect to see some dampening of the NGL-to-crude ratio further into 2013. 
The natural gas-to-ethylene spread, really, is the thing you need to stay tuned about relative to Williams because we really have that entire space covered with our ethylene cracker at Geismar. And so we really aren't all that sensitive at the WMB level between gas-to-ethane or ethane-to-ethylene spread. In fact, in 2013 and mid-2013, when our ethylene cracker comes into service, our expansion there comes into service, we'll be almost perfectly balanced between our ethane production at Geismar -- or sorry, our ethane production in our processing business and our ethane consumption at Geismar. A very positive thing that we're seeing out of this commodity price environment that we're in is a tremendous demand for infrastructure on the market side on natural gas, particularly on Transco pipeline, and it's driving a lot of demand for power generation loads. But as well, this big spread that we continue to see between gas and crude oil-based products is continuing to demand infrastructure that helps us arbitrage that tremendous spread between domestic natural gas and world crude oil prices. And so it takes a lot of infrastructure to close that arbitrage, and we certainly have seen a lot of demand to get at that. 
So what this boils down to in terms of specifics for us, first of all, in 2012, we previously had $82.50 oil, WTI Oil, in our pricing environment. We're seeing that go to $100 here in 2012, and we're taking gas down from what was $4.25 at Henry Hub down to $3 in the period. That equates to a tremendous crude-to-gas ratio of 33.7. So -- and that's up from about 23 in 2011. However, the NGL-to-crude relationship, we really are expecting to diminish significantly, and we certainly have seen that, as I mentioned here in the first quarter. And in 2011, we saw that the 56%, previously in our guidance, we had a 58% NGL-to-crude relationship. We're taking that all the way down to 45%. So very conservative on our part, but reflective of a very warm winter for propane demand, and as well, this lack of demand we're seeing right now for ethane due to these ethylene crackers being out of service in the near term. So at the end of the day, we're taking our NGL margin down from $0.83 in 2011 down to $0.78 at the midpoint of our guidance. And on the frac spread side, that goes from $0.91 down to $0.83. So about 9% on the frac spread for 2012.
Looking at 2013 then, pretty similar viewpoint, moving a $100 crude oil, and we also are seeing gas go from what was $4.75 down to $3.75. And that gets us to a crude-to-gas ratio of about 27 in 2013. And we're expecting the NGL-to-crude relationship to be 45% during this period. Additionally, our NGL margin is dropping again relative to 2011, $0.83. We're seeing it go down to $0.70 for that margin. So certainly, very conservative outlook here on NGL margins. But as you'll see, despite that conservative outlook, we continue to be able to grow the cash flows of this business and drive our dividend very substantially. And I really think that's the takeaway. We certainly hope that folks are cautious as they look at our growth against some of our peers' growth because we probably have one of the more conservative perspectives out here on this pricing level. And so, despite, though, this conservative picture, a lot of growth continuing in our business as you'll see on our guidance of the next page.
Moving on to Slide 17. This really just lays out for you all of the adjusted segment profit, the changes that we expect the capital expenditure, the dividends and the EPS. And as you can see, a very nice pattern, with up into the right here in terms of adjusted segment profit. Our dividend, certainly strong increases there, and our EPS adjusted earnings. So the capital expenditure, as you can see, is very volatile over this period. Really, this is driven by, first, the Laser acquisition in 2012, and as well some dollars that we pushed from '11 into '12 in our capital -- in growth capital buckets. So 2013, you can see that going down. I would tell you, given the amount of demand that we've got for project and so forth, I would be surprised if we continue to see 2013 held so low as we get a little closer to that time and some of the projects we're working on become more of a reality. So, great picture here in terms of the continued growth in our business. And I'll remind you -- and I think this is extremely important, that when you're comparing our growth in these businesses, you recognize how conservative our pricing forecast is relative to what we've seen out there in the market from others. And despite that very conservative picture, we continue to see growth that looks like this. If we were to see this normalize with our -- from our 2011 margins, as a lot of folks are showing, you'd see a much higher growth rate in here. But we are very comfortable with the picture that we have here and our ability to continue to increase the dividend even over a more conservative pricing environment.
So moving to our last slide here on Slide 18. As we mentioned before, we certainly have transformed Williams. We're very excited about the growth prospects that we have in the business and the demand for our infrastructure services as they continue. And we certainly very much appreciate the model that we have between Williams and WPZ and the ability to increase our dividends that comes from that. 
And so with that, thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to being able to talk you further about our growth."

But really boiling it down and looking at the continuing operations, you'll see that our adjusted segment profit versus our third quarter guidance came in right in between our midpoint and high that we've given you for a guidance there, so our continuing operation is performing very well in the fourth quarter and throughout 2011. As we look forward, a tremendous amount of new growth and you'll see that built in to both our guidance and capital, as well as our opportunity pipeline that we continue to project. And one of the -- probably the biggest area of change that we had in that opportunity pipeline was a large number of increases coming from our gas pipe segment as major expansions, particularly on Transco, and a little -- to a lesser degree, on Gulfstream, really start to present themselves as the industry and power generation industry look to take advantage of continued low natural gas prices. So very excited about the way we're positioned in that space, and our opportunity pipeline certainly demonstrates that.
On guidance, you'll note a raise in guidance for both '12 and '13, and this is an improvement in our adjusted segment profit plus DD&A of about $40 million and 12 at midpoint and $120 million in 2013. In '12, the drivers there are slightly higher NGL margins, the addition of Laser to our guidance, as well as some offsetting impact of lower volumes in some of our areas due to lower gas prices and our expectation of slow drilling in some of those areas. So overall, an improvement in '12, though. In '13, you'll see even lower NGL margins than we had previously in our guidance there, and I'll speak to that in just a moment. But those were -- are offset in '13 by higher ethylene margins in our MC&O areas, so a nice raise there for '13. And I think it really shows the strength of our portfolio, and a big part of that strength is the growth in fee-based revenues that we continue to see in '11, we're going to see in '12, and we certainly are going to start to see present itself in '13.
Speaking of commodity prices and our changes there, what you'll note there is very high crude-to-gas ratios reflecting kind of what we're seeing in the current market out there. We've got gas now at $3 for '12 and $3.75 for '13, and we've got crude holding steady at $100. However, despite that very high crude-to-gas ratio, much as we usually see when we see that ratio blow way out, we do not see the NGL components keeping pace with that big separation. And so you'll see a very low NGL-to-crude ratio in our forecast of about 45%. And that has us have our NGL margin declining from '11 through '13 of just a little over 15%. But as I said earlier, we are projecting our ethylene business, particularly in '13, starting to take advantage of those lower ethylene prices. So -- but despite what I would say is a very conservative outlook in the NGL margin space, we continue to show very strong cash flow growth and very bullish about the way our continued cash flows from both WPZ and our Midstream Canada and olefin segment is going. And I would just remind you, as you're looking out there amongst our peers, making sure you're looking at it on an apples-to-apples basis, we feel like we've got a pretty good insight into the commodity prices. But I think what's impressive is we've got continued nice strength in our growing cash flow despite a 15% decline in our NGL margin, and I think a lot of our peers would be hard-pressed to show that kind of resilience and strength in a lower price environment. 
So with that, we will turn it over to questions."

And I would tell you there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to not only capture that existing business but to grow that business further and be able to optimize the value of those streams even better. Our BB splitter that we did in August '10 is a great example of that where we're further optimizing the value of those streams. I would tell you that from our vantage point, that a lot of the oil sands operations are fairly immature in terms of optimizing the value of those resources. And so things like hydrogen that is in big demand out there and will continue to be in big demand. Helium transfer, we think there's a lot of services up there that we have a lot of room to grow that business in. And so I would tell you, we're going to seek out those areas where we have the largest competitive advantages and provide us the highest return. And I would say some of those more competitive areas are going to have a hard time competing with those opportunities. Having said that, we certainly keep our eyes open if we think that some of those projects could demand a return that's competing with our other opportunities that we have both in the U.S. and in Canada."

I would say that certainly, the current environment has got us a little bearish on that. But I'll also tell you that if you just look historically, if you look at the gas-to-crude ratio or crude-to-gas ratio, and you realize how high that is relative to historical, there is an inverse relationship, generally, that occurs between high crude-to-gas ratio and the NGL-to-crude number. And so even though it seems unprecedented low number on that NGL to crude, we also are unprecedented crude-to-gas ratios as well. And so if you look at the overall margin, I'm not sure that it's that far out of line. And so -- but certainly, the current environment, the very warm winter that we're having, certainly is impacting propane storage. And propane is just as exposed to that as natural gas is. And so that could be a hangover certainly in '12. I think, '13 it's a little early to call, frankly, and we may be a little bit conservative in '13. But I think as we look for both ethane for the balance of this first half of '12 and propane for the balance of the year, that we could see some pressure there just because of what we're seeing in storage volumes on propane right now."

It gets a little confusing, too. But I think that the thing that we have given some guidance on is kind of where our total capacity is going with Springville. Right now, we're in the 300 range. We'll be going up to 625, 650 over the course of the year on Springville. Laser is going to be up around 1.3 billion a day of capacity. And then Randy talked about the $500 million in a Constitution project. And we also have about $500 million a day of inter-connectivity with Tennessee Gas Pipeline in that field. So that kind of adds up to that 3 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity. And maybe what you ought to keep in mind is that, that is one of the limitations out there. So producers are out scrambling to get takeaway capacity and then drilling to fill that, evidenced by Cabot's willingness to take the full 500 on the Constitution project. So it does take time to build. I think we exited the year, just say on our Springville assets, for instance, and '11 at around $600 million a day. That will be going up by well over 50% by the end of '13. And the Laser -- the whole Laser story is one that's unfolding. It obviously just started up. So volumes are building there. The earning potentials in '12 and '13 are just a shadow of what they're going to be. So we've got a real strong producer group right now behind those assets, and they're going to be ramping up quickly. Cabot, I think, has been pretty transparent about their plans. This is one of WPX's key areas, and they've been having good results out there. And the Carrizo volumes are backed by a drilling carry from reliance. So we're very excited about the opportunities up there, and I think you'll see these producers working hard to take advantage of that takeaway capacity."

Some of the things I'll be hitting on this morning here, first of all, talking about our 2",4207,"Great. Thank you, Travis, and good morning, everyone. A lot of great information to go through here this morning and glad we've got the context set clear here now . Some of the things I'll be hitting on this morning here, first of all, talking about our 2011 performance, and then I'll work through some of the rapidly expanding growth capital that we've got out there and a lot of the projects that are behind that capital expansion. And then I will move to the guidance for 2012 and '13, along with an updated commodity price deck that reflects our latest thinking about the commodities environment that we look forward to in '12 and '13.
First of all though, before we get into that, I want to remind you, certainly, we could not be more excited about Williams going forward and the way we're positioned in what we think are definitely the right assets, great markets and we certainly are excited about the strategy and how that is performing for us. Also, our MLP structure continues to fuel our dividend growth at WMB and allows us to continue to raise capital in a very cost-efficient manner for Williams shareholders and our high-dividend payout expect an increase every quarter now as we go forward rather than either annual or semiannually. We now have laid out our policy to increase that and are going to be increasing that at a rate of about 7/8 of $0.01. And that equates to a December '11 number versus a December '12, will give us a 14% increase in our annual dividend growth from '11 versus '12.
So we continue to be very excited about our ability to grow the dividend. We think it's extremely transparent where that growth is coming from. And as we continue to add more and more capital projects to this, we expect to even be able to expand that further. We continue to be very committed to our investment grade credit as well.
Okay, moving on here to Slide 5. Great financial performance for 2011, a 37% growth in our adjusted net income. That was $734 million versus $537 million from our continuing ops. Very strong business performance, growing at a clip of about 27% on our adjusted segment profit. And that was driven by a 24% increase in Williams Partners and a 67% increase in our Midstream Canada and olefins. 
Some of the drivers there, certainly, in the fee-based business, we grew our fee-based revenues by 12% in Williams Partners and a lot of that volume growth is coming from our Marcellus business, as well as our Deepwater business. The higher NGL frac spreads also were a driver for 2011, and our NGL production volumes were up. But as some of our contracts continue to roll into a fee-based business, our NGL equity volumes were flat. So our business is growing but more and more of our revenues are coming from fee-based business.
We certainly, on the Deepwater Gulf business, as I mentioned, not only did we see growth in revenues for 2011, but we also signed up 2 very significant growth projects that will come on in 2014 and beyond, and that is the Keathley Canyon project and as well, the GulfStar FPS. And I'll speak a little bit more about that later. 
Our Gas Pipelines continued to grow as well. And really, the big projects for the gas pipelines, there was actually 4 new major expansions that came on in just during 2011. And most of these projects started up in the end of -- latter part of the year, and about $67 million in increased revenues from those projects.
And then again in the Midstream Canada and olefins, higher sales prices really drove a lot of that, as well as increased volumes. But I think probably most important to note is that it wasn't just priced just that the market offered us, but our butane/butylene splitter that we installed in -- towards the last half of 2010 really provided tremendous margin upgrade for us in the 2011 timeframe. So a very high-return project as we continue to optimize the mix that's coming off the oil sands off gas stream. So we continue to be very excited about that. And as well, we had better margins in our Geismar ethylene business and somewhat impacted by some downtime that we had in the fourth quarter for Geismar.
So here on Slide 6, we show the visibility to growth across all of our operating areas. And really important changes going on here. So I'll draw your attention to this. First of all, 2011 has been dropped from this. Prior, you would have seen 2011 included here, so you really have to look at things on an annualized basis to get to a more comparative viewpoint. So for instance, in guidance, we went from 3 years now to 2 years and on an annual average basis, you see that increase being up 47% on an annual average basis, moving from $1.7 billion to $2.5 billion here in the fourth quarter. And so some of the drivers, of course, for this, and a lot of this is weighted towards 2012, but some of the drivers here, primarily, the Laser acquisition and then some of the expansion cap around the Laser acquisition, as well as a small portion for Constitution. Both of those additions are included in that new Marcellus slice.
Moving to the middle slice then, you can see now we're going from what was 6 years, 2011 through 2016, is now 5 years. And the midpoint on that -- or sorry, the annual average at midpoint on that was about -- a little over $1.5 billion. And before now, that is $2.5 billion and a 56% increase on the average annual growth capital spending for that period. The drivers on this, a lot of which is on the Eastern Seaboard, which is a number of small projects that are in-guidance quality projects, but the capital push is into 2014. So it's out of that guidance period that's shown to the left. As well as a pretty significant increase on Constitution, again, that's shown in the Marcellus slide. And then additionally, we've got some increases in the Deepwater and some increases in the area of our Midstream Canada and olefins, particularly some projects that we have serve, some pet chem infrastructure needs for third parties. We haven't disclosed those projects yet but are looking forward to doing that yet in the very near future.
Moving over to the larger pie. Here, you can see this moves from $2.6 billion up to $4.2 billion on an annual average basis or a 62% increase. A number of large drivers here, but I'll tell you, probably the biggest single theme to this is the fact that we're seeing so much increase for demand on Transco along the Eastern Seaboard and the markets there. So our largest increase here is in the Eastern Seaboard pie that you can see there, and you can see Marcellus keeping pace throughout this as well. So a lot of great growth going on. And we just continue to see the demand for our infrastructure continue to drive our forecast for growth opportunities out in front of us. And frankly, we're going to be in a nice position to be able to prioritize to the very best capital opportunities that we have available for us looking forward.
Moving on to Slide 7, as we mentioned in our capital explanation and the opportunities ahead of us, the Marcellus area continues to be an area we're extremely excited about and continue to grow a very strong presence in the Marcellus, and particularly, in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, we are making progress in growing out the infrastructure there, really leveraging off of a resource base there in the Susquehanna County area and our key customers there, Cabot, WPX Energy and Carrizo. And we are really excited about how that's coming together. We've got 2 new things to announce. Certainly we closed the Laser pipeline that we had mentioned earlier. But as of yesterday, we also disclosed the Constitution Pipeline project which will provide even greater access for our customers in this area into new expanding markets as we connect into both the Iroquois pipeline and a favorable location on Tennessee Gas Pipeline in New York. And Cabot is the anchor customer for that project, and we will be moving ahead with that project. The size and total capital on that project will be somewhat dependent on the amount of interest we have from other parties, but we are prepared to move ahead with the commitment that we have from Cabot for that project. So very excited about this. And really, this area, we believe by 2015, will have about 3 Bcf per day. Gathering capacity matched up with 3 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity from the area as well. And so this is exactly right onto our strategy of providing large-scale infrastructure solutions to producers in the right locations. And certainly, we think Susquehanna County in the Marcellus is the right location.
Moving on to Slide 8. Here, you can see another exciting project that's leveraging off the growth in the Marcellus Shale as well. And this project is really aimed at serving both producers in Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia, and as well, potentially Utica Shale shippers as well. And so -- but the really unique thing about this project is it not only provides producers with access into these markets, it also provides these great, growing markets on Transco in zone 6, 5, 4 and even 3, it provides these folks with access to these growing reserve base as well with actual firm, backhaul capacity on Transco. And so Transco, as you know, continues to -- has been continuing to expand with moving supplies from the South to the North, but those expansions have been coming in such a rapid manner that we really -- or welcome a new supply source from the north to be able to expand our capabilities to serve these markets even faster. So this is not just a supply-based project. It also is providing a great opportunity for our markets along the Transco system as well. And you can see, we would expect this to be in service as early as December of 2014, and we do have an open season out there right now and look to conclude that on April 2. And we'll know a little more about the details of this project when that's concluded.
Now moving onto Slide 9, in the Keathley Canyon Connector, and we've talked about this project. Fortunately, I won't spend a lot of time here. But this is a 215-mile project with a gathering capacity of 400 million a day. And these contracts were executed in late 2011, another great accomplishment that we had in 2011. This project will be expected to be in service in mid-year 2014. And I point that out because despite the great growth that we continue to have throughout our guidance period, a lot of these projects that I'm talking about will -- do not come into service in that timeframe and will continue to fuel our growth beyond the guidance period.
Moving on to Slide 10, our GulfStar FPS, another project that we contracted during 2011, and you can see a lot of details offered for you here on the slide. This project is going extremely well to date and a lot of the major contracts for the fabrication and installation of both the spar and the pipelines that will tie it into our existing pipeline system have been executed, and are at or below where we expected the estimates to come in for this project. So getting off to a great start on this project and really excited about the degree of interest that we're getting from other producers in the Deepwater as well as they're starting to see the reality of this project come together and the speed at which this product can be deployed.
Moving on to Slide 11, moving out West now. The West continues to provide opportunity to us and the Parachute Plant is a great example. It's a 350 million a day cryogenic train, almost completely fee-based project, and it will be in service in 2014. Major customer on this is WPX Energy, and this will really help them lift their cash returns on their drilling operations out there as right now, we continue to be a little bit short on processing capacity in that area. So very excited about what's going on out there. Another thing that's not mentioned here is the Overland Pass Pipeline, and that pipeline, that's the NGL pipeline that comes out of the Rockies and into the Mid-continent area. And that capacity is going to be increased up to 255,000 barrels per day to accommodate One Oak's new volumes coming out of the Bakken Shale, as well as Parachute TXP1 plant as well.
Moving on to Slide 12. And you can see here great visibility along our gas pipeline system here and a number of projects that are mentioned. And I'll tell you that the drivers for expansion on Transco in particularly is largely driven by power generation load. And right now, we are pursuing projects. These aren't speculative matters. These are actual projects we are pursuing right now that are requiring an excess of 3 Bcf a day of pipeline capacity. And that's about $2.5 billion of pipeline investment to accomplish that. So that's outside of some of the things that we most recently announced. And as well, I will tell you, in a broader study that we looked at, about 30 gigawatts of new power generation load we expect within about 50-mile radius of the Transco pipeline. So you've been hearing a lot about this for the last couple of years from the industry pundits, but we are actually seeing it come to -- into very tangible projects for Transco, and we expect to be able to grow both our capital investments and our revenues from our Transco business here pretty rapidly over the next 4 or 5 years.
Okay, now moving onto Slide 13 into Canada in our Midstream Canada and olefins area. Our Boreal pipeline is a great example of how well our project teams are executing up there. And this is a project that's being funded out of our international cash reserves, so it's not drawing down on any of our ability to provide dividend. And as we've mentioned before, a lot -- all of this Canadian business today is really being held in reserve from a dividend standpoint. We're not using any of these cash flows. But the point, really, of this slide is to show we continue to be able to execute our projects up here very well. In August of 2010, we brought on the BB splitter, and we brought that in below budget and on time. And also now, in Boreal pipeline, expect to be able to say that as well, and we're expecting that to come on in May or June of this year, and that will be slightly ahead of our schedule for that project. And as well, we now are forecasting that project to come in under the original budgeted amount. So great execution by our teams up here, and that's a good thing because we have a lot of remaining expansion projects to build with the next one that will come online will be the expansion for NOVA of our ability to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the gas streams up here as well. And that will come on in the first part of 2013.
And as you can see here on Slide 14, we have a little more detail on that particular project. This is the NOVA Chemicals project, and we basically have contracted with NOVA to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the existing gas streams up there for them. And particularly, the first amount of work that's going on is at the Suncor facility. And this involves both some upgrades on the extraction facility, as well as some upgrades on the fractionator down at our Redwater facility. And as you can see here, that project is -- you can see that range of that budget moving down as well. So making great progress on all of our projects up here.
The next project here on Slide 15 is our Geismar plant expansion, very excited about what this offers to us from a strategic standpoint. And we've got a very low cost expansion, and we think we're going to be well ahead of the market on most of the other expansions that are coming on in the ethylene cracking space. And we think this is going to be a good thing for Williams relative to the choppiness that we expect to see in terms of ethane volumes coming up in 2013. And we think this project is extremely well-timed in terms of being able to capture the spread between gas and ethylene. And so from a Williams standpoint, we are going to be rather insensitive to the spread between gas to ethane or ethane to ethylene because we'll perfectly balanced here between our ethane supplies coming out of WPZ and our ethane consumption in Midstream Canada and olefins. And so things are going well on this project as well, and we've got a really talented staff and a great operating team there at Geismar, gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to bring this project in on-time and on budget as well.
Now we're going to move to Slide 16 here and talk about our perspective on the industry fundamentals that are driving our NGL margins and our olefins margins as well. So first of all, I'm going to kind of go through the general perspective that we have, and then I'll come back and talk about the specific changes that we've made to our pricing guidance. First of all, the crude-to-gas ratio continues to be at record high levels, and we certainly expect to see that in both '12, and to a slightly lesser degree, in '13, as we expect gas prices to rebound a little bit from '12 even though we don't expect dramatic movement. 
The NGL-to-crude ratio however, is really continuing to soften. We're certainly seeing that here in February and in March, and we expect to see that continue through the second quarter of '12. We may see some rebound, and hope to see some rebound in the second half of '12, as a lot of the ethylene cracking capacity that is out-of-service right now, some of that down time is related to expansion on some of those ethylene crackers. And so we expect to see ethane demand towards the second half of '12 rebound. And then as we move into '13, though, we expect to see some of the new processing and NGL transport and fractionation infrastructure start to come into service in '13. And we -- so we expect to see supplies getting a bit longer in '13 and expect to see some dampening of the NGL-to-crude ratio further into 2013. 
The natural gas-to-ethylene spread, really, is the thing you need to stay tuned about relative to Williams because we really have that entire space covered with our ethylene cracker at Geismar. And so we really aren't all that sensitive at the WMB level between gas-to-ethane or ethane-to-ethylene spread. In fact, in 2013 and mid-2013, when our ethylene cracker comes into service, our expansion there comes into service, we'll be almost perfectly balanced between our ethane production at Geismar -- or sorry, our ethane production in our processing business and our ethane consumption at Geismar. A very positive thing that we're seeing out of this commodity price environment that we're in is a tremendous demand for infrastructure on the market side on natural gas, particularly on Transco pipeline, and it's driving a lot of demand for power generation loads. But as well, this big spread that we continue to see between gas and crude oil-based products is continuing to demand infrastructure that helps us arbitrage that tremendous spread between domestic natural gas and world crude oil prices. And so it takes a lot of infrastructure to close that arbitrage, and we certainly have seen a lot of demand to get at that. 
So what this boils down to in terms of specifics for us, first of all, in 2012, we previously had $82.50 oil, WTI Oil, in our pricing environment. We're seeing that go to $100 here in 2012, and we're taking gas down from what was $4.25 at Henry Hub down to $3 in the period. That equates to a tremendous crude-to-gas ratio of 33.7. So -- and that's up from about 23 in 2011. However, the NGL-to-crude relationship, we really are expecting to diminish significantly, and we certainly have seen that, as I mentioned here in the first quarter. And in 2011, we saw that the 56%, previously in our guidance, we had a 58% NGL-to-crude relationship. We're taking that all the way down to 45%. So very conservative on our part, but reflective of a very warm winter for propane demand, and as well, this lack of demand we're seeing right now for ethane due to these ethylene crackers being out of service in the near term. So at the end of the day, we're taking our NGL margin down from $0.83 in 2011 down to $0.78 at the midpoint of our guidance. And on the frac spread side, that goes from $0.91 down to $0.83. So about 9% on the frac spread for 2012.
Looking at 2013 then, pretty similar viewpoint, moving a $100 crude oil, and we also are seeing gas go from what was $4.75 down to $3.75. And that gets us to a crude-to-gas ratio of about 27 in 2013. And we're expecting the NGL-to-crude relationship to be 45% during this period. Additionally, our NGL margin is dropping again relative to 2011, $0.83. We're seeing it go down to $0.70 for that margin. So certainly, very conservative outlook here on NGL margins. But as you'll see, despite that conservative outlook, we continue to be able to grow the cash flows of this business and drive our dividend very substantially. And I really think that's the takeaway. We certainly hope that folks are cautious as they look at our growth against some of our peers' growth because we probably have one of the more conservative perspectives out here on this pricing level. And so, despite, though, this conservative picture, a lot of growth continuing in our business as you'll see on our guidance of the next page.
Moving on to Slide 17. This really just lays out for you all of the adjusted segment profit, the changes that we expect the capital expenditure, the dividends and the EPS. And as you can see, a very nice pattern, with up into the right here in terms of adjusted segment profit. Our dividend, certainly strong increases there, and our EPS adjusted earnings. So the capital expenditure, as you can see, is very volatile over this period. Really, this is driven by, first, the Laser acquisition in 2012, and as well some dollars that we pushed from '11 into '12 in our capital -- in growth capital buckets. So 2013, you can see that going down. I would tell you, given the amount of demand that we've got for project and so forth, I would be surprised if we continue to see 2013 held so low as we get a little closer to that time and some of the projects we're working on become more of a reality. So, great picture here in terms of the continued growth in our business. And I'll remind you -- and I think this is extremely important, that when you're comparing our growth in these businesses, you recognize how conservative our pricing forecast is relative to what we've seen out there in the market from others. And despite that very conservative picture, we continue to see growth that looks like this. If we were to see this normalize with our -- from our 2011 margins, as a lot of folks are showing, you'd see a much higher growth rate in here. But we are very comfortable with the picture that we have here and our ability to continue to increase the dividend even over a more conservative pricing environment.
So moving to our last slide here on Slide 18. As we mentioned before, we certainly have transformed Williams. We're very excited about the growth prospects that we have in the business and the demand for our infrastructure services as they continue. And we certainly very much appreciate the model that we have between Williams and WPZ and the ability to increase our dividends that comes from that. 
And so with that, thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to being able to talk you further about our growth."

First of all, we certainly had very noisy result from the EPS as we spun off WPX. But really boiling it down and looking at the continuing operations, you'll see that our adjusted segment profit versus our third quarter guidance came in right in between our midpoint and high that we've given you for a guidance there, so our continuing operation is performing very well in the fourth quarter and throughout 2011. As we look forward, a tremendous amount of new growth and you'll see that built in to both our guidance and capital, as well as our opportunity pipeline that we continue to project. And one of the -- probably the biggest area of change that we had in that opportunity pipeline was a large number of increases coming from our gas pipe segment as major expansions, particularly on Transco, and a little -- to a lesser degree, on Gulfstream, really start to present themselves as the industry and power generation industry look to take advantage of continued low natural gas prices. So very excited about the way we're positioned in that space, and our opportunity pipeline certainly demonstrates that.
On guidance, you'll note a raise in guidance for both '12 and '13, and this is an improvement in our adjusted segment profit plus DD&A of about $40 million and 12 at midpoint and $120 million in 2013. In '12, the drivers there are slightly higher NGL margins, the addition of Laser to our guidance, as well as some offsetting impact of lower volumes in some of our areas due to lower gas prices and our expectation of slow drilling in some of those areas. So overall, an improvement in '12, though. In '13, you'll see even lower NGL margins than we had previously in our guidance there, and I'll speak to that in just a moment. But those were -- are offset in '13 by higher ethylene margins in our MC&O areas, so a nice raise there for '13. And I think it really shows the strength of our portfolio, and a big part of that strength is the growth in fee-based revenues that we continue to see in '11, we're going to see in '12, and we certainly are going to start to see present itself in '13.
Speaking of commodity prices and our changes there, what you'll note there is very high crude-to-gas ratios reflecting kind of what we're seeing in the current market out there. We've got gas now at $3 for '12 and $3.75 for '13, and we've got crude holding steady at $100. However, despite that very high crude-to-gas ratio, much as we usually see when we see that ratio blow way out, we do not see the NGL components keeping pace with that big separation. And so you'll see a very low NGL-to-crude ratio in our forecast of about 45%. And that has us have our NGL margin declining from '11 through '13 of just a little over 15%. But as I said earlier, we are projecting our ethylene business, particularly in '13, starting to take advantage of those lower ethylene prices. So -- but despite what I would say is a very conservative outlook in the NGL margin space, we continue to show very strong cash flow growth and very bullish about the way our continued cash flows from both WPZ and our Midstream Canada and olefin segment is going. And I would just remind you, as you're looking out there amongst our peers, making sure you're looking at it on an apples-to-apples basis, we feel like we've got a pretty good insight into the commodity prices. But I think what's impressive is we've got continued nice strength in our growing cash flow despite a 15% decline in our NGL margin, and I think a lot of our peers would be hard-pressed to show that kind of resilience and strength in a lower price environment. 
So with that, we will turn it over to questions."

The joint venture between us and Cabot, us being Williams Partners, would be 75% owners. So that would be our share of the overall capital depending upon which version, the 24 or 30 inches built. Does that answer your questions?"

And so even though it seems unprecedented low number on that NGL to crude, we also are unprecedented crude-to-gas ratios as well. And so if you look at the overall margin, I'm not sure that it's that far out of line. And so -- but certainly, the current environment, the very warm winter that we're having, certainly is impacting propane storage. And propane is just as exposed to that as natural gas is. And so that could be a hangover certainly in '12. I think, '13 it's a little early to call, frankly, and we may be a little bit conservative in '13. But I think as we look for both ethane for the balance of this first half of '12 and propane for the balance of the year, that we could see some pressure there just because of what we're seeing in storage volumes on propane right now."

It gets a little confusing, too. But I think that the thing that we have given some guidance on is kind of where our total capacity is going with Springville. Right now, we're in the 300 range. We'll be going up to 625, 650 over the course of the year on Springville. Laser is going to be up around 1.3 billion a day of capacity. And then Randy talked about the $500 million in a Constitution project. And we also have about $500 million a day of inter-connectivity with Tennessee Gas Pipeline in that field. So that kind of adds up to that 3 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity. And maybe what you ought to keep in mind is that, that is one of the limitations out there. So producers are out scrambling to get takeaway capacity and then drilling to fill that, evidenced by Cabot's willingness to take the full 500 on the Constitution project. So it does take time to build. I think we exited the year, just say on our Springville assets, for instance, and '11 at around $600 million a day. That will be going up by well over 50% by the end of '13. And the Laser -- the whole Laser story is one that's unfolding. It obviously just started up. So volumes are building there. The earning potentials in '12 and '13 are just a shadow of what they're going to be. So we've got a real strong producer group right now behind those assets, and they're going to be ramping up quickly. Cabot, I think, has been pretty transparent about their plans. This is one of WPX's key areas, and they've been having good results out there. And the Carrizo volumes are backed by a drilling carry from reliance. So we're very excited about the opportunities up there, and I think you'll see these producers working hard to take advantage of that takeaway capacity."

Thanks for joining us. I know it's a busy day for earnings releases. 
Some of you have all seen the strong financial results for the quarter, so this morning I hope to provide some color around the business fundamentals to provide great transparency around the projects and the business growth that supports our confidence in a sustainable high-growth dividend for WMB. 
First of all, our quarter came out to about 8% above consensus due to I believe the combination of mild weather and continued growth in revenues from our recent capital investments that continue to ramp up. And then as well, the high ethylene margins in the first quarter as well. I think we're higher than most people expected. So let me hit on just a few of these things real quickly. 
First of all, the mild weather, how that impact this drove lower natural gas prices which of course improved our NGL margins despite some lower NGL prices to very low natural gas prices actually help prop up our margins. 
Secondly, and probably less obvious is that fact that we had great operating performance during the quarter. Because normally in the first quarter, we have a lot of freeze offs of production from our producers and so forth. So in this period, we did not experience very much of that at all, so we've enjoyed the mild weather in those 2 ways. 
Secondly, as I mentioned, the projects that we continue to bring online continue to grow our fee-based revenue and actually, in the Midstream the fee-based revenues were up 19%. And really this was due to a combination of issues. 
First of all, as I mentioned projects that we've been investing in over the last couple of years continue to ramp up. Namely, the Perdido Norte volumes, continue to come up, the Echo Springs portrayed at Echo Springs continue to enjoy more and more volumes from the Piceance. And the Northeast Pennsylvania assets were up and certainly the volumes there grew actually by a little over 160% as well at our Markham, our new expansion at Markham, that also experienced new fee-based volumes from the Eagle Ford as well. So really across-the-board, a lot of the investments we've been making for the last several years really starting to pan out, in terms of driving our fee-based revenues particularly within Midstream. 
These 2 factors also drove strong operating statistics, the mild weather and the new projects online. Our NGL production was actually up 18%. Our gathering volumes were up 19%. 
Of course, most of our capital expansion in our processing business has been fee-based so our equity gallons were only up 7% and I think probably the main driver for that is the fact that again as I mentioned our plants were up and running more in the first quarter than we saw in the first quarter of '11. 
Certainly the lower, the higher ethylene prices were driven by the lower ethane prices during the quarter and we continue to see strong demand for ethylene in that area, particularly there was a lot of outages and it drove the ethylene demand even higher in the area. So I am pretty excited about the way that business is hoping to support our overall combined MD revenue. 
And then certainly, our gas pipe continues on a steady pace as well and we actually saw a 6% growth in our fee-based revenue in our gas pipes areas as well. 
And so, while we're certainly excited to see this continued strong growth in our fee-based revenues, we are not surprised because our project development and project execution continues to be the underpinning for our confidence in dividend growth of 20% in 2013 and 2014 on the back of the WPZ distribution growth of a 10% and of course continued growth in our MC&O area as well, even though we are putting a very high coverage ratio as we explained to you on that. 
Certainly, the risk-reducing investment we intend to make in our ethylene-cracking capacity continues to support that dividend growth as well. 
Looking ahead and even beyond the guidance period, you can see many of our larger projects don't even start up until 2014. And many of these investments are just reaching stride in 2015, like the recent Caiman acquisition, our Canada expansion that is continuing and certainly Northeast Pennsylvania with acquisitions like Laser really continuing to grow very steadily beyond the guidance period. 
And as we've mentioned several times before, we continue to be very encouraged by the amount of demand for services on Transco, as the market continues to look to take advantage of the low price natural gas. 
So the opportunity is really due, just keep coming at us and we are fortunate to have a great operating and project management talent on board. And we certainly are mobilizing a lot of that talent from all over our system right now, help deliver these great opportunities safety, on-time and on budget and we are proud of the track record we continue to build in that regard. 
So taking full advantage of North America as a funded natural gas and gas liquids resources is certainly going to take a tremendous amount of infrastructure, as demand for these great resources grows and continue to drive volumes on our infrastructure. And we certainly think Williams is the best-positioned company to deliver the critical infrastructure required to take advantage of these great resources. 
And I also remind you our Analyst Day webcast is May 22, and we look forward to being able to describe in some more detail all of the great projects that continue to drive our confidence and our growth. And with that, I'll turn it over for questions."

But certainly what we are trying to do here is add flexibility. Having said all that, right now, the project has laid out, is larger both in terms of capital dollars and volumes than we originally expected. And primarily that is driven by demand, along the Leidy route that came in as a result of the open season. As you recall, we opened that leg up to the Northwest, that leg up to butler to the Northwest and saw some very strong demand on that leg.

We've been pretty candid about some of the challenges, but I think we've got the right team in place. We've got the broad resources across the organization drawn and we continue to refine that construction effort up there. But that's kind of the critical path. The producers have a lot of the same challenges.

So I'm very optimistic about the progress that we're making. But that's probably one of the bigger changes. And of course we are actively working with the regulators and the local government authorities that set the rules out there.

But with the Caiman acquisition announcement and the increase in distribution guidance, it became clear that the growth in fee-based businesses is so transparent for a number of years and so great. That for an interim period to have some of your distributions based on part of commodity-sensitive operation, they're doing well. isn't such a big deal since the fee-based stuff is going to catch up to it not too long anyhow?
Given the fact that they you're taking strong results particular in the olefin side, what's the appetite? Because like 6 months ago, you all would have been shy about making distributions contingent on fee-based businesses. But given the backdrop of all the growth in the fee-based stuff, what's appetite for reducing the distribution a little more if commodities continue to be favorable like that?"

I just would say our approach has been start with the geology first. And we tried to target the places that we think are the sweet spots in the Marcellus. It's not all created equal. But during the best parts of the Marcellus, in the dry gas windows, you're probably in the best place to drill United States of America for dry gas. So Susquehanna County probably being the number 1 dry gas location, we have seen a rig or 2 come out of that area that we have access to with our systems. But what the producers have been doing has been replacing less efficient rigs with more efficient rigs. And so it hasn't had any impact at all on our volume forecast. So the situation is very robust up there for us and we are very confident that, that system is going to perform. In fact, we've got the majority of that 3 bcf a day of capacity, takeaway capacity that we highlighted in the slides. We got the majority of that contracted for. There's a little bit of available capacity hydraulically available and we are in the process of sorting through the demand for that right now. We have more demand for it than we have space. So situation is still very robust, very, very positive. There are places in the Marcellus where it's fringier and those are not areas that we are in right now. But those will probably see less activity than the better areas. In terms of the propane demand, propane is a tougher commodity to predict probably right now just with the increases in supply and maybe a changing demand profile and exports and probably going to be a big part of that story going forward. We have not seen any changes in drilling in the rich gas area as particularly in the Northeast. All we've seen is more and more interest. So certainly, if propane is down, that is going to hurt a bit. But I still think it's not going to fall to the point where it greatly diminishes the drilling economics in those rich gas areas. They are some of the best in the nation right now."

We have seen a little bit of fall off there, probably down about $100 million a day from the first of the year. And I will tell you that we've got a lot of wells tied into those gathering systems. Most of it's coming out of tight sands production and so it's a hyperbolic decline. It builder wells on the very flat part of the decline. So up in Wyoming, we've seen both shale and ultra have gone down to 2 rigs each, so that's a drop of about 4 rigs in total. That $100 million a day is probably indicative of the flush production that we were seeing and we think it'll be pretty stable because we are on those flat parts of the decline. Over on 1 side, we've had 4 rigs drilling over there and we've had 1 pullout. And the other 3 are from producers that are getting the benefit to those NGLs and we don't anticipate those coming out of the equation. Piceance has been down to about 5 rigs and that have been running at about 8. So there's a little bit of slowdown there. Again, the producers are seeing the benefits of the NGLs there and we are not expecting any further decline there in the Piceance.  Down in Four Corners, lots of wells tied into that. It's pretty resilient to any kind of drastic falloff. But we are down about 40 wells per year there in the Four Corners. So it's pretty modest I think the fall offs that we've have seen.

There is a very similar play in the Mancos, in the Piceance with the same 3 types of windows and there's activity in that area as well. And although this is probably something I can't say nearly as much about. There is up in the 1 Centre area a shale play is being tried up in that area as well. So as we are seeing these shale plays, particularly wet gets shale plays that are developing around the country, they tend to be in places where there's already production.

And so I think there's a real concern on the part of the power generation industry about making sure they've got 20 of reliable access to supply us long term. And so I think Transco is perfectly positioned to do that because they can provide access from supplies in the South and even areas obviously like the midcontinent supplies and Barnett Shale and Haynesville and so forth. They come into Transco at station 85 and as well as of course the Gulf Coast supplies. But as well, now they would have access with supplies from the north and so the power generation of Transco is extremely well positioned if somebody is concerned about reliability, the multiple loop lines right through these populated areas and access, multiple access to supply points. And so that is driving a lot of interest and demand for Transco being kind of the pipe of choice out there for power generation' convergence."

There aren't a lot of people out there right now with that kind of product. And the big advantage is really time to first oil so it's really around the producers wanting to accelerate their cash flows. We're standing ready with the product that can do that. The producer's option is to self-develop, but they're starting from a standing soft and has a fairly significant impact on the present value of the projects. So we think the financials on the product are very compelling. We've got probably 5 or 6 of those that are in various states of discussion. And 2 of the nice things about these opportunities is that the producers will make a decision. When they find and make a discovery, they're probably in the 100 million barrels plus range, the price of oil where it is and the prospects going forward being pretty bright for crude oil. These producers are going to make a decision and they are going to move forward. And so we are really counting on a couple of more of them deciding that they would like to accelerate that cash flow and would like to outsource that business. And there are a number of producers that are getting interested in that even more so. They don't really get any credit on their balance sheet for adding steel. They get credit for adding proven reserves. And so it works well for both parties. And I think the confidence that Hess and Chevron has shown us in our first sale of a GulfStar augurs well for the additional opportunities for us out there. So just in terms of timing I think over the next 12 months, I think there's a great chance that we can add another 1 and there's no guarantees on that, but the deal churn that we've got, I think that is a possibility."

And as Rory mentioned earlier, in the Marcellus, we certainly are very aware that in fact even though it wasn't embedded in our economics for the Caiman acquisition, we think that puts us in a great position to be a solution provider for NGL infrastructure in that area where it's so desperately needed. But certainly, the Mount Bellevue area is pretty crowded in terms of service providers in that area. But we're getting a lot of interest from the petchem side, in terms of providing more customized infrastructure and helping to move product around. You can't really go expanding the ethylene cracking capacity in the way the ethylene volumes are growing without quite a bit of infrastructure in and around the petchem space there. And so we are very focused on that area. So I think we see a lot of opportunity at the far upstream end of the Midstream infrastructure and the far downstream end of the Midstream infrastructure and are looking at some very interesting projects there to take advantage of our liquids in our production, but help petchem look out for the future and where their supplies are going to be coming from. The answer your question is yes, but I wouldn't translate that into thinking that we're going to be into the fray, where there's plenty of players right now and particularly in the Bellevue area proper as the merchant for that space. So we think there's quite a crowd there already. We would want to butt into that space just because we can provide the kind of margin and return that we expect from our other opportunities."

Thanks for joining us. I know it's a busy day for earnings releases. 
Certainly, you've have all seen the strong financial results for the quarter, so this morning I hope to provide just some color around the business fundamentals that provide great transparency around the projects and the business growth that is supports our confidence in a sustainable high-growth dividend for WMB. 
First of all, our quarter came out to about 8% above consensus due to I believe a combination of mild weather and continued growth in revenues from our recent capital investments that continue to ramp up. And then as well, the high ethylene margins in the first quarter as well. I think we're higher than most people expected. So let me hit on just a few of these things real quickly. 
First of all, the mild weather, how that impact this -- drove lower natural gas prices which of course improved our NGL margins despite some lower NGL prices. The very low natural gas prices actually helped prop up our key pulse margins. 
Secondly, and probably less obvious is the fact that we had great operating performance during the quarter. Because normally in the first quarter, we have a lot of freeze offs of production from our producers and so forth. So in this period, we did not experience very much of that at all. So we've enjoyed the mild weather in those 2 ways. 
Secondly, as I mentioned, the projects that we continue to bring online continue to grow our fee-based revenues and actually, in the midstream the fee-based revenues were up 19%. And really this was due to a combination of issues. 
First of all, as I mentioned, projects that we've been investing in over the last couple of years continue to ramp up, namely, the Perdido Norte volumes continuing to come up, the Echo Springs -- fourth train at Echo Springs continue to enjoy more and more volumes from the Piceance. And the Northeast Pennsylvania assets were up and certainly the volumes there grew actually by a little over 160%. As well at our Markham, our new expansion at Markham, that also experienced new fee-based volumes from the Eagle Ford as well. So really across the board. A lot of the investments we've been making for the last several years really starting to pan out in terms of driving our fee-based revenues, particularly within midstream. 
These 2 factors also drove strong operating statistics, the mild weather and the new projects online. Our NGL production was actually up 18%. Our gathering volumes were up 19%. 
Of course, most of our capital expansion in our processing business has been fee-based so our equity gallons were only up 7% and I think probably the main driver for that is the fact that our, again as I mentioned, our plants were up and running more during the first quarter than we saw in the first quarter of '11. 
Certainly the lower -- sorry, the higher ethylene prices were driven by the lower ethane prices during the quarter. And we continue to see strong demand for ethylene in that area, particularly there was a lot of outages and it drove the ethylene demand even higher in the area. So, pretty excited about the way that business is hoping to support our overall combined MD revenue. 
And then certainly, our gas pipe growth continues on a steady pace as well and we actually saw a 6% growth in our fee-based revenues in our gas pipes areas as well. 
And so, while we're certainly excited to see this continued strong growth in our fee-based revenues, we are not surprised because our project development and project execution continues to be the underpinning for our confidence in dividend growth of 20% in 2013 and 2014 on the back of the WPZ distribution growth of 8 -- 10% and of course continued growth in our MC&O area as well, even though we are putting a very high coverage ratio as we explained to you on that. 
Certainly, the risk-reducing investment we intend to make in our ethylene-cracking capacity continues to support that dividend growth as well. 
Looking ahead and even beyond the guidance period, you can see many of our larger projects don't even start up until 2014. And many of these investments are just reaching stride in 2015, like the recent Caiman acquisition, our Canada expansion that's continuing and certainly Northeast Pennsylvania with acquisitions like Laser really continuing to grow very steadily beyond the guidance period. 
And as we mentioned several times before, we continue to be very encouraged by the amount of demand for services on Transco, as the market continues to look -- to take advantage of low priced natural gas. 
So the opportunity is really due, just keep coming at us and we are fortunate to have a great operating and project management talent on board. And we certainly are mobilizing a lot of that talent from all over our system right now, help deliver these great opportunities safety, on-time and on budget and we're  proud of the track record we continue to build in that regard. 
So taking full advantage of North America's abundant natural gas and gas liquids resources, it is certainly going to take a tremendous amount of infrastructure, as demand for these great resources grows and continue to drive volumes on our infrastructure. And we certainly think Williams is the best positioned company to deliver the critical infrastructure required to take advantage of these great resources. 
And I'll also remind you our Analyst Day webcast is May 22, and we look forward to being able to describe in some more detail all of the great projects that continue to drive our confidence and our growth. And with that, I'll turn it over for questions."

But certainly what we are trying to do here is add flexibility. Having said all that, right now, the project as laid out is larger both in terms of capital dollars and volumes than we originally expected. And primarily that is driven by demand along the Leidy route that came in as a result of the open season. As you recall, we opened that leg up to the Northwest, that leg up to butler to the Northwest and saw some very strong demand on that leg. So we had to decide how we best serve that load in Northwest PA, particularly volumes coming down from Northern PA as well."

So I maybe gun jumping just a little bit there, but just saying yes in context to that question. The path to go from there to the 5 bcf a day number that we've shown in all of our materials, it's really around construction and that is not a straight-line event. I think we've been pretty candid about some of the challenges, but I think we've got the right team in place. We've got the broad resources across the organizations drawn and we continue to refine that construction effort up there. But that's kind of the critical path. The producers have a lot of the same challenges. So a lot if it is just working through the process and refining the process that would get wells drilled and connected up in the Northeast and it gets better every month. So I'm very optimistic about the progress that we're making. But that's probably one of the bigger challenges. And of course we're actively working with the regulators and the local government authorities that set the rules out there. And I think there's a pretty good dialogue going now and it's getting better. So it's moving in the right direction."

That for an interim period to have some of your distributions based in part of commodity-sensitive operation, they're doing well, isn't such a big deal since the fee-based stuff is going to catch up to it not too long anyhow.
Given the fact that you're taking out so strong results particularly on the olefins' side, what's the appetite? Because like 6 months ago, you all would have been shy about making distributions contingent on fee-based businesses.

I just would say our approach has been start with the geology first. And we've tried to target the places that we think are the sweet spots in the Marcellus. It's not all created equal. But during the best parts of the Marcellus, in the dry gas windows, you're probably in the best place to drill United States of America for dry gas. So Susquehanna County probably being the #1 dry gas location. We have seen a rig or 2 come out of that area that we have access to with our system. But what the producers have been doing has been replacing less efficient rigs with more efficient rigs. And so it hasn't had any impact at all on our volume forecast. So the situation is very robust up there for us and we're very confident that, that system is going to perform. In fact, we've got the majority of that 3 bcf a day of capacity, takeaway capacity that we highlighted in the slides. We got the majority that's contracted [ph] for. There's a little bit of available capacity, hydraulically available, and we're are in the process of sorting through the demand for that right now. We have more demand for it than we have space. So situation is still very robust, very, very positive. There are places in the Marcellus where it's fringier and those are not areas that we're in right now. But those fills will probably see less activity than the better areas. In terms of the propane demand, propane is a tougher commodity to predict probably right now just with the increases in supply and maybe a changing demand profile and exports and probably going to be a big part of that story going forward. We have not seen any changes in drilling in the rich gas areas particularly in the Northeast. All we've seen is more and more interest. So certainly, if propane is down, that is going to hurt a bit. But I still think it's not going to fall to the point where it greatly diminishes the drilling economics in those rich gas areas. They're some of the best in the nation right now."

We have seen a little bit of fall off there, probably down about $100 million a day from the first of the year. And I will tell you that we've got a lot of wells tied into those gathering systems. Most of it's coming out of tight-sands production and so it's a hyperbolic decline. The builder wells are on the very flat part of the decline. And so up in Wyoming, we've seen both shale and ultra have gone down to 2 rigs each, so that's a drop of about 4 rigs in total. That $100 million a day is probably indicative of the flush production that we were seeing. And we think it'll be pretty stable because we are on those flat parts of the decline. Over in Wamsutter, we've had 4 rigs drilling over there and we've had 1 pullout. And the other 3 are from producers that are getting the benefit to those NGLs and we don't anticipate those coming out of the equation. Piceance has been down to about 5 rigs and that had been running at about 8. So there's a little bit of slowdown there. Again, the producers are seeing the benefits of the NGLs there and we're not expecting any further decline there in the Piceance.  Down in Four Corners, there are lots of wells tied into that. It's pretty resilient to any kind of drastic falloff. But we are down about 40 wells per year there in the Four Corners. So it's pretty modest and I think the fall offs that we've seen they've been minor but I think those are indicative of what we'll see going forward until we get a little bit of increase in gas price."

And in fact, we built some early production systems out there. The resource is definitely in place there. Producers were working hard, including our affiliate at the time to kind of crack the code on how to commercially produce that. I think they're still working on that. So I would look at the Paradox as still a work in progress. We do have some minor facilities there in case things do take off. But I don't see that as something that we're real excited about right now. I think if I was to point to some of the exciting things that are coming out West, I'd point to the Mancos shale play down in the San Juan basin. It's like a lot of these shale plays. It's got 3 different windows, a dry gas, a condensate, wet gas window and an oil window and that's starting to attract a lot of attention. There's a very similar play in the Mancos -- in the Piceance with the same 3 types of windows and there's activity in that area as well. And although this is probably something I can't say nearly as much about, there is up in the Wamsutter area a shale play that's being tried up in that area as well. So as we're seeing these shale plays, particularly wet gas shale plays that are developing around the country, they tend to be in places where there's already production. And what we're finding is that's the case out West as well and there's activity in 3 of our 4 basis today pursuing that kind of a play. So I think we'll have some more exciting things to talk about in the next 6 to 12 months as those place get a little better understood."

Certainly coming for Transco, really the 2 primary drivers for Transco right now is serving the producers' needs, getting out in the Marcellus. But as well, we've seen a lot of interest from the market and wanting access to the Marcellus as well for long-term things like power plant conversions. And so I think there's a real concern on the part of the power generation industry about making sure they've got 20 of reliable access to supply us long term. And so I think Transco is perfectly positioned to do that because it can provide access from supplies in the South and even areas obviously like the midcontinent supplies and Barnett Shale and Haynesville and so forth. They come into Transco at station 85 and as well as of course the Gulf Coast supplies. But as well, now they would have access with supplies from the North. And so the power generation -- Transco is extremely well positioned if somebody is concerned about reliability, be it its multiple loop lines right through these populated areas and access, multiple access to supply points. And so that is driving a lot of interest and demand for Transco being kind of the pipe of choice out there for the power generation conversions."

There aren't a lot of people out there right now with that kind of product. And the big advantage is really time to first oil [ph] so it's really around the producers wanting to accelerate their cash flows. We're standing ready with the product that can do that. The producer's option is to self-develop, but they're starting from a standing soft and has a fairly significant impact on the present value of the projects. So we think the financials on the product are very compelling. We've got probably 5 or 6 of those that are in various states of discussion. And one of the nice things about these opportunities is that the producers will make a decision. When they find and make a discovery, and they're probably in the 100 million barrels plus range, with the price of oil, where it is and the prospects going forward being pretty bright for crude oil. These producers are going to make a decision and they are going to move forward. And so we're really counting on a couple of more of them deciding they'd like to accelerate that cash flow and they'd like to outsource that business. And there are a number of producers that are getting interested in that even more so. They don't really get any credit on their balance sheet for adding steel. They get credit for adding proven reserves. And so it works well for both parties. And I think the confidence that Hess and Chevron has shown us in our first sale of a GulfStar augurs well for the additional opportunities for us out there. So just in terms of timing I think over the next 12 months, I think there's a great chance that we can add another one. There's no guarantees on that, but the deal churn that we've got, I think that's a possibility."

And as Rory mentioned earlier, in the Marcellus, we certainly are very aware that in fact even though it wasn't embedded in our economics for the Caiman acquisition, we think that puts us in a great position to be a solution provider for NGL infrastructure in that area where it's so desperately needed. But certainly, the Mont-Bellevue area is pretty crowded in terms of service providers in that area. But we're getting a lot of interest from the petchem side, in terms of providing more customized infrastructure and helping to move product around. You can't really go expanding the ethylene cracking capacity in the way the ethylene volumes are growing without quite a bit of infrastructure in and around the petchem space there. And so we are very focused on that area. So I think we see a lot of opportunity at the far upstream end of the midstream infrastructure and the far downstream end of the midstream infrastructure and are looking at some very interesting projects there that take advantage of our liquids and our production, but help pets look out for the future where their supplies are going to be coming from. So to answer your question, it's yes. But I wouldn't translate that into thinking that we're going to be into the fray, where there's plenty of players right now and particularly in the Bellevue area proper as the merchant during that space. So we think there's quite a crowd there already. And we wouldn't want to butt in to that space just because we don't think we'd provide the kind of margin and return that we expect from our other opportunities."

Thanks for joining us. I know it's a busy day for earnings releases. 
Certainly, you've have all seen the strong financial results for the quarter, so this morning I hope to provide just some color around the business fundamentals that provide great transparency around the projects and the business growth that it supports our confidence in a sustainable high-growth dividend for WMB. 
First of all, our quarter came out to about 8% above consensus due, to I believe, a combination of mild weather and continued growth in revenues from our recent capital investments that continue to ramp up. And then as well, the high ethylene margins in the first quarter as well. I think we're higher than most people expected. So let me hit on just a few of these things real quickly. 
First of all, the mild weather, how that impacted us -- drove lower natural gas prices which of course improved our NGL margins despite some lower NGL prices. The very low natural gas prices actually helped prop up our key pulse margins. 
Secondly, and probably less obvious is the fact that we had great operating performance during the quarter. Because normally in the first quarter, we have a lot of freeze offs of production from our producers and so forth. So in this period, we did not experience very much of that at all. So we've enjoyed the mild weather in those 2 ways. 
Secondly, as I mentioned, the projects that we continue to bring online continue to grow our fee-based revenues and actually, in the midstream the fee-based revenues were up 19%. And really this was due to a combination of issues. 
First of all, as I mentioned, projects that we've been investing in over the last couple of years continue to ramp up, namely, the Perdido Norte volumes continuing to come up, the Echo Springs -- fourth train at Echo Springs continue to enjoy more and more volumes from the Piceance. And the Northeast Pennsylvania assets were up and certainly the volumes there grew actually by a little over 160%. As well at our Markham, our new expansion at Markham, that also experienced new fee-based volumes from the Eagle Ford as well. So really across the board, a lot of the investments we've been making for the last several years really starting to pan out in terms of driving our fee-based revenues, particularly within midstream. 
These 2 factors also drove strong operating statistics, the mild weather and the new projects online. Our NGL production was actually up 18%. Our gathering volumes were up 19%. 
Of course, most of our capital expansion in our processing business has been fee-based so our equity gallons were only up 7% and I think probably the main driver for that is the fact that our, again as I mentioned, our plants were up and running more during the first quarter than we saw in the first quarter of '11. 
Certainly the lower -- sorry, the higher ethylene prices were driven by the lower ethane prices during the quarter. And we continue to see strong demand for ethylene in that area, particularly there was a lot of outages and it drove the ethylene demand even higher in the area. So, pretty excited about the way that business is helping support our overall combined MD revenue. 
And then certainly, our gas pipe growth continues on a steady pace as well, we actually saw a 6% growth in our fee-based revenues in our gas pipes areas as well. 
And so, while we're certainly excited to see this continued strong growth in our fee-based revenues, we are not surprised because our project development and project execution continues to be the underpinning for our confidence in dividend growth of 20% in 2013 and 2014 on the back of the WPZ distribution growth of 8 -- 10% and of course continued growth in our MC&O area as well, even though we are putting a very high coverage ratio as we explained to you on that. 
Certainly, the risk-reducing investment we intend to make in our ethylene-cracking capacity continues to support that dividend growth as well. 
Looking ahead and even beyond the guidance period, you can see many of our larger projects don't even start up until 2014. And many of these investments are just reaching stride in 2015, like the recent Caiman acquisition, our Canada expansion that's continuing and certainly Northeast Pennsylvania with acquisitions like Laser really continuing to grow very steadily beyond the guidance period. 
And as we mentioned several times before, we continue to be very encouraged by the amount of demand for services on Transco, as the market continues to look -- to take advantage of low priced natural gas. 
So the opportunities really do just keep coming at us and we are fortunate to have a great operating and project management talent on board. And we certainly are mobilizing a lot of that talent from all over our system right now, help deliver these great opportunities safety, on-time and on budget and we're  proud of the track record we continue to build in that regard. 
So taking full advantage of North America's abundant natural gas and gas liquids resources, it is certainly going to take a tremendous amount of infrastructure, as demand for these great resources grows and continues to drive volumes on our infrastructure. And we certainly think Williams is the best positioned company to deliver the critical infrastructure required to take advantage of these great resources. 
And I'll also remind you our Analyst Day webcast is May 22, and we look forward to being able to describe in some more detail all of the great projects that continue to drive our confidence and our growth. And with that, I'll turn it over for questions."

But certainly what we are trying to do here is add flexibility. Having said all that, right now, the project as laid out is larger both in terms of capital dollars and volumes than we originally expected. And primarily that is driven by demand along the Leidy route that came in as a result of the open season. As you recall, we opened that leg up to the Northwest, that leg up to butler to the Northwest and saw some very strong demand on that leg. So we had to decide how we best serve that load in Northwest PA, particularly volumes coming down from Northern PA as well."

They need to see those margins back at the wellhead in order to keep their drilling rigs moving in the richer areas. So I think we'll be able to maintain that for the foreseeable future. At some point, it probably starts to fall off. But I think that's -- that 300 million gallon per quarter range is a pretty good spot to be thinking about our equity launch."

So I maybe gun jumping just a little bit there, but just so you have some context to that question. The path to go from there to the 5 bcf a day number that we've shown in all of our materials, it's really around construction and that is not a straight-line event. I think we've been pretty candid about some of the challenges, but I think we've got the right team in place. We've got the broad resources across the organizations drawn and we continue to refine that construction effort up there. But that's kind of the critical path. The producers have a lot of the same challenges. So a lot if it is just working through the process and refining the process that would get wells drilled and connected up in the Northeast and it gets better every month. So I'm very optimistic about the progress that we're making. But that's probably one of the bigger challenges. And of course we're actively working with the regulators and the local governmental authorities that set the rules out there.

I just would say our approach has been start with the geology first. And we've tried to target the places that we think are the sweet spots in the Marcellus. It's not all created equal. But during the best parts of the Marcellus, in the dry gas windows, you're probably in the best place to drill United States of America for dry gas. So Susquehanna County probably being the #1 dry gas location. We have seen a rig or 2 come out of that area that we have access to with our system. But what the producers have been doing has been replacing less efficient rigs with more efficient rigs. And so it hasn't had any impact at all on our volume forecast. So the situation is very robust up there for us and we're very confident that, that system is going to perform. In fact, we've got the majority of that 3 bcf a day of capacity, takeaway capacity that we highlighted in the slides. We got the majority that's contracted for. There's a little bit of available capacity, hydraulically available, and we're in the process of sorting through the demand for that right now. We have more demand for it than we have space. So situation is still very robust, very, very positive. There are places in the Marcellus where it's fringier and those are not areas that we're in right now. But those fills will probably see less activity than the better areas. In terms of the propane demand, propane is a tougher commodity to predict probably right now just with the increases in supply and maybe a changing demand profile and exports and probably going to be a big part of that story going forward. We have not seen any changes in drilling in the rich gas areas particularly in the Northeast. All we've seen is more and more interest. So certainly, if propane is down, that is going to hurt a bit. But I still think it's not going to fall to the point where it greatly diminishes the drilling economics in those rich gas areas. They're some of the best in the nation right now."

We have seen a little bit of fall off there, probably down about $100 million a day from the first of the year. And I will tell you that we've got a lot of wells tied into those gathering systems. Most of it's coming out of tight-sands production and so it's a hyperbolic decline. The builder wells are on the very flat part of the decline. And so up in Wyoming, we've seen both shale and ultra have gone down to 2 rigs each, so that's a drop of about 4 rigs in total. That $100 million a day is probably indicative of the flat production that we were seeing. And we think it'll be pretty stable because we are on those flat parts of the decline. Over in Wamsutter, we've had 4 rigs drilling over there and we've had 1 pull out. And the other 3 are from producers that are getting the benefit to those NGLs and we don't anticipate those coming out of the equation. Piceance has been down to about 5 rigs and that had been running at about 8. So there's a little bit of slowdown there. Again, the producers are seeing the benefits of the NGLs there and we're not expecting any further decline there in the Piceance.  Down in Four Corners, there are lots of wells tied into that. It's pretty resilient to any kind of drastic falloff. But we are down about 40 wells per year there in the Four Corners. So it's pretty modest and I think the fall offs that we've seen they've been minor but I think those are indicative of what we'll see going forward until we get a little bit of increase in gas price."

We see Williams’ currency as being kind of a backup currency. I think WPZ will be the primary financing vehicle for obviously, for Williams Partners. But certainly in situations like the Caiman, we're trying to do more with WPZ, may have put some stress on WPZ. We felt that having Williams step up because it was good for Williams as well as good for WPZ. So we'll use I think Williams very sparingly. That's the only acquiescence we've had in the last decade.

And in fact, we built some early production systems out there. The resource is definitely in place there. Producers were working hard, including our affiliate at the time to kind of crack the code on how to commercially produce that. I think they're still working on that. So I would look at the Paradox as still a work in progress. We do have some minor facilities there in case things do take off. But I don't see that as something that we're real excited about right now. I think if I was to point to some of the exciting things that are coming out West, I'd point to the Mancos shale play down in the San Juan basin. It's like a lot of these shale plays. It's got 3 different windows, a dry gas, a condensate, wet gas window and an oil window and that's starting to attract a lot of attention. There's a very similar play in the Mancos -- in the Piceance with the same 3 types of windows and there's activity in that area as well. And although this is probably something I can't say nearly as much about, there is up in the Wamsutter area a shale play that's being tried up in that area as well. So as we're seeing these shale plays, particularly wet gas shale plays that are developing around the country, they tend to be in places where there's already production. And what we're finding is that's the case out West as well and there's activity in 3 of our 4 basis today pursuing that kind of a play. So I think we'll have some more exciting things to talk about in the next 6 to 12 months as those place get a little better understood."

But as well, we've seen a lot of interest from the market and wanting access to the Marcellus as well for long-term things like power plant conversions. And so I think there's a real concern on the part of the power generation industry about making sure they've got plenty of reliable access to supply us long term. And so I think Transco is perfectly positioned to do that because it can provide access from supplies in the South and even areas obviously like the midcontinent supplies and Barnett Shale and Haynesville and so forth. They come into Transco at station 85 and as well as of course the Gulf Coast supplies. But as well, now they would have access with supplies from the North. And so the power generation -- Transco is extremely well positioned if somebody is concerned about reliability, be it its multiple loop lines right through these populated areas and access, multiple access to supply points. And so that is driving a lot of interest and demand for Transco being kind of the pipe of choice out there for the power generation conversions."

There aren't a lot of people out there right now with that kind of product. And the big advantage is really time to first oil [ph] so it's really around the producers wanting to accelerate their cash flows. We're standing ready with the product that can do that. The producer's option is to self-develop, but they're starting from a standing soft and has a fairly significant impact on the present value of the projects. So we think the financials on the product are very compelling. We've got probably 5 or 6 of those that are in various states of discussion. And one of the nice things about these opportunities is that the producers will make a decision. When they find and make a discovery, and they're probably in the 100 million barrels plus range, with the price of oil, where it is and the prospects going forward being pretty bright for crude oil. These producers are going to make a decision and they are going to move forward. And so we're really counting on a couple of more of them deciding they'd like to accelerate that cash flow and they'd like to outsource that business. And there are a number of producers that are getting interested in that even more so. They don't really get any credit on their balance sheet for adding steel. They get credit for adding proven reserves. And so it works well for both parties. And I think the confidence that Hess and Chevron has shown us in our first sale of a GulfStar augurs well for the additional opportunities for us out there. So just in terms of timing I think over the next 12 months, I think there's a great chance that we can add another one. There's no guarantees on that, but the deal churn that we've got, I think that's a possibility."

But certainly, the Mont-Bellevue area is pretty crowded in terms of service providers in that area. But we're getting a lot of interest from the petchem side, in terms of providing more customized infrastructure and helping to move product around. You can't really go expanding the ethylene cracking capacity in the way the ethylene volumes are growing without quite a bit of infrastructure in and around the petchem space there. And so we are very focused on that area. So I think we see a lot of opportunity at the far upstream end of the midstream infrastructure and the far downstream end of the midstream infrastructure and are looking at some very interesting projects there that take advantage of our liquids and our production, but help petchems look out for the future where their supplies are going to be coming from. So to answer your question, it's yes. But I wouldn't translate that into thinking that we're going to be into the fray, where there's plenty of players right now in particularly -- in the Bellevue area proper as the merchant during that space. So we think there's quite a crowd there already.

Certainly, you've have all seen the strong financial results for the quarter, so this morning I hope to provide just some color a",973,"Great. Thank you, John, and good morning to everybody. Thanks for joining us. I know it's a busy day for earnings releases. 
Certainly, you've have all seen the strong financial results for the quarter, so this morning I hope to provide just some color around the business fundamentals that provide great transparency around the projects and the business growth that it supports our confidence in a sustainable high-growth dividend for WMB. 
First of all, our quarter came out to about 8% above consensus due, to I believe, a combination of mild weather and continued growth in revenues from our recent capital investments that continue to ramp up. And then as well, the high ethylene margins in the first quarter as well. I think we're higher than most people expected. So let me hit on just a few of these things real quickly. 
First of all, the mild weather, how that impacted us -- drove lower natural gas prices which of course improved our NGL margins despite some lower NGL prices. The very low natural gas prices actually helped prop up our key pulse margins. 
Secondly, and probably less obvious is the fact that we had great operating performance during the quarter. Because normally in the first quarter, we have a lot of freeze offs of production from our producers and so forth. So in this period, we did not experience very much of that at all. So we've enjoyed the mild weather in those 2 ways. 
Secondly, as I mentioned, the projects that we continue to bring online continue to grow our fee-based revenues and actually, in the midstream the fee-based revenues were up 19%. And really this was due to a combination of issues. 
First of all, as I mentioned, projects that we've been investing in over the last couple of years continue to ramp up, namely, the Perdido Norte volumes continuing to come up, the Echo Springs -- fourth train at Echo Springs continue to enjoy more and more volumes from the Piceance. And the Northeast Pennsylvania assets were up and certainly the volumes there grew actually by a little over 160%. As well at our Markham, our new expansion at Markham, that also experienced new fee-based volumes from the Eagle Ford as well. So really across the board, a lot of the investments we've been making for the last several years really starting to pan out in terms of driving our fee-based revenues, particularly within midstream. 
These 2 factors also drove strong operating statistics, the mild weather and the new projects online. Our NGL production was actually up 18%. Our gathering volumes were up 19%. 
Of course, most of our capital expansion in our processing business has been fee-based so our equity gallons were only up 7% and I think probably the main driver for that is the fact that our, again as I mentioned, our plants were up and running more during the first quarter than we saw in the first quarter of '11. 
Certainly the lower -- sorry, the higher ethylene prices were driven by the lower ethane prices during the quarter. And we continue to see strong demand for ethylene in that area, particularly there was a lot of outages and it drove the ethylene demand even higher in the area. So, pretty excited about the way that business is helping support our overall combined MD revenue. 
And then certainly, our gas pipe growth continues on a steady pace as well, we actually saw a 6% growth in our fee-based revenues in our gas pipes areas as well. 
And so, while we're certainly excited to see this continued strong growth in our fee-based revenues, we are not surprised because our project development and project execution continues to be the underpinning for our confidence in dividend growth of 20% in 2013 and 2014 on the back of the WPZ distribution growth of 8 -- 10% and of course continued growth in our MC&O area as well, even though we are putting a very high coverage ratio as we explained to you on that. 
Certainly, the risk-reducing investment we intend to make in our ethylene-cracking capacity continues to support that dividend growth as well. 
Looking ahead and even beyond the guidance period, you can see many of our larger projects don't even start up until 2014. And many of these investments are just reaching stride in 2015, like the recent Caiman acquisition, our Canada expansion that's continuing and certainly Northeast Pennsylvania with acquisitions like Laser really continuing to grow very steadily beyond the guidance period. 
And as we mentioned several times before, we continue to be very encouraged by the amount of demand for services on Transco, as the market continues to look -- to take advantage of low priced natural gas. 
So the opportunities really do just keep coming at us and we are fortunate to have a great operating and project management talent on board. And we certainly are mobilizing a lot of that talent from all over our system right now, help deliver these great opportunities safety, on-time and on budget and we're proud of the track record we continue to build in that regard. 
So taking full advantage of North America's abundant natural gas and gas liquids resources, it is certainly going to take a tremendous amount of infrastructure, as demand for these great resources grows and continues to drive volumes on our infrastructure. And we certainly think Williams is the best positioned company to deliver the critical infrastructure required to take advantage of these great resources. 
And I'll also remind you our Analyst Day webcast is May 22, and we look forward to being able to describe in some more detail all of the great projects that continue to drive our confidence and our growth. And with that, I'll turn it over for questions."

But certainly what we are trying to do here is add flexibility. Having said all that, right now, the project as laid out is larger both in terms of capital dollars and volumes than we originally expected. And primarily that is driven by demand along the Leidy route that came in as a result of the open season. As you recall, we opened that leg up to the Northwest, that leg up to butler to the Northwest and saw some very strong demand on that leg. So we had to decide how we best serve that load in Northwest PA, particularly volumes coming down from Northern PA as well."

I think we've been pretty candid about some of the challenges, but I think we've got the right team in place.

I just would say our approach has been start with the geology first. And we've tried to target the places that we think are the sweet spots in the Marcellus. It's not all created equal. But during the best parts of the Marcellus, in the dry gas windows, you're probably in the best place to drill United States of America for dry gas. So Susquehanna County probably being the #1 dry gas location. We have seen a rig or 2 come out of that area that we have access to with our system. But what the producers have been doing has been replacing less efficient rigs with more efficient rigs. And so it hasn't had any impact at all on our volume forecast. So the situation is very robust up there for us and we're very confident that, that system is going to perform. In fact, we've got the majority of that 3 bcf a day of capacity, takeaway capacity that we highlighted in the slides. We got the majority that's contracted for. There's a little bit of available capacity, hydraulically available, and we're in the process of sorting through the demand for that right now. We have more demand for it than we have space. So situation is still very robust, very, very positive. There are places in the Marcellus where it's fringier and those are not areas that we're in right now. But those fills will probably see less activity than the better areas. In terms of the propane demand, propane is a tougher commodity to predict probably right now just with the increases in supply and maybe a changing demand profile and exports and probably going to be a big part of that story going forward. We have not seen any changes in drilling in the rich gas areas particularly in the Northeast. All we've seen is more and more interest. So certainly, if propane is down, that is going to hurt a bit. But I still think it's not going to fall to the point where it greatly diminishes the drilling economics in those rich gas areas. They're some of the best in the nation right now."

We have seen a little bit of fall off there, probably down about $100 million a day from the first of the year. And I will tell you that we've got a lot of wells tied into those gathering systems. Most of it's coming out of tight-sands production and so it's a hyperbolic decline. The builder wells are on the very flat part of the decline. And so up in Wyoming, we've seen both shale and ultra have gone down to 2 rigs each, so that's a drop of about 4 rigs in total. That $100 million a day is probably indicative of the flat production that we were seeing. And we think it'll be pretty stable because we are on those flat parts of the decline. Over in Wamsutter, we've had 4 rigs drilling over there and we've had 1 pull out. And the other 3 are from producers that are getting the benefit to those NGLs and we don't anticipate those coming out of the equation. Piceance has been down to about 5 rigs and that had been running at about 8. So there's a little bit of slowdown there. Again, the producers are seeing the benefits of the NGLs there and we're not expecting any further decline there in the Piceance. Down in Four Corners, there are lots of wells tied into that. It's pretty resilient to any kind of drastic falloff. But we are down about 40 wells per year there in the Four Corners. So it's pretty modest and I think the fall offs that we've seen they've been minor but I think those are indicative of what we'll see going forward until we get a little bit of increase in gas price."

We see Williams’ currency as being kind of a backup currency. I think WPZ will be the primary financing vehicle for obviously, for Williams Partners. But certainly in situations like the Caiman, we're trying to do more with WPZ, may have put some stress on WPZ. We felt that having Williams step up because it was good for Williams as well as good for WPZ. So we'll use I think Williams very sparingly. That's the only acquiescence we've had in the last decade. But again if we see a situation that really is compelling, it's a tool in the toolkit and I think a real advantage that we have relative to a lot of our competitors."

And in fact, we built some early production systems out there. The resource is definitely in place there. Producers were working hard, including our affiliate at the time to kind of crack the code on how to commercially produce that. I think they're still working on that. So I would look at the Paradox as still a work in progress. We do have some minor facilities there in case things do take off. But I don't see that as something that we're real excited about right now. I think if I was to point to some of the exciting things that are coming out West, I'd point to the Mancos shale play down in the San Juan basin. It's like a lot of these shale plays. It's got 3 different windows, a dry gas, a condensate, wet gas window and an oil window and that's starting to attract a lot of attention. There's a very similar play in the Mancos -- in the Piceance with the same 3 types of windows and there's activity in that area as well. And although this is probably something I can't say nearly as much about, there is up in the Wamsutter area a shale play that's being tried up in that area as well. So as we're seeing these shale plays, particularly wet gas shale plays that are developing around the country, they tend to be in places where there's already production. And what we're finding is that's the case out West as well and there's activity in 3 of our 4 basis today pursuing that kind of a play. So I think we'll have some more exciting things to talk about in the next 6 to 12 months as those place get a little better understood."

Certainly coming for Transco, really the 2 primary drivers for Transco right now is serving the producers' needs, getting out in the Marcellus. But as well, we've seen a lot of interest from the market and wanting access to the Marcellus as well for long-term things like power plant conversions. And so I think there's a real concern on the part of the power generation industry about making sure they've got plenty of reliable access to supply us long term. And so I think Transco is perfectly positioned to do that because it can provide access from supplies in the South and even areas obviously like the midcontinent supplies and Barnett Shale and Haynesville and so forth. They come into Transco at station 85 and as well as of course the Gulf Coast supplies. But as well, now they would have access with supplies from the North. And so the power generation -- Transco is extremely well positioned if somebody is concerned about reliability, be it its multiple loop lines right through these populated areas and access, multiple access to supply points. And so that is driving a lot of interest and demand for Transco being kind of the pipe of choice out there for the power generation conversions."

There aren't a lot of people out there right now with that kind of product. And the big advantage is really time to first oil [ph] so it's really around the producers wanting to accelerate their cash flows. We're standing ready with the product that can do that. The producer's option is to self-develop, but they're starting from a standing soft and has a fairly significant impact on the present value of the projects. So we think the financials on the product are very compelling. We've got probably 5 or 6 of those that are in various states of discussion. And one of the nice things about these opportunities is that the producers will make a decision. When they find and make a discovery, and they're probably in the 100 million barrels plus range, with the price of oil, where it is and the prospects going forward being pretty bright for crude oil. These producers are going to make a decision and they are going to move forward. And so we're really counting on a couple of more of them deciding they'd like to accelerate that cash flow and they'd like to outsource that business. And there are a number of producers that are getting interested in that even more so. They don't really get any credit on their balance sheet for adding steel. They get credit for adding proven reserves. And so it works well for both parties. And I think the confidence that Hess and Chevron has shown us in our first sale of a GulfStar augurs well for the additional opportunities for us out there. So just in terms of timing I think over the next 12 months, I think there's a great chance that we can add another one. There's no guarantees on that, but the deal churn that we've got, I think that's a possibility."

But certainly, the Mont-Bellevue area is pretty crowded in terms of service providers in that area. But we're getting a lot of interest from the petchem side, in terms of providing more customized infrastructure and helping to move product around. You can't really go expanding the ethylene cracking capacity in the way the ethylene volumes are growing without quite a bit of infrastructure in and around the petchem space there. And so we are very focused on that area. So I think we see a lot of opportunity at the far upstream end of the midstream infrastructure and the far downstream end of the midstream infrastructure and are looking at some very interesting projects there that take advantage of our liquids and our production, but help petchems look out for the future where their supplies are going to be coming from. So to answer your question, it's yes. But I wouldn't translate that into thinking that we're going to be into the fray, where there's plenty of players right now in particularly -- in the Bellevue area proper as the merchant during that space. So we think there's quite a crowd there already.

Thanks for joining us and it's time right now and so we appreciate you being able to take the timeout for us. Well, certainly, despite a very disappointing financial performance in the second quarter and significantly lower",1427,"Thanks, John, and good morning. Thanks for joining us and it's time right now and so we appreciate you being able to take the timeout for us. Well, certainly, despite a very disappointing financial performance in the second quarter and significantly lower margin forecast for the balance of '12 and '13, we're very pleased that despite that we're able to continue to remain confident in our very well supported dividend growth, which still at 55% here in 2012 and 20% both in '13 and '14. So a lot of our confidence on that continues to come from the degree of coverage that we've had built into our model, as well as the extraordinary maintenance costs or maintenance capital we have built into PZ right now and as well a lot of continued strong growth coming from our P based business. On our second quarter performance was certainly impacted by rapid decline in NGL prices, but a few things as well. It is one thing, I think, that doesn't always obvious in the way we report is that we also have a pretty significant amount of product that's in transit that has held in pipelines and of course, that gets remarked each quarter used on the pricing decline so back to this period, we had about $22 million impact on that over and above what you would see in your typical pricing model. So whenever we see prices move down, that gets somewhat accelerated and when we see it move back, the other way it comes back to us.
But there certainly were other factors as well beyond pricing. Some growing pains, the Boreal Pipeline line fill. The high start-up O&M cost associated with the Cayman pipeline or -- the Cayman acquisition that we now refer to as Ohio Valley and as well, quite a bit of depreciation expense going on with that as well. But we also had higher maintenance costs, which we accelerated some of our work at a lot of our Western plants as we had a third-party fractionator being out during the second quarter that requires us to take some of our plants down, so we took advantage of that and accelerated things like a lot of turbine overhauls, embezzled maintenance during the period.
The good news for the quarter, a 19% increase in our fee-based view businesses within our midstream portion of WPZ. We had certainly had good progress on our major project execution going on during the quarter as well. So we remain very confident in the way our model is growing particularly on the fee-based business side.
Just commenting quickly on prices. Certainly, the second quarter dropped that we have from the first and second quarter was over 20% on our NGL margins, and the balance of the year is forecasted to be approximately 30% lower than what we recognized in first quarter of '12. So we certainly have, in this model, we have taken it down to what we're seeing and certainly, we expect for prices, particularly on the light-end products, ethane and propane to be very choppy as we see a lot of new infrastructures supply coming on of the NGL side, but a bit ahead of a lot of the Petrochemical buildout and some of the export buildout on the propane side.
The NGL crude ratios are really what drove us. A lot of folks have thought out this from a crude standpoint but really the crude price had very little to do with this and we got in our forecast, we've got NGL, the crude ratio is running at about 40% here through the balance of the year versus historical average of 60% and the almost 57% that we realized in 2011. So certainly, that disconnect that we saw on the ethane and propane side is what really damaged the second quarter from a pricing standpoint and we expect that to continue as the market needs to be balanced on the supply side, on both ethane and propane.
The good news of course for Williams is with the Geismar facility as we're expanding that, we moved away from a lot of the risk on the ethane choppiness. We're not all barish long-term on NGLs as much as we are realizing that there's going to be a lot of infrastructure changes going on as this market tries to build out and we think there will be quite a bit of volatility associated with that.
On the project news, a lot of great efforts going on around the company right now in terms of building out our $9 billion that's in our guidance for CapEx through 2014. The Boreal Pipeline we brought on this certainly in the second quarter and that was brought on below our planned budget and as well, brought in a little ahead of schedule. Our ethane extraction project in Canada is also going very well and that project's being very well executed so this will really be the third project, the ethane extraction project, that we've managed out there, the first being the BB splitter, the Boreal Pipeline and now the ethane extraction project. Our Canadian team continues to do a great job of executing on those projects.
Likewise, in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our GoldStar projects going ahead very nicely the Keathley Canyon project is doing very well and I tell you, we remain very bullish on the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico as an oil province and we really think that we're very well positioned to provide a lot of the service as the Deepwater comes back.
The Cayman or Ohio Valley efforts, a lot of effort going on in the buildout, people from really all over our systems up there trying to assist with getting that business buildout and a tremendous amount of activity going on, a lot of promise and we are very excited about the way things are going so far on that acquisition.
The Laurel Mountain midstream buildout, we're getting to the point where we're almost can say that we're not constraining production there with infrastructure. We have for sometime a lot of that volumes have been limited by our infrastructure up there as Chevron continues to drill out that acreage, and we're about to get to the point where we'll be out in front of them with expansions were excited about our. And then of course, the Geismar expansion continues to go very well and it's well contracted at this point.
And the gas pipeline space, the Northeast supply link project continues ahead and is well our Rockway Lateral, we are hopeful that we can get a positive response that is waiting on a build in front of Congress and so we're looking forward to that. In addition, we also have a lot of new projects that have been recently announced, the Canadian propane dehydrogenation project which would be there at our Redwater facility. We think we're extremely well positioned for that project and it's a very nice compliment to our propylene production that we have there today in Canada already. And then Utica JV that we announced, we're excited about the promise of that, a little early to comment too much on that today but that JV is completed and we are excited about the promise and there you'll see in our capital guidance and you see the we've added capital for that JV in terms of our expectation. Just announced the expansion and really excited about the way that's gone. That project winds up being a very nice project for us in terms of being able to expand longer Leidy system and we think that it will be both a lower risk project for us in the immediate term but also provides, we think, a great value to producers and our markets and giving them great access with the supplies out there and we're very excited about that. And we certainly haven't shut the door in any way, shape, or form on the Atlantic access but we're not about to go ahead with a very risky build like that without very strong support from the producer community in terms of contracts that make sense for the kind of return that's allowed in the pipeline basis.
Finally, the lateral south are also projects that are gaining steam here in the second quarter and in the third quarter, and so our backlog continues to mount as those our confidence in our strategy and our growth in our dividend and so with that, I'll turn it over for questions."

And another one on TransCo operations. Looking at I understand that most TransCo revenue is firm there is a variable component that can move around quarter-to-quarter and I know that this is a seasonally weaker quarter historically for TransCo but it looks as though that there's that revenue or EBITDA per Mcf on TransCo this quarter was kind of lower than that it's been on a year-over-year and a quarter-over-quarter basis. It's just that because of the nature of the volumes are just increasingly short-haul and so on a kind of per unit basis, you're seeing revenues decline or was there something operationally with Transco that this quarter that made the result a little bit softer there?"

Just one last one. I guess from an accounting perspective, why was it that the accelerated maintenance that you talked about it in the Rockies, why did that show up in higher midstream OpEx as opposed to capital and as a result of that accelerated maintenance, would it be reasonable to expect that maybe the run rate OpEx for the remainder of 2012 would be lower in the midstream segment?"

Thanks for joining us and it's a busy time right now, and so we appreciate you being able to take the timeout for us. Well, certainly, despite a very disappointing financial performance in the second quarter and sign",1463,"Great. Thanks, John, and good morning. Thanks for joining us and it's a busy time right now, and so we appreciate you being able to take the timeout for us. Well, certainly, despite a very disappointing financial performance in the second quarter and significantly lower margin forecast for the balance of '12 and '13, we're very pleased that despite that, we're able to continue to remain confident in our very well-supported dividend growth, which is still at 55% here in 2012 and 20%, both in '13 and '14. So a lot of our confidence on that continues to come from the degree of coverage that we've had built into our model, as well as the extraordinary maintenance costs or maintenance capital we have built into PZ right now, and as well a lot of continued strong growth coming from our fee-based business. 
Our second quarter performance was certainly impacted by a rapid decline in NGL prices, but a few things as well. It is one thing, I think, that isn't always obvious in the way we report is that we also have a pretty significant amount of product that's in transit that has held in pipelines. And of course, that gets remarked each quarter based on the pricing decline. So in fact, in this period, we had about $22 million impact on that over and above what you would see in your typical pricing model. So whenever we see prices move down, that gets somewhat accelerated. And when we see it move back, the other way it comes back to us.
But there were certainly were other factors as well beyond pricing. Some growing pains, the Boreal Pipeline line fill. The high start-up O&M cost associated with the Caiman pipeline -- or sorry, the Caiman acquisition that we now refer to as Ohio Valley and as well, quite a bit of depreciation expense going on with that as well. But we also had higher maintenance costs, which we accelerated some of our work on a lot of our Western plants as we had a third-party fractionator being out during the second quarter that requires us to take some of our plants down, so we took advantage of that and accelerated things like a lot of turbine overhauls, embezzled maintenance during the period.
The good news for the quarter, a 19% increase in our fee-based view businesses within our midstream portion of WPZ. And we certainly had great progress on our major project execution going on during the quarter as well. So we remain very confident in the way our model is growing particularly on the fee-based business side.
Just commenting quickly on prices. Certainly, the second quarter dropped that we have from the first and second quarter was over 20% on our NGL margins, and the balance of the year is forecasted to be approximately 30% lower than what we recognized in the first quarter of '12. So we certainly have, in this model, we have taken it down to what we're seeing and certainly, we expect for prices, particularly on the light-end products, ethane and propane, to be very choppy as we see a lot of new infrastructure and supply coming on of the NGL side, but a bit ahead of a lot of the Petrochemical build out and some of the export build out on the propane side.
The NGL crude ratios are really what drove us. A lot of folks have thought about this from a crude standpoint but really, the crude price had very little to do with this. And we've got in our forecast, we've got NGL to crude ratio is running at about 40% here through the balance of the year versus historical average of 60% and the almost 57% that we realized in 2011. So certainly, that disconnect that we saw on the ethane and propane side is what really damaged the second quarter from a pricing standpoint, and we expect that to continue as the market needs to be balanced on the supply side on both ethane and propane.
The good news, of course, for Williams is with the Geismar facility. As we're expanding that, we moved away from a lot of the risk on the ethane choppiness. We're not all buried long term on NGLs as much as we are realizing that there's going to be a lot of infrastructure changes going on as this market tries to build out and we think there will be quite a bit of volatility associated with that.
On the project news, a lot of great efforts going on around the company right now in terms of building out our $9 billion that's in our guidance for CapEx through 2014. The Boreal Pipeline we brought on this, certainly, in the second quarter and that was brought on below our budget -- below our planned budget, excuse me. And as well, brought in a little ahead of schedule. Our ethane extraction project in Canada is also going very well and that project has been very well executed. So this will really be the third project, the ethane extraction project, that we've managed up there, the first being the BB splitter, the Boreal Pipeline and now the ethane extraction project. And our Canadian team continues to do a great job of executing on those projects.
Likewise, in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our GulfStar project is going ahead very nicely, the Keathley Canyon project is doing very well. And I'll tell you, we remain very bullish on the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico as an oil province and we really think that we're very well positioned to provide a lot of the service as the Deepwater comes back.
The Caiman or Ohio Valley efforts, a lot of effort going on in the build out, people from really all over our systems up there trying to assist with getting that business built out and the tremendous amount of activity going on, a lot of promise. And we're very excited about the way things are going so far on that acquisition.
The Laurel Mountain Midstream build out, we're getting to the point where we're almost, I can say that we're not constraining production there with the infrastructure. We have, for sometime, a lot of that volumes have been limited by our infrastructure up there as Chevron continues to drill out that acreage. And we're about to get to the point where we'll be out in front of them a little bit with the expansion, so we're excited about our. And then of course, the Geismar expansion continues to go very well and it's well contracted at this point. And the gas pipeline space, the Northeast Supply Link project continues ahead, and as well our Rockway lateral. We are hopeful that we can get a positive response that is waiting on a bill in front of Congress, and so we're looking forward to that.  
In addition, we also have a lot of new projects that have been recently announced, the Canadian propane dehydrogenation project, which would be there at our Redwater facility. We think we're extremely well positioned for that project and it's a very nice compliment to our propylene production that we have there today in Canada already. And then the Utica JV that we announced, we're excited about the promise of that, a little early to comment too much on that today, but that JV is completed and we're excited about the promises there. And you'll see in our capital guidance, you'll see that we've added in capital for that JV in terms of our expectation for that. 
We just announced Leidy expansion and really excited about the way that's gone. That project wind up being a very nice project for us in terms of being able to expand along our Leidy system and we think that it will be both a lower-risk project for us in the immediate term, but also provides, we think, a great value to producers and to our markets in giving them great access to the supplies up there. So we're very excited about that. And we certainly haven't shut the door in any way, shape or form on the Atlantic access, but we're not about to go ahead with a very risky build like that without very strong support from the producer community and in terms of contracts that make sense for the kind of return that's allowed in the pipeline basis.

Thanks for joining us and it's a busy time right now, and so we appreciate you being able to take the time out for us. Well certainly, despite a very disappointing financial performance in the second quarter and sign",1458,"Great. Thanks, John, and good morning. Thanks for joining us and it's a busy time right now, and so we appreciate you being able to take the time out for us. Well certainly, despite a very disappointing financial performance in the second quarter and significantly lower margin forecast for the balance of '12 and '13, we're very pleased that despite that, we're able to continue to remain confident in our very well-supported dividend growth, which is still at 55% here in 2012 and 20% both in '13 and '14. So a lot of our confidence on that continues to come from the degree of coverage that we've had built into our model, as well as the extraordinary maintenance costs or maintenance capital we have built into PZ right now, and as well a lot of continued strong growth coming from our fee-based business. 
Our second quarter performance was certainly impacted by a rapid decline in NGL prices, but a few things as well. There’s one thing, I think, that isn't always obvious in the way we report is that we also have a pretty significant amount of product that's in transit that is held in pipelines. And of course, that gets remarked each quarter based on the pricing decline. So in fact in this period, we had about $22 million impact on that over and above what you would see in your typical pricing model. So whenever we see prices move down, that gets somewhat accelerated. And when we see it move back the other way, it comes back to us.
But there were certainly were other factors as well beyond pricing. Some growing pains, the Boreal Pipeline line fill. The high start-up O&M cost associated with the Caiman pipeline -- or sorry, the Caiman acquisition that we now refer to as Ohio Valley and as well, quite a bit of depreciation expense going on with that as well. But we also had higher maintenance costs, which we accelerated some of our work on a lot of our Western plants as we had a third-party fractionator being out during the second quarter that required us to take some of our plants down, so we took advantage of that and accelerated things like a lot of turbine overhauls, embezzled maintenance during the period.
The good news for the quarter, a 19% increase in our fee-based businesses within our midstream portion of WPZ. And we certainly had great progress on our major project execution going on during the quarter as well. So we remain very confident in the way our model is growing, particularly on the fee-based business side.
Just commenting quickly on prices. Certainly the second quarter drop that we had from the first and second quarter was over 20% on our NGL margins, and the balance of the year is forecasted to be approximately 30% lower than what we recognized in the first quarter of '12. So we certainly have, in this model we have taken it down to what we're seeing and certainly we expect for prices, particularly on the light-end products, ethane and propane, to be very choppy as we see a lot of new infrastructure and supply coming on of the NGL side, but a bit ahead of a lot of the Petrochemical build out and some of the export build out on the propane side.
The NGL crude ratios are really what drove us. A lot of folks have thought about this from a crude standpoint, but really the crude price had very little to do with this. And we've got in our forecast, we've got NGL to crude ratio is running at about 40% here through the balance of the year versus historical average of 60% and the almost 57% that we realized in 2011. So certainly that disconnect that we saw on the ethane and propane side is what really damaged the second quarter from a pricing standpoint, and we expect that to continue as the market needs to be balanced on the supply side on both ethane and propane.
The good news, of course, for Williams is with the Geismar facility. As we're expanding that, we moved away from a lot of the risk on the ethane choppiness. We're not all buried long term on NGLs as much as we are realizing that there's going to be a lot of infrastructure changes going on as this market tries to build out and we think there will be quite a bit of volatility associated with that.
On the project news, a lot of great efforts going on around the company right now in terms of building out our $9 billion that's in our guidance for CapEx through 2014. The Boreal Pipeline we brought on, this certainly in the second quarter and that was brought on below budget -- below our planned budget, excuse me. And as well, brought in a little ahead of schedule. Our ethane extraction project in Canada is also going very well and that project has been very well executed. So this will really be the third project, the ethane extraction project that we've managed up there, the first being the BB splitter, the Boreal Pipeline and now the ethane extraction project. And our Canadian team continues to do a great job of executing on those projects.
Likewise in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our GulfStar project is going ahead very nicely, the Keathley Canyon project is doing very well. And I'll tell you, we remain very bullish on the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico as an oil province and we really think that we're very well positioned to provide a lot of the service as the Deepwater comes back.
The Caiman or Ohio Valley efforts, a lot of effort going on in the build out, people from really all over our systems up there trying to assist with getting that business built out and the tremendous amount of activity going on, a lot of promise. And we're very excited about the way things are going so far on that acquisition.
The Laurel Mountain Midstream build out, we're getting to the point where we're almost, I can say that we're not constraining production there with the infrastructure. We have, for sometime, a lot of that volume’s been limited by our infrastructure up there as Chevron continues to drill out that acreage. And we're about to get to the point where we'll be out in front of them a little bit with the expansion, so we're excited about that. And then of course, the Geismar expansion continues to go very well and it's well contracted at this point. And the gas pipeline space, the Northeast Supply Link project continues ahead, and as well our Rockway lateral. We are hopeful that we can get a positive response.  That is waiting on a bill in front of Congress, and so we're looking forward to that.  
In addition, we also have a lot of new projects that have been recently announced, the Canadian propane dehydrogenation project, which would be there at our Redwater facility. We think we're extremely well positioned for that project and it's a very nice compliment to our propylene production that we have there today in Canada already. And then the Utica JV that we announced, we're excited about the promise of that, a little early to comment too much on that today, but that JV is completed and we're excited about the promises there. And you'll see in our capital guidance, you'll see that we've added in capital for that JV in terms of our expectation for that. 
We just announced Leidy expansion and really excited about the way that's gone. That project winds up being a very nice project for us in terms of being able to expand along our Leidy system and we think that’ll be both a lower-risk project for us in the immediate term but also provides, we think, a great value to producers and to our markets in giving them great access to the supplies up there. So we're very excited about that. And we certainly haven't shut the door in any way, shape or form on the Atlantic access, but we're not about to go ahead with a very risky build like that without very strong support from the producer community and in terms of contracts that make sense for the kind of return that's allowed in the pipeline basis.
Finally, the Dalton lateral Mobile Bay South are also projects that are gaining steam here in the second quarter and into the third quarter. And so our backlog continues to mount as does our confidence in our strategy, in our growth, in our dividend. And so with that, I'll turn it over for questions."

As you know, given the significant disruption that occurred to the normal market activity, we decided to delay our earnings release webcast by a day. We also know this concentrated a number of earnings calls today, so thanks a bunch for joining us this morning for this webcast amongst a very busy morning. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to my prerecorded comments released yesterday afternoon. But just in case you didn't, I'll quickly hit on some key things and then we'll move on to our Q&A session.
We have several really important items to communicate to this week starting with of course a review of our third quarter performance. So I'll quickly touch on the key things from that discussion. 
For the third quarter, WMB's adjusted income was up about 17% over second quarter in spite of NGL fracs  spread that were about 18% lower on average than the already low second quarter amounts and the impact of hurricane Isaac, and I'll talk about that just a little bit. With regard to the NGL fracs spread, we saw about a 9% lower average NGL composite price, but an even higher impact from natural gas strength prices that were up about 26% on average. So certainly the frac spread environment that we saw on the third quarter continued to find from what was a heavy decline from first quarter to second quarter, and so we will not expect in that degree of decline into the third quarter. And again, a lot of that was impacted by gas prices moving up. 
Turning to fee-based revenues now for third quarter, this measure grew about 5% per year over year for the third quarter. And importantly, at the Midstream segment for WPZ, these grew at about 12% rate. So continued great volume growth there in our fee-based revenues, and just to a highlight a few of the areas that affected that, our gathering volumes in the business, such as our natural gas gathering volumes in the Midstream business were up 17% higher from 3Q '11 to 3Q '12. And in the eastern onshore which is basically our Marcellus area and -- which is in the western Gulf of Mexico, we saw both of those areas gathering volumes actually double from year to year.
The main driver of the 12% growth rate for overall for our business was eastern GMP business, as I mentioned, and of course, one of the drivers there was the acquisition from the Cayman, which we now refer to as the hot Ohio power Midstream in our business, and that was about $30 million between years. 
Also, there was a couple of factors that brought that 12% growth rate down and tend to lessen it. The Hurricane Isaac reduced some of our Gulf Coast fee-based revenues and in third quarter of '11, we actually had pretty significant content settlements related to some of our nor tape business. So on a normalized basis, we see these fee-based revenues actually growing even stronger than the 12% for WPZ Midstream. Most of the Hurricane Isaac impacts were cost by interruptions and third-party operations. So while we did have some immediate interruption in our offshore assets in particular, in terms of getting things back up and running, it really was due to some downstream oil terminals and some downstream NGL pipeline held us up a little bit longer. So we really did fair pretty well against our assets that there were some assets that were integrated with a little more challenge.
Hurricane Isaac also significantly impacted our results in the Midstream Canadian and all defense business as an Geismar had downtime that affected its production volumes, as well as some damage to a furnace as we try to restart the plant after the hurricane. So all in, this affected our segment profitability from about $9 million to $13 million, and about $4 million of this was for adjusted settlement profit.
So that's a quick look up our third quarter drivers, but again, given continued lower NGL commodity price environment and the Hurricane Isaac impact, we actually had a pretty good operational period here for the third quarter.
So next up, we have some important updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, from both WMB and WPZ. Included in these updates are the effect of the Geismar drop-down, which we've announced will be closing very soon, but we've also got some other adjustments including somewhat lower revenue growth rates assumptions for WPZ, and these are really being driven by prolonged natural gas prices assumptions and some of the producers' reactions that we're seeing to that as we go through our September planning process where we've taken a lot of the input from a lot of our producers around our systems. And I certainly want to let you know this really is across the board that we're seeing this in areas that whether we may -- whether producer themselves is heavily impacted by the gas prices. So some examples of that will be areas where we hold the people rights for natural gas drilling operations, and so the producers are not enjoying any of the uplift from the NGLs. And so of course, they're responding to lower natural gas prices, those of course, will be mostly out West where that occurred. We also had some respondents in the Gulf Coast, and then to some degree in the Northeast. But we'll get into a little bit the Northeast. The good news, I would say, in the Northeast is that the activities continue there. And for the most part, the activities, particularly in Ohio Valley Midstream area, really have nothing to do with either prices or with the drilling that results from the resources. Actually those are coming in a little better than we thought. It just really the way in terms of the activities in our ability to that infrastructure into place there quickly. So all in all, I would say the environment's pretty good, but I do think with our gas prices at $3.25, it's in our assumptions and planning around that we do expect continued reduction in areas that are totally dependent on just the natural gas price.
So I do want to reaffirm our plans for strong cash dividend growth where we're expecting a 55% higher dividend in 2012,at WMB and as well 12% growth in 2013 and 2014 which will move our dividend to $1.20, $1.44 and $1.55, respectively. Our stated policy of paying out WMB dividends for all of the distributions, WMB receives from WPZ less taxes, corporate interests and corporate CapEx. However, we also want investors to appreciate how committed we are sustaining the great strength of WPZ for the long run, and of course, that's what the Geismar drop-down is all about. And it really shows the evidence of WMB's commitment keeping WPZ healthy and making sure that the commodity hedge, the national hedge there is shared with WPZ and not just held with the WMB level. So in that transaction, WMB is receiving nearly $43 million new WPZ LP units related to the Geismar drop-down. Assuming the strong WPZ cash distribution growth rate included in our guidance, WMB will see a significant increase in cash distributions for WPZ. This could result, of course, in an ultimately higher dividend growth rate from what we have forecasted right now for WMB, and certainly, if the forecasted pricing environment that we have out there particularly around ethylene prices occurs, then we would certainly be in a position to further increase the dividend at WMB. So a lot of questions around that as a lot of people snap to the fact that cash distribution will go up significantly from that, and we've certainly been clear that we tend to maintain the policy. And I think our response to that, and we certainly agree with that calculation, but we do have quite a bit of risk embedded in the pricing at WPZ. And so we don't really want to go out any further on that distribution being 2 years ahead of time in terms of the dividend at WMB. I do think we intend to be very sure and really work hard to maintain that the distribution growth rates at WPZ. However, and some of the activities -- some of the things that we might respond to if we did see a commodity collapse, it would pull us down, pull the coverage down of course, would be our ability to impact the GP IDRs that we receive. So we remain very committed to WPZ and help the WPZ and we think we've got a great model. And certainly, if the pricing environment occurs, we're going to be in great shape to continue to increase that dividend at WMB even further.
Of course, at the same time WMB will no longer enjoy 100% of the cash flow and earnings it enjoys today, and as a result, you've seen a lowering of WMB's income guidance related to the noncontrolling interest that arises in Geismer once it's dropped into WPZ. So even though the cash flow piece of that looks stronger, particularly with the capital burden being shifted over to WPZ, the earnings piece of that gets diluted by the issuance of -- to the WPZ LP unit holders. 
Additionally, as I previously mentioned, we have some other updates our guidance for '13 and '14, including lower revenue growth rates across most of our operating areas that are exposed to natural gas prices, as I mentioned. And although we have some fairly low natural gas price assumptions in place for '13 and '14, you really should not misconstrue that we have a lack of confidence in the natural gas market. And in fact, I would tell you we're fairly bullish about the long-term demand that we continue to see built for natural gas, but we've also been impressed with the capabilities of natural gas producers here in the U.S. to continue to lower their cost of production. And so we're balancing that. We do think it will take some time for a lot of the big capital that's coming on to build that demand. But long term, I would tell you we're very bullish on seeing this natural gas market continue to expand.
'S finally, in the prerecorded podcast, we provided additional information about exciting new development in our Canadian and petchem services businesses and update on all of our in guidance projects, most of which are fee-based that really continued to demonstrate how Williams is particularly position to take advantage of this long-term super cycle as a trusted name in the development, construction and operation of exactly the types of infrastructure needed to realize the full potential for producers and end uses of natural gas, NGLs and all of them. So with that, I'll open it up for questions."

Of course, it's in their best interest to have us educated other plans as well because we've got to go build a lot of the infrastructure for those volumes. And so we've been going through that process in September and I would just tell you that it really across the board. And I would tell you if we thought the spreads were going to be $4.50 or $5, in '13 and -- we probably would have had a different perspective on that. But with our assumption of gas prices being at $3.25 for '13, with that assumption embedded, we have a hard time being more bullish than producers in terms of their capital plans and so we really basically took the capital plan from producers. Now remember, this was a lot of their ideas, of course, were formed over the summer when gas prices were even softer. So if we do see gas prices rebound, we probably would see some more activity and more rigs pick up. But of course, then we would have to raise our gas natural price if we believe that the and that, of course, will come out of the margin for both the NGLs and the all offense margin. So I think there's a pretty good balance there. But in general, I would tell you that we gather a lot of gas, and there's just a lot of areas that are exposed to natural gas prices and we're seeing drops in really all of our regions from what we had forecasted earlier in the year based on producers forecast that we would have picked up in the first part of 2012."

So bottom line is, we intend to maintain a coverage ratio there at WPZ and try to let this swings. Good news is there's a lot of cash flow in WPZ, and we would expect to let that coverage absorb a lot of those swings. If that wasn't enough to absorb that, and then a next move in more dire environment would be to waive some of the GPI DR, if necessary to maintain WPZ's health."

I would just tell you, we certainly hope that for the help of the industry, that's a good thing.

You can argue us to where that price that kicks total out and brings gas in, but it's certainly not $4 from our vantage point. And so, I think -- we think that, that low that we saw on the natural gas price is pretty temporary and is very price driven. So we continue to be impressed with the kind of drilling and growth around our systems as they sit here today. But we think eventually that's got to moderate and obviously that's our reaction to it. On the ethylene price, I would just tell you that the what we saw in the -- for continued to see is really a response between crude oil and ethane. As you get into '14, we're actually completely -- almost completely neutral to ethane prices, and in fact, a little bit short ethane, so if our ethane price is wrong, that will just show up in ethylene price.

And I honestly think it was very dependent on producers capability, certainly not all these basins are created equal. There's quite a bit differentiation from unit , there's a pretty big spread in one part of the accounting versus others. And as well I would tell you that some producers are better than others at getting the cost down and as well, there's a major variability in terms of what the other options might be and what they're invested in. And so I would just say it's not as the markets that efficient in that regard. It is remarkably, to my vantage point, sometime I was marveled at how efficient it is particularly the summer, the kind of a pick up we saw with low natural gas price on the semantic. But on the producer side, it's not everybody has the same number of options or might take the rigs and some are more invested in others in getting their cost structure down in the area. And so we certainly saw that previous ownership of WTX in the Piceance where they have a very low cost structure in peons. And we certainly see that in the Marcellus with some players have a much lower cost structure and lower cash cost than others. So I would just tell you, it's pretty are able out there. And I think it's hard to drop with a broad brush. And so that's not the way we do, we do it kind of from a building it from a ground up perspective based on all the different input we get from producers in each of our areas.

And we also know this concentrated a number of earnings calls today, so thanks a bunch for joining us this morning for this webcast amongst a very busy morning. 
Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to my prerecorded comments released yesterday afternoon. But just in case you didn't, I'll quickly hit on some key things and then we'll move on to our Q&A session. We have several really important items to communicate to you this week, starting with, of course, a review of our third quarter performance. So I'll quickly touch on the key things from that discussion.  
For the third quarter, WMB's adjusted income was up about 17% over second quarter, in spite of NGL fracs bed -- sorry, frac spreads that were about 18% lower, on average, than the already-low 2 -- second quarter amounts and the impact of Hurricane Isaac, and I'll talk about that just a little bit. 
With regard to the NGL frac spread, we saw about a 9% lower average NGL composite price, but an even higher impact from natural gas strength prices that were up about 26%, on average. So certainly, the frac spread environment that we saw on the third quarter continued to decline from what was a heavy decline from first quarter to second quarter, and so were not expecting that degree of decline into the third quarter. And again, a lot of that was impacted by gas prices moving up.  
Turning to fee-based revenues now for third quarter. This measure grew about 5% for -- year-over-year for the third quarter. And importantly, at the Midstream segment for WPZ, this grew at about 12% rate, so continued great volume growth there in our fee-based revenues. 
And just to a highlight a few of the areas that affected that, our gathering volumes in the business, such as our natural gas gathering volumes in the Midstream business, were up 17% higher from 3Q '11 to 3Q of '12. And in the eastern onshore, which is basically at our Marcellus area and the Perdido Norte, which is in the western Gulf of Mexico, we saw both of those areas' gathering volumes actually double from year-to-year.
The main driver of the 12% growth rate for -- overall for our business was the eastern G&P business, as I mentioned. And of course, one of the drivers there was the acquisition from the Caiman, which we now refer to as the hot -- Ohio Valley Midstream in our business, and that was up about $30 million between years.  
Also, there was a couple of factors that brought that 12% growth rate down and tend to lessen it. The Hurricane Isaac reduced some of our Gulf Coast fee-based revenues, and in third quarter of '11, we actually had a pretty significant contract settlement related to some of our Perdido Norte business. So on a normalized basis, we see these fee-based revenues actually growing even stronger than the 12% for WPZ Midstream. 
Most of the Hurricane Isaac impacts were cost by interruptions in third-party operations. So while we did have some immediate interruption in our offshore assets, in particular, in terms of getting things back up and running, it really was due to some downstream oil terminals and some downstream NGL pipelines that held us up a little bit longer. So we really did fair pretty well against our assets that -- but there were some assets that we're integrated with that were a little more challenge.
Hurricane Isaac also significantly impacted our results in the Midstream Canadian olefins business as Geismar had downtime that affected its production volumes, as well as some damage to a furnace, as we try to restart the plant after the hurricane. So all-in, this affected our segment profitability from about $9 million to $13 million, and about $4 million of this was treated as an assessment for adjusted settlement profit.
So that's a quick look at our third quarter drivers. But again, given the continued lower NGL commodity price environment and the Hurricane Isaac impact, we actually had a pretty good operational period here for the third quarter.
So next up, we have some important updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, from both WMB and WPZ. Included in these updates are the effect of the Geismar drop-down, which we've announced we will be closing very soon. But we've also got some other adjustments, including somewhat lower revenue growth rate assumptions for WPZ, and these are really being driven by prolonged natural gas price assumption and some of the producers' reactions that we're seeing to that as we went through our September planning process, where we've taken a lot of the input from a lot of our producers around our systems. 
And I certainly want to let you know this really is across-the-board, that we're seeing this in areas that whether -- where we may -- whether producers themselves is heavily impacted by the gas prices. So some examples of that would be areas where we call the keep-hole rights for natural gas drilling operations. And so the producers are not enjoying any of the uplift from the NGLs, and so of course, they're responding to lower natural gas prices. Those, of course, would be mostly out west, where that would occur.
We also had some response in the Gulf Coast and then, to some degree, in the northeast. But we'll get into a little bit, the northeast. The good news, I would say, in the northeast is that the activities continue there. And for the most part, the activities, particularly in Ohio Valley Midstream area, have -- really have nothing to do with either prices or with the drilling results from the resources. Actually, those are coming in a little better than we thought. It's just really a delay in terms of the activity and our ability to get infrastructure into place there quickly. 
So all in all, I would say the environment's pretty good. But I do think with our gas prices assumption at $3.25, it's in our assumptions and planning around that, we do expect continued reduction in areas that are totally dependent on just the natural gas price.
So I do want to reaffirm our plans for a strong cash dividend growth where we're expecting a 50% -- 55% higher dividend in 2012 at WMB and, as well, the 20% growth in each 2013 and 2014, which will move our dividend to $1.20, $1.44 and $1.75, respectively. 
Our stated policy of paying out WMB dividends for all of the distributions WMB receives from WPZ, less taxes, corporate interests and corporate CapEx. However, we also want investors to appreciate how committed we are at sustaining the great strength of WPZ for the long run, and of course, that's what the Geismar drop-down is all about, and it really shows the evidence of WMB's commitment to keeping WPZ healthy and making sure that the commodity hedge, the natural commodity hedge there is shared with WPZ and not just held with the WMB level. 
So in that transaction, WMB is receiving nearly 43 million new WPZ LP units related to the Geismar drop-down. Assuming the strong WPZ cash distribution growth rate included in our guidance, WMB will see a significant increase in cash distributions for WPZ. This could result, of course, in an ultimately higher dividend growth rate from what we have forecasted right now for WMB. And certainly, if the forecasted pricing environment that we have out there, particularly around ethylene prices occurs, then we would certainly be in a position to further increase the dividend at WMB. 
So a lot of questions around that as a lot of people have snapped to the fact that our cash distributions will go up significantly from that. And we've certainly been clear, but we intend to maintain the policy. And I think our response to that, and we certainly agree with that calculation, but we do have quite a bit of risk embedded in that pricing at WPZ. And so we don't really want to go out any further on that distribution being 2 years ahead of time in terms of the dividend at WMB. I do think we intend to be very sure and really work hard to maintain that -- the distribution growth rate at WPZ, however. 
And some of the things that we might respond to, if we did see a commodity collapse, it would pull us down -- pull that coverage down, of course, would be our ability to impact the GP IDRs that we receive. So we remain very committed to WPZ and help the WPZ, and we think we've got a great model. And certainly, if the pricing environment occurs, we're going to be in great shape to continue to increase that dividend at WMB even further.
Of course, at the same time, WMB will no longer enjoy 100% of the cash flow and earnings it enjoys today. And as a result, you've seen a lowering of WMB's income guidance related to the noncontrolling interest that arises in Geismar, once it's dropped into WPZ. So even though the cash flow piece of that looks stronger, the -- particularly with the capital burden being shifted over to WPZ, the earnings piece of that gets diluted by the issuance of -- to the WPZ LP unit holders. 
Additionally, as I previously mentioned, we have some other updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, including lower revenue growth rates across most of our operating areas that are exposed to natural gas prices, as I mentioned. And although we have some fairly low natural gas price assumptions in place for '13 and '14, you really should not misconstrue that we have a lack of confidence in the natural gas market. And in fact, I would tell you, we're fairly bullish about the long-term demand that we continue to see build for natural gas. But we also have been impressed with the capabilities of natural gas producers here in the U.S. to continue to lower their cost of production, and so we're balancing that. We do think it'll take some time for a lot of the big capital that's coming on to build that demand. But long term, I would tell you we're very bullish on seeing this natural gas market continue to expand.
Finally, in the prerecorded podcast, we provided additional information about exciting new develops in our Canadian and Petchem Services businesses and updates on all of our end-guidance projects, most of which are fee based that really continued to demonstrate how Williams is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this long-term super cycle as a trusted name in the development, construction and operation of exactly the types of infrastructure needed to realize the full potential for producers and end users of natural gas, NGLs and all of them.

And I would just say this, Faisel, that really what we saw -- again, how our planning process works is that we start to pull that together in September, and we take in input from all across our systems from producers planned capital for the following year. Of course, it's in their best interest to have us educated on their plans as well because we've got to go build a lot of the infrastructure for those volumes. And so we've been going through that process in September, and I would just tell you that it's really across-the-board. And I would tell you if we thought as prices were going to be $4.50 or $5 in '13 and -- and then we probably would've had a different perspective on that. But with our assumption of gas prices being at $3.25 for '13, with that assumption embedded, we'd have a hard time being more bullish than the producers in terms of their capital plans. And so we really basically took the capital plans from producers. Now remember, this was -- a lot of their ideas, of course, were formed over the summer when gas prices were even softer. So if we do see gas prices rebound, we probably would see some more activity and more rigs picked up. But -- and of course, then we would have to raise our gas -- natural gas price if we believe that. And that would -- of course, would come out of the margin for both the NGLs and the olefins margin. So I think there's a pretty good balance there. But in general, I would tell you that we gather a lot of gas. And there's just a lot of areas that are exposed to natural gas price, and we're seeing drops in really all of our regions from what we had forecasted earlier in the year, based on producers' forecasts that we would have picked up in the first part of 2012."

So bottom line is we intend to maintain a coverage ratio there at WPZ and try to let the swings. Good news is that there's a lot of cash flow in WPZ, and we would expect to let that coverage absorb a lot of those swings. If that wasn't enough to absorb that, then our next move in a more dire environment would be to waive some of the GP IDR, if necessary, to maintain WPZ's health."

I think for the help of the industry, that's a good thing. But we continue to see supplies grow. And in fact, our forecast of lower volume rate is not showing up currently in our growth rates. It's continuing to grow. And so we think that a lot of the demand that we picked up over the summer, obviously, was very price-dependent growth, and you can argue whether that price is $3.50 or $3.75 or $3.25. You can argue as to where that price that kicks coal out and brings gas in, but it's certainly not $4 from our vantage point. And so I think -- we think that, that low that we saw in the natural gas price is pretty temporary and is very price driven. So we continue to be impressed with the kind of drilling and growth around our systems as we sit here today. But we think, eventually, that's got to moderate, and obviously, that's the -- our reaction to it. On the ethylene price, I would just tell you that the -- what we saw in the -- what we continue to see is really a response to -- between crude oil and ethane. As you get into '14, we're actually completely -- or almost completely neutral to ethane prices and, in fact, a little bit short ethane. So if our ethane price is wrong, that'll just show up in ethylene price, but really just driving that ethylene price off of CMAI forecast and oil prices then.

You alluded to trying to be a little conservative, especially as maybe CPG fuel switching eases off a bit and suggested that some of the numbers may change.

Because they make just so much more money on the liquids part of the plays that they have, that there's a limited amount of capital and they just can't see putting it towards dry gas.

Certainly, not all these basins are created equal. There's quite a bit differentiation from one -- even in Susquehanna County, I will tell you, there's a pretty big spread in one part of the county versus others. And as well, I would tell you that some producers are better than others at getting their costs down, and as well, there's a major variability in terms of what their other options might be and what they're invested in. And so I would just say it's not as the market's not perfectly efficient in that regard. It is remarkably, to -- from my vantage point, sometimes I was marveled at how efficient it is, particularly this summer, the kind of a pick up we saw with low natural gas price on the demand side. But in the producer side, it's not everybody has the same number of options about where they might take the rigs, and some are more invested in others in getting their cost structure down in an area. And so we certainly saw that with our previous ownership of WPX in the Piceance, where they had a very low-cost structure in Piceance. And we certainly see that in the Marcellus with some players having a much lower cost structure and a -- and lower cash cost than others. So I would just tell you, it's pretty variable out there, and I think it's hard to draw it with a broad brush. And so that's not the way we do it. We do it kind of from a building it from a ground-up perspective based on all the different input we get from producers in each of our areas, and so that's really the -- how we come up with that."

I would say it's a complete function of business mix and commodity prices and the growth rate. Because again, as Alan mentioned earlier, in the near term, we're burdened with an extraordinary growth rate. We're financing a lot of growth, and that means more units out, more interest expense with little cash flow. But if you look at '14 and you look at the ethylene price, you can bury that ethylene price and you can get a of lot different coverage. You can move gas price, and you can get a much different coverage. So I think it's really a function of what you assume on prices. So the 1.23 is built off that price assumptions we have here, price and margin and all the other assumptions. So if you have lower margin assumptions, you'll get a lower coverage. If you have higher, you get higher. But again, I think it's going to be variable. Coverage would be variable based on where we are in the commodity cycle and a number of other factors."

And I want to reiterate that we are very committed to maintaining the health of WPZ as you -- as I think we've demonstrated with the Geismar drop-down.

We certainly think our Geismar expansion is very timely and is going to be able to take great advantage of new ethane supplies ahead of -- in the other cracker expansions. And so -- but we think eventually the petchem market is going to respond to the huge amount of NGLs that producers are going after today.

As you know, given the significant disruption that occurred to the normal market activity, we decided to delay our earnings release webcast by a day. We also know this concentrated a number of earnings calls today, so thanks a bunch for joining us this morning for this webcast amongst a very busy morning. 
Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to my prerecorded comments released yesterday afternoon. But just in case you didn't, I'll quickly hit on some key themes and then we'll move on to our Q&A session. 
We have several really important items to communicate to you this week, starting with, of course, a review of our third quarter performance. So I'll quickly touch on the key themes from that discussion.  
For the third quarter, WMB's adjusted income was up about 17% over second quarter, in spite of NGL fracs that for -- sorry, frac spreads that were about 18% lower, on average, than the already-low 2 -- second quarter amounts and the impact of Hurricane Isaac, and I'll talk about that just a little bit. 
With regard to the NGL frac spread, we saw about a 9% lower average NGL composite price, but an even higher impact from natural gas Street [ph] prices that were up about 26%, on average. So certainly, the frac spread environment that we saw in the third quarter continued to decline from what was a heavy decline from first quarter to second quarter, and so we were not expecting that degree of decline into the third quarter. And again, a lot of that was impacted by gas prices moving up.  
Turning to fee-based revenues now for third quarter. This measure grew about 5% per -- year-over-year for the third quarter. And importantly, at the Midstream segment for WPZ, this grew at about a 12% rate, so continued great volume growth there in our fee-based revenues. 
And just to a highlight a few of the areas that affected that, our gathering volumes in the business, so that's as our natural gas gathering volumes in the Midstream business, were up 17% higher from 3Q '11 to 3Q of '12. And in the eastern onshore, which is basically at our Marcellus area and the Perdido Norte, which is in the western Gulf of Mexico, we saw both of those areas gathering volumes, actually double from year-to-year.
The main driver of the 12% growth rate for -- overall for our business was the eastern G&P business, as I mentioned. And, of course, one of the drivers there was the acquisition from the Caiman, which we now refer to as the Ohio Valley Midstream in our business, and that was up about $30 million between years.  
Also, there was a couple of factors that brought that 12% growth rate down and tended to lessen it. The Hurricane Isaac reduced some of our Gulf Coast fee-based revenues, and in third quarter of '11, we actually had a pretty significant contract settlement related to some of our Perdido Norte business. So on a normalized basis, we see these fee-based revenues actually growing even stronger than the 12% for WPZ Midstream. 
Most of the Hurricane Isaac impacts were caused by interruptions in third-party operations. So while we did have some immediate interruption in our offshore assets, in particular, in terms of getting things back up and running, it really was due to some downstream oil terminals and some downstream NGL pipelines that held us up a little bit longer. So we really did fare pretty well against our assets, but there were some assets that we're integrated with that were a little more challenged.
Hurricane Isaac also significantly impacted our results in the Midstream Canadian and olefins business as Geismar had downtime that affected its production volumes, as well as some damage to a furnace, as we tried to restart the plant after the hurricane. So all-in, this affected our segment profit from about $9 million to $13 million, and about $4 million of this was treated as an assessment for adjusted segment profit.
So that's a quick look at our third quarter drivers. But again, given the continued lower NGL commodity price environment and the Hurricane Isaac impact, we actually had a pretty good operational period here for the third quarter.
So next up, we have some important updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, from both WMB and WPZ. Included in these updates are the effect of the Geismar drop-down, which we've announced we will be closing very soon. But we've also got some other adjustments, including somewhat lower revenue growth rate assumptions for WPZ. And these are really being driven by a prolonged natural gas price assumption and some of the producers' reactions that we're seeing to that as we went through our September planning process, where we take in a lot of the input from a lot of our producers around our systems. 
And I certainly want to let you know this really is across-the-board, that we're seeing this in areas that where the -- where we may -- where the producer themselves is heavily impacted by the gas prices. So some examples of that would be areas where we hold the keep-hole [ph] rights for natural gas drilling operations. And so the producers are not enjoying any of the uplift from the NGLs, and so, of course, they're responding to lower natural gas prices. Those, of course, would be mostly out west, where that would occur.
We also had some response in the Gulf Coast and then, to some degree, in the northeast. But we'll get into a little bit, the northeast. The good news, I would say, in the northeast is that the activities continue there. And for the most part, the activities, particularly in the Ohio Valley Midstream area, really have nothing to do with either prices or with the drilling results from the resources. Actually, those are coming in a little better than we thought. It's really just a delay in terms of the activity and our ability to get infrastructure into place there quickly. 
So all in all, I would say the environment's pretty good. But I do think with our gas price assumption at $3.25, that's in our assumptions and planning around that, we do expect continued reduction in areas that are totally dependent on just the natural gas price.
So I do want to reaffirm our plans for a strong cash dividend growth where we're expecting a 50% -- 55% higher dividend in 2012 at WMB and, as well, the 20% growth in each 2013 and 2014, which would move our dividend to $1.20, $1.44 and $1.75, respectively. 
Our stated policy of paying out WMB dividends for all of the distributions WMB receives from WPZ, less taxes, corporate interests and corporate CapEx. However, we also want investors to appreciate how committed we are at sustaining the great strength of WPZ for the long run and, of course, that's what the Geismar drop-down is all about, and it clearly shows the evidence of WMB's commitment to keeping WPZ healthy and making sure that the commodity hedge, the natural commodity hedge there is shared with WPZ and not just held with the WMB level. 
So in that transaction, WMB is receiving nearly 43 million new WPZ LP units related to the Geismar drop-down. Assuming the strong WPZ cash distribution growth rate included in our guidance, WMB will see a significant increase in cash distributions from WPZ. This could result, of course, in an ultimately higher dividend growth rate from what we have forecasted right now for WMB. And certainly, if the forecasted pricing environment that we have out there, particularly around ethylene prices occurs, then we would certainly be in a position to further increase the dividend at WMB. 
So a lot of questions around that as a lot of people have snapped to the fact that our cash distributions will go up significantly from that. And we've certainly been clear that we intend to maintain the policy. And I think our response to that is we certainly agree with that calculation, but we do have quite a bit of risk embedded in that pricing at WPZ. And so we don't really want to go out any further on that distribution being 2 years ahead of time in terms of the dividend at WMB. I do think we intend to be very sure and really work hard to maintain the distribution growth rate at WPZ, however, and some of the things that we might respond to if we did see a commodity collapse, it would pull us down -- pull that coverage down, of course, would be our ability to impact the GP IDRs that we receive. So we remain very committed to WPZ and the health of WPZ, and we think we've got a great model. And certainly, if the pricing environment occurs, we're going to be in great shape to continue to increase that dividend at WMB even further.
Of course, at the same time, WMB will no longer enjoy 100% of the cash flow and earnings it enjoys today. And as a result, you've seen a lowering of WMB's income guidance related to the non-controlling interest that arises in Geismar, once it's dropped into WPZ. So even though the cash flow piece of that looks stronger, the -- particularly with the capital burden being shifted over to WPZ, the earnings piece of that gets diluted by the issuance of -- to the WPZ LP unit holders. 
Additionally, as I previously mentioned, we have some other updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, including lower revenue growth rates across most of our operating areas that are exposed to natural gas prices, as I mentioned. And although we have some fairly low natural gas price assumptions in place for '13 and '14, you really should not misconstrue that, that we have a lack of confidence in the natural gas market. And in fact, I would tell you, we're fairly bullish about the long-term demand that we continue to see build for natural gas. But we also have been impressed with the capabilities of natural gas producers here in the U.S. to continue to lower their cost of production, and so we're balancing that. We do think it'll take some time for a lot of the big capital that's coming on to build that demand. But long term, I would tell you we're very bullish on seeing this natural gas market continue to expand.
Finally, in the prerecorded podcast, we provided additional information about exciting new develops in our Canadian and Petchem Services businesses and updates on all of our end-guidance projects, most of which are fee based that really continue to demonstrate how Williams is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this long-term super cycle as a trusted name in the development, construction and operation of exactly the types of infrastructures needed to realize the full potential for producers and end users of natural gas, NGLs and olefins. 
So with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

And I would just say this, Faisel, that really what we saw -- again, how our planning process works is that we start to pull that together in September, and we take in input from all across our systems, from producers' planned capital for the following year. Of course, it's in their best interests to have us educated on their plans as well because we've got to go build a lot of the infrastructure for those volumes. And so we've been going through that process in September, and I would just tell you that it's really across the board. And I would tell you if we thought gas prices were going to be $4.50 or $5 in '13 and -- and then we probably would have had a different perspective on that. But with our assumption of gas prices being at $3.25 for '13, with that assumption embedded, we'd have a hard time being more bullish than the producers in terms of their capital plans. And so we really basically took the capital plans from producers. Now remember, this was -- a lot of their ideas, of course, were formed over the summer when gas prices were even softer. So if we do see gas prices rebound, we probably would see some more activity and more rigs picked up. But, of course, then we would have to raise our gas -- natural gas price if we believed that. And that would -- of course, would come out of the margin for both the NGLs and the olefins margin. So I think there's a pretty good balance there. But in general, I would tell you that we gather a lot of gas. And there's just a lot of areas that are exposed to the natural gas price, and we're seeing drops in really all of our regions from what we had forecasted earlier in the year, based on producers' forecasts that we would have picked up in the first part of 2012."

So bottom line is we intend to maintain a coverage ratio there at WPZ and try to let the swings. Good news is, is that there's a lot of cash flow in WPZ, and we would expect to let that coverage absorb a lot of those swings. If that wasn't enough to absorb that, then our next move in a more dire environment would be to waive some of the GP IDR, if necessary, to maintain WPZ's health."

And so the issue there is that to bring cash across the border would trigger a gain, and that's a pretty substantial gain at this time."

And my last question, Alan, there were some questions around the changes in expected gathering with natural gas volumes. You alluded to trying to be a little conservative, especially as maybe CPG fuel switching eases off a bit and suggested that some of the numbers may change. If you're rolling [ph] to a high side, maybe the volumes will be greater. My question is many producers that have alternatives are saying even at $4 gas, they're not going back and turning on the spigot. Because they make just so much more money on the liquids part of the plays that they have, that there's a limited amount of capital and they just can't see putting it towards dry gas. And you all have mentioned him even the Marcellus, that some of the prolific dry gas areas are easing off, even though there's probably very respectable returns at some of those very good wells today. Can you speak to whether you really think the volumes will necessarily follow price?"

Certainly, not all these basins are created equal. There's quite a bit differentiation from one -- even in Susquehanna County, I will tell you, there's a pretty big spread in one part of the county versus others. And as well, I would tell you that some producers are better than others at getting their costs down and, as well, there's a major variability in terms of what their other options might be and what they're invested in. And so I would just say it's not as -- the market's not perfectly efficient in that regard. It is, remarkably, to -- from my vantage point, sometimes I always marvel at how efficient it is, particularly this summer, the kind of a pickup we saw with low natural gas price on the demand side. But in the producer side, it's not -- not everybody has the same number of options about where they might take the rigs, and some are more invested in others in getting their cost structure down in an area. And so we certainly saw that with our previous ownership of WPX in the Piceance, where they had a very low-cost structure in the Piceance. And we certainly see that in the Marcellus, with some players having a much lower cost structure and a -- and lower cash cost than others. So I would just tell you, it's pretty variable out there, and I think it's hard to draw it with a broad brush. And so that's not the way we do it. We do it kind of from a building it from a ground-up perspective based on all the different input we get from producers in each of our areas, and so that's really the -- how we come up with that."

Because again, as Alan mentioned earlier, in the near term, we're burdened with an extraordinary growth rate.

But if you look at '14 and you look at the ethylene price, you can bury that ethylene price and you're going to get a of lot different coverage. You can move gas price, and you're going to get much different coverage. So I think it's really a function of what you assume on prices. So the 1.23 is built off the price assumptions we have here, price and margin and all the other assumptions. So if you have lower margin assumptions, you'll get lower coverage. If you have higher, you'll get higher. But again, I think it's going to be variable. Coverage would be variable based on where we are in a commodity cycle and a number of other factors."
